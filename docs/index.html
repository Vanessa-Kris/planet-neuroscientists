Ariel University is a settlers' university, located outside of legal Israel borders. What Ariel lacks in academic performance or even official recognition, it makes up in support from right-wing politicians. This post addresses the scientific qualifications of Ariel's rector Michael Zinigrad. Or the pretence thereof.

The ORI doesn’t describe Venkata Sudheer Kumar Ramadugu‘s misconduct — that detail will likely come later in the Federal Register, according to their … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/27/former-umich-postdoc-earns-five-year-ban-on-federal-funding-after-admitting-to-misconduct-and-then-lying/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Former UMich postdoc earns five-year ban on Federal funding, after admitting to misconduct and then lying</span></a>

A Cornell researcher whose work came under scrutiny earlier this year for text recycling has had a third paper retracted. The latest retraction for Robert Sternberg — whose work was the subject of  allegations by Brendan O’Connor and Nick Brown — appears in the Review of General Psychology. Here’s the retraction notice for “A model of ethical reasoning:” … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/26/cornell-psychology-researcher-sees-a-model-for-ethical-reasoning-retracted/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Cornell psychology researcher sees “A model for ethical reasoning” retracted</span></a>

So sit back, sip your hot apple cider or spiked egg nog, and revel in family dysfunction worse than your own.<br /><br /><span style="color: #20124d;"><span>{Well! There is an actual TV show called <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/homicide-for-the-holidays" target="_blank" title="on Oxygen, which has morphed from Oprah Lifestyle to True Crime"><i>Homicide for the Holidays</i></a>, which I did not know. Kind of makes my title seem derivative... but it was coincidental.}</span></span><br /><br /><br />“Folie à deux”, or <a href="https://behavenet.com/diagnostic-criteria-2973-shared-psychotic-disorder" target="_blank">Shared Psychotic Disorder</a>, was a diagnosis in DSM-IV-TR:<br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(A)</b> A delusion develops in an individual  in the context of a close relationship with another person(s), who has  an already-established delusion. </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(B)</b> The delusion is similar in content to that of the person who already has the established delusion. </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(C)</b> The disturbance is not better accounted for by another Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia) or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.</div><br />Folie à deux occurs in the secondary partner, who shares a delusion with the primary partner (diagnosed with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or psychotic depression). In in DSM-5, folie à deux no longer exists as a specific disorder. Instead, the secondary partner is given a diagnosis of “other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other  psychotic disorder” with a specifier: “delusional symptoms in the partner of individual with delusional  disorder” (APA, 2013).<br /><br />The first cases were reported in the 19th century by the French psychiatrists Baillarger (1860) and <a href="http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E16-02.htm" target="_blank" title="English translation">Lasègue &amp; Falret (1877</a>). The latter authors note that insanity isn't contagious, but under special circumstances...<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">a) In the “folie à deux” one individual is the active element; being more intelligent than the other he creates the delusion and gradually imposes it upon the second one who is the passive element. At the beginning the latter resists but later, little by little, he suffers the pressure of his associate, although at the some degree he also reacts and influences the former to correct, modify, and coordinate the delusion that then becomes their common delusion, to be repeated to all in an almost identical fashion and with the same words.</blockquote>The two individuals are in a close relationship and typically live in an isolated environment.<br /><br />A recent paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2018.10.001" target="_blank"><span class="content"><span class="text surname">Guivarch</span></span> et al. (2018)</a> covered the history of the disorder, and performed a literature review on folie à deux and homicide. They found 17 articles:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In the cases examined, homicides were committed with great violence, usually against a victim in the family circle, and were sometimes followed by suicide. The main risk factor for homicide was the combination of mystical and persecutory delusions. The homicides occurred in response to destabilization of the delusional dyads.</blockquote><br />Body mutilation is not uncommon: “<i>These features appear in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957154X08094236" target="_blank">reported case</a> of a mother who was  delusional and killed her young son by hitting him on the head 3 times  with a hatchet</i>.”<br /><br />The authors presented a detailed history of induced psychosis involving Mr. A (the secondary) and Mrs. A (the primary, who had a family history of delusion). Shortly after getting married, they had a child who was removed by social services due to inadequate parenting.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Subsequently, the couple engaged in several years of delusional  wandering in France and Italy, traveling from village to village to  accomplish <i>“a divine mission”</i>, during which time they were hosted in monasteries  or abbeys. They expressed delusional feelings but never visited a  psychiatrist and were never confronted by the police. The couple's  relationship transformed; the partners stopped having sexual relations  and quickly established a delusional hierarchical relation, with Mrs. A  being called <i>“Your Majesty”</i> and Mr. A considering himself <i>“King of Australia, Secretary of Her Majesty”</i>.</blockquote><br />After about 20 years of this, in a fit of overkill, Mr. A murdered a random 11 year old child by inflicting 44 stab wounds. Earlier, he had felt humiliated and persecuted at a police check point, which provoked  an “incident.” The murder of the child was part of their delusional divine mission, to make a necessary sacrifice that would restore balance.<br /><br /><br /><b>Paranoia of the exalted type in a setting of folie à deux</b><br /><br />The famous case of Pauline P (“a dark, rather sulky looking but not unattractive girl of stocky build”) and Juliet H (“a tall, willowy, frail, attractive blonde with large blue eyes”) was also mentioned (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8341.1955.tb00896.x" target="_blank">Medlicott, 1955</a>). The two girls established a very close bond, constructed an elaborate make-believe world of fictional characters, withdrew from all others, became sexually involved, and developed a superiority complex. They killed Pauline's mother “because one of the girls was going to move with her parents, which would have led to the separation of the delusional dyad (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016025271830030X?via%3Dihub#bb0150">Medlicott, 1955</a>).”  This formed the basis of the fantastic 1994 film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Creatures" target="_blank"><i>Heavenly Creatures</i></a>, featuring Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oYhX3-G3wSw/XB94LSQwCeI/AAAAAAAAMsk/Pzig5gW2DSgDZYFFE6fyCUfpn248-unaQCLcBGAs/s1600/Kate%2Band%2BMelanie%2Bin%2BHeavely%2BCreatures.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" height="225" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oYhX3-G3wSw/XB94LSQwCeI/AAAAAAAAMsk/Pzig5gW2DSgDZYFFE6fyCUfpn248-unaQCLcBGAs/s400/Kate%2Band%2BMelanie%2Bin%2BHeavely%2BCreatures.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Granted, their indissoluble bond was pathological, but laughable 1955 views of same-sex relationships were on display in this analysis:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">There is of course no doubt that the relationship between these two girls was basically homosexual in nature. Pauline made attempts in 1953 of establishing heterosexual relationships, but in spite of intercourse on one occasion there was no evidence of real erotic involvement. <span style="color: red;"><b>All her escapades were fully discussed with Juliet which is a common feature amongst people basically homosexual in orientation. </b></span> </blockquote><br />Yes, we can generalize and say that all teenage girls in the 1950s commonly bragged about their heterosexual exploits with their lesbian lovers.<br /><br />From Pauline's 1953 diary:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“To-day Juliet and I found the key to the 4th World.  ... We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the 4th World. Only about 10 people have it. When we die we will go to the 4th World, but meanwhile on two days every year we may use the key and look in to that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of, on this Day of Finding the Key to the Way through the Clouds.”</blockquote><br />Your family gatherings may not always be harmonious, but presumably your delusional children are not plotting to kill you. Happy Holidays. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e1WwyyHO1Vs/XB-A1NbP7RI/AAAAAAAAMsw/ZsvO8wkeQB8BbYyI9HmLYU_QnO7tnZtwwCLcBGAs/s1600/christmas-vacation-christmas-eve-dinner.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="720" height="266" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e1WwyyHO1Vs/XB-A1NbP7RI/AAAAAAAAMsw/ZsvO8wkeQB8BbYyI9HmLYU_QnO7tnZtwwCLcBGAs/s400/christmas-vacation-christmas-eve-dinner.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Christmas_Vacation" target="_blank"><i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</i></a></b></span></div><br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />Baillarger J.

Do you believe that people's eyes emit an invisible beam of force?

According to a rather fun paper in PNAS, you probably do, on some level, believe that. The paper is called Implicit model of other people’s visual attention as an invisible, force-carrying beam projecting from the eyes.



To show that people unconsciously believe in eye-beams, psychologists Arvid Guterstam et al. had 157 MTurk volunteers perform a computer task in which they had to judge the angle at which paper tubes wou

Frontiers is a somewhat unconventional open access publisher, which likes to have it both ways: playing scientific elite while accepting almost anything from paying customers. My regular contributor Smut Clyde will tell you below how some anti-vaccine scare-mongers managed to sneak in some rather dangerous works thanks to Frontiers' unofficial "we don't judge, we just charge" quasi-policy.

<h4>Time to torch the textbooks</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*v489KmVg2nP9MDfsu9i3pw.png" /></figure><p>Welcome all to the third annual review of the year in neuroscience from The Spike. We’ve made it to the end of 2018. Who saw that coming?</p><p>Which means it’s time to take stock, and admire the great strides we’ve made in understanding the brain this year. Pfft. There, done that. Now for the actual review, this year a sampling of three pieces of beautiful or provocative work that shows us we understand less than we thought.</p><h4>1/ Neurons “transmit” RNA</h4><p>January started with a bang: Jason Shepherd and his team <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31504-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417315040%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">published a paper </a>showing that messenger RNA (mRNA) is transmitted between neurons. I’ll say right upfront that molecular biology is not one of my strengths. But then neither is elephant juggling, and I gave that a damn good try until the hernia. And the findings in this paper are so outlandish that if you missed it then, you need to know about it know.</p><p>It all starts with the Arc gene, and the protein it encodes. We know Arc is needed for learning. Delete the Arc gene in mice and learning is screwed. The Arc gene shows up in those big fishing expeditions for genes related to disorders of learning and development. And for once we even know something about what the Arc protein does — it’s involved in building synapses, possibly by moving AMPA receptors into position.</p><p>So far, so genetics. The Arc gene is read-out by a string of Arc mRNA, which in turn specifies an Arc protein, and the Arc protein alters synapses. A lot of mechanism, but no function. That mucking about with a gene that affects synapses in turn affects learning is a bit of no-brainer. We already know a lot about when and why synapses between neurons get weaker or stronger; knowing this gene-to-protein pathway gives us a better understanding of how synapses get stronger or weaker, but doesn’t tell us a lot more about the why or when. As systems neuroscientists we only get out of bed for something that tells us about how neurons talk to each other.</p><p>It turns out neurons can talk to each other using Arc. I’m out of bed now.</p><p>The Shepherd lab’s paper in January showed that the Arc protein makes a virus-like shell, and inside this shell is wrapped Arc’s own mRNA — the mRNA that encodes the protein itself. This shell is then in turn shoved in the kind of bag — a vesicle — that neurons use to transmit stuff to each other at synapses. Except this type of vesicle isn’t released at a synapse, its simply released from wherever on the neuron’s skin it happened to form.</p><p>The big question the Shepherd lab then faced down was: if this bag containing a bit of Arc’s mRNA is released outside the neuron, does it get taken up by other neurons? And if it does get taken up, what does it do? They tackled this in a really elegant way. Take a bunch of neurons in a dish that have no Arc in them, as it’s been knocked-out. Then dump some of those Arc mRNA filled bags into that dish, special ones that have been altered to glow. And watch: do the glowing bags end up inside the neurons? Yes, they did.</p><p>And the clincher was when Shepherd’s team then looked inside these Arc-less neurons, now filled with glowing bags, and found huge quantities of the Arc protein. The mRNA had been taken up, and proteins manufactured from it.</p><p>The ramifications of this work are potentially huge. For one thing, we have this startling evidence of non-canonical transmission between neurons. But more important is what was transmitted: this is a neuron sending a recipe for how to construct a protein to another neuron. A protein that is heavily involved in controlling learning. We now have evidence that internal instructions to change one neuron’s synapses can be sent to other nearby neurons, and potentially change theirs too. Understanding how neurons learn just got a whole lot more complicated.</p><p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31502-7">the same thing happens in flies too</a>.</p><h4>2/ Who watches the watch-people?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j9etcIMb-wa1qU5JqSKo3w.png" /></figure><p>Say I was the annoying kind of father who doled out sweets one at a time in a slow tedious game for my own amusement. I’ve got a bowl of sweets and grapes all mixed together, and a 5 year old who would very much like a sweet, actually daddy. So the game goes as follows — I look in the bowl, and pick something out and show it to the irritated child. With my left hand I always take and show a grape, with my right hand a chocolate; I repeat that pick-and-show a few times to hammer home the message. Then I pick one item in each fist so they can’t see, and ask my 5 year old to choose a hand to open. Which would they pick? Right hand, yes?</p><p>But if I then put both hands in the bowl without looking in the bowl, which would they pick? If my 5 year old understood how the world works, then they now know that I was not able to see what I chose — so they should pick a hand at random. Or yell for mummy to get daddy to pack in this idiotic game.</p><p>To pick a hand, the 5 year old needs some pretty advanced knowledge of what others know — a model of the world that includes inferring what others themselves know about the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30549-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218305499%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Work by Johanna Eckert and colleagues</a> this year showed chimps have exactly this knowledge — about humans.</p><p>Each chimp had to deal with two such annoying humans. Two buckets were in view, both mixes of carrots and peanuts; one heavy on the carrots, one heavy on the peanuts. The buckets were transparent, so the chimp could see which was carrot-heavy, and which peanut-heavy. The humans deliberately picked the rare options: Human 1 picked peanuts from the carrot-heavy bucket; Human 2 picked carrots from the peanut-heavy bucket. Each showed these picks to the chimp.</p><p>After showing this a few times, and presumably as the chimp grew tired of these annoying humans and their tedious game, then came the test. On some trials, the humans looked in the bucket as they were picking. On other trials, the could not see the bucket, and picked blindly. The chimp could see all this. On each trial it was offered both fists, and asked to choose one. Which did it choose?</p><p>The tension here is between the chimp’s knowledge of what is in the buckets, and the knowledge of what the humans know. The chimp knows which bucket is full of carrots (ugh) and which is full of peanuts (woohoo!). But it may also know that Human 1 keeps picking peanuts from the carrot bucket, and Human 2 irritatingly picks carrots from the peanut bucket. So if it knew this, then the chimp should choose the fist of Human 1 and collect its peanut.</p><p>Ah, but wait: if Humans 1 and 2 did not look into the bucket, then surely it was more likely that Human 1 now has a carrot and Human 2 now has a peanut, because that’s what their buckets were filled with. In which case, the chimp should choose the fist of Human 2, as they were more likely to have a peanut.</p><p>Amazingly, the chimps worked all this out. On trials where the humans looked into the buckets, the chimps chose the fist of Human 1 — the peanut picker — vastly more often than chance. On trials where the humans could not see into the buckets, and picked at random, the chimps chose the fist of Human 2 more often. The chimps’ choices reflected not only their knowledge of the world, but also what they inferred the humans knew about the world. And used this knowledge to adjust the probability of their decisions.</p><p>Face it, a chimp is a better statistician than you.</p><h4>3/ Misplaced childhood</h4><p>You remember when you were one, charging about the place with a very full nappy (diaper, if you insist), slipped, and landed so hard on your bum that the nappy lost containment and the resulting pooh tsunami covered Grandma? No? Well, that’s because of infant amnesia — we lay down no long term memories of our early childhood.</p><p>Infant amnesia seems fairly self-evident: we cannot remember anything about our early childhood, so there must be no memory stored in our brain. Or is it? For what if instead we simply can’t access the memories. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30695-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098221830695X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Work from Paul Frankland’s lab</a>, led by Axel Guskjolen, has now shown us that actually there may well memories of your infancy still in there somewhere.</p><p>Mice can’t remember stuff from their early childhood either. Frankland’s lab showed this by testing a mouse’s memory for fear of a bad place — put a mouse in a special box, apply a mild electric shock, repeat a couple of times. Then next day put it back in that box, and the mouse freezes, remembering the box, what it means, and anticipating a shock.</p><p>Do this to adult mice — 60 days old — and that memory lasts for more than 90 days. They freeze just as much if put back into the box after 90 days as they do after one day — even if they’ve never seen the box in the intervening 89 days. They have a clear memory of the bad place that lasts for longer than they’d been alive when they first saw it. Pretty convincing long-term memory.</p><p>But do this to infant mice — 14 days old — and all memory of the bad place is gone by 15 days later. Put them back in the box after 30 days, say, and no freezing at all. Is the memory gone, or hidden?</p><p>We know that the hippocampus is strongly involved in these kinds of place memories. So it’s a great candidate for finding the memory of the bad place. Frankland’s lab took the elegant approach of injecting into the hippocampus a gene that tags neurons when they are active. The idea here was that neurons laying down the memory during training in the bad place will be most active, so will be the most strongly tagged. The crucial part is that the tagging causes the neurons to express a light-sensitive ion channel. Then if you were to later shine a laser into that same part of hippocampus, the laser will re-activate just those tagged neurons. In theory, re-activating whatever those neurons represent.</p><p>Frankland’s lab did just this in their 14 day old mice: tagged the active neurons while training them to learn about the bad place. When they put them back in the box after 15 days, they did not freeze, showing no memory, as expected. But then the laser in hippocampus was switched on: and the mice froze. Just as though re-activating the tagged neurons switched on a lost memory of the bad place.</p><p>As with all good scientists, the team did a lot of control experiments to make this convincing. They turned the laser on without tagging the neurons, and no freezing. They tagged the neurons, but only turned the laser on in other locations, like their cage, not the special box: and no freezing. This control is actually very important. Activating so many neurons in hippocampus at the same time could cause an epilepsy-like absence seizure, where the mice would freeze in place. But as the freezing was only in the bad place, and not wherever the laser was switched on, that’s pretty convincing evidence that freezing in the bad place wasn’t just a seizure.</p><p>Activating the tagged neurons still worked after 30 days between training and testing. It worked after 60 days. An infant mouse’s memory of what happened in the bad place could be turned back on at will. It was there, but they could not access it. Which opens up the slightly worrying idea that infant amnesia is not the erasure of memory, but the hiding of memory.</p><h4>Plan S</h4><p>If we’re going to discuss science in 2018, I suppose we have to mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S">Plan S</a>. A bold plan to get published works from across the European Union freely and immediately available for all to read. And to do get the plan launched in a mere couple of years. A worthy idea, but one that caused no end of arguing.</p><p>From one perspective, this is a long-needed action, whether you believe that science paid for by taxpayers should be available to those taxpayers, or that the vast profits of scientific publishing houses are obscene. From another perspective, this is a draconian laying down of the law, with a narrow, muddled view of what constitutes open-access (no pre-prints, no free access with a short delay), and little thought for institutions that depend on revenue from publishing journals for their existence (such as learned societies). Who is right?</p><p>Everyone, of course. We need a Plan S of some kind; the version we got was not thought through well enough before being announced. Prioritising paid-for open-access over all others risks giving more, not less, power to established publishers. And I saw strangely little discussion of the UK’s long experience with our own version of Plan S: we’ve had mandated gold open-access publication of work funded by our Research Councils since 2014, when a central fund was established to pay for it (and the Wellcome Trust made a similar mandate with their own money). Each university is given its share of this central fund each year, with a simple mission: pay for each paper funded by the Research Councils to be published “open to all”.</p><p>Result? With no caps on how much journals will charge to publish an open-to-all paper, this costs an absolute fortune . The funds held by each university are rapidly run down each financial year. To stem the flood, some universities put their own local rules in place about what kinds of paper will qualify for funding (e.g. no funds for hybrid journals) so there are big inconsistencies between universities in how they implement this apparently simple policy. Worse, some universities simply run out of funding, and turn down the mandated requests for pay for papers. In short, an expensive mess.</p><p>I look forward to the Plan S architects answering the simple question: if implemented, where will people publish when the money runs out?</p><h4><strong>Hey, 2018 wasn’t all bad.</strong></h4><p>We had Peter Dayan and Demis Hassabis elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, in recognition of their ground-breaking work in artificial intelligence and neuroscience. <a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut/">DeepLabCut </a>brought automated, general purpose movement tracking to the masses.<br />We got compelling evidence that the tiny groups of mid-brain neurons housing the brain’s key neuromodulators are home to extraordinary diversity, in a flurry of papers within what seemed a week of each other, on <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30971-1#.W3_cq2FUTcg.twitter">serotonin</a>, on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0203-4">dopamine</a>, and on <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30635-4">noradrenaline</a>.</p><p>Hugo Spiers and colleagues <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30771-1">showed us</a> that the difference in navigation ability between the men and women of a country correlates rather stunningly well with the level of gender inequality in that country: the more unequal the genders are treated, the bigger the gap in the ability to navigate. To the extent that countries with minor gender inequality — your Norways and your Finlands — show no difference in navigation ability between men and women.</p><p>And it would be remiss of me not to mention that <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> itself had an exciting year, as it morphed from one-man show to a platform for a rich variety of voices in systems neuroscience.

December brought us an issue of <em>Nature</em> with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0716-8">a really strange neuroscience paper</a>. A paper about the role of hippocampus in memory. Unlike most strange papers, this one was strange for what was <strong>not</strong> in it. No flashy genetics; no tricksy optogenetics to make neurons do unworldly things; no DREADDs to control specific neurons with designer chemicals; no Neuropixels or calcium imaging to record hundreds or thousands of neurons; no unit recording of any kind, in fact. Just behaviour, chemical lesions for causality, and EEG/LFP to track sleep states. Like something from the late 80s. As were the statistical analyses (seriously <em>Nature</em>, bar charts with single sided error bars in 2018?).</p><p>But it made an interesting case for scientific insight, and there it is, in <em>Nature</em>.

<p>End of year festivities are now in full swing with our focus on friends, family and food. In this blog, I look at how diet can affect your mental health, and share some healthy eating tips to get you through the silly season without the mood swings and guilt.</p>
<h2>Does diet affect mental health?</h2>
<p>If you’re in a negative mood, you’re more likely to choose indulgent, comfort foods that are sugary, fatty or salty instead of opting for nutritious options.</p>
<p>We have anecdotal evidence to support the notion that how you feel affects the foods you choose to eat.</p>
<p>Until recently, what was less understood was the causal relationship between food and how it affected mood.</p>
<h2>The SMILES trial – evidence at last!</h2>
<p>Associate Professor Felice Jacka, Deakin University researcher and founder of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry, and her team have recently conducted a small <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y">clinical trial</a> of 67 people suffering symptoms of depression and found a link between diet and their mental health.</p>
<p>In the study, half of the participants were encouraged to follow a Modified Mediterranean Diet, which was constructed using existing dietary guidelines from Greece and Australia, <em>traditional</em> Mediterranean diet principles. Everyone was coached by a dietician. A comparison group of people with the same symptoms, were offered social support only.</p>
<p>The results of the <a href="https://foodandmoodcentre.com.au/media/smiles-trial/">SMILES study,</a> published in the international journal <em>BMC Medicine</em>, showed that participants in the dietary intervention group had a much greater reduction in their depressive symptoms over the three-month period, compared to those in the social support group.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, a third of those in the dietary support group met criteria for remission of major depression, compared to 8 percent of those in the social support group.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rnfirstbite/diet-for-mental-health/5802234" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jacka says</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Research now suggests that depression and dementia are affected by the quality of our diets across the life course. Research also shows that adults who eat more unhealthy junk foods are at increased risk of depression.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also the case in teenagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see a pretty clear dose-response relationships between their diet and level of mental health and wellbeing. In particular, those that had low scores on what we call an unhealthy dietary pattern were worse off, and those who had a higher score on the nutrient-dense dietary pattern were better off.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>What foods should I choose to improve mood?</h2>
<p>The ‘bad-mood food’ culprits are what you might expect. As Jacka <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2014/10/02/4098166.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Highly-processed snack and takeaway food products, rich in tasty fat and sugar, have now displaced much of the fruit, vegetables and other nutritious, unprocessed foods in our diets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy, nutrient-dense dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, seem to protect against developing depression, and also dementia. Jacka says,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The strongest evidence-base we have is for the Mediterranean diet, and it is what we should be advocating for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A Mediterranean type diet (which is <em>not</em> red wine based!) is characterised by high consumption of plants (vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains), is rich in healthy fats from generous consumption of fish and olive oil, is low in red meat and dairy, and allows for moderate consumption of red wine with meals.</p>
<h2>Tips for healthy eating over the festive season.</h2>
<p>Tis the season to be jolly!</p>
<p>Here are some easy brain-healthy choices you can make to keep you feeling joyful at your next BBQ or end of year party:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of only snacking on chips, try a few raw nuts too (just not the salted and roasted kind!).</li>
<li>Load up your plate with salad or veggies first — you’ll leave less room for meat, bread or potatoes.</li>
<li>Swap the BBQ lamb chop or steak for salmon. Omega-3 fats in fish reduce inflammation, which may contribute to an increased risk of depression or anxiety.</li>
<li>Add some legumes (beans, chickpeas or lentils) to your plate. Your gut will love the extra fibre, and evidence is building that a healthy gut microbiome is linked to better mental health.</li>
<li>High-quality extra-virgin olive oil seasoned with balsamic vinegar is delicious for dipping wholegrain bread, and is a healthy alternative to butter or margarine.</li>
<li>Enjoy prawns and turkey. Both are rich in tryptophan an essential amino acid that is the precursor for the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) serotonin.</li>
<li>Swap the pavlova for fresh fruit (or at least choose both!). Or, if you must indulge, save the sweet treats for a special occasion like Christmas day.</li>
<li>Cheers! Enjoy a glass of red wine with friends and family. Social connection is one of the best protective factors against mental health problems and cognitive decline.</li>
</ul>

The test is called EDOR® and according to Emotra's website and materials, it has been shown to be highly effective. Last year, I explained why I disagree with that assessment.

But for Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, self-correction of a paper he had published in the Proceedings of the National … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/14/political-scientist-asks-for-correction-gets-flip-flop/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Political scientist asks for correction, gets flip-flop</span></a>

<p>Psychologists, philosophers and poets have devoted many years reflecting on the meaning of love for another. A less-explored question – the focus of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407517724600">a study</a> to appear in the January 2019 issue of <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> – is what makes us feel loved by others?</p>
<p>More specifically, the study investigated whether there is widespread agreement about the everyday experiences, romantic and non-romantic, that lead us (or US citizens, at least) to feel loved. Some of the results are obvious – many participants agreed that making love, being hugged, receiving compliments and gifts, make us feel loved. But there was even stronger agreement that mundane yet touching gestures make us feel loved, such as our pets being happy to see us, a child snuggling up to us, or someone showing us compassion.</p>
<p><span id="more-35619"></span></p>
<p>Employing an approach known as “cultural consensus theory”, Saeideh Heshmati at Penn State University and her colleagues presented nearly 500 online participants (men and women aged 18 to 93 selected to be representative of the US population as a whole) with 60 everyday scenarios, and for each one asked them to indicate whether it was true or false that most people would feel loved in that situation (or to pass if they didn’t know).</p>
<p>Other scenarios for which there was particularly strong agreement that the situation would provoke felt love included being cared for when sick; being told “I love you”; spending time with one’s children; being made to feel special; and spending quality time with someone.</p>
<p>There was far less agreement around whether situations that do not involve other people prompt feelings of being loved or not, such as the sun shining or eating one’s favourite food.</p>
<p>In terms of the everyday situations that do <em>not</em> provoke feelings of being loved, there was striking agreement that this is the case for any behaviours by others that imply they are being overly controlling or possessive, such as wanting to know where you are at all times, or wanting to spend all their time with you. The researchers speculated this might be a reflection of the individualistic culture in America with its celebration of personal liberty, and that findings in other cultures may differ.</p>
<p>Another angle on their results the researchers looked at was whether there are particular groups who are more at odds with the consensus on felt love than others. They found that men seemed less attuned to the consensus than women. Perhaps, they suggested, this is a reflection of men’s greater focus on passionate, sexual love (as revealed by earlier research) and the fact women may have found it easier to reflect on the everyday, nonsexual love explored in the current study. Also, people currently in a romantic relationship showed more awareness of the consensus on felt love (perhaps because they experience the emotion more often, the researchers surmised), as did white people (perhaps because, being the ethnic majority, their beliefs formed more of the consensus).</p>
<p>In terms of personality, participants higher in trait agreeableness were more in tune with the collective views on felt love, which seems intuitive, but so too were participants higher in neuroticism (i.e. with low emotional stability, who are known to go through more relationship difficulties on average), which is harder to explain. This last finding may reflect that “individuals high in neuroticism still experience love, they simply do not have lasting love experiences…,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>The main take-away from the research, Heshmati and her team added, is that “people feel loved in a range of settings much wider than just romantic relationships ..”, and “although knowledge of love can differ between people, there is a consensus within the US culture about which scenarios elicit love in most people.”</p>
<p>An important caveat to remember when interpreting these results is that participants  were sharing their beliefs about the times they believed “most people” feel loved – they weren’t actually reporting their <em>own</em> experiences (though they may have extrapolated from their own experiences to make inferences about people in general). It would be intriguing to see how the results might differ if participants were simply asked to report their own experiences. For now this fascinating research lays the groundwork for future investigations to explore felt love in other cultures and to see how it interacts with other psychological traits not measured here, such as attachment style.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/8935858-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The Polio Eradication Programme in Nigeria is making positive strides towards interruption of wild poliovirus (WPV). The past two decades were marked with surges in WPV cases that saw Nigeria accounting for almost half of the global burden of WPV in 2005. During 2003-2013, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) faced a serious challenge with resurgence of polio virus originating from Nigeria in twenty-six previously polio-free countries in sub Saharan Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>WPV cases increased from 202 in 2002 to a peak of 1,122 in 2006 following suspension of immunization campaigns in northern Nigeria due to unfounded rumors of oral polio vaccine (OPV) safety. Through an aggressive effort, the suspension was lifted and the campaigns reinstated.</p>
<p>Another surge in WPV cases was recorded in 2012 with 122 cases, up from 63 cases in 2011. In 2012, the Nigerian government launched the national polio eradication emergency plan (NPEEP) to intensify efforts to interrupt WPV transmission. A progressive decline in WPV1 cases was thereafter achieved from 122 in 2012 to 0 in 2015.</p>
<p>The strong leadership of the program by the Government of Nigeria at Federal and State level, the engagement of the traditional institutions, establishment of an Incident Management System through Emergency Operation Centres (EOC) to coordinate all efforts of government and partners at Federal level and in high risk states, and the localized innovative strategies to address the outbreak were some of the major contributing factors to the progress registered.</p>
<p>The program came close to marking two years without WPV1 in 2016. After twenty-three months without detection of WPV1, four cases were detected from areas that had not been accessible to the program for over three years due to insecurity in Borno state, north eastern Nigeria. Genetic sequencing of the viruses revealed the closest known link to a virus last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating prolonged undetected circulation for over four years.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time of publishing this supplement in 2018, the country has marked just over two years without WPV1.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the resurgence of WPV1 in 2016 paused a major setback to the country and regional progress, it provided an opportunity for the program to stretch its innovative capacity to mount a response in a complex environment. The outbreak in Borno demonstrated the necessity of ensuring accessibility, particularly for surveillance to rule out any undetected presence of the virus.</p>
<p>Innovative strategies for surveillance and vaccination, and strengthening of partnerships with non-traditional actors have been instrumental to the progress registered so far in the response to the 2016 outbreak. At the time of publishing this supplement in 2018, the country has marked just over two years without WPV1. However, an estimated 70,000 under-five children remain trapped in insecure areas of Borno state, and therefore the progress is acknowledged with caution. Nigeria still remains among the three WPV endemic countries globally, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>This supplement presents some of the innovations, lessons learned and best practices that the Nigerian government and its polio partners implemented during 2014-2016 towards interruption of WPV transmission. The programmatic interventions described here include innovative strategies such as directly observed vaccination (DOPV), addressing unmet needs of non-compliant households, use of mobile hard-to-reach teams, focus on nomadic groups and engagement of security personnel to interrupt polio virus transmission in polio sanctuaries in northern Nigeria, along rivers of interest and security compromised areas respectively.</p>
<p>Ensuring sensitive and quality surveillance to detect any suspect viruses is a key aspect of the NPEEP. Initiatives to intensify surveillance at field level, evaluate the quality of documentation and profile of polio compatible cases have been implemented in Nigeria. Furthermore, innovations such as Auto-Visual AFP Detection and Reporting (AVADAR), and use of mobile technology for monitoring program performance have facilitated reporting in real-time for decision making and timely action.</p>
<p>In line with the strategic focus of the Global Polio End Game Strategy and Plan, the switch from tOPV to bOPV was successfully implemented in April 2016 and some lessons from the field have been documented. In addition, laboratory containment activities, in conformity with the Global Action Plan III, were implemented.</p>
<p>We believe that these public health interventions, among other activities, have contributed to the progress registered for far in the polio eradication program in Nigeria and will further enable Nigeria achieve and sustain polio-free status. The ongoing effort to utilize the lessons learned and assets available to improve routine immunization, integrated disease surveillance and response, and primary health care will be maximized to ensure a smooth transition towards certification of polio eradication. It is our hope that these interventions and experiences will be of interest to public health and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When’s the best time of day to give someone bad news? First thing in the morning or early evening? Yes, if it’s in the morning, they have longer to work out what to do about it, but you might be better off plumping for the evening because according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/npr2.12042">new study</a>, published open-access in <i>Neuropsychopharmacology,</i> they’re likely to suffer less of a physiological stress response at this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35610"></span></p>
<p>If a threat – whether physical or psychological – doesn’t quickly vanish, communication between a trio of brain regions – the hypothalamus, the pituitary glands and the adrenal cortex (known collectively as the HPA axis) – causes, among other things, an increase in levels of the hormone cortisol, which triggers the release of glucose, for energy, into the bloodstream. This stress response effectively provides our muscles with extra fuel to fight or flee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, there’s also a daily pattern to our baseline levels of cortisol production – healthy people typically experience a spike around waking, and a steady decrease in levels throughout the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All kinds of other factors also influence an individual’s cortisol levels at any given time, including age, sex, sleep/wake time preferences, exercise patterns and general stress levels. This raises the possibility that how we respond physically to stress might vary depending on the time of day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To find out, Yujiro Yamanaka at Hokkaido University and colleagues recruited 20 male and 7 female healthy young subjects with similar typical sleep durations and average wake/sleep times (in other words, they were not “larks” or “owls”); also none of them had a history of hormonal, psychiatric or sleep problems. The participants first gave saliva samples every two hours for one day, so their typical daily cortisol levels could be assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They were then randomised to undergo a stressful experience either two hours after they typically woke up, or ten hours afterwards. For the stress experience, the researchers used the widely-used Trier Social Stress test, which requires people to give a presentation and perform mental arithmetic in front of interviewers, while being videoed. Saliva samples were collected from all the participants before their test, immediately afterwards and then every ten minutes for half an hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that the group that were stressed in the morning showed a statistically significant increase in their cortisol levels after the test, compared with before (a sign of a large stress response). In contrast, the cortisol increase in the evening group was smaller and did not reach statistical significance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers said it seems that the HPA axis “has a powerful response to acute psychological stress in the morning rather than in the evening”. Animal research suggests that this might be because the adrenal cortex typically becomes less sensitive to ACTH, the hormone produced by the pituitary gland that triggers the release of cortisol, as the day wears on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What are the implications of all this?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given all the factors that affect an individual’s cortisol levels and their response to stress, the real-world impact of experiencing morning vs. evening stress is far from clear. There’s another complication – the researchers explained that if stress in the evening doesn’t significantly hike cortisol levels, and so does not increase glucose availability, we might in fact be <i>more</i> vulnerable to any threat, because we might find it harder to mount a useful response. On the other hand, if that stressor is something we can’t immediately combat, and we’re frequently stressed, arguably it might be better to have a lower cortisol response, because chronically elevated levels of cortisol are associated with ill health. In other words, the short answer to the question of whether to share bad news in the morning or evening is: “it depends!”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for other researchers interested in stress, these new results (while they need replicating with larger samples) also have implications: the time of day of experiments investigating stress could, it seems, affect the results in important ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/epistemologie-politique-i-introduction/">Epistémologie politique (I) Introduction</a></h4>

<p>Dans cette série, je m’intéresse à l’épistémologie de la pensée politique. J’entends ici par épistémologie la théorie de la connaissance de manière générale, c’est-à-dire pas seulement la connaissance scientifique mais la connaissance du monde, plus généralement. Dans la pensée politique, il y a bien sûr un aspect normatif (comment la société devrait être organisée et dans quel but) mais cette normativité prend toujours appui sur une théorie du monde : comment fonctionnent la société, l’économie, les structures de pouvoir. Elle inclut également toujours un certain nombre de présupposés sur la psychologie humaine. Par exemple, selon une théorie typiquement associée à la droite conservatrice, l’homme est un loup pour l’homme (Hobbes) ; il s’ensuit que des institutions doivent être créées pour protéger l’homme de ses congénères. Une variante (droite libérale) est que l’homme cherche avant tout à maximiser à son intérêt personnel ; il s’ensuit que les institutions sociales doivent être organisées de façon à ce que l’intérêt personnel coïncide avec l’intérêt collectif. Selon une autre théorie ancrée à gauche, l’homme est naturellement altruiste (Rousseau) ; il s’ensuit que la société doit être organisée pour faciliter la coopération entre les hommes (avec bien sûr de nombreuses variantes ; anarchismes, communismes, etc).</p>
<p>Ainsi les doctrines politiques sont en grande partie déterminées par des théories sous-jacentes de l’homme et du monde. Par conséquent, les désaccords politiques sont très souvent liés à des désaccords sur ces théories et se manifestent donc sur le plan épistémologique. Par exemple, les discours de droite tendent à se présenter comme « réalistes » ; la droite libérale comme « rationnelle » ; par opposition à une gauche qui serait « utopiste ». En utilisant ces mots, on se place non sur le plan de la finalité politique mais sur celui de la connaissance : on admet que la finalité des systèmes politiques critiqués est louable, mais on prétend qu’ils reposent sur une vision fausse de la façon dont le monde fonctionne. C’est donc réellement sur la connaissance que porte le jugement, sur la validité empirique des théories sous-jacentes.</p>
<p>Le système politique néolibéral, par exemple (habituellement classé au centre droit), refuse généralement l’appellation « néolibéral », pourquoi ? Parce que ses partisans ne pensent pas suivre une doctrine particulière, mais simplement exprimer ce qui est rationnel, « logique ». D’un point de vue épistémologique, cette posture est critiquable, puisque la logique s’exprime dans un cadre formel, et donc dans un modèle particulier. Autrement dit, la rationalité s’exerce au sein d’une théorie particulière du monde, ce qui fait que deux discours contradictoires peuvent être rationnels, mais relatifs à des théories différentes. Par exemple, les discours Keynésiens et néoclassiques sont deux discours rationnels contradictoires, parce qu’ils reposent sur des modèles différents. Conformément à cette posture rationaliste, la pensée néolibérale ou néoclassique repose largement sur une connaissance mathématisée, c’est-à-dire dont les questions portent sur des aspects formels plutôt que sur la validité empirique du modèle sous-jacent (comme le concept de l’agent rationnel). La théorie tend par conséquent à ignorer les champs du savoir permettant de questionner empiriquement les modèles socio-économiques, tels que l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie. On peut donc formuler une critique épistémologique de cette pensée politique.</p>
<p>De manière symétrique, le discours de gauche tend à dépeindre la pensée politique de droite comme la manifestation sournoise de mauvaises intentions. Par exemple, le discours économique de droite tend à promouvoir la réduction de l’impôt, en particulier sur les plus riches. Ceci est vu par la critique de gauche comme la défense des intérêts d’une classe dominante. Pourquoi ? Encore une fois, on peut analyser la question sous l’angle épistémologique. Selon les théories de gauche, l’impôt est ce qui permet de répartir équitablement les richesses. Par conséquent, une mesure tendant à réduire l’impôt favorise les classes riches de la population. Il s’ensuit qu’un système politique qui promeut cette mesure doit avoir pour but de favoriser ces classes. Il s’agit encore une fois de la simple expression de la rationalité au sein d’un cadre théorique. On a donc dans le discours néolibéral et dans sa critique deux discours rationnels au sein de cadres théoriques différents.</p>
<p>Ce dernier exemple soulève un autre point épistémologique intéressant, qui est la façon dont les partisans d’une théorie jugent ceux d’une autre théorie. On voit dans cet exemple l’opposition de deux mépris : le néolibéral considère son critique comme idiot (irrationnel) ; le critique considère le néolibéral comme égoïste et de mauvaise foi. Dans les deux cas, le partisan juge son adversaire en utilisant son propre cadre théorique, c’est-à-dire comme si l’adversaire utilisait le même cadre théorique. En effet, le néolibéral juge son critique idiot, parce que ce critique serait effectivement idiot s’il adoptait le cadre théorique néolibéral mais n’en tirait pas les conclusions logiques (d’où le discours récurrent des gouvernants face à leur opposition qu’il faut « faire de la pédagogie », ce qui est perçu à juste titre comme du mépris). De même, l’opposant juge le néolibéral de mauvaise foi, c’est-à-dire qu’il considère que celui-ci est tout à fait conscient que ses propositions politiques favorisent la classe dominante. Or ceci suppose qu’il a adopté le cadre théorique alternatif de l’opposant. Dans les deux cas donc, chacun semble négliger la possibilité que son propre cadre de pensée est une théorie dont il est convaincu, et non une vérité évidente et universelle. Il en résulte une critique relativement stérile, en cela qu’elle ne porte pas sur les fondements (notamment empiriques) des théories en compétition mais sur les supposées compétences des interlocuteurs d’un côté (arguments d’autorité) et sur les intérêts personnels ou de classe de l’autre (invectives).</p>
<p>On touche ici à deux points distincts. D’une part, au statut épistémologique des théories (est-ce qu’elles se valent toutes et ne sont que des points de vue ? ou peut-on les juger empiriquement ou théoriquement ?). Sur ce point, on peut s’appuyer sur une riche littérature en philosophie des sciences. D’autre part, à la psychologie des croyances : qu’est-ce qui fait que l’on croit à certaines théories plutôt qu’à d’autres, et qu’éventuellement on change d’avis ? Sur ce deuxième point, on peut s’appuyer également sur une riche littérature en psychologie sociale, comme la <a href="https://www.psychologie-sociale.com/index.php/fr/theories/influence/6-la-theorie-de-la-dissonance-cognitive">théorie de la dissonance cognitive</a> dont je parlerai dans un prochain texte. Celle-ci propose que l’on cherche à rendre nos actes et nos croyances cohérents non seulement en agissant conformément à nos croyances, mais également dans de nombreux cas en adaptant nos croyances à nos actes (entre autres). Par exemple, une personne qui gagne beaucoup d’argent peut se convaincre qu’un système politique qui favorise l’inégalité est plus efficace. Ceci explique l’alignement entre catégories sociologiques et croyances politiques, qui est plus satisfaisante que la théorie de la mauvaise foi. Ce n’est effectivement pas un hasard si les classes supérieures tendent à adopter une théorie qui justifie leur position sociale (e.g. la théorie néolibérale), mais cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que cette adoption est cynique. Au contraire, ces croyances sont sincères. Simplement, différentes catégories sociologiques et culturelles sont plus ou moins susceptibles d’adopter différentes croyances.</p>
<p>Dans cette série, je compte donc développer une critique épistémologique du discours politique.</p>

<p>In this paper we introduce three methods for re-scaling data sets aiming at improving the likelihood of clustering validity indexes to return the true number of spherical Gaussian clusters with additional noise features. Our method obtains feature re-scaling factors taking into account the structure of a given data set and the intuitive idea that different features may have different degrees of relevance at different clusters. We experiment with the Silhouette (using squared Euclidean, Manhattan, and the pth power of the Minkowski distance), Dunn’s, Calinski–Harabasz and Hartigan indexes on data sets with spherical Gaussian clusters with and without noise features. We conclude that our methods indeed increase the chances of estimating the true number of clusters in a data set.</p>

<p>The issue of determining “the right number of clusters” in K-Means has attracted considerable interest, especially in the recent years. Cluster intermix appears to be a factor most affecting the clustering results. This paper proposes an experimental setting for comparison of different approaches at data generated from Gaussian clusters with the controlled parameters of between- and within-cluster spread to model cluster intermix. The setting allows for evaluating the centroid recovery on par with conventional evaluation of the cluster recovery. The subjects of our interest are two versions of the “intelligent” K-Means method, ik-Means, that find the “right” number of clusters by extracting “anomalous patterns” from the data one-by-one. We compare them with seven other methods, including Hartigan’s rule, averaged Silhouette width and Gap statistic, under different between- and within-cluster spread-shape conditions. There are several consistent patterns in the results of our experiments, such as that the right K is reproduced best by Hartigan’s rule – but not clusters or their centroids. This leads us to propose an adjusted version of iK-Means, which performs well in the current experiment setting.</p>

<p>“Learning styles” – there can be few ideas that have created such a stark disconnect between the experts on the ground and the evidence published in scholarly journals. Endorsed by the overwhelming majority of teachers, yet dismissed by most psychologists and educational neuroscientists as a “neuromyth”, the basis of learning styles is that people learn better when taught via their preferred learning modality, usually (but not always) described as either visual, auditory or kinaesthetic.</p>
<p>Many studies have already uncovered <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/">serious problems with the learning styles concept</a>, such as that measures of learning styles are invalid and that students do not in fact learn better via their preferred modality. Now further evidence against learning styles comes from Greece, in one of the first investigations on the topic to involve primary school pupils.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00105/full">Writing in <em>Frontiers in Education</em></a>, Marietta Papadatou-Pastou and her colleagues report that teachers and pupils did not agree on the pupils’ preferred learning modality – a significant blow for the learning styles concept since “teachers typically adopt learning styles within a classroom context by relying on their own assessment of students’ learning styles.”</p>
<p><span id="more-35587"></span></p>
<p>The study was simple enough – nearly 200 fifth- and sixth-grade pupils (average age 11 years) from five schools chose which was their preferred learning style out of visual, auditory or kinaesthetic. They also completed a short IQ test (the Raven’s matrices). Next, their teachers – 19 took part – first provided an open-ended answer to the question “Does teaching that is tailor-made to the students’ learning style reinforce the students’ performance?”, then they were asked to identify each of their pupils’ favoured style (such that each child was rated by one teacher).</p>
<p>All of the participating teachers endorsed the concept of learning styles. However, there was not a statistically significant correlation between the teachers’ judgments of their pupils’ favoured learning style and the pupils’ own declaration of their preference. “We posit that identifying preferred learning style can be a hit-and-miss process, with no agreement between the assessment made by teachers and students,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>There was also no association between the teachers’ judgments of pupils’ learning style and the pupils’ IQ, suggesting the teachers were not using IQ as a proxy for learning style.</p>
<p>A weakness of the study was that the teachers were not asked specifically about the kind of learning styles approach they used or favoured, so it’s possible they were not familiar with the visual, auditory, kinaesthetic breakdown, though this seems unlikely since this so-called VARK model is the most popular.</p>

Also contentious is its demand that all research papers funded by cOAlition S members must be published under the most liberal Creative Commons licence (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a></span> or equivalent). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>While cOAlition S <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/feedback/">subsequently announced</a></span> that hybrid OA will get a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/plan-s-three-year-transition-period-hybrid-journals">three-year stay of execution</a></span>, <i>Nature </i><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">calculates</a></span> that banning hybrid OA means that European researchers will be unable to publish in 85% of the journals they currently submit too. Rather they will need to publish in “pure” gold OA journals, which in most cases will require paying article-processing charges (APCs).

This is an essential community service to early-career scholars in particular and deserves to be cherished (and its modest costs paid for). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Any wider circulation of drafts seems to be an unmitigated good; at the point where journals start to make their contribution, circulation should be constrained only to the degree necessary to protect that contribution.
