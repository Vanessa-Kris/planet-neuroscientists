                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>“Trust in the science” is the kind of refrain commonly uttered by well-meaning individuals looking to promote positive, scientifically-backed change, such as encouraging action against climate change or improving uptake of vaccines. The hope is that if people are encouraged to trust science, they will not be duped by those who are promoting the opposite agenda — one which often flies in the face of scientific evidence. But are people actually less likely to fall for misinformation when they have trust in science?</p>



<p>Yes and no, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103121000871?dgcid=rss_sd_all">according to a new a study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>. Thomas C O’Brien and colleagues from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign find that people with greater trust in science are generally less likely to believe misinformation. But when that misinformation is presented with scientific-sounding content to back it up, they become more easily duped by it.</p>



<span id="more-43196"></span>



<p>In the first study, 532 online participants read an article about the “Valza virus”, which stated that the virus had been created as a bioweapon in a government lab and subsequently covered up. The article was written informally, in a style meant to imitate real online posts made by conspiracy theorists. In one condition, the article cited scientists who said that studies in their own lab proved that there had been a conspiracy; in the other, the article instead quoted activists.</p>



<p>Participants then answered questions about how much they believed the article (e.g. to what extent they agreed it was “credible” or “probably true”) and whether they felt it should be shared with a class studying current affairs. (They also answered other questions about their comprehension of the text, in order to obscure the purpose of the study). Finally, participants rated their own trust in science, responding to statements like “scientific theories are trustworthy”, and answered questions that probed their own understanding of scientific methodology.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, people with a greater trust in science and/or a stronger understanding of methodology were less likely to believe the conspiracy theory. But the article’s content made a difference: people who had a high trust in science were more likely to believe the article if it had quoted scientists than if it had not. Similarly, this group was more likely to say that the article should be shared with the current affairs class if it had apparently scientific content. For people with lower levels of trust in science, whether or not the article had cited scientists made no difference to their beliefs or intentions to share it.</p>



<p>A subsequent study looked at people&#8217;s belief in a conspiracy theory about genetically modified foods, and this time used real articles and pictures from websites. All participants read that genetically modified foods caused tumours, and that this was being covered up. In one condition, they saw articles that referred to an actual scientific paper which supported the theory (and which, unknown to participants, has since been heavily criticised and retracted). In the other condition, they again read arguments by activists, without any scientific content.</p>



<p>The results were the same: although, overall, people who trusted in science were less likely to believe this conspiracy theory, their levels of belief increased when the article contained supposedly scientific content.</p>



<p>In a final study, the team found that people were less likely to believe the conspiracy about genetically modified foods when they had first been asked to think about times when it is important to critically evaluate evidence, compared to when they had been asked to think of times when science had benefited humanity.</p>



<p>The research suggests that trust in science can actually <em>increase</em> people’s vulnerability to pseudoscience, the authors write. Broad campaigns to promote trust in science may therefore not be that useful; instead, it may be more beneficial to promote critical analysis skills.</p>



<p>That said, there is clearly some benefit to trusting science: people with low trust in science tended to believe the conspiracy theories regardless of their content, while those with high trust only showed a tendency to believe them if they contained some (pseudo)scientific content. So it seems likely that those broad campaigns could still have some positive effects. Still, to help people spot misinformation it seems important to teach them to critically evaluate evidence and understand that science isn&#8217;t infallible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-farm-windbreak-turbine-speed-power-output">Windbreaks, surprisingly, could help wind farms boost power output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Windbreaks may sound like a counterintuitive idea for boosting the performance of a wind turbine. But physicists report that low walls that block wind could actually help wind farms produce more power.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that the output of a single wind turbine could be improved with a windbreak. While windbreaks slow wind speed close to the ground, above the height of the windbreak, wind speeds actually increase as air rushes over the top. But for large wind farms, there’s a drawback. A windbreak’s wake slows the flow of air as it travels farther through the rows of turbines. That could suggest that windbreaks would be a wash for wind farms with many turbines.</p>



<p>But by striking a balance between these competing effects, windbreaks placed in front of each turbine can increase power output, new computer simulations suggest. It comes down to the windbreaks’ dimensions. Squat, wide barriers are the way to go, according to a simulated wind farm with six rows of turbines. To optimize performance, windbreaks should be a tenth the height of the turbine and at least five times the width of the blades, physicists report July 30 in <em>Physical Review Fluids</em>. Such an arrangement could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.074611">increase the total power by about 10 percent</a>, the researchers found. That’s the equivalent of adding an additional turbine, on average, for every 10 in a wind farm.</p>



<p>In the simulations, the wind always came from the same direction, suggesting the technique might be useful in locations where wind tends to blow one way, such as coastal regions. Future studies could investigate how this technique might apply in places where wind direction varies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></h4>

              
                <p>At the start of a school year, kids usually show up with oversized backpacks stocked with fresh pencils, crisp notebooks and snacks. This back-to-school season, many children will carry extra baggage.</p>



<p>Eighteen months of an unprecedented pandemic turned routines — including going to school — topsy-turvy. This fall, many kids are heading to their new classrooms toting traumas, worries and gaps in their learning.</p>



<p>What’s more, schoolchildren are returning as the pandemic is once again shifting the ground under our feet. Infections driven by the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus are putting new twists on questions over how to keep kids learning while still protecting unvaccinated children from illness. These burdens may profoundly change yet another school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year comes on the heels of one already marked by losses big and small. When school buildings abruptly closed in the spring of 2020 and school shifted online, many children lost regular time spent together with friends and teachers. Kids missed out on gym class, organized sports and time to goof around at recess. Some kids even lost their voices, digitally silenced by exasperated teachers doing their best to corral rambunctious students in virtual classrooms. “I’m muting you,” these kids were told.</p>





<p>But every student had their own personal pandemic experience. “You can’t generalize,” says Pedro Noguera, dean of the education school at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Half of the kids in the United States went to in-person school by the end of 2020, either full-time or on a hybrid schedule. Faced with closed schools, some kids instead had private teachers and learning bubbles. Others muddled along on their own, without solid internet access or a quiet place to sit.</p>



<p>Too many kids who rely on schools as a safety net went without consistent meals and regular check-ins from adults. More than 1.5 million kids globally <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01253-8/fulltext">lost a parent, live-in grandparent or other live-in relative</a> to the pandemic, scientists estimated July 20 in the <em>Lancet</em>. School counselors had harder times reaching kids.</p>

<p>These pandemic losses were not spread evenly. Existing inequities <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-school-plans-students-inequities">deepened</a> during the pandemic (<em>SN: 9/8/20</em>). Children from Black and Hispanic communities, and other traditionally underserved groups of kids, suffered some of the biggest losses.</p>



<p>Despite the variation, a patchwork of new data is beginning to put numbers to the scope of the problems that teachers, school administrators and families will face as students return to school. Understanding these challenges is a step toward helping kids come back to the classroom and, ultimately, thrive, says Kathleen Ethier, a social and behavioral scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Maybe one of the positive take-home messages from this past year and a half,” she says, “is that we understand now just how important school is.”</p>



<h3>Learning loss</h3>



<p>Getting a measure of academic performance that applies to all kids across the United States is tough. But early in the pandemic, students’ test scores hinted at the academic blows that were to come.</p>



<p>Comparing previous test score changes of kids in California to the changes from fall of 2019 to the winter of 2020 showed an <a href="https://edpolicyinca.org/publications/covid-19-impacts-student-learning">overall academic lag</a>. “On average, kids are two to two-and-a-half months behind where we would expect they would have been if COVID hadn’t happened,” says learning science expert Libby Pier of Education Analytics, a nonprofit based in Madison, Wis. Considering that a normal school year is nine months long, “that’s a quarter to a third of the school year they missed out on.”</p>



<p>The pandemic, of course, didn’t end in 2020; measures of academic slipping got worse as time went on. Elementary school students across the United States finished the 2020–2021 school year an average of five months behind in math and four months behind in reading, an <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning">analysis</a> from the analytics firm McKinsey &amp; Company, headquartered in New York City, shows. Those numbers, described in a July 27 report, don’t reflect all students. The analysis counted results only from kids who were in schools to take the tests; kids at home might have fared worse.</p>

</div>



<p>The learning lag was most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-school-plans-students-inequities">pronounced in children from underserved communities</a>: those who are Hispanic, Black, economically disadvantaged or learning English (<em>SN</em>: 9/8/20). Students in majority-Black schools ended the year six months behind where they would have been in both reading and math; students in white-majority schools lost four months of math and three months of reading.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to say to what extent school closures and shifts to virtual learning played in these lower-than-expected test scores. “Right now, we don’t have the evidence to conclude whether the impacts we are seeing are because students were learning remotely, or because there was a global pandemic happening,” Pier says. Kids could have also been struggling with losing a parent, caring for siblings or internet connection problems. Without all the information about kids’ lives, including their school experiences, she says, “we can’t answer the questions we want.”</p>



<h3>Virtual, for some</h3>



<p>One big question is how virtual school stacks up against in-person school. In the fall of 2020, the CDC’s Ethier and her colleagues asked 1,290 parents of 5- to 12-year-olds about the type of schooling available to their child, along with questions about the well-being of the family.</p>



<p>On 11 of 17 measures, families with kids who were doing partial or full-time virtual school <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011a1.htm">were doing worse</a> than those who attended full-time in person. Kids in virtual school were getting less exercise, less time in person with friends and less time outside. Parents of kids in virtual school were worse off, too, reporting mental distress, difficulty sleeping and conflicts between work and childcare. “Both in terms of stress that families feel, and outcomes among children, there really were significant differences” between in-person and virtual learning, Ethier says.</p>



<p>Ethier’s study, published March 19 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>, “gives us some clues about who to watch out for and what to watch out for,” she says.</p>



<p>Families of color were more likely to have a student in virtual school than white families, Ethier’s team found. A recent study of New York schools revealed similar trends. Across the state, about <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2781960">18 percent of elementary students had access to in-person school</a>. But a racial breakdown turned up stark differences in who could go to school and who had to stay home. About 30 percent of white students could attend in-person school; for Black students, that number was only 5 percent, Ashley Fox and her colleagues report July 15 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>

<p>More advantaged students, such as white, suburban middle-class kids, had considerably more access to in-person school than other groups. Those other groups included students from urban areas, low-income families, students with disabilities and students experiencing homelessness, Fox, a health policy researcher at University at Albany in New York, and her team found. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even before the pandemic, schools had massive inequities; depending on where students live, they received different educational experiences. Fox’s new tally of which schools stayed open shows that the pandemic exacerbated these inequities. A caveat, Fox says, is that the researchers measured access to in-person school, not whether a family actually chose that option.</p>



<h3>An emotional toll</h3>



<p>These academic inequities are not surprising, says Noguera. “The real issue now is what we do about it.” It would be a mistake, he says, “to focus narrowly on academics and ignore some of the mental health challenges that kids will be bringing back with them.”</p>



<p>Depression and anxiety rates among children and adolescents are rising. More kids with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945a3.htm#F1_down">mental health crises</a> are turning up in emergency departments, scientists described in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> November 13. Compared with April through December of 2019, the proportion of children ages 5 to 11 who had mental health-related visits in the same months of 2020 increased by about 25 percent on average, from 782 mental-health-related visits per 100,000 total visits in 2019 to 972 such visits in 2020. &nbsp;For adolescents ages 12 to 17, that proportion increased by about 30 percent, from 3,098 mental-health visits per 100,000 total visits in 2019 to 4,051 in 2020.</p>

<p>And in February and March of this year, there were an average of 855 emergency department visits a week for suspected suicide attempts among 12- to 17-year-old girls, an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm?s_cid=mm7024e1_x">increase of about 50 percent</a> over with the same winter weeks of 2019, scientists reported June 18 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>These studies weren’t designed to pinpoint causes of this increasing emotional distress. But hints come from surveys of families, such as Ethier’s. Parents of children who received virtual school were more likely to report their kids had worse mental or emotional health compared with parents of children who attended in-person school.</p>



<p>Interrupted schooling may cast long shadows, says Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children’s Research Institute. Earlier studies have linked educational attainment with people’s future health, earnings potential and even how long they live. Losing out on school is a big deal, says Christakis. “Children’s lives, their longevity, their health, will be impacted,” he says, “not in the short term, necessarily, but over their life-span.”</p>



<p>As students come back into their classrooms, teachers, administrators and parents would do well to acknowledge all the burdens kids are carrying into class, and not just the academic ones. “We should be thinking of the restart, the return to school, as an opportunity to do things differently,” Noguera says. “To not just to go back to the way it was, but to really try to make schools much more responsive to the needs of kids and parents than they have been.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">The new UN climate change report shows there’s no time for denial or delay</a></h4>

              
                <p>The science is unequivocal: Humans are dramatically overhauling Earth’s climate. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">effects of climate change are now found everywhere</a> around the globe and are intensifying rapidly, states a sweeping new analysis released August 9 by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. And the window to reverse some of these effects is closing.</p>



<p>“There is no room for doubt any longer” about humans’ responsibility for current climate change, says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta and an author on the first chapter of the report. “And now we can say quite definitely that a whole class of extreme [events]” is linked to human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Climate change is already affecting every region on Earth in multiple ways, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">drought and fire conditions in the U.S. West</a> to heat waves in Europe and flooding in Asia, the report notes&nbsp; (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>). Each of the past four decades <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-normals-30-years-hottest-record-united-states">has been the warmest on record</a> since preindustrial times (<em>SN: 5/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>The study also looks at several different scenarios of greenhouse gas warming, including perhaps the most hopeful scenarios in which by 2050 the world achieves “net zero” carbon emissions, where emitted gases are balanced by carbon removal from the atmosphere.</p>





<p>If the world gets down to net-zero emissions, the decades afterward hold “hints of light,” says Baylor Fox-Kemper, an oceanographer at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and the coordinating lead author of the new report’s chapter on oceans and Earth’s icy regions. “Temperatures come back down a little — not all the way back to preindustrial times, but there’s a little recovery.”</p>



<p>But other changes are irreversible on near-future timescales — that is, the next century or more, Fox-Kemper says. Even in those mid-century net-zero emissions scenarios, “it’s still pretty bad,” he says. Sea levels, for example, will continue to rise until about the year 2300, driven in part by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change">juggernaut of Greenland’s melting ice sheet</a> (<em>SN: 9/30/20</em>). “We may have already crossed [the] threshold beyond which Greenland’s melting could be stopped,” he says. Still, swift and deep emissions reductions would significantly slow how much sea levels will rise by the end of the century, the report finds.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>Feeling the heat</h4>



<p>With more global warming, effects on weather patterns and extremes become more pronounced. A new report by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates how much worse the effects could get as warming hits 1.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees C or 4 degrees C over preindustrial levels. For instance, severe droughts are about twice as frequent today as in the past, and could be five times more frequent with 4 degrees C of warming.</p>

<p>The new analysis is the sixth in a series of massive assessment reports undertaken by the IPCC since 1990. In each report, hundreds of scientists from around the world analyze the findings of thousands of studies to form a consensus picture of how Earth’s climate is changing and what role people play in those changes.</p>



<p>“The key message [of this report] is still the same as was first published in 1990 … human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases pose a threat for humans’ well-being and the biosphere,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, at an event announcing the report’s release August 9.</p>



<p>But researchers understand climate change far better now than they did in 1990, when the first assessment report was released. In the last three decades, new findings have poured in from tens of thousands more observing stations, from a wealth of satellite instruments, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">from dramatically improved climate simulations</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>The IPCC’s fifth assessment report, released in several parts during 2013 and 2014, was itself a game changer. It was the first to state that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-calls-swift-switch-alternative-power">are driving climate change</a> — a conclusion that set the stage for 195 nations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">to agree in Paris in 2015 to curb those emissions</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/14</em>; <em>SN: 12/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>The Paris Agreement set a target of limiting the global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times. But many island nations and others most threatened by climate change feared that this target wasn’t stringent enough. So in an unprecedented step, the U.N. commissioned a report by the IPCC to compare how a future Earth might look if warming were limited to just 1.5 degrees Celsius instead.</p>

<p>That special report, released in 2018, revealed in fine detail <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">how just half a degree of extra warming by 2100 could matter</a>, from the increased likelihood of heat waves to higher sea levels (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). The one-two punch of those concrete findings and scorching temperatures in 2019 grabbed the attention of public and policy makers alike.</p>



<p>Scientists were surprised by how hard the 1.5 degree report landed. “Even for me,” says Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a senior advisor for climate at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “a person who has dedicated my entire professional career to addressing climate change, the report caused me to rethink my personal contribution to the climate problem. Climate change was not some distant temperature target to be hit in the ethereal future. It was close; it was now.”</p>



<p>IPCC scientists hope the new report, with its powerful emphasis on the regional and local effects of climate change — fully a third of the report is devoted to outlining those — will have a similar impact. And its timing is significant. Beginning October 31, heads of state from around the world are scheduled to meet in Glasgow, Scotland, to discuss updated — and hopefully increasingly ambitious — plans to reduce emissions to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With previous reports, “the world listened, but it didn’t hear. Or the world listened, but it didn’t act strongly enough,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, at the Aug. 9 event for the report’s release. “We certainly urge them … to listen to the facts on the table now.”</p>

<p>The biomedical research enterprise experienced a year of reckoning in 2020. Global cooperation to create a COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented pace shows the promise of research. Yet the pandemic, the resulting economic and social uncertainties, and the urgency of addressing systemic racial and regional inequities all add to longstanding concerns about the sustainability of the biomedical research enterprise.</p>



<p>Most of us in the biomedical research community agree &mdash; we need a new vision for a healthier future.</p>



<p>To help reimagine that future, the Health Research Alliance (HRA) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) partnered to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/12/reimagine-biomedical-research-for-a-healthier-future/">launch</a> the Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future Essay Challenge. We invited the community to submit ideas that re-commit to serving society and achieving an equitable, diverse, and creative environment for all those working to advance scientific discovery and improve human well-being.</p>



<p>Now, we are thrilled to announce the winners and honorable mentions of the challenge, who will all present their ideas at the <strong>Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future Symposium</strong> to be hosted by HRA on <strong>September 23, 2021</strong>, from <strong>12&ndash;1pm Eastern Daylight Time</strong> (UTC&minus;04:00).</p>



<p>Congratulations to the two winning essays, published as perspectives in<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>PLOS Biology</em></a> and<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>PLOS Medicine</em></a>:</p>

<p>Note: Four of the honorable mentions are posted on the PLOS<a href="https://yoursay.plos.org/?category=HRA-Essay-Competition"> Your Say blog</a>, and one honorable mention is in press at a non-PLOS journal, and we&rsquo;ll add that link retroactively as soon as it publishes.</p>



<p>We received close to 100 essays proposing a wide variety of ideas. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/12/reimagine-biomedical-research-for-a-healthier-future/">judging panel</a> had a difficult time selecting essays, but eventually put forth those that were the most feasible, had high potential for impact, and would spark valuable discussion among the community.</p>



<p>We thank everyone who participated in the challenge. We also note that neither PLOS nor HRA necessarily advocate for the specific ideas outlined in the winning essays. However, we do agree that these seven pieces will foster a dialogue that could spur meaningful change within the biomedical research ecosystem. Ultimately, these changes should advance scientific discovery and ensure those advances have equitable impact.</p>



<p>To spark conversation and action, we encourage you to read the perspectives and the blogs, and to attend the symposium on September 23, 2021 prepared to ask questions of the authors.</p>



<p>Our goal is for the discussion during the symposium to stimulate action and change. Ideally, this effort will ultimately result in a more equitable and effective biomedical research ecosystem.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>“Service with a smile” —&nbsp;having a friendly, cheerful demeanor when working with customers in retail or hospitality — has long been identified as having a negative impact on worker wellbeing. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721418812771?journalCode=cdpa">2019 study</a>, for example, found that “faking it” was of significant detriment to service workers, whilst the term “emotional labour” was <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520272941/the-managed-heart">first used</a> by sociologists to describe jobs which require workers to display positive emotions.</p>



<p>And when this requirement to provide service with a smile is combined with a reliance on tips for income, there can be horrible consequences, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-54880-001">new study </a>suggests. A team led by the University of Notre Dame’s Timothy G. Kundro finds that the combination of financial dependence and deference to customers that tipping and emotional labour involves can lead to customers feeling like they have more power and ultimately sexually harassing workers.</p>



<span id="more-43181"></span>



<p>For the first study, the team recruited 92 employees working at least 35 hours per week and receiving regular tips from customers. First, participants indicated how financially dependent they were on customer tips by reporting what percentage of their total income came from them, and also answered questions about how much they had to appear friendly, sensitive, and composed.</p>



<p>The psychological power of customers versus workers was also measured, with participants indicating whether they felt customers had more power than them and whether or not they had to behave in a way that pleased those they were serving. Finally, they rated how many times they had been sexually harassed by customers over the last six months.</p>



<p>Workers who were both highly dependent on customer tips for income <em>and</em> who indicated that they were required to behave in a pleasing way reported that customers had high levels of power over them — more than workers who weren’t dependent on tips or who didn’t have to provide “service with a smile”. And in turn, this group also reported a higher incidence of sexual harassment at work. This suggests that the combination of both relying on tips and service with a smile can be the catalyst for customers sexually harassing workers.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;A second study looked at the behaviour of customers. Participants, 171 men attracted to women, were asked to imagine they were a customer arriving at a local restaurant: all saw an image of a waitress who was to serve them, displaying either a pleasant, submissive facial expression or a non-deferent one, before reading a transcript of an exchange and finally an image of their receipt.</p>



<p>In the high financial dependence condition, the final receipt included a line for a tip, with a reminder that tips are appreciated; the receipt in the low financial dependence condition stated that employees were paid a fair wage and tips were not necessary. Participants then indicated how much power they believed they had in the situation.</p>



<p>Finally, participants stated how attractive they found the waitress and how likely they would be to ask her for a drink, ask her for her phone number, or touch her in a “joking” manner. They also indicated how much they agreed with statements related to power including “If I asked for her phone number she’d probably give it to me” and “If I asked her for a date, she’d probably say yes”.</p>



<p>Again, participants’ sense of power and intentions to sexually harass the waitress depended on a combination of how financially dependent she was on tips and her displays of emotional labour. Specifically, when they had seen pictures of a submissive, smiling woman <em>and</em> been encouraged to tip, they felt they had more power over her. This in turn led to a higher likelihood that participants would attempt to show inappropriate sexual behaviour towards the waitress.</p>



<p>Thus, across both studies, the team found that two crucial elements of service work — emotional labour and financial dependence through receiving tips — were closely linked to the likelihood of customers sexually harassing them. This can put serving staff in a double bind: not engaging in emotional labour and reducing likelihood of receiving tips then <em>increases</em> financial dependence on customers, thus putting them more at risk. Psychological interventions may not be the answer here. Rather, practical solutions could help: reducing the need for emotional labour in employees, for one, or ensuring that all workers are paid a decent living wage and are less reliant on tips.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-photons-matter-particle-physics">Colliding photons were spotted making matter. But are the photons ‘real’?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Collide light with light, and poof, you get matter and antimatter. It sounds like a simple idea, but it turns out to be surprisingly hard to prove.</p>



<p>A team of physicists is now claiming the first direct observation of the long-sought Breit-Wheeler process, in which two particles of light, or photons, crash into one another and produce an electron and its antimatter counterpart, a positron. But like a discussion from an introductory philosophy course, the detection’s significance hinges on the definition of the word “real.” Some physicists argue the photons don&#8217;t qualify as real, raising questions about the observation&#8217;s implications.</p>



<p>Predicted more than 80 years ago, the Breit-Wheeler process had never been directly observed, although scientists have seen related processes, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lhc-atlas-photons-interact-physics">light scattering off of light</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/17</em>). New measurements from the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.052302">match predictions</a> for the elusive transformation, Brookhaven physicist Daniel Brandenburg and colleagues report in the July 30 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“The idea that you can create matter from light smashing together is an interesting concept,” says Brandenburg. It’s a striking demonstration of the physics immortalized in Einstein’s equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, which revealed that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin.</p>





<p>Whether the observation truly qualifies depends on whether the photons are considered “real,” as demanded by the Breit-Wheeler process, or “virtual.” In particle physics, virtual particles are ones that appear only for brief instants and don’t carry their normal masses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Photons from a commonplace source of light, like a lightbulb or a laser, are real, physicists agree. But the bona fides of Brandenburg and colleagues’ photons are up for debate. That’s because the light the team is colliding comes from an unusual source.</p>



<p>In the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, atomic nuclei travel at nearly the speed of light before ramming into one another. Those speedy nuclei are surrounded by electromagnetic fields, and those fields have photons associated with them. Normally, such photons from electromagnetic fields are virtual. But in the experiment, the photons act as if they are real due to the high speeds at which the two nuclei are zipping along.</p>



<p>The new evidence for the Breit-Wheeler process comes from collisions where the nuclei just missed one another. In those cases, the electromagnetic fields of the two nuclei overlap, and two photons from those fields can collide. So the researchers looked for near-misses that spit out one electron and one positron.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="550" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline.jpg" alt="illustration of two photons colliding, producing an electron and a positron" class="wp-image-3102271" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline-474x383.jpg 474w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline-556x450.jpg 556w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline-230x186.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102271">When two atomic nuclei (red) pass close by, two particles of light (yellow) collide, producing a negatively charged electron ( e<sup>&#8211;</sup>) and a positively charged positron (e<sup>+</sup>).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102271">BNL</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But, says study coauthor Zhangbu Xu, a physicist also at Brookhaven in Upton, N.Y., “the issue is how you actually say these are from [real] photons, not from other processes.” To shore up the case that the particles came from real photons, the researchers studied the angles between those particles, which differ depending on whether real or virtual photons collided. The angles matched expectations for real photons, suggesting that the team had seen the legit Breit-Wheeler process.</p>



<p>Still, “strictly speaking,” says particle physicist Lucian Harland-Lang of the University of Oxford, the experiment is “kind of one step removed” from the true Breit-Wheeler process. Although the photons behave almost as if real, they are technically virtual.</p>



<p>Brandenburg and colleagues take a different view, akin to a physics version of the classic duck test: If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. If the reality of a photon is based only on how it behaves then these would be real photons.</p>



<p>And the scientists’ measurements back that up, says laser plasma physicist Stuart Mangles of Imperial College London, who was not involved with the new study: “Everything they’re measuring about it makes it look like a real photon.” However, Mangles notes that the photons are still virtual by some definitions: Unlike normal photons, which have no mass, these photons do have mass.</p>



<p>One way to skirt thorny questions about the definition of reality would be to perform this experiment with indisputably real photons. Mangles and others are working toward detecting the Breit-Wheeler process with lasers, which produce light that’s as real as the light allowing you to read this article. That, physicists are hoping, will clinch the case for colliding light making matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As the delta variant of the coronavirus sends case counts surging, millions of U.S. children are heading back to school in person, many for the first time in more than a year. It’s a confluence of events that has some parents, educators and health officials worried.</p>



<p>The vast majority of children are unvaccinated, making them one of the populations most vulnerable to the virus. Crowd them together, mix in a more transmissible variant, and it could create a perfect recipe for infection and spreading COVID-19 if extra precautions like wearing masks aren’t taken.</p>



<p>Vaccines offer the best protection, but many children can’t yet get COVID-19 shots. While vaccines for children younger than 12 are in testing, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfizer-covid-vaccine-kids-12-to-15-years-old-fda">could still be months</a> before they’re available for most children in elementary and middle school (<em>SN: 5/10/21</em>). Their younger siblings will probably have to wait longer.</p>



<p>Even once vaccines are in hand for the youngest, it’s unclear how many will get the shots. Most eligible 12-year-olds and teens have yet to get vaccinated. Some people have even questioned whether children need to be vaccinated now, given that their risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19 is less than that of adults.</p>





<p>That is true: Most children who get COVID-19 recover with no lingering effects. But a year and a half into the pandemic, there’s still much that researchers and doctors don’t know about the consequences of the disease for kids. Among the unknowns: How often do kids develop lingering symptoms, or long COVID-19? Why do some healthy children develop serious, run-amok inflammation weeks after recovering from COVID-19? For some kids, that complication comes even more out of the blue: They weren’t even aware they were infected.</p>



<p>Now the delta variant is causing yet more uncertainty. Studies primarily involving adults show that it’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">making people sicker</a> than earlier versions of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Will it hit kids harder too?</p>

<p>Researchers are beginning to gather the data needed to answer those questions, though there is a dearth of data so far on kids and delta. The emerging picture suggests that while the virus remains no big deal for many children, it is a serious problem for others.</p>



<h4>A top 10 killer</h4>



<p>“It drives me crazy to hear over and over again that the virus is not serious for children,” said Andrew Pavia, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. While COVID-19 doesn’t tend to strike kids as hard as it does adults, “By every measure, its <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/multimedia/videos/idsa-media-briefing-covid-vaccines--the-delta-variant/">impact is greater than the impact of influenza</a>,” he said July 13 during a news conference sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<p>Since the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking flu deaths in 2004, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm">childhood deaths from flu</a> in the United States have ranged from a low of 37 in the 2011–2012 flu season to a high of 199 in the 2019–2020 season. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">Flu nearly disappeared</a> in the 2020–2021 season as precautions against the coronavirus helped limit the spread of some other respiratory illnesses, too — except some colds, for still-mysterious reasons (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). That flu season set a new low with one pediatric death reported. The coronavirus, however, proved deadly to more than twice the number of children as flu claimed over the last 18 months. As of August 4, COVID-19 has <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3">killed 416 U.S. children</a> of the nearly 4.3 million infected since January 2020.</p>



<p>“Anything that kills more than 350 children a year is going to automatically rank in the top 10 causes” of childhood death, says Debbie-Ann Shirley, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at University of Virginia Health in Charlottesville.</p>



<p>While it’s a small fraction of the more than 600,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States, these numbers raise alarms for some health experts.</p>



<p>“Think about if 300 children had died over the past year from lightning strikes or from shark attacks,” says Taison Bell, a critical care and infectious diseases doctor who directs UVA Health’s medical intensive care unit. “We would be doing things a lot differently when it came to going to the beach or being outside when it was raining.”</p>



<p>Now, the number of <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%208.5%20FINAL.pdf">infections in kids is increasing</a>. From July 30 to August 5, there were 93,824 new COVID-19 cases in children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That&#8217;s up from  71,726 new cases in the last week of July, which nearly doubled the 38,654 cases from the previous week. And as infections rise, the number of hospitalizations and deaths will too. With millions of children infected, “even a small percentage adds up to tens of thousands of children being hospitalized for COVID-19,” Shirley says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Kid cases</h3>



<p>Overall, children have accounted for about 14 percent of COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. With the delta variant making inroads among unvaccinated people, cases in children are on the rise again. These data are from 49 states (Nebraska stopped reporting cases at the end of June), New York City, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam.</p>

<p>While many kids get away with no symptoms, or with only a few sniffles, for other children, being infected with the coronavirus is life-changing, Pavia said, “If your child is the one who ends up in the ICU for a week, or if your child develops long COVID and flunks out of a semester of school, and doesn’t get to college or loses their athletic scholarship, there’s nothing mild about that.”</p>



<h4>Serious consequences</h4>



<p>Roberta DeBiasi has seen her share of children who are really sick with COVID-19. At Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., where DeBiasi is the chief of pediatric infectious diseases, nearly 2,900 children have been treated for the disease. Of those, more than 550 were hospitalized, and 175 ended up in intensive care.</p>



<p>Nationwide, kids account for 1.3 percent to 3.5 percent of hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Like adults with serious cases of COVID-19, children who end up in the hospital tend to have underlying medical conditions, including obesity, respiratory or lung disease and neuromuscular diseases that make them more susceptible to severe illness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another 165 kids have been treated at Children’s National for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. That is a condition in which the immune system kicks up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-complications-inflammation-rare-cases">inflammation to such a degree that it can lead to organ failure</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/20</em>). It appears about four to six weeks after an infection with the coronavirus and can happen even in children who had mild cases or no symptoms initially.</p>



<p>There’s no good predictor of which children will develop the condition, DeBiasi says. “Even the sickest kids that are in the intensive care unit, there’s no way you would have said, ‘Oh, my child is at higher risk.’ It’s just a normal child. So that’s what makes it a little bit scary.”</p>



<p>Some medications that calm the immune system help, and many children seem to make full recoveries. But 37 children in the United States have died from the condition as of June 28. Doctors have known about the rare inflammatory condition for only a little over a year, and the long-term implications of MIS-C for children’s health are yet one more mystery to solve. DeBiasi and colleagues have launched <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04830852">a study</a> of the long-term effects of the syndrome.</p>



<p>The team is also looking at long COVID in kids. Long COVID can encompass a constellation of symptoms from exhaustion, shortness of breath after activity, loss of taste and smell, problems thinking and memory disturbances that persist for weeks or months. “Even if, overall, those symptoms seem mild, they do have an impact on your quality of life,” DeBiasi says. “If you’re in school and trying to learn, it’s not good to have memory disturbances.”</p>



<p>No one is quite sure how often long COVID strikes kids. DeBiasi’s new three-year study will track more than 1,000 children and young adults who have had COVID-19. Other children in the study participants’ households who didn’t have COVID-19 will be recruited as a control group.</p>



<p>In a study of children in the United Kingdom with COVID-19, the illness usually ran its course in about five to seven days, with younger kids getting better faster. But about 4 percent of children in the study <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIISS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext">still had symptoms a month after falling ill</a>, researchers report August 3 in the <em>Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</em>. That was more likely for adolescents 12- to 17-years-old than for 5- to 11-year-olds. Just under 2 percent of children still had symptoms two months into the illness, the researchers found.</p>



<p>In Switzerland, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782164">about 4 percent of 109 school</a>children who had antibodies indicating they’d previously had COVID-19 had one or more symptoms for at least 12 weeks after the initial illness, researchers reported July 15 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>In both studies, kids who had colds or other respiratory illnesses that weren’t COVID-19 sometimes also had symptoms lasting a month or more, suggesting that the coronavirus isn’t the only virus that can have lingering health effects.</p>



<p>How delta will affect children also remains to be seen. Children are now making up a slightly larger percentage of cases than with previous versions of the virus: 19 percent in the last week of July, up from just under 17 percent the week before. Over the entire course of the pandemic, children have accounted for 14.3 percent of all infections, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>



<p>But that rising share may be because children under 12 can’t be vaccinated yet, and only about 30 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. It doesn’t necessarily mean that children are more susceptible than adults to infection with the virus, they just remain vulnerable.</p>



<p>And though delta is more transmissible, it isn’t yet clear whether it causes more severe illness for children as it appears to for adults. Some doctors are reporting that kids infected with the delta variant are getting sicker. But at Children’s National, “we’re not seeing any difference in how sick the kids get or how often they end up hospitalized with the delta variant than any other,” DeBiasi says.</p>

</aside>



<p>But even if delta isn’t more dangerous for kids, there’s still basic math to consider: If many more children get sick because of the supercontagious variant, a greater number of kids could face severe or long-term illness.</p>



<p>Some U.S. kids get hit harder than others, regardless of the variant. <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Deaths-by-Race-and-Hispanic-Origin-Ages-0-18-Years/32c3-mvuz">Hispanic or Latino children account for 36 percent of child deaths</a> from COVID-19, even though only 18.5 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic or Latino. Black children are also overrepresented among child deaths from COVID-19. While 13.4 percent of the U.S. population is Black, about 22 percent of pediatric COVID-19 deaths were Black children.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders make up 0.2 percent of the U.S. population, but 1.4 percent of children who have died of COVID-19 and 1 percent of children with MIS-C come from that group.</p>



<p>Just as with adults, other severe consequences of the illness hit children of color harder too. <a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)00518-7/fulltext">Black and Latino children were overrepresented</a> among kids treated at Children’s National for MIS-C, DeBiasi and colleagues reported June 25 in the <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em>. Nationally, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mis/cases/index.html">62 percent</a> of the 4,196 children with confirmed cases of the rare syndrome were Black or Latino, and 60 percent were male.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Schools’ role</h4>



<p>So will going back to school — a move that many see as crucial to kids’ well-being and learning — make it that much harder to protect children from getting sick and to curb the spread of COVID-19?</p>



<p>Some people worry that as unvaccinated children return to in-person learning, they could catch COVID-19 from their peers and spread the virus to vulnerable adults. But evidence suggests that’s not a given.</p>



<p>Schools aren’t the culprit, says Susi Kriemler, an epidemiologist and pediatrician at the University of Zurich. “I’m a believer that most infections that affect children come from parents in the household,” she says. She and colleagues have collected data to back up that belief. They took blood samples from nearly 3,000 children at 55 schools in the canton of Zurich, looking for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 that would indicate a prior infection. Samples were collected in three rounds: June to July 2020, October to November 2020 and March to April 2021.</p>



<p>The team then looked for clusters of cases within classrooms that could indicate student-to-student spread. There was no evidence of student-to-student transmission within the classes, the researchers reported July 19 at medRxiv.org. Instead, any clusters of infections in schools <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.21260644v1">reflected the rates of COVID-19 being reported in the broader community.</a></p>



<p>That report hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists yet, but it echoes findings from a study of four schools in Orange County, Calif. There, one school had 97 percent of its students learning from home. That school had the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-021-01660-x">highest infection rate</a>, and it coincided with the highest community transmission rate, particularly during the winter surge in 2020, researchers reported July 24 in <em>Pediatric Research</em>. By contrast, another school had 93 percent in-person instruction with high rates of mask-wearing and less than half the community transmission rate of the first school. The in-person school had the lowest infection rate of the four.</p>



<p>But there are some caveats. The mostly in-person school spent about $1,400 per student upgrading the school and implementing anti-COVID measures, which many schools cannot afford. And all of those data were collected before the delta variant sent case counts soaring in many places.</p>



<p>On maps compiled by the CDC, much of the country is now tinted red, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_community">indicating high transmission rates with 100 or more people out of every 100,000</a> in an area testing positive for the coronavirus over the last seven days. Most of the rest of the country is orange, for substantial transmission, indicating 50 to 99 people out of every 100,000 getting infected in a seven-day period. Those high infection rates have <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/church-camp-covid-outbreak-new-breakthrough-cases/285-2a21d58c-a264-42ec-9897-7794f35759c8">spilled over into kids</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/us/illinois-summer-camp-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html">at summer camps</a>, and some campers brought the virus home, where it spread in their communities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Hot spots</h3>



<p>Back-to-school time is happening just as most of the United States has high or substantial levels of coronavirus transmission. Red counties are where there are more than 100 cases for every 100,000 people in the last seven days; orange counties have 50 to 99 cases for every 100,000 people in a seven-day period. This snapshot reflects the situation as of August 3. Under such conditions, everyone should wear masks when indoors in public places, especially in schools, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.</p>

<p>Camp horror stories won’t necessarily be repeated in schools, though. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">Air cleaning, air circulation and wearing masks</a> may cut down on the spread of even the delta variant (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>), though it’s unclear how widely such measures will be implemented in schools. The CDC recommends that everyone — kids, teachers, administrators, staff, visitors —<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic"> wear masks when in schools</a>, even if fully vaccinated (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).</p>



<p>Some places are starting school with mask mandates in place. Other states have banned schools from requiring the protective gear. A patchwork of policies elsewhere leaves it up to parents to decide whether their children should wear masks to school or get vaccinated when eligible.</p>



<p>Still, if everything is done correctly, schools don’t have to be COVID-19 hotbeds. As the researchers studying the four California schools wrote, “We speculate that even at times of high community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, schools can be among the healthiest places for children to be so long as the right mitigation strategies are in place.”</p>

                <p>Our paper on <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">A database and deep learning toolbox for noise-optimized, generalized spike inference from calcium imaging</a> is out now in Nature Neuroscience. It consists of a large and diverse ground truth database with simultaneous calcium imaging and juxtacellular recordings across almost 300 neurons. We used the database to train a supervised algorithm (&#8220;Cascade&#8221;) to infer spike rates from calcium imaging data.</p>



<p>If you are into calcium imaging, here are 5 reasons why you should use Cascade. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. You don&#8217;t have to install it</strong></p>



<p>You are not familiar with Python? Or you don&#8217;t want to install dependencies? No problem. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/Demo%20scripts/Calibrated_spike_inference_with_Cascade.ipynb">Click this link.</a> The link will bring you to an online interface where you can work with Cascade. You can upload your data (dF/F traces) as *.mat- or *.npy-files and download the results (inferred spike rates). Trying out the package is as quick as it can get. The online interface is a Google Colaboratory and therefore runs on servers provided by Google for free.</p>



<p>However, you can also install Cascade locally on your computer. Just go to the <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github page</a> and follow the installation instructions (tested on Ubuntu, Windows and Mac). This might be useful if you want to integrate spike inference into an existing workflow. People including myself have used Cascade together with CaImAn or Suite2p. You can use the dF/F output of these packages and apply the Cascade &#8220;predict&#8221; function as seen in the demo scripts. It&#8217;s a single-line addition of code to your pipeline.</p>



<p>Personally, I used Cascade with a GPU for the analyses in the paper. For daily work with calcium imaging recordings in mice (typically a few hours of recordings and a few hundreds of neurons), I run it on a computer without dedicated GPU because it&#8217;s fast enough on any reasonable CPU (seconds to minutes). Sometimes, I also use the online Colaboratory Notebook. The results are identical, whether I use a local installation or the Notebook, since the code is identical.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. You don&#8217;t have to tune parameters</strong></p>



<p>For each neuron from a data set, the algorithm automatically detects the noise level and chooses an appropriately trained model. The models are trained across many different conditions and indicators. This broadly trained model ideally generalizes to unseen data. Check out <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">Figure 3 in the paper</a> if you want to know more about the details.</p>



<p>To get started, you have to choose a model based on the frame rate of your recordings and on the temporal resolution that you want to achieve with spike inference. The FAQ, which can be found both on the <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github Readme</a> and at the end of the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/Demo%20scripts/Calibrated_spike_inference_with_Cascade.ipynb">Colab Notebook</a>, give you guidance if any doubts remain.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Estimate absolute spike rates</strong></p>



<p>Have you ever wondered whether a specific calcium transient corresponded to a single action potential or a burst of many action potentials? At least it would be nice to have some estimate of spike rates for a given recording. Cascade gives you this estimate.</p>



<p>The next question is a bit more tricky: how precise is that estimate? &#8211; It is as exact as it can get if you apply an algorithm to calcium imaging data where you do not have an associated ground truth. We have quantified this precision in the paper in terms of correlation (=variance explained), absolute errors and typical biases (see Figure 3 and Extended Data Figure 4). In the end, the typical errors depend on the data quality and noise levels. However, you should expect that the true spike rate might be as low as 0.5 times or as high as 2.0 times the spike rate estimated by Cascade. On average across neurons, the error will be lower. This is not single-spike precision, but, as bad as it sounds, this is as good as it gets. The imprecision is, among other things, due to the unpredictable heterogeneity of the spike-calcium-relationship across neurons.</p>



<p>However, absolute estimates with a certain imprecision, which you get from Cascade, are still better than results that do not have an immediate meaning (dF/F scores).</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong></strong><strong>4. Improve temporal precision</strong></p>



<p>Spike inference, also referred to as temporal &#8220;deconvolution&#8221; of calcium recordings, improves the temporal resolution by getting rid of the slow calcium transient. The slower the calcium transient, the more pronounced the improvement of deconvolution. And, yes, the algorithm generalizes well across short and long time constants.</p>



<p>Applications where I have used Cascade myself to achieve improved temporal resolution:</p>



<p>a) Detection of fast sequences on a sub-second time scale (check out <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">Figure 5e in our toolbox paper</a>)</p>



<p>b) Detection of swimming-locked neuronal activity in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">head-fixed adult zebrafish</a>. Adult zebrafish move on a sub-second time scale, faster than the calcium indicators we used in their brains at room temperature. </p>



<p>c) Locking of neuronal activity to oscillations in the hippocampus (ongoing work, not yet published).</p>



<p>If your observations are masked by slow indicator transients, give it a shot and try out Cascade.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><strong>De-noise your recordings</strong></p>



<p>When I used Cascade for the first time, I was surprised how well it de-noised recordings. The <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">Cascade paper</a> is full of examples where this is validated with ground truth.</p>



<p>Or, have a look at the spike rate predictions for the Allen Brain Observatory data set (Figure 6b,f,g,h; Extended Data Figure 10). Shot noise is removed, and slower transients due to movement artifacts are rejected. The algorithm simply has learned very well how an action potential looks like.</p>

<p>One of the most striking examples, however, was when we tested the effect of Cascade on population imaging analyses (Supplementary Figure 11, the only figure not yet included in the preprint). To this end, we used NAOMi to simulate neuronal population patterns and analyzed how well the correlations between neuron pairs were predicted from dF/F traces (red) or from spike rates inferred with Cascade (blue). For dF/F traces, correlations were often overestimated (among other reasons due to slow calcium transients) and underestimated (due to overwhelming noise). Pairwise correlation computed from Cascade&#8217;s spike rates are simply closer to the true correlations.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to get the best out of your 2P calcium imaging data, I would recommend to use Cascade. The result is simply closer to the true neuronal activity.</p>

<p><strong>This plastic will self-destruct</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/plastic-will-self-destruct">Science News</a>,</em>&nbsp;August 7, 1971</p>



<p>Public indignation over litter and garbage has caused industry to ask chemists whether self-destroying, or quickly degradable, plastics might be devised to replace indestructible … glass, aluminum and plastics, which comprise the largest segment of consumer waste.… [Chemist James] Guillet and his team … devised a self-destroying plastic that is about ready for marketing — a wrapping paper that disintegrates in about a month.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Guillet’s work on polymers that degrade via light helped pave the way for their wider commercial use. But these materials may have created more problems than they solved. Most plastics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">wind up in landfills</a> where the materials don’t get enough light to degrade as intended (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>). Plastics that do break down turn into microscopic pieces that can wind up in ecosystems and harm animals. Scientists are trying to make more eco-friendly plastics, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-compost-new-enzyme-technique-biodegradable">compostable plastics</a> that can be totally broken down with enzymes (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 5</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">What science tells us about reducing coronavirus spread from wind instruments</a></h4>

              
                <p>The last time I played clarinet with my band was on March 10, 2020. It was a typical Tuesday evening rehearsal: About 10 musicians crowded into a small basement room, sipping beers and chatting between tunes. Brass instruments, woodwinds and drums blared, with bass lines audible from the stairwell.</p>



<p>Since 2004, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra has practiced in the same space, a couple of blocks from the East River in Brooklyn, N.Y. The room is cramped — chairs and music stands crowd every corner, shelves are crammed with instruments and sheet music. With no windows or AC units, air circulation is minimal.</p>



<p>When I walked up the stairs after practice, I had no idea that the space we’d filled with boisterous pop covers and protest tunes would sit quiet for more than a year. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in March 2020, isolating musicians like me from the art we love. Millions of high school and college musicians were barred from their band rooms, children’s lessons were canceled and professionals lost performance opportunities and income streams.</p>

<p>Though restrictions are now easing, we still face questions about how our instruments play into infection risk. Wind instruments — brasses as well as woodwinds like my clarinet — produce sound through human breath. And human breath spreads COVID-19. So how can we perform while keeping ourselves and our audiences safe, during the pandemic and beyond? To find answers, wind musicians, including myself, turned to science.</p>



<h4>An ill wind</h4>



<p>The hazards of live music hit home when <a href="https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-superspreader-singing.html">news broke</a> of a superspreader event among members of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington state. On March 10 — the same day as my band’s final rehearsal — 61 members had gathered to sing. By the time Gov. Jay Inslee instituted a stay-at-home order two weeks later, 52 members of the choir had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or were assumed to have it. Three singers were hospitalized, and two died.</p>



<p>The group had been careful, avoiding physical contact such as handshakes and hugs, putting plenty of space between their chairs and using hand sanitizer. At that time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health agencies were primarily telling people to avoid close contact and contaminated surfaces to reduce transmission risks. But many musicians quickly realized that something else was going on.</p>



<p>“When we saw the Skagit Valley choir spread, we knew right away that [the coronavirus] was spreading via aerosol,” says Mark Spede, director of bands at Clemson University in South Carolina. He is one of the lead researchers on a coalition that developed COVID-19 protocols for performing arts students. It was “pretty clear,” he says, that the virus was spreading through the air. On May 15, 2020, Skagit County health department staff reported in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm">the “act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission</a> through emission of aerosols.”</p>



<p>I quickly realized that wind instruments like mine had to pose a similar danger. To play it safe, most wind musicians stopped playing together. My band briefly entertained the idea of practicing outside, but as New York City shut down, we switched to virtual rehearsals. These meetings were a poor substitute for in-person sessions. As anyone who’s tried to sing “Happy Birthday” over Zoom can tell you, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-call-zoom-pandemic-popularity-phone-tech-history">videocalling platforms</a> just don’t cut it for music practice. These platforms are built to highlight one speaker at a time, creating a painful lag in sound when people try to sing or play simultaneously (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>“School band shut down,” recalls 16-year-old Hannah Scheuer, a bandmate of mine and a student in the New York City public school system. Unable to enter the school building for months, classmates who rented instruments from the school couldn’t bring them home to practice. A survey conducted in late April by Spede and colleagues revealed that out of 30,000 U.S. high school and college music programs, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/4701205/draft-30-assessing-the-risk-of-music-activities-during-covid.pdf">about one-third had no in-person rehearsals</a> through the end of the 2020–2021 school year.</p>

<h4>Musicians in studies</h4>



<p>Facing a lockdown without the camaraderie of rehearsals, musicians wanted answers about the risks their instruments might pose in spreading COVID-19. Some went as far as becoming study subjects to find out.</p>



<p>The Minneapolis-based Minnesota Orchestra, for instance, reached out to Jiarong Hong, a mechanical engineer at the nearby University of Minnesota. A <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/new-study-explores-how-coronavirus-travels-indoors">July 2020 release of his study on indoor transmission of the coronavirus</a> had drawn media attention; the study was later <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301476">published</a> in the January 2021 <em>Journal of Aerosol Science</em>. Catching wind of this work, the orchestra asked Hong and colleagues to “provide scientifically driven guidelines to help them get back to their work safely,” Hong says. His lab set up experiments with the musicians, which led to one of the first studies on the subject.</p>



<p>Engineer Lia Becher at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar in Germany had an experience similar to Hong’s. When a colleague’s video demonstrating how air spreads after a cough went viral, musicians asked Becher and her lab group how air would spread out of their instruments. So she worked with local musicians to meticulously track the dispersion of air from instruments with mouthpieces.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Spede and James Weaver, director of performing arts and sports for the National Federation of State High School Associations in Indianapolis, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/articles/unprecedented-international-coalition-led-by-performing-arts-organizations-to-commission-covid-19-study/">convened a group of concerned music teachers and arts organizations</a>. They worked with mechanical engineers at the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Maryland in College Park to study the risks posed by different performance activities, in the hopes of bringing students back to classrooms for fall 2020.</p>



<p>These studies and others like them fall into two categories, notes Juliette O’Keeffe, an environmental health scientist at the National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health in Vancouver. Some, she explains, visualize the air coming out of an instrument (a qualitative method), while others measure properties of the air particles that emerge, such as size, concentration and distance traveled (a quantitative method). O’Keeffe conducted a <a href="https://ncceh.ca/sites/default/files/COVID-19 Risks and precautions for the performing arts.pdf">review of studies that examined aerosols emitted from instruments</a> and she posted her findings on her institution’s website on September 23, 2020.</p>



<p>Becher and colleagues employed qualitative methods, visualizing the air with a special mirror called a schlieren mirror. Using the temperature and pressure differences between static air and exhaled air, the mirror turns air patterns into visual light patterns. Videos produced by Becher’s team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEJhHf-zpHE&amp;list=PL9DGkx-EA5-EiKNMBeVVwFzuukZHvpEmm&amp;index=2">show exactly how air comes out of different instruments</a>, in what looks like roiling puffs of smoke.</p>

</div><figcaption><br>When a musician blows into their instrument, air particles escape through the instrument and the musician’s mouth. In these three clips, a schlieren mirror visualizes, via temperature and pressure change, how particles escape a flute, a trumpet, and a bass clarinet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hong’s lab followed quantitative methods, <a href="https://tsi.com/products/particle-sizers/particle-size-spectrometers/aerodynamic-particle-sizer-(aps)-spectrometer-3321/">using an aerodynamic particle sizer</a> — a special spectrometer that measures the diameters of tiny particles. These instruments can determine the sizes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">aerosols that may spread the coronavirus</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>Spede and Weaver’s collaborators used both quantitative and qualitative methods. This included the schlieren mirror and measurements taken in a dedicated aerosol testing room with a ventilation system that allows engineers to isolate the aerosols that emerged from the various instruments.</p>



<h4>Which winds pose the highest risks?</h4>



<p>For singers, all air comes directly out of the windpipe. But for wind musicians, once the air leaves the windpipe, its travel pattern depends on the instrument.</p>



<p>Hong’s team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301555">measured these patterns with musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra</a>. The study’s findings, which he also published in the January 2021 <em>Journal of Aerosol Science</em>, measured risk by comparing the size and concentration of air particles dispersed by musicians with those emitted when a person speaks. Tubas were lowest risk, producing fewer particles than a person speaking. Flutes, French horns and larger woodwinds released similar levels of aerosols as a speaking person. Oboes, trombones and especially trumpets were all higher risk, spreading more aerosols than a person speaking.</p>



<p>Hong’s research provides specific aerosol sizes and concentration measurements for individual instruments. But this work, like other studies in this field, used very small sample sizes of one or two musicians to characterize an instrument’s air dispersion.</p>

<p>Such a small sample size can be particularly challenging when investigating woodwinds. While brass instruments are easy to evaluate, because all air goes straight from the mouthpiece to the bell, woodwinds get complicated. When I play my clarinet, aerosols have several escape routes: the flared opening at the instrument’s end, the keyholes and the space where my lips meet the reed — the thin piece of wood that vibrates against the clarinet’s mouthpiece to create sound. What’s more, small differences between clarinet players’ techniques can have a big impact on the speeds and concentrations of aerosols that players release.</p>



<p>In one trial by Hong’s team, one clarinet player produced five times as many aerosols as a second clarinet player. Hong hypothesizes that this difference is because one player used a “harder” clarinet reed, typically used by more experienced musicians. This reed is stiffer and requires more air to produce a sound. The way a clarinet player positions her mouth around her instrument may also affect aerosol generation, Hong explains.</p>



<p>Like Hong’s research, Becher’s work and preliminary findings from Spede and Weaver’s studies suggest that trumpets, trombones, clarinets and oboes spread more aerosols farther out into performance spaces, while larger instruments, particularly tubas, pose lower risks. The long, circuitous tubes in larger instruments trap breath-propelled particles and reduce the speed of those that do escape — in other words, you’re less likely to catch COVID-19 if you stand in front of a tuba player than if you stick your head into a tuba’s bell.</p>



<p>Although more research is needed, current studies nonetheless suggest that in most cases playing a wind instrument is about as likely (or even less likely) to transmit the coronavirus as loud talking or singing. The air is just traveling through your instrument’s tubing, rather than going straight out of your mouth. And there are ways to reduce risk.</p>





<h4>Safety tips</h4>



<p>While Hong, Becher and other scientists researched particle dispersion from wind instruments, music nonetheless returned to the streets of New York in summer 2020, with many musicians inspired to support Black Lives Matter protests across the city. Eager to join the movement, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra began looking at studies, deliberating how to be safe. I and three other science-minded performers formed a COVID-19 committee.</p>



<p>Evaluating the literature was tricky. In an August 2020 e-mail exchange, committee member Phil Andrews sent the band a preprint from medRxiv.org, which <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165837v1?fbclid=IwAR3fRbIH_K1NbzThfPR2Eje4t4iA-kQPMr1O0ZAe_tbI2vH5LHwqK5i0L0A">suggested that fabric covers be stretched over brass instruments’ bells</a> — the flared openings through which sound emerges. I wrote back with caution, noting that the study included only eight participants. Everything seemed preliminary, and because many of our bandmates have health conditions or families to look after, we opted for more caution. Until we knew more, we’d play only percussion instruments — outside.</p>



<p>Other musicians I spoke with remembered scouring the CDC’s website for any mention of wind instruments and carefully reading preprints in subjects that they had never studied. Benjamin Yates, a trombone instructor at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette, recalls an instance of intense research over the summer: “I was sitting at my computer and I had all these tabs open, and I’m looking up really basic terms, like ventilation — what does ventilation actually mean, scientifically?”</p>



<p>Yates’ and my efforts to align group practices with scientific recommendations reflected a broader trend across the nation to find safe ways to play music. While some musicians opted to stay in lockdown, others moved rehearsals and performances outside, often using makeshift bell covers or musician masks with space for a mouthpiece. A mask with a hole in it might seem odd, but research led by Spede and Weaver shows that these masks reduce aerosol spread from the sides of musicians’ mouths as they blow into their instruments. This is especially key for younger musicians who have less control over their mouth positioning.</p>



<p>Formulating safe strategies for musicians became especially important as U.S. school programs prepared for the 2020 fall semester. For Spede and Weaver, time was ticking on their project to build guidelines for student musicians. Preliminary investigations by engineers at the Universities of Colorado and Maryland provided the information they needed. This study, which included <a href="https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/hq37vp75r">12 performers playing nine different instruments</a>, was published as a preprint on the University of Colorado’s website in April 2021. Before publication, however, Spede and Weaver’s team used the findings to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u46GJAnpZ7k">devise detailed risk mitigation guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the 2020–2021 school year, Spede and Weaver <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/4701205/draft-30-assessing-the-risk-of-music-activities-during-covid.pdf">surveyed U.S. high school and college music programs</a>. Of 3,000 programs that responded, about 2,800 reported using some or all of the guidelines for bands, choirs or orchestras. Among those schools that responded, coronavirus spread was almost nonexistent. Eight programs each reported a case of coronavirus spread between musicians: five in choirs, two in bands and one in an orchestra. Seven of the eight cases involved one person infecting a single other person; two of the cases occurred at schools that did not use any of the recommended safety guidelines.</p>



<p>“With hundreds or thousands of hours of rehearsal and millions of people participating,” Weaver says, “the fact that we’ve had [so few] cases of spread, we’re pretty confident in the mitigations.” Spede and Weaver believe these protocols could be useful beyond the pandemic, for instance, during cold and flu seasons and other infectious disease outbreaks.</p>



<p>In addition to Spede and Weaver’s guidelines, musicians may consider reorganizing where they sit onstage. A modeling study by researchers at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, based on Hong’s measurements, suggests that moving percussion instruments toward the center of the stage and putting the highest-risk winds near vents that pull air from the room can cut aerosol accumulation. The Utah Symphony, which collaborated with the University of Utah researchers on this study, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-musicians-relocating-reduce-risk-concerts">adopted this recommendation</a> for its spring 2021 concert season (<em>SN Online: 6/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>O’Keeffe also suggests that musicians monitor COVID-19 transmission rates in their communities, so they know the likelihood that a person with COVID-19 is present. Disease-tracking metrics used by the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, R.I., indicate that more than <a href="https://globalepidemics.org/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression/">10 new cases a day for every 100,000 people</a> in a region constitutes higher risk. Musicians may feel safer, too, when more than 70 percent of their community is fully vaccinated, adopting the vaccination goal from the White House COVID-19 task force.</p>



<h4>An industry transformed</h4>



<p>When I asked musicians how COVID-19 changed their musical activity, their answers reflected both the economic and emotional fallout of last spring’s lockdowns.</p>



<p>“Before COVID, I was working at my [former] high school as a school aide while giving lessons there as well,” says Elijah Herring, a saxophone student who graduated from New York’s Brooklyn College this spring. “Because the school system closed down, I lost my job. I wasn’t able to get unemployment benefits until June or July.… I had to street perform to make ends meet, to pay bills, to take care of my mom.”</p>



<p>In the short term, COVID-19 was a blow to the music world. Musicians lost income as well as motivation to practice or compose; some left the industry altogether. But in the long term, the pandemic has transformed how many musicians think about their profession.</p>



<p>“Music is a privilege,” says Orion White, a saxophone student at the University of Idaho in Moscow. “It’s something that really sticks with you; it changes you. It can be almost religious if you let it be, and I took that for granted. Not anymore.”</p>



<p>This sentiment is heightened by the layers of added challenge needed to play — any performance, group practice or even informal jam session now requires intensive safety and trust. Before they can start playing, musicians must trust each other with their vaccination status and other health information. I’ve led discussions in my own band, developing practice guidelines that incorporate health needs and risk comfort levels.</p>

<p>Audiences seem to acknowledge the effort that goes into performing. Andrews and Herring both say that they’re getting more money from busking now than they did before the pandemic.</p>



<p>The Rude Mechanical Orchestra had our first pandemic practice that included wind instruments on May 18 this year. We gathered outside, by the river, a few blocks away from our old basement practice space.</p>



<p>We had agreed to strict guidelines — all wind players had to be fully vaccinated, with masks and bell covers on. So only four people opted to play a wind instrument. Still, a tuba, two trombones, a clarinet and a lot of percussion was enough to bring melodies to life. We played through some of our classic tunes, pausing to talk through song structure and enjoy the breeze.</p>



<p>At one point, a small girl with a loose ponytail approached us and began dancing to the music. She didn’t know that we were out of practice or that half of the drummers were trained in other instruments. But her dance echoed our joy in being back together.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squirrel-jump-leap-tree-branch-parkour-tricks">Squirrels use parkour tricks when leaping from branch to branch</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkour enthusiasts need look no further than up in the trees for inspiration. Squirrels’ aerial acrobatics make the rodents masters of the form, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A detailed look at how squirrels navigate narrow branches that bend and sway with the wind — where the smallest error could spell death — shows that the rodents make split-second calculations to balance trade-offs between branch bendiness and the distance between tree limbs. And for particularly tricky jumps, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe5753">squirrels improvise parkour-style moves</a> in midair to stick the landing, researchers report in the Aug. 6 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>This study is “a great example of how cool ‘normal’ animals can be in their biomechanics,” says Michelle Graham, a graduate student in biomechanics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who was not involved with the research. “We’ve all seen squirrels do crazy stuff in nature, but no one ever pays any attention to it.”</p>



<p>That is unless you’re like Nathaniel Hunt, who has been mesmerized by watching squirrels flash through the overstory since graduate school. “Tree canopies are incredibly challenging environments to navigate,” says Hunt, an integrative biologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha. When jumping between bendy branches, a squirrel must assess how far it has to jump and know when to leap. Jump too early and the squirrel will fall short. Too late, and the squirrel will find itself on a branch too flimsy from which to launch. Hunt wondered, “How are they sensitive to that trade-off, managing to make accurate leaps?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>To find out, he and his colleagues designed an artificial forest obstacle course on the outskirts of the University of California, Berkeley campus. Then, the team used peanuts to coax free-ranging <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-name-66-species-potential-biodiversity-threats-eu">fox squirrels</a> (<em>Sciurus niger</em>) into running and jumping through a series of acrobatic tests (<em>SN: 1/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>First, the unwitting subjects learned to leap from artificial branches of high, medium or low stiffness across a gap to reach a prize: a basket of peanuts at the end of a landing peg. High-speed video captured details of the jumps, from launch point to landing accuracy, for 12 squirrels spanning 96 leaping trials.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the squirrels leaped from more bendy branches earlier — presumably to maximize jumping force — even though that increased the distance that the animals must clear, Hunt says. By comparing what the squirrels actually did with statistical models that simulated optimal jumping decisions, the researchers found something interesting: Branch flexibility had about six times as great an influence on when squirrels decided to jump as did the length of the gap. If squirrels had cared more about distance, they’d have jumped from about the same spot on the rod, regardless of its give. “We were surprised to see squirrels weighing both of these things simultaneously, but in different amounts,” Hunt says.</p>



<p>The researchers upped the ante for five squirrels by increasing the flexibility of branches as well as gap distance. Initial leaps were less than graceful. No squirrels fell, but most landed clunkily at first, grasping the peg they leaped to with their front paws and swinging around to pull themselves up instead of landing neatly on all fours. But within five trials, “squirrels learned to compensate for their initial error,” Hunt says, which they did by modifying their initial velocity.</p>

</div><figcaption>To better understand how squirrels leap from tree branch to tree branch without falling, researchers trained free-roaming squirrels to jump through a series of tests in an artificial forest obstacle course. High-speed camera footage showed that these rodents can learn to stick landings in just a few jumps, and that squirrels consider both branch bendiness and distance when deciding to leap from a limb.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If squirrels regularly encounter the same branches, such quick learning “might explain how they move so fluidly and rapidly” across particular branches, Hunt explains. The rodents might be such quick navigators, he says, because “they’ve already learned what they need to know about that branch.”</p>



<p>The squirrels surprised the researchers in other ways too. For longer jumps, or those that necessitated landing higher or lower than the starting point, many squirrels rotated midair, using their legs to “jump” off an adjacent vertical wall in a parkour-style maneuver. More often than not, squirrels employed parkour to slow down if they were coming in too hot to a landing. “It’s an additional point of control,” Hunt says.</p>



<p>For many arboreal animals, “jumping between limbs is such a common thing, and yet we so frequently only study it in pieces,” Graham says, such as looking just at the launch but not the landing. This study&#8217;s holistic look reveals “something really interesting about squirrels, that they take greater account of [branch bendiness] than the gap distance,” she notes. “I don’t know that I would’ve guessed that.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The world is full of fascinating opportunities to learn. But with so many different topics for children to explore, why do they pick certain paths? In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621994230">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science, </em>a team from Rutgers University looks closely at what drives children’s curiosity. They find that children are motivated to learn more about a topic when there is a gap in their knowledge that they want to fill. The results suggest that for young children there is a sweet spot for learning, when they already know enough to find a topic interesting, but not so much that it becomes boring.</p>



<span id="more-43143"></span>



<p>In the first study, fifty children aged around five years old were assessed on their existing knowledge in three areas: biological transmission of illness, psychosomatic events, and theory of mind (understanding other people’s mental states). In the biological transmission domain, for example, children heard stories about a character who sneezed, and were asked whether a friend would also catch the illness, while in the psychosomatic domain they were asked if somebody’s cheeks could redden from embarrassment.</p>



<p>Next, participants were presented with choose your own adventure stories, where a character experienced a similar event to the one given in the knowledge assessment task and one that was irrelevant and unrelated. Participants then selected which event they wanted to hear the end of. In the biological transmission scenario, for example, participants read that a character had played with a friend with a cold. At the end of the story, the children were asked if they wanted to find out whether the character had picked up the cold or, instead, what he had for breakfast.</p>



<p>Based on their responses to the initial questions, children were classified as having either “mature” or “immature” levels of knowledge for each of the three areas. The team found that those with more knowledge showed no particular preference for either scenario when reading the story, but those with <em>immature</em> theories were more likely to select the ending that was related to the first part of the study.</p>



<p>This could be because the ending related to the first set of scenarios offered the children a chance to learn something new after their interest was initially piqued, the team suggests. Those who had a more mature understanding of the initial scenarios may have already known &#8220;too much&#8221; about them to find them particularly compelling, or were already certain enough about their knowledge to not feel the need to explore further.</p>



<p>The results were replicated in a second study, in which just 58% of children with mature theories chose the story ending related to the first part of the study, compared to 68% of those with immature theories (though the difference here was not significant). Interestingly, children who were in neither category, and instead were in an in-between group, transitioning from immature to mature theories, were far more likely to choose this option: 80% of children in this group selected the ending more closely related to the initial scenarios.</p>



<p>The results suggest that children use uncertainty when deciding what to learn about, the team says. When children are uncertain about things, they seek more information to resolve that uncertainty. This in turn informs their learning (and may go some way to explain why children often ask endless “Why?” questions).</p>



<p>The findings could help parents and teachers encourage children to learn more about particular topics, providing them with more information when they are at an intermediate stage of curiosity. Looking out for this particular knowledge gap, when interest is piqued, could be the starting point for further learning.</p>

                <p>At every moment, subatomic particles stream in unfathomable numbers through your body. Each second, about 100 billion neutrinos from the sun pass through your thumbnail, and you’re bathed in a rain of muons, birthed in Earth’s atmosphere. Even humble bananas emit positrons, the electron’s antimatter counterpart. A whole universe of particles exists, and we are mostly oblivious, largely because these particles are invisible.</p>

<p>When I first learned, as a teenager, that this untold world of particles existed, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And when I thought about it, I could barely breathe. I was, to steal a metaphor from writer David Foster Wallace, a fish who has only just noticed she’s swimming in water. The revelation that we’re stewing in a particle soup is why I went on to study physics, and eventually, to write about it.</p>



<p>To truly fathom matter at its most fundamental level, people must be able to visualize this hidden world. That’s where particle detectors come in. They spot traces of the universe’s most minuscule constituents, making these intangible concepts real. What’s more, particle detectors reveal beauty: Particles leave behind graceful spirals of bubbles, flashes of light and crisp lines of sparks.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="960" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner.jpg" alt="Renee Jones measures particle tracks on a cloud chamber scan" class="wp-image-3101218" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner-271x383.jpg 271w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner-319x450.jpg 319w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner-132x186.jpg 132w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner-411x580.jpg 411w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_feamale-scanner-550x776.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101218">Tracks from bubble chambers and cloud chambers typically had to be inspected by eye.

<p>As a physics student, I spent hours examining these stunning pictures in my textbooks. I went on to build particle detectors in graduate school, and to make my own images of particles wending their way through our world.</p>



<p>As a particle moves through a material, it drops bread crumbs that can give away its path. Those bread crumbs come in a variety of forms: light, heat or electric charge. “Basically, every particle detector that exists is looking for one or more of those three things,” says particle physicist Jennifer Raaf of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. Particle detectors translate the bread crumbs into signals that can be recorded and analyzed. Such signals helped reveal the physics of the standard model, a crowning achievement of science that describes the particles and forces of nature. They’re also likely to be key in the discovery of physics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">beyond the standard model</a>.</p>





<p>As time has passed, technologies for detecting particles have vastly improved. Here are a few types of detectors that have made the invisible visible.</p>





<h4>Through a cloud</h4>



<p>One of the first ways scientists visualized particle tracks was with cloud chambers. Developed more than a century ago, cloud chambers are filled with a gas — often a vapor of alcohol — on the verge of condensing into liquid. When a charged particle passes through the chamber, it strips electrons from the air within, creating an electric charge that initiates condensation. A wispy line forms along the particle’s path, like a miniature contrail.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="456" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-456x450.jpg" alt="black and white image of positron particle track" class="wp-image-3101228" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-456x450.jpg 456w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-388x383.jpg 388w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-188x186.jpg 188w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-588x580.jpg 588w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101228">A particle track in a cloud chamber in the early 1930s was the first evidence of a positron, a positively charged particle with the mass of an electron.&nbsp;The track is curved due to a magnetic field that surrounded the chamber.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101228">C. D. Anderson, courtesy of Emilio Segrè Visual Archives</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Scientists often surround cloud chambers and other detectors with a strong magnetic field, which bends particles’ paths into curves or spirals. Negatively charged particles curve in one direction, positive particles go the opposite way. Other details further characterize the particle: The amount of curvature indicates a particle’s momentum, for example.</p>



<p>Cloud chambers revealed a variety of previously unknown particles, including the positron and the muon, a heavy cousin of the electron, in the 1930s. These particles were mostly unexpected. At the time, physicists were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">barely coming to grips</a> with the fact that particles besides electrons and protons existed.</p>



<p>Cloud chambers are simple enough that you can <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/how-make-your-own-cloud-chamber">make one in your own home</a>, using alcohol and dry ice.</p>

<h4>Bubble trails</h4>



<p>The 1950s were all about bubble chambers.</p>



<p>When charged particles pass through liquid in a bubble chamber, they leave tiny vapor bubbles, like iridescent orbs trailing a soap bubble wand. Although the chambers are typically filled with liquid hydrogen, a variety of liquids can be used; one early prototype even used beer. Bubble chambers could be made bigger than cloud chambers, and produced sharper tracks, making it possible to observe more particles in more detail.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks.jpg" alt="black and white image of a kaon particle track" class="wp-image-3101220" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101220">A subatomic particle called a kaon decays into other particles that leave distinct spirals in this bubble chamber image from the 1970s.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101220">CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the same decade, particle accelerators came to the fore. These accelerators produce energetic beams of particles that scientists can crash into other particles or into targets. Those collisions whip up a flurry of new particles. Scientists sent those beams into bubble chambers to watch what happened.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector.jpg" alt="black and white image of the Big European Bubble Chamber" class="wp-image-3101219" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101219">The Big European Bubble Chamber, pictured during installation of the vessel, started up at CERN near Geneva in 1973.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101219">CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The resulting images were not only scientifically illuminating, they were stunning: If Raaf were going to get a tattoo, she says, it might be a bubble chamber image. I’ve so far resisted the temptation to get ink.</p>



<h4>Going digital</h4>



<p>Cloud chambers and bubble chambers had a drawback. Tracks were typically recorded with photographs, and each had to be inspected by eye for anything of interest. That process was too slow; it held physicists back from discovering the particles that might show up in only one or two out of myriad photographs, if that. To find the rarest of particles, “you can’t really be looking at pictures. You want to have that information digitized in a smart way,” says Sam Zeller, a particle physicist at Fermilab.</p>

Kalmus, UA1 Experiment/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enter the multiwire proportional chamber. Invented in 1968, this technology relies on a fine array of high-voltage wires, which record charge produced when incoming particles dislodge electrons from atoms in a gas-filled chamber. This technique could capture millions of particle tracks per second, much more than bubble chambers could achieve. And the data went directly to a computer for analysis. Multiwire proportional chambers and their descendants revolutionized particle physics, and led to discoveries of particles such as the charm quark and the gluon in the 1970s, and the W and&nbsp;Z bosons in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Some of the most advanced modern detectors trace their lineage back to multiwire proportional chambers, such as liquid argon time projection chambers. These detectors are high-resolution, meaning that researchers can zoom in on the details of an interaction and visualize it in 3-D. Liquid argon time projection chambers will be key to one of the biggest upcoming particle physics experiments in the United States, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in South Dakota. Because neutrinos very rarely interact with matter, the experiment demands such advanced detection techniques.</p>



<h4>Shining a light</h4>



<p>Scientists have also devised methods to detect particles via light. When a particle moves above a certain speed limit for a given material, it emits light, known as Cherenkov light. It’s analogous to an airplane passing the sound-speed barrier and creating a sonic boom. Charged particles can also emit light when passing through materials laced with certain chemicals, called scintillators.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2.jpg" alt="image of neutrino data from the NOvA experiment" class="wp-image-3101217" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101217">The NOvA experiment at Fermilab uses tubes of liquid scintillator to spot neutrinos interacting inside the detector.

<p>To spot the small amounts of light left behind by individual particles, scientists use photomultiplier tubes, originally invented in the 1930s, which convert light into electrical signals. These tubes could be used to pick up either Cherenkov light or scintillator light.</p>



<p>Scintillator detectors began to prove their worth in 1956 when a tank of liquid scintillator was used to discover the neutrino — once thought to be entirely undetectable. Liquid scintillator detectors are still common — used in the NOvA neutrino experiment at Fermilab, for example — as are detectors made of solid plastic strips with scintillator mixed in.</p>

<h4>Putting it all together</h4>



<p>Modern detectors at the world’s major particle colliders, like the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, throw in a bit of everything. “It’s this onion of different types of detectors; every layer is a different thing,” Raaf says. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector.jpg" alt="image of a detector from the CMS experiment" class="wp-image-3101225" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101225">Modern detectors at particle colliders, such as the CMS experiment (shown) at CERN, pack in an assortment of technologies to spot the spray of particles from high-energy collisions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101225">Maximilien Brice/CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Standing multiple stories tall, these massive machines include an assortment of technologies — plastic scintillator detectors, Cherenkov detectors, descendants of multiwire proportional chambers. They also typically include detectors made from silicon that can precisely measure particle tracks based on small electric currents produced when particle pass through. These detectors all work in concert within a very strong magnet. After particles collide at the center of the detector, computers crunch the data from all the parts and reconstruct what happened in the collision, tracing out the paths the particles took.</p>



<p>No matter the technique, the mesmerizing subatomic hieroglyphs allow physicists to decipher the native language of matter, unveiling its constituents and the forces by which they communicate. “It’s pretty amazing that you can see the invisible,” says Zeller.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-lunar-magnetic-field-short-time-space">A lunar magnetic field may have lasted for only a short time</a></h4>

              
                <p>A lunar magnetic field may not have just been short-lived; it may have persisted for only a blip in geologic time, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Shortly after the moon formed about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-still-old">4.5 billion years ago</a>, it may have begun generating a magnetic field, a protective sheath that can deflect away charged particles from the sun (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>). Now, analyses of moon rocks suggest that any lunar magnetic field was gone by <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi7647">at least 4 billion years</a> ago, researchers report August 4 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Magnetized lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts decades ago were the first indication that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-moon-got-its-magnetism">the moon may have once had an internal dynamo</a>, in which molten, iron-rich rock swirls inside the core of a celestial body, giving rise to a magnetic field (<em>SN: 11/9/11</em>). But how long such a lunar dynamo may have lasted has been unclear.</p>



<p>The moon’s core is “really small,” says John Tarduno, a geophysicist at the University of Rochester in New York, and it’s not clear how that core could have sustained a dynamo for long before cooling.</p>





<p>In the new study, Tarduno and colleagues examined the magnetization of a handful of Apollo rock samples. Analyzing the magnetism of tiny shards of metal trapped in crystals in rock dating to 3.9 billion, 3.6 billion, 3.3 billion and 3.2 billion years ago showed that those rocks were barely magnetized at all.</p>



<p>But the analyses also found that a piece of lunar glass formed during a meteorite impact about 2 million years ago “had a strong magnetic field — just a little weaker than Earth’s today,” Tarduno says. That’s odd, because “everyone agrees there isn’t a magnetic field on the moon now, and there wasn’t one 2 million years ago,” he says. “How does this happen?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="516" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1.png" alt="piece of impact glass" class="wp-image-3102247" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-505x383.png 505w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-593x450.png 593w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-245x186.png 245w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102247">Researchers found strong magnetization in a bit of impact glass (similar to the glass shown) that formed during the collision of a meteorite with the lunar surface just 2 million years ago. That magnetization, the team suggests, came not from a magnetic field generated by the moon’s core, but from the force of the meteorite impact.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102247">Rory Cottrell</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taken together, these findings point to one conclusion, the team says: that the moon hasn’t generated a magnetic field for at least 4 billion years. The magnetization of the bit of glass happened due to the meteorite impact that also formed the glass itself, Tarduno and colleagues suggest.</p>



<p>That idea — that a meteorite impact can produce strong magnetization in rocks — is one that’s been discussed in many scientific studies in the past, Tarduno says. As the meteorite punches into the lunar surface at superfast speeds, that impact can partially ionize particles on the surface, creating a thick magnetized plasma. “The glass, as it was moving through this plasma, acquired that strong magnetization,” he says.</p>



<p>The moon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-map-lunar-surface-geology">has been repeatedly battered by meteorites</a> over time (<em>SN: 4/24/20</em>). And that means that other relatively young and highly magnetized lunar samples that researchers have puzzled over may have gotten their magnetization in this way, Tarduno says. If so, that may also help explain results from recent studies, based on analyses of the magnetization of a moon rock dating to between 2.5 billion and 1 billion years ago, that have suggested the moon’s magnetic field might have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-had-magnetic-field-least-billion-years-longer-thought">lingered until as recently as 1 billion years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>).</p>





<p>Geodynamicists have wrangled over how the moon’s small core could have sustained a magnetic field for billions of years or even if the moon ever had a magnetic field at all, says Lisa Tauxe, a paleomagnetist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. Modeling studies of the moon’s core “just have a great deal of trouble generating enough oomph to make a magnetic field, whereas you can do that pretty easily for the Earth.” The new study, she says, “presents a well-argued case against a long-lived field.”</p>



<p>If any lunar magnetic field did disappear about 4 billion years ago, the lengthy bombardment of the moon&#8217;s surface by the solar wind since then may have left a hidden wealth of helium-3 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-showers-dig-water-moon-nasa">water</a> buried in the lunar soils (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>). Those are products that future moon expeditions may be able to mine for energy as well as life support.</p>



<p>Drilling into those soils may also give scientists an unprecedented glimpse at the past physical properties of the sun, which could also help scientists better understand conditions on the early Earth, Tarduno says. “[We] have the potential now to learn both about the ancient sun and early Earth’s atmosphere, which you’re not going to get in any other way,” he adds. “That’s really exciting stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">A bounty of potential gravitational wave events hints at exciting possibilities</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new crew of potential ripples in spacetime has just debuted — emphasis on the word “potential.”</p>



<p>By loosening the criteria for what qualifies as evidence for gravitational waves, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01045">physicists identified 1,201 possible tremors</a>. Most are probably fakes, spurious jitters in the data that can mimic the cosmic vibrations, the team reports August 2 at arXiv.org. But by allowing in more false alarms, the new tally may also include some weak but genuine signals that would otherwise be missed, potentially revealing exciting new information about the sources of gravitational waves.</p>



<p>Scientists can now look for signs that may corroborate some of the uncertain detections, such as flashes of light in the sky that flared from the cosmic smashups that set off the ripples. Gravitational waves are typically spawned by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">collisions of dense, massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars</a>, the remnants of dead stars (<em>SN: 1/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>To come up with the new census, physicists reanalyzed six months of data from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, and Virgo gravitational wave observatories. Scientists had already identified 39 of the events as likely gravitational waves in earlier analyses.</p>



<p>Eight events that hadn’t been previously identified stand a solid chance of being legitimate — with greater than a 50 percent probability of coming from an actual collision.</p>



<p>The physicists analyzed the data from those eight events to see how they might have occurred. In one, two black holes may have slammed together, melding into a whopper black hole with about 180 times the mass of the sun, which would make it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">the biggest black hole merger seen yet</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). Another event could be a rare sighting of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">black hole swallowing a neutron star</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">Snake-eating spiders are surprisingly common</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spider’s typical dinner menu might include insects, worms or even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">small lizards</a> and frogs (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). But some arachnids have more adventurous tastes — they can eat snakes up to 30 times their size.</p>



<p>Take the Australian redback. Not including legs, a female of this species of spider is only about the size of an M&amp;M candy. But she can take down relatively big prey such as juvenile eastern brown snakes, which are among the most venomous serpents in the world. A snake that gets trapped in a redback’s web — a messy tangle of long, sticky silk threads that dangle to the ground — is quickly set upon by the spider, which subdues the struggling victim with more sticky silk before delivering a toxic bite that eventually kills the snake.</p>



<p>“I find it cool that tiny Australian redback spiders can kill brown snakes,” says spider biologist Martin Nyffeler of the University of Basel in Switzerland. “[It’s] very fascinating and a little frightening!”</p>



<p>But redbacks are far from the only spiders with an appetite for snake. <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-49/issue-1/JoA-S-20-050/Spiders-Arachnida-Araneae-feeding-on-snakes-Reptilia-Squamata/10.1636/JoA-S-20-050.full">At least 11 different families of spiders feed on snakes,</a> Nyffeler and herpetologist Whit Gibbons report May 11 in <em>The Journal of Arachnology.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="475" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680.jpg" alt="Brown widow spider crawls along a scarlet snake ensnared in the spider's web" class="wp-image-3102098" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-548x383.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-644x450.jpg 644w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-266x186.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102098">In Georgia, this brown widow spider (<em>Latrodectus</em> <em>geometricus</em>) snared a scarlet snake (<em>Cemophora coccinea</em>).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102098">Daniel R. Crook</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Nyffeler and Gibbons, of the University of Georgia in Athens, searched for reports of snake-eating spiders in all sorts of places — from research journals and magazine articles to social media and YouTube videos. In all, the team analyzed 319 accounts from all over the world. Most reports came from Australia and the United States, but these spiders live on every continent except Antarctica.</p>



<p>“I didn’t realize how common this was. I don’t think anybody did,” says evolutionary biologist Mercedes Burns of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who was not involved in the research.<br><br>Snakes that the spiders ate came from seven families. Some, including coral snakes, rattlers, palm-pitvipers and lanceheads, are highly venomous. “I was kind of surprised at the types of snakes that were described because some of them are pretty big, pretty strong,” Burns says.</p>





<p>Tangle web spiders, a group that includes North American widow spiders and redbacks, are the most successful snake slayers, Nyffeler and Gibbons found. Relatively small, these spiders can catch snakes 10 to 30 times their size, Nyffeler says.</p>



<p>Tidier <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-poisonous-webs-neuro-toxins-genes">orb weaver spiders</a> don’t do too shabbily either (<em>SN: 8/3/20</em>). A golden silk orb weaver in Florida caught a 1-meter-long green snake, the longest in the study. However, making a meal of green snakes may be a risky choice — these serpents often eat arachnids, including orb weaver spiders, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Not all snake-eating spiders trap the serpents with webs. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-tarantula-eating-weird-stuff-complex-amazon-food-webs">Tarantulas actively hunt their prey</a>, then use powerful jaws to deliver a potent venom (<em>SN: 2/28/19</em>). “Often a tarantula tries to catch the snake by the head and will hold on in spite of all efforts of the snake to shake him off,” Nyffeler says. Once that venom takes effect, the snake calms down.</p>



<p>In some encounters, venom defeated snakes in minutes. In others, spiders took days to kill their prey, Nyffeler and Gibbons found.</p>

<p>Once the snakes die, spiders use enzymes to turn soft body parts into a soup that the arachnids suck into their stomach. “They have what’s called a pumping stomach,” Burns says. “It’s almost like their stomach is attached to a rubbery straw. They have to kind of suck everything down.”</p>



<p>Most of spiders in the study likely dine on snake only now and again, Nyffeler says. Some South American tarantulas, however, eat snakes and frogs almost exclusively.</p>



<p>Nyffeler hopes that his new study increases appreciation for spiders, which he calls extraordinary creatures. “The fact that small spiders are capable of killing much larger snakes is very fascinating,” he says. “Knowing and understanding this enriches our understanding of how nature works.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Many of the world’s most pressing problems require global co-operation. If we are to combat climate change or contain the spread of devastating diseases, for instance, we need to work across borders and share resources.</p>



<p>So a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24787-1">new study</a> in <em>Nature Communications </em>doesn’t make for encouraging reading. Using a common paradigm for studying co-operation, Angelo Romano from the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and colleagues look at how more than 18,000 participants from 42 different countries co-operate with people from their own nation and elsewhere. They find that in every single country, participants show national parochialism: they co-operate more readily with people from their own country than with others.</p>



<span id="more-43134"></span>



<p>Participants completed 12 trials of a prisoner’s dilemma task, each with a different partner who either came from their own country or another country (there were also some trials in which participants weren’t given any information about their partner’s nationality). In each trial, participants were given 10 “monetary units”, and had to decide how many to keep for themselves and how many to give to their partner. Any money they gave away was doubled — and any they received from their partner were doubled too — so in theory the optimal result would be for both parties to co-operate by giving away all of their money. Additionally, on some trials participants were told their decisions would be private, while on others they were told they would be published online.</p>



<p>The team found that people co-operated more (i.e. sent more money to their partner) when their partner came from the same country compared to when they came from a different country. This effect was statistically significant for 39 of the 42 countries, and the remaining three showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. It also didn’t matter whether or not their decisions were going to be made public: participants displayed this “national parochialism” either way. And although the decisions were all about a hypothetical pool of money, a sub-study in which participants actually received a monetary reward produced the same results.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the extent to which participants favoured co-operating with their compatriots over people from other nations was similar across the different countries, and the team didn’t find any evidence that this was related to cultural or political factors. By contrast, they did find that <em>overall</em> levels of co-operation varied by country and were related to particular factors. For instance, co-operation was generally greater in countries with more egalitarian values and those where there are more opportunities to establish new relationships with others.</p>



<p>The results suggest that national parochialism occurs around the world with surprisingly little variation. This is consistent with theories that our tendency to favour the in-group is a universal human behaviour, the authors write. However, they also note that past studies using different methodologies<em> have </em>found cultural differences in in-group favouritism, so further work is needed to understand the exact scenarios in which national parochialism emerges in different countries.</p>



<p>Still, the study shows that at least when it comes to making decisions about sharing goods with others, people are less keen to co-operate with those outside of their own country. While the paper focuses on decisions made at an individual level rather than those made by governments and institutions, the work has clear implications when it comes to understanding the obstacles to co-operating across borders. In fact, we’re in the middle of a pandemic that requires a co-ordinated, global response, yet in most low-income countries <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02109-1">the vast majority of people haven’t received a single dose</a>. The barriers to global co-operation are obviously multi-faceted, but national parochialism surely doesn’t help.  </p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781643135748">How the Mountains Grew</a><br><em>John Dvorak</em><br><em>Pegasus Books, $29.95</em></p>



<p>Imagine a world where pigeon-sized dragonflies soar above spiders with half-meter-long legs, where 2-meter-long millipedes slither and 20-kilogram scorpions hunt. About 300 million years ago, such surreal creatures thrived; today, rocks hint at how these and other creatures in the deep past lived. These clues allow geologist and writer John Dvorak to vividly re-create ancient landscapes in <em>How the Mountains Grew: A New Geological History of North America</em>.</p>



<p>Far from a dusty tome plodding through plate tectonics, the book teems with life as Dvorak establishes inextricable links between geology and biology. Take the oversize dragonflies and millipedes now preserved as fossils. Rocks of a similar age hold evidence of a rise in atmospheric oxygen that helps explain how these animals grew so large.</p>





<p>The book zigzags from place to place on a chronological, continental-scale field trip. To avoid dizzying readers, Dvorak revisits certain sites that preserve multiple threads of geologic history. For instance, at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota’s Black Hills, he describes how, about 2 billion years ago, molten rock rose and lodged itself into sedimentary rocks deposited on the seafloor of bygone oceans. Today, presidents’ faces stare out from this now-solidified magma, those ancient oceanic sediments sitting just below the visage of George Washington. The book later returns to glimpse younger seas that came and went, depositing sediments now replete with fossils. All these rocks, Dvorak explains, whisper stories of how this particular mountain grew.</p>





<p>Dvorak also ponders Earth’s future, envisioning an ice sheet grinding down Mount Rushmore’s carefully carved profiles more than 100,000 years from now. And he considers humankind’s future, arguing that we must determine how our dependence on fossil fuels — the result of another interplay between biology and geology — will end.</p>



<p>But it’s a different end, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">the asteroid impact that marked the demise of the nonbird dinosaurs</a> (<em>SN: 6/1/20</em>), where Dvorak’s storytelling shines brightest. He imagines the final days of the last <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, describing its desperate search for food somewhere well north of Mount Rushmore. In the hours to months after the impact, we share this behemoth’s last steps, its final gasps.</p>



<p>“No degree of evolutionary perfection could have guaranteed survival,” Dvorak writes. As that lone <em>T. re</em>x dies on the page, we can’t help but realize that we, too, are brief biological moments in geologic time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-magnetic-field-hair-computer-simulations-physics">Black holes born with magnetic fields quickly shed them</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a shaggy dog in springtime, some black holes have to shed. New computer simulations reveal how black holes might discard their magnetic fields.</p>



<p>Unlike dogs with their varied fur coats, isolated black holes are mostly identical. They are characterized by only their mass, spin and electric charge. According to a rule known as the no-hair theorem, any other distinguishing characteristics, or “hair,” are quickly cast off. That includes magnetic fields.</p>



<p>The rule applies to black holes in a vacuum, where magnetic fields can simply slip away. But, says astrophysicist Ashley Bransgrove of Columbia University, “what we were thinking about is what happens in a more realistic scenario.” A magnetized black hole would typically be surrounded by electrically charged matter called plasma, and scientists didn’t know how — or even if — such black holes would undergo hair loss.</p>



<p>Black holes can be born with magnetic fields or gain them later, for example by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">swallowing a neutron star</a>, a highly magnetic dead star (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>). When Bransgrove and colleagues simulated the plasma surrounding a magnetized black hole, they found that a process called magnetic reconnection allows the magnetic field to escape the black hole. The magnetic field lines that map out the field’s direction break apart and reconnect. Loops of magnetic field form around blobs of plasma, some of which <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.055101">blast outward</a>, while others fall into the black hole. That process eliminates the black hole’s magnetic field, the researchers report in the July 30 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Magnetic reconnection in balding black holes could spew X-rays that astronomers could detect. So scientists may one day glimpse a black hole losing its hair.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greece-santorini-volcano-eruption-sea-level">Greece’s Santorini volcano erupts more often when sea level drops</a></h4>

              
                <p>When sea level drops far below the present-day level, the island volcano Santorini in Greece gets ready to rumble.</p>



<p>A comparison of the activity of the volcano, which is now partially collapsed, with sea levels over the last 360,000 years reveals that when the sea level dips more than 40 meters below the present-day level, it triggers a fit of eruptions. During times of higher sea level, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00783-4">the volcano is quiet</a>, researchers report online August 2 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>



<p>Other volcanoes around the globe are probably similarly influenced by sea levels, the researchers say. Most of the world’s volcanic systems are in or near oceans.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to see why a coastal or island volcano would not be affected by sea level,” says Iain Stewart, a geoscientist at the Royal Scientific Society of Jordan in Amman, who was not involved in the work. Accounting for these effects could make volcano hazard forecasting more accurate.</p>





<p>Santorini consists of a ring of islands surrounding the central tip of a volcano poking out of the Aegean Sea. The entire volcano used to be above water, but a violent eruption around 1600 B.C. caused the volcano to cave in partially, forming a lagoon. That <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-volcanoes-wake-fast">particular eruption</a> is famous for potentially dooming the Minoan civilization and inspiring the legend of the lost city of Atlantis (<em>SN: 2/1/12</em>).</p>



<p>To investigate how sea level might influence the volcano, researchers created a computer simulation of Santorini’s magma chamber, which sits about four kilometers beneath the surface of the volcano. In the simulation, when the sea level dropped at least 40 meters below the present-day level, the crust above the magma chamber splintered. “That gives an opportunity for the magma that’s stored under the volcano to move up through these fractures and make its way to the surface,” says study coauthor Christopher Satow, a physical geographer at Oxford Brookes University in England.</p>



<p>According to the simulation, it should take about 13,000 years for those cracks to reach the surface and awaken the volcano. After the water rises again, it should take about 11,000 years for the cracks to close and eruptions to stop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073021_mt_santorini_inline_680.gif" alt="animation of sea level rise, cracking crust and a volcanic eruption" class="wp-image-3102078" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102078">When the sea drops at least 40 meters below the present-day level, the crust beneath the Santorini volcano (illustrated) starts to crack. As the sea level drops even further over thousands of years, those cracks spread to the surface, bringing up magma that feeds volcanic eruptions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102078">Oxford Brookes University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It may seem counterintuitive that lowering the amount of water atop the magma chamber would cause the crust to splinter. Satow compares the scenario to wrapping your hands around an inflated balloon, where the rubber is Earth’s crust and your hands’ inward pressure is the weight of the ocean. As someone else pumps air into the balloon — like magma building up under Earth’s crust — the pressure of your hands helps prevent the balloon from popping. “As soon as you start to release the pressure with your hands, [like] taking the sea level down, the balloon starts to expand,” Satow says, and ultimately the balloon breaks.</p>



<p>Satow’s team tested the predictions of the simulation by comparing the Santorini volcano’s eruption history — preserved in the rock layers of the islands surrounding the central volcano tip — with evidence of past sea levels from marine sediments. All but three of the volcano’s 211 well-dated eruptions in the last 360,000 years happened during periods of low sea level, as the simulation predicted. Such periods of low sea level occurred when more of Earth’s water was locked up in glaciers during ice ages.</p>



<p>“It’s really intriguing and interesting, and perhaps not surprising, given that other studies have shown that volcanoes are sensitive to changes in their stress state,” says Emilie Hooft, a geophysicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, who wasn’t involved in the work. Volcanoes in Iceland, for instance, have shown an uptick in eruptions after overlying glaciers have melted, relieving the volcanic systems of the weight of the ice.</p>



<p>Volcanoes around the world are likely subject to the effects of sea level, Satow says, though how much probably varies. “Some will be very sensitive to sea level changes, and for others there will be almost no impact at all.” These effects will depend on the depth of the magma chambers feeding into each volcano and the properties of the surrounding crust.</p>



<p>But if sea level controls the activity of any volcano in or near the ocean, at least to an extent, “you’d expect all these volcanoes to be in sync with one another,” Satow says, “which would be incredible.”</p>



<p>As for Santorini, given that the last time sea level was 40 meters below the present-day level was about 11,000 years ago — and sea level is continuing to rise due to climate change — Satow’s team expects the volcano to enter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greek-volcano-reawakens">a period of relative quiet</a> right about now (<em>SN: 3/14/12</em>). But two major eruptions in the volcano’s history did happen amid high sea levels, the researchers say, so future violent eruptions aren’t completely off the table.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-baby-florida-historic-nursery-endangered">A hammerhead shark baby boom near Florida hints at a historic nursery</a></h4>

              
                <p>It seems like an unlikely place for a nursery of endangered hammerhead sharks, but a recreational hot spot just off the coast of Miami may host a school of these precious babies. If confirmed, the nursery would be the first ever identified in U.S. Atlantic waters for this iconic shark species.</p>



<p>Finding an endangered shark nursery in a vast ocean is like finding a needle in a haystack. While scientists have used satellites to track migrations of adult great hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna mokarran</em>), where the sharks breed and give birth and where babies grow up is still “a bit of a mystery,” says shark scientist Catherine Macdonald of the University of Miami.</p>



<p>Macdonald investigates where and how sharks can thrive in areas that are heavily impacted by humans. One of those areas is Florida’s Biscayne Bay, a popular spot for fishing and boating that is polluted by urban runoff. There, she and colleagues regularly survey shark abundance and diversity using a catch-and-release system: Sharks that get hooked on baited lines are reeled in, documented, tagged and put back into the water.</p>



<p>Discovering a potential hammerhead shark nursery was an accident. The team got its first inkling of something special in June 2018, when researchers caught a juvenile great hammerhead — an interesting anomaly. In a decade of surveying, the team had never captured a hammerhead in these waters, says David Shiffman, a marine biologist at Arizona State University who is based in Washington, D.C. Several months later, the team caught another young hammerhead.</p>



<p>Over the next year and a half, “we kept catching them … every few months,” Macdonald says. So far, the team has documented <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.418">nine baby great hammerheads</a>, Macdonald, Shiffman and colleagues report July 11 in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>. Based on the sharks’ sizes — all under 200 centimeters long — they were less than 5 years old. The area where the young sharks have been found is fairly shallow and carpeted with seagrass, which probably provides protection and is rife with small fish to eat, the researchers suspect.</p>

<p>Though the Biscayne Bay site seems to be experiencing a hammerhead shark baby boom, officially designating the area as a nursery will require more monitoring. Juvenile sharks are more common at the site than other areas surveyed and the sharks come back to it for multiple years, the team says. But it’s unknown whether the sharks reside at the site for extended periods of weeks or months — the third and final <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2007/337/m337p287.pdf">criteria</a> for the site to qualify as a nursery.</p>



<p>Great hammerhead sharks breed infrequently, about once every two years. And the rate at which people catch and kill the sharks — both accidentally and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poached-hammerhead-fins-traced-endangered-populations">intentionally</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/09</em>) — contributed to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature listing the species as critically endangered in 2019. So when nursery areas are discovered, “it’s important they remain safe,” says marine biologist Jasmin Graham, President and CEO of Minorities in Shark Sciences, an organization that promotes diversity and inclusion in marine science. And while adult sharks have few predators other than people, “there’s a super high mortality rate for juveniles.” With an already unstable population, as many juveniles as possible that can survive to reproductive age is crucial, Graham says.</p>



<p>The possibility of an endangered shark nursery in Biscayne Bay fills Macdonald with hope, and she is working with conservation partners to get legal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-we-need-predators">protections</a> for this important site (<em>SN: 9/17/15</em>). “Even in such a heavily impacted place, it is possible for nature to be thriving,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/02/were-more-willing-to-engage-with-sexists-if-we-think-they-are-intelligent/">We’re More Willing To Engage With Sexists If We Think They Are Intelligent</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>For many readers, the idea of interacting with an overtly sexist person probably doesn’t sound particularly appealing — yet in many instances we <em>do</em> continue to engage with those who espouse sexist views. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2020.1819187">new study</a>, authored by Elena Agadullina from Russia’s National Research University Higher School of Economics, finds one factor that could determine whether we are likely to want to interact with a perpetrator of sexism: their intelligence. Participants preferred to interact with intelligent people — even those who had engaged in sexist behaviour.</p>



<span id="more-43091"></span>



<p>Participants, 348 Russian students, were sorted into three conditions. All read descriptions of a man named Peter; in one condition, Peter was described as having an IQ of 130; in another, Peter had a below average IQ of 100; and in the control condition participants received no information about his intelligence.</p>



<p>They were then separated into further conditions. In the sexist condition, Peter was described as someone who believes that women are not as intelligent as men, and that they should therefore work only on household chores, while participants in the non-sexist condition read that Peter believed women should have equal rights and opportunities. Finally, participants indicated how willing they would be to develop a relationship with Peter, be friends with him, or interact with him in everyday life (these were combined into a single measure of willingness to interact with Peter in the future).</p>



<p>Perceived intelligence played a significant role in participants’ choices about interactions. Overall, participants would rather interact with a non-sexist person than a sexist one. But intelligence mattered: they were more willing to interact with a sexist person when they read that he was intelligent than when they read he wasn’t. In fact, participants’ responses showed that they would rather engage with an intelligent sexist over an unintelligent <em>non-sexist</em>. This was the case for both men and women.</p>



<p>The second study looked at different manifestations of sexism. Participants read a story about either Peter or a woman named Sofia, who were described as either highly intelligent or unintelligent. They then either heard that Peter/Sofia had forced a young colleague into a sexual relationship or had innocently invited a colleague to a café to discuss work, before answering the same questions about interactions as in the first study.</p>



<p>This time, participants also completed a measure of their own sexism, indicating how much they agreed with six statements related to hostile sexism (such as “women seek to gain power by gaining control over men”) and benevolent sexism (“women should be cherished and protected by men”).</p>



<p>Again, participants preferred to interact with an intelligent harasser than a non-intelligent one. Interestingly, participants in the no sexual harassment condition were no more or less likely to want to engage with an intelligent than an unintelligent person.</p>



<p>Participants with high levels of hostile sexist attitudes themselves, on the other hand, were more likely to want to interact with an unintelligent woman, and in particular with an unintelligent woman harasser. This may be because the unintelligent woman character fit neatly within their worldview rather than challenging the status quo in any way.</p>



<p>One of Agadullina’s suggestions as to why participants preferred intelligent sexists is that people see sexism as a more malleable characteristic than intelligence: they may therefore make calculations about whether or not to interact with a sexist person on those grounds, believing they have the potential to change. Future research could look more closely at why knowing that an individual is intelligent overrides our better judgement about sexual harassment and sexism, as well as what other traits may also act as mitigating factors. Replicating the work in different cultural settings could also prove interesting.</p>



<p>Although the research focused on individual interactions, writing off sexism due to someone&#8217;s perceived intelligence has a wider impact: it can send the message that sexist behaviour is not particularly important if the perpetrator has other desirable characteristics. Continuing social and political work that highlights the importance of justice and equity for everyone remains key.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2020.1819187">When sexism is not a problem: The role of perceived intelligence in willingness to interact with someone who is sexist</a></p>

<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt in all areas of human life, from the impact on healthcare and the economy to education and the movement of people. The pandemic has also affected many sporting events, including the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo which was due to be hosted in 2020 but was postponed to 2021. With regional and national lockdowns and stay-at homes orders, training schedules for athletes have also been disrupted. To better understand the impacts on athletes with disabilities Piotr Urbański from Poznan University of Physical Education, Poland and colleagues decided to survey 166 athletes who were members of either the Polish Paralympic Committee or the Polish Sports Association for the Disabled’Start. The study found that the athletes were strongly affected by the pandemic and whilst a majority reported training at home, 12% stopped training altogether. Across the group the athletes reduced their training from 9.4h/week to 5.3h/week, highlighting the impact the pandemic has had on these athletes many of whom will be hoping to compete in the Paralympic games in August and September this year.</p>
<h4>Plasma-rich platelet products could help treat bilateral hip osteoarthritis in dogs &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-021-02913-x">BMC Veterinary Research</a></em></h4>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease affecting companion animals. In dogs, OA commonly affects the hip joint leading the reduced function and pain for the animals. There are limited treatment options available with most treatment focused on alleviating pain and improving joint function rather than treating the disease. Recently there has been interest in using of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to treat musculoskeletal disorders such as OA. Alves from the University of Evora, Portugal and colleagues from the Portuguese National Guard set out to test the use of PRP to treat police working dogs with bilateral hip OA.  After intra-articular administration of the PRP the team used a variety of scales including the Canine Brief Pain and Canine Orthopedic Indices to measure response to treatment. Compared to a control group receiving a saline treatment, the dogs treated with PRP saw improvements in pain and functional scores and no additional medication was required during the study’s follow-up period. The team concluded that PRP product could be a good therapeutic option for Hip OA in dogs.</p>
<h4>Mutant p53 affects chromatin accessibility in tumor cells through direct and indirect mechanisms &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-08362-x">BMC Cancer</a></em></h4>

<p>The transcription factor, p53 encoded by the TP53 is a well characterized tumor suppressor and mutations in the gene sequence can affect its tumor suppressor activity. Some mutations can also result in a gain-of-function oncogenic activity. The effects of mutations on p53 binding to the genome has been well documented, but changes to chromatin accessibility has not been previously characterized. In their study, Bhavya Dhaka and Radhakrishnan Sabarinathan from National Centre for Biological Sciences, India use chromatin accessibility data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify regions in the genome where chromatin accessibility is altered in tumors with mutant p53. The pair identified 1587 and 984 areas where chromatin accessibility was lost and gained, respectively, in breast cancer and 1143 lost and 640 gained in colon cancer. Surprisingly, less than half the sites identified contained sequence motifs for p53 binding. However, these are regions associated with other transcriptional regulators, suggesting that gain-of-function p53 mutants utilizes both direct and indirect mechanisms to affect chromatin accessibility.</p>
<h4>USA National representative survey provides insight into factors affecting inequalities in accessing affordable, healthy food &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-021-00434-2">BMC Nutrition</a></em></h4>

<p>In recent years, inequalities in accessing high-quality and affordable food within the United States have been identified. This is primarily due the existence of food deserts – geographical regions where it is difficult to buy affordable, high-quality food –  within minority neighborhood. Much of the research to date has focused on assessing access and food-quality by using directories, census data and/or Geographic Information Systems. In their study Sansom and Hannibal from Texas A&amp;M School of Public Health, USA conducted a nationally representative survey to better understand the motivations and efforts that minority groups encounter to reach stores providing healthy food options. Their survey of 1612 participants found that saving money, having a good selection of food including organic foods were important factors for minority populations when choosing where to purchase food. In addition, driving less was a major consideration however, the survey demonstrated that minority groups across the USA need to drive for significantly longer their white counterparts to reach stores. The study from Sansom and Hannibal highlights the variety of issues that need to be tackled to reduce inequalities.</p>
<h4>Inexpensive 3D printing mask frames can prolong the life of N95 and KN95 masks &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42490-021-00055-7"><span class="c-journal-title__text ">BMC Biomedical Engineering</span></a></em></h4>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply shortages of various forms of personal protective equipment, including N95 and KN95 respirators used by healthcare professionals. This has led to masks being used for prolonged periods of time and in some cases being reused after decontamination procedures. However, the reusability of these masks is hampered by degradation of the fit of the masks. To try to improve the reusability, Malia McAvoy from Harvard Medical School, USA and colleagues set out to develop a mask frame for damaged and/or poor fitting masks. Using inexpensive 3D printing, the team developed a mask frame consisting of two printed side pieces connected by malleable wired links that allowed the user to mould the frame and mask against their face to recreate the tight fit. The frame is then held in place by elastic around the head. The team tested the fit on 45 volunteers with and without the mask frames on four different brands of either N95 or KN95 standard. For volunteers using masks with broken and effective straps an average of 85% passed the fit test, suggesting that the mask frames can prolong the lifespan of the masks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion">A super-short gamma-ray burst defies astronomers’ expectations</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprisingly short gamma-ray burst has astronomers rethinking what triggers these celestial cataclysms.</p>



<p>The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected a single-second-long blast of gamma rays, dubbed GRB 200826A, in August 2020. Such fleeting gamma-ray bursts, or GRBs, are usually thought to originate from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">neutron star smashups</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>). But a closer look at the burst revealed that it came from the implosion of a massive star’s core.</p>



<p>In this scenario, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dying-stars-called-collapsars-may-forge-much-universe-gold">the core of a star collapses into a compact object</a>, such as a black hole, that powers high-speed particle jets. Those jets punch through the rest of the star and radiate powerful gamma rays before the outer layers of the star explode in a supernova (<em>SN: 5/8/19</em>). That process is typically thought to produce longer GRBs, lasting more than two seconds.</p>



<p>Discovering such a brief gamma-ray burst from a stellar explosion suggests that some bursts previously classified as stellar mergers may actually be from the deaths of massive stars, researchers report online July 26 in two studies in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>The first clues about GRB 200826A’s origin came from the burst itself. The wavelengths of light and amount of energy released in the burst <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01395-z">were more similar to collapse-related GRBs</a> than collision-produced bursts, Bing Zhang, an astrophysicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and colleagues report. Plus, the burst hailed from the middle of a star-forming galaxy, where astronomers expect to find collapsing massive stars, but not neutron star mergers — which are generally found on the fringes of tranquil galaxies.</p>



<p>Another group, led by astronomer Tomás Ahumada-Mena of the University of Maryland in College Park, searched for the supernova that’s expected to follow a GRB produced by a collapsing star. Using the Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii to observe GRB 200826A’s host galaxy, the team was able to pick out <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01428-7">the telltale infrared light of the supernova</a>. The burst may have been so brief because its jets had just barely punched through the surface of the star before they petered out and the star blew up, Ahumada-Mena says.</p>

                <p class="">Devon had been a superstar student in high school, and by the time she was a freshman in college she already had her career path to becoming a physician mapped out. She was intelligent, ambitious, and seemingly destined for success. But by the end of her very first semester at college her life was in complete disarray. She appeared haggard and disheveled, was failing all of her classes, and displayed a paranoid mistrust of everyone around her. </p><p class="">Devon’s transformation began about mid-way through her first semester when she started to lose interest in academics—and everything else, it seemed; sometimes she just wanted to stay in bed all day. At first, she thought she might be suffering from depression, or at least some extreme form of homesickness due to her first prolonged stay away from her family. But she also started to notice that almost anywhere she went on campus people were staring and whispering about her. The whispers were critical—sometimes downright mean—and soon Devon started to hear them all the time, whether she was in earshot of others or not. It seemed to her that she was the focal point of everyone at her school—not only students, but also professors, staff, and visitors.</p><p class="">Devon eventually decided that all of these whispers and surreptitious glances harbored malicious intent. She had come to her university hoping to be recognized for her academic success, but now she began to believe that her professors, school administrators, and fellow students were involved in an intricate plot devised to see her fail. She decided she had been identified by a national surveillance system as someone who posed a threat to a medical system that was desperately attempting to hold onto its male dominance.</p><p class="">After that revelation, Devon’s life began to spiral out of control. She rarely went to class, and she tried to avoid everyone. Thinking her roommate was in on the plot against her, she would often sleep in a secluded corner of the library rather than go back to her dorm room. She refused to eat the potentially poisoned food from the school cafeteria, and she lost over 10 pounds. Classmates often saw her walking across campus with her eyes on the ground, muttering to herself. When her parents came to visit late in the semester, they realized the severity of the situation and checked Devon into the hospital.</p><h2><strong>Schizophrenia symptoms</strong></h2>

<p class="">Devon was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia, a potentially severe psychiatric condition <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia" target="_blank">that affects about 20 million people throughout the world</a>. Schizophrenia defies a clear and simple definition as it can look very different from one patient to the next. The disorder can involve a number of different symptoms; which symptoms are present varies from case to case.</p><p class="">Clinicians often categorize the symptoms of schizophrenia as <em>positive</em>, <em>negative</em>, or <em>cognitive</em>. Positive symptoms involve the development of a behavior or thought pattern that isn’t normally present in a healthy individual. These include psychosis, which is a disruption in reality that might involve delusional thinking like Devon’s paranoia. Hallucinations are also common; typically, the hallucinations are auditory in nature. Many schizophrenics, for example, hear voices in their heads that can sound as clear as if someone else in the room was talking. The critical whispers Devon heard would fall into this category.</p><p class="">Negative symptoms involve the loss of a behavior or function that is typically seen in a healthy individual. Examples include a lack of motivation that can resemble depression, blunted emotion, difficulty experiencing pleasure, and a decreased desire for social interaction.</p><p class="">Cognitive symptoms are those that affect someone’s ability to think clearly, and might involve deficits in attention, concentration, and/or memory.</p><p class="">Each patient with schizophrenia displays a unique combination of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. The diverse presentation (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25219520/">combined with supporting genetic data</a>) has led some to suggest that cases diagnosed as schizophrenia really may represent distinct disorders that are erroneously lumped together in one category.</p><h2><strong>Schizophrenia and the brain</strong></h2><p class="">Given the diverse nature of the condition, perhaps it’s not surprising that it has been difficult to identify specific aspects of brain function that are consistently pathological in schizophrenic patients. A great deal of research over the past half century, however, has focused on neurotransmitter abnormalities at the root of the disorder.</p><p class="">The neurotransmitter dopamine has received a lot of this attention. All of the drugs used to treat schizophrenia act to reduce dopamine activity, and drugs that increase dopamine levels (e.g., amphetamine) can induce behavior that in some ways resembles the psychotic states schizophrenic patients experience. Both of these observations support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is linked to some degree of dopamine dysregulation. There is also evidence that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730746/">dopamine synthesis and release in the brain is higher than normal</a> in schizophrenic patients. </p><p class="">Although dopamine has received the lion’s share of attention when it comes to neurotransmitter abnormalities in schizophrenia, researchers have also found that attempting to explain the varied symptoms of the disorder with fluctuations in the levels of one neurotransmitter is a somewhat futile task. This is one reason scientists have turned their focus to other neurotransmitter systems as well. The activity of the neurotransmitter glutamate, for example—a widespread, primarily excitatory, neurotransmitter—seems to also be dysregulated in schizophrenic patients. Some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21956446/" target="_blank">researchers think these glutamate abnormalities might be especially capable of accounting for the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia</a>—symptoms that dopamine irregularities have been less successful in explaining. </p><p class="">Thus, it may be that dopamine abnormalities are more responsible for positive symptoms like delusions and hallucinations, while glutamate abnormalities contribute more to negative symptoms. A case of schizophrenia, then, could potentially involve abnormalities in both dopamine and glutamate activity, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902122/" target="_blank">some hypotheses suggest</a> that altered glutamate signaling may lead to abnormalities in dopamine signaling.</p><p class="">Although they tend to get less research attention, other neurotransmitters like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14624191/" target="_blank">GABA</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954475/" target="_blank">serotonin</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32768486/" target="_blank">norepinephrine</a> have been implicated as well, further complicating the picture. </p><p class="">Despite decades of research, we are left with many questions about how these neurotransmitter abnormalities translate into schizophrenia symptoms. In other words, even if we can say with some confidence that dopamine and/or glutamate activity is dysregulated in schizophrenia, researchers are still trying to figure out how these neurotransmitter irregularities might lead to the diverse symptoms of the disorder. Thus, overall findings about abnormalities in neurotransmitter activity have been difficult to translate into a model that helps to explain the complex symptomatology of schizophrenia.</p><h2><strong>Neurodevelopmental origins and risk factors of schizophrenia</strong></h2><p class="">And then there is the question of what causes schizophrenia to emerge in the first place. The general thinking in this respect is that schizophrenia has its origins in early neural development, when a brain that is particularly susceptible—due perhaps to genetic makeup—experiences some insult while still in the womb. This fetal stress might alter neural development and subsequent brain function in a way that increases the likelihood of developing schizophrenia later in life. Why it would take a couple decades for that fetal stress to manifest into a psychiatric condition, however, is still unclear.</p><p class="">In support of this neurodevelopmental perspective, there is evidence that genetics makes a substantial contribution to the development of schizophrenia, and many of the genes that have been implicated in schizophrenia <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911319/" target="_blank">are also thought to play an important role in fetal development</a>. Additionally, complications during pregnancy or delivery and indicators of abnormal fetal development like low birth weight <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12091183/" target="_blank">are also considered risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life</a>. And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14609251/" target="_blank">babies who are born in late winter and spring have a slightly increased risk of developing schizophrenia</a>, which some have suggested may be linked to an increased likelihood of maternal respiratory infections or malnutrition (e.g., vitamin D deficiency) during the winter. </p><p class="">There are a number of other risk factors for schizophrenia, but their mechanistic connection to the condition has not been clearly established. For example: older fathers are more likely to have a child who develops schizophrenia, males are more likely to develop schizophrenia than females, higher rates of schizophrenia are found in urban environments, migrant populations have a greater risk of schizophrenia, childhood adversity like physical abuse or sexual abuse has been linked to schizophrenia, and drug abuse (e.g., heavy cannabis use) has been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia. </p><h2><strong>Treatment</strong></h2><p class="">The most common treatment for schizophrenia since the middle of the 20th century has been the use of antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic, was developed in the 1950s; since then, a long list of similar antipsychotic drugs have been brought to market. These drugs have an important mechanistic similarity in that they all act to block dopamine receptors to some degree. While antipsychotic drugs are relatively effective in reducing positive symptoms, however, they demonstrate little benefit in treating negative symptoms (which are often more functionally impairing than positive symptoms). And, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23810019/" target="_blank">many patients do not respond to antipsychotic drugs at all</a>.</p><p class="">Additionally, antipsychotic drugs have a problematic side effect profile. The dopamine receptor blockade caused by the drugs can lead to a number of side effects, including movement-related problems such as Parkinsonism (characterized by tremors, slow movement, rigidity, and postural impairments), dystonia (characterized by sustained involuntary muscle contractions, repetitive abnormal movements or fixed postures), akathisia (characterized by restlessness and an inability to sit still), and tardive dyskinesia (characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements). Tardive dyskinesia can persist even after the patient has stopped taking the drug; indeed, it is sometimes irreversible.</p><p class="">Newer drugs have been touted as being less likely to cause movement-related side effects, but no antipsychotic has been able to fully distance itself from this side effect profile. Additionally, newer antipsychotics (typically referred to as second-generation antipsychotics) have been linked to other problems like weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. Thus, treatments for schizophrenia are less than ideal; researchers hope that a better understanding of the disorder will one day lead to improved therapeutic options.</p><h2>References (in addition to linked text above):</h2><p class="">Kahn RS, Sommer IE, Murray RM, Meyer-Lindenberg A, Weinberger DR, Cannon TD, O'Donovan M, Correll CU, Kane JM, van Os J, Insel TR.

The vast majority of studies have compared measures in COVID survivors to those obtained from participants without COVID.

After that, we don't really know what happens. So it's a stretch to suggest that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141641/" target="_blank">neurotropism</a> (viral infection of brain cells) causes alterations at a macro level in humans that can be detected by structural MRI. Anyway, that's the hypothesis.</p><p>What was unclear to me, however, was the number of other analyses conducted as part of the study.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">New delta variant studies show the pandemic is far from over</a></h4>

              
                <p>The coronavirus’s delta variant is different from earlier strains of the virus in worrying ways, health officials are discovering. And those differences may mean a return to some of the restrictions that vaccinated people thought were in the past.</p>



<p>The variant is not only more contagious than earlier strains, it also makes people sicker. And even vaccinated people can get infected and house similar levels of viral particles in their noses as unvaccinated people, raising concern about the vaccines’ ability to curb transmission, new data indicate. But experts caution that there&#8217;s more to infectiousness than just those viral levels in the nose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are five things to know about the new delta data:</p>



<h3>1. Vaccinated people can get infected with delta, but the vaccines are still working.&nbsp;</h3>





<p>Some 350 of about 470 people, nearly 75 percent, who caught the coronavirus in a large <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w">outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., were fully vaccinated</a>, researchers report July 30 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. Public health officials linked many of those cases to packed indoor and outdoor events at places like bars and rental homes. The delta variant, which was first identified in India, was behind 120 of 133 analyzed COVID-19 cases, or 90 percent, in the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while it may sound like the vaccines didn’t do their job, the high proportion of cases in vaccinated people may be because of the county’s high vaccination rate, the researchers say; as of July 3, 70 percent of those eligible in Barnstable County are vaccinated. As more people in a community get vaccinated, the likelihood that someone who tests positive for the coronavirus has protection from the shots also goes up. That’s simply because the vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Crucially, COVID-19 shots still protected vaccinated people from severe disease. While five people were hospitalized, including one unvaccinated person, as of July 27, no one had died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 35,000 of the 162 million vaccinated people in the United States will develop a symptomatic infection every week. That’s about 21 COVID-19 cases in every 100,000 fully vaccinated people getting sick each week. That compares with about 179 infections among every 100,000 unvaccinated people per week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for hospitalization, two to three unvaccinated people out of every 100,000 will be hospitalized weekly with COVID-19 and roughly one person per 100,000 will die each week, according to CDC’s calculations. That’s about 25 times the number of fully vaccinated people facing the same fate. Among the fully vaccinated, 0.1 of 100,000 people will be hospitalized weekly and 0.04 per 100,000 will die each week.</p>



<h3>2. Vaccinated people might more readily transmit delta to others, but there’s a huge caveat to that.</h3>



<p>In that Massachusetts study, both unvaccinated and vaccinated people infected with the delta variant had similar levels of coronavirus genetic material in their noses, as measured by PCR, suggesting similar viral loads.<em> </em>Those elevated viral loads could mean that vaccinated people might more readily transmit delta than other coronavirus variants, despite being protected from the worst of COVID-19 themselves.</p>



<p>That “concerning” finding underpinned the agency’s recommendation from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">earlier in the week</a> that vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain instances, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a July 30 statement (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this finding comes with major caveats. The result “just gives you an indication of how much viral RNA is in the sample, it tells you nothing about infectiousness,” says Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California. These data “are a cause for concern, but this is not a definitive answer on transmissibility” from vaccinated people, she says.</p>



<p>When a vaccinated person gets infected and becomes symptomatic, “we already knew that they’d have higher viral loads,” Butler-Wu says. But the immune response jump-started by the vaccine may hamstring many of those viral particles.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Many of these viral particles are likely coated in antibodies,” says Brett Lindenbach, a virologist at Yale University, meaning the viral particles “should be less infectious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The delta variant may spread more easily from vaccinated people than earlier variants, he says, but definitively demonstrating that would require detailed studies that document transmission events from vaccinated people to others. Still, both Lindenbach and Butler-Wu say that mask wearing, for vaccinated and unvaccinated people, can help slow the spread of the delta variant.</p>



<h3>3. The delta variant can actually make people sicker.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Three recent studies in Canada, Singapore and Scotland indicate that the variant raises the risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto analyzed data from the province of Ontario to see if different coronavirus variants made people sicker. She and colleague David Fisman had information about who got infected and what the outcome of the infection was. Even after accounting for vaccination, age and underlying health conditions, the delta variant carried a 120 percent increased risk of hospitalization, 287 percent increased risk of ICU admission and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.05.21260050v2">137 percent increased risk of death</a>, the researchers report July 12 at medRxiv.org. “And that’s on top of what we see with alpha,” Tuite says. </p>



<p>In Singapore, a preliminary study in the <em>Lancet</em> posted June 7 to the preprint server SSRN found that the<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3861566"> delta variant nearly doubles the risk of pneumonia</a> compared with earlier strains and carries an increased risk of needing supplemental oxygen, being admitted to the ICU and dying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those preliminary data haven’t been reviewed by other scientists yet, but agree with data published in the <em>Lancet </em>June 14 from a study in Scotland. There, researchers found that the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext">delta variant doubles the risk of hospitalization</a> compared with the alpha variant.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the vaccines work slightly less well against the delta variant than they did against earlier strains. Still, vaccination reduces the risk of these serious complications. Vaccines are like using an extinguisher on a kitchen fire, says Paul Offit, director of vaccine education at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The goal is to keep the rest of the house from burning down.” The virus can enter cells in the nose, throat and lungs and start to replicate there, “so you can have an asymptomatic infection or a mild disease,” Offit says.</p>



<p>But then, a vaccinated person’s immune system will kick in after a couple of days and prevent the infection from causing more severe disease, he says. “It’s easier to prevent moderate to severe disease than it is to prevent mild disease.”</p>



<h3>4. Delta is much more transmissible than previous forms of the coronavirus.</h3>



<p>An unvaccinated person infected with the ancestral version of the virus that first emerged at the end of 2019 typically transmitted the virus to two to four people on average.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Someone infected with the delta variant, however, might pass the virus on to five to 10 others on average. That’s nearly on par with the contagiousness of chicken pox, <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/8a726408-07bd-46bd-a945-3af0ae2f3c37/note/57c98604-3b54-44f0-8b44-b148d8f75165.#page=1">internal CDC documents</a> first obtained and published by the <em>Washington Post</em> show.</p>



<h3>5. Public health measures like vaccination and masks remain crucial tools.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The CDC recommended a return to masking, because it is one of the most effective tools to prevent infection.</p>



<p>N95 masks are effective in all settings, but surgical masks fare best when the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6549/1439">concentration of viruses in the air is low</a>, an international group of researchers calculated in a June 25 <em>Science </em>study. And their calculations suggest the masks work best against both getting an infection and spreading it when everyone is wearing a mask. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting masks protect better</a> than ones that have gaps at the top or sides, previous studies have demonstrated (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three-layer <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e1.htm">cotton cloth masks are also effective</a>, researchers reported July 2 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Researchers tested how many stand-ins for virus-carrying aerosol particles mannequin heads “breathed” with and without cotton masks. If all the dummies wore masks, the combined concentration of aerosol particles in the air was 72 percent lower than the number of airborne particles when none of the mannequins were masked.</p>



<p>Combining masks with proper <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">ventilation and filtration may be even more helpful</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). In the mannequin study, researchers also placed two HEPA filters in various locations around the room. HEPA filtration cut exposure to airborne particles by 65 percent compared with no filtration and no masks. When all the mannequins were masked and the HEPA filters were on, the average particle concentration was reduced 90 percent.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Olympic athletes have always been under intense pressure, but this year the pandemic has added to the challenges they face.</strong> At <em>Wired, </em><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/simone-biles-tokyo-olympics">Amit Katwala explores</a> the impact that competing at the Olympics has on athletes’ mental health.</p>

<p><strong>People who were allowed to travel further unsupervised when they were kids are more confident navigators as adults.</strong> That’s according to work by psychologist Vanessa Vieites, <a href="https://theconversation.com/kids-set-free-to-roam-on-their-own-feel-more-confident-navigating-in-adulthood-163972">who describes her study</a> at <em>The Conversation.</em> Men also reported being allowed to explore more as children, which went some way to explaining gender differences in adult wayfinding.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Instagram is rife with memes about mental health. But are these actually beneficial to people who have experienced trauma? </strong>At <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jul/29/mental-health-memes-can-they-offer-more-than-comic-relief">Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett takes a nuanced look</a> at the possible benefits and dangers of this trend.  </p>

<p><strong>Cockatoos in Sydney know how to raid household bins <strong>—</strong> and, intriguingly, this is a behaviour that they seem to have learned from each other. </strong>Researchers found that before 2018, cockatoos in just a few suburbs were able to “dumpster dive”, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/australia-s-cockatoos-are-masters-dumpster-diving-and-now-they-re-learning-each-other">reports Cathleen O’Grady</a> at <em>Science, </em>but over time the behaviour spread out from those original locations. The team even found that there are local “subcultures” of cockatoos that have different strategies for opening the bins.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Giving a stranger a compliment is not nearly as awkward as we anticipate, and also makes them feel much happier than we expect. </strong>At <em>BBC Worklife</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210722-why-we-dont-dole-out-many-compliments-but-should">David Robson looks at the research</a> on compliments, and concludes that we should be giving each other more of them (within reason!).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Both antidepressants and psychological therapy produce changes in the brain’s response to emotional information — though a recent study found that these changes occur in different but related areas. </strong>At <em>Psyche</em>, <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/mental-disorders-are-brain-disorders-heres-why-that-matters">researcher Camilla Nord explains the results</a>, arguing that neuroscience has a central role to play in improving our understanding of mental health disorders and in the development of personalised treatments.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Finally, yet more research has looked at whether bronze or silver medallists are happier. </strong>This time, researchers used software to analyse the faces of athletes on the podium in the last five Olympic Games. The team found that bronze medallists appeared to be happier than silver medallists, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/29/1022537817/theres-a-psychology-lesson-behind-why-olympic-bronze-medalists-are-so-happy">reports Vanessa Romo</a> at <em>NPR</em> (contrary to the findings of a similar study <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/26/is-it-true-that-its-more-painful-to-come-second-rather-than-third-new-insights-from-the-2016-olympics/">we reported on</a> a couple of years ago).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/peru-skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim">A skeleton from Peru vies for the title of oldest known shark attack victim</a></h4>

              
                <p>When news broke that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">oldest known case of a person killed by a shark</a> involved a member of Japan’s Jōmon culture around 3,000 years ago, two researchers took special notice (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>Back in 1976, bioarchaeologist Robert Benfer of the University of Missouri in Columbia and Harvard University anthropological archaeologist Jeffrey Quilter had participated in an excavation of a roughly 17-year-old boy’s skeleton that bore signs of a fatal shark encounter. The boy’s left leg was missing and his right hip and right forearm bones displayed deep bite marks characteristic of those made by sharks, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“Successful shark bites usually involve tearing off a limb, often a leg, and ingesting it,” Benfer says. An unsuccessful attempt to ward off a shark presumably resulted in the boy’s arm injuries.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating indicated that the teen, whose remains were discovered at a Peruvian village site called Paloma, died around 6,000 years ago before being placed in a grave unlike any others in his community, says Benfer, who directed investigations at Paloma in 1976 and in three more field seasons that concluded in 1990. That could make the teen the oldest known shark attack victim.</p>





<p>Quilter went on to describe the youth’s shark-related injuries in two paragraphs in a 1989 book, <a href="https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781587293993/life-and-death-at-paloma"><em>Life and Death at Paloma</em></a>. But the results were never published in an academic journal. Quilter and Benfer e-mailed the excerpt to the Jōmon researchers on July 26. “We were unaware of their claim until now, but are keen to speak to them about it in more detail,” says University of Oxford archaeologist J. Alyssa White, who led the Jōmon team.</p>



<p>Paloma lies in hills about 3.5 kilometers from Peru’s Pacific coast. Small groups intermittently lived there in round, reed huts between around 7,800 and 4,000 years ago. Paloma’s residents primarily fished, collected or dove for shellfish, and gathered edible plants.</p>



<p>A majority of the 201 human graves excavated at Paloma were dug beneath or just outside reed huts. But the young man with a missing leg was buried in a long, oval pit dug in an open area and left unfilled. Excavators found remains of a grid of canes that had been tied together and covered with several woven mats to form a cover or roof over the body. Items placed in the grave included a seashell, a large, flat rock and several ropes, one with elaborate knots and a tassel at one end.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/utdtRG6AyfE/">Impact AND credibility matter when researchers evaluate research</a></h4>

<html><body><p><strong>by Veronique Kiermer, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, &amp; James Harney.</strong></p>



<p>Today we&rsquo;ve posted a <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ryds4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, along with accompanying data, on qualitative research we conducted about how researchers assess the credibility and impact of research. This study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, was supported by a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> and conducted with the assistance of the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Cell Biology</a>. The findings will inform future PLOS activities to support improved research assessment practices &mdash; specifically to support efforts to move emphasis towards individual research outputs and away from journal-level metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/how-do-researchers-evaluate-research/">wrote </a>in October 2020, we are interested in how researchers evaluate research outputs when (1) conducting their own research, and (2) when they take part in committees for hiring or grant review. In particular, we were interested in how researchers make judgments about the <em>credibility</em> and<em> impact </em>of the research outputs &mdash; including papers, preprints, research data &mdash; that they encounter in these contexts.</p>



<p>We interviewed 52 cell biology researchers.&nbsp; Our approach focused on the goals they are trying to achieve (e.g.&rdquo;identify impactful research to read&rdquo;), rather than the tools they are presently using to carry out these tasks. By focusing on researchers&rsquo; goals (the <em>what</em>) rather than <em>how</em> they are achieving them, we sought to better understand how we might influence those practices. This qualitative research will be followed by survey work to better quantify our findings. This will provide insights into opportunities for better solutions for improved research assessment. In particular, we&rsquo;ll understand what signals of credibility and impact might provide researchers with more useful ways than journal impact factor or journal prestige to assess the quality and credibility of individual studies and individual researchers.</p>



<p>Our results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the <em>credibility</em> (or trustworthiness) of research outputs is the central concern for researchers when conducting their own research, and that <em>impact</em> was a strong focus when researchers are part of hiring or grant review committees. But we established that researchers also assess attributes of research outputs related to reproducibility, quality, and novelty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, we found that researchers said they assessed credibility in committees more frequently than we anticipated, given that impact considerations &mdash; including journal impact factor &mdash; are prevalent in committee guidance and research assessment objectives (see for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McKiernan et al</a>. (2019), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niles et al.</a> (2020), <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:32909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alperin et al.</a> (2020), and <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/measuring-research-9780190640125?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugimoto &amp; Larivi&egrave;re</a> (2018)).</p>



<p>Our interviews confirmed that convenient proxies for credibility and impact, usually those based on journals, are used pervasively and are common in both research discovery and committee activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research also indicates that when researchers inspect publications to evaluate credibility they try to minimize the amount of time they spend reading and understanding publications. Their tactics included selective reading of the abstracts, figures, and methods sections. Sometimes they said that they also look for signals such as whether data was available and had been reused, whether peer-reviewed versions of preprints have been published, and whether open peer review reports were available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insights that help us better understand what researchers&rsquo; goals are and how they make judgements about credibility when discovering and reading research may offer opportunities to provide more reliable signals that help them with these tasks, yet are better tailored for credibility judgments than journal-level metrics. The stated importance of assessing credibility by researchers who participate in research assessment committees also suggests an opportunity for funders and institutions to better align their guidelines with the practice and motivations of committee members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After our follow-up survey work to validate these preliminary findings, we will report back and hope that this research will help others in the understanding and development of better methods of research assessment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-wasp-larvae-caterpillars">Viruses can kill wasp larvae that grow inside infected caterpillars</a></h4>

              
                <p>When parasitic wasps come calling, some caterpillars have a surprising ally: a viral infection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insects called parasitoid wasps lay their eggs inside young moth larvae, turning the caterpillars into unwitting, destined-to-die incubators for possibly hundreds of wasp offspring. That’s bad news for viruses trying to use the caterpillars as replication factories. For the caterpillars, viral infections can be lethal, but their chances of survival are probably higher than if wasps choose them as a living nursery.</p>



<p>Now, a study shows how certain viruses can help caterpillars stymie parasitoid wasps. A group of proteins dubbed parasitoid killing factor, or PKF, that are found in some insect viruses <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb6396">are incredibly toxic to young parasitoid wasps,</a> researchers report in the July 30 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The new finding shows that viruses and caterpillars can come together to fight off a common wasp enemy, says study coauthor Madoka Nakai, an insect virologist at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. A parasitoid wasp would kill a host that the virus needs to survive, so the virus fights for its home. “It’s very clever,” Nakai says.</p>





<p>What’s more, some moth caterpillars make the wasp-killing proteins themselves, the team found. It’s possible that in the distant past, a few moths survived a viral infection and “got some presents” in the form of genetic instructions for how to make the proteins, says study coauthor Salvador Herrero, an insect pathologist and geneticist at the University of Valencia in Spain. Those insects could have then passed the ability down to offspring. In this case, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” Herrero says.</p>



<p>Previous studies had shown that viruses and insects, including moths, can swap genes with each other. The new finding is one of the latest examples of this activity, says Michael Strand, an entomologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“Parasite-host relationships are very specialized,” he says. “Factors like [PKF] are probably important in defining which hosts can be used by which parasites.” But whether caterpillars stole the genetic instructions for the proteins from viruses or if viruses originally stole the instructions from another host remains unclear, Strand says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers discovered in the 1970s that virus-infected caterpillars could <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/168/3928/251">kill parasitoid wasp larvae using an unknown viral protein</a>. In the new study, Herrero and colleagues identified PKF as wasp-killing proteins. The team infected moth caterpillars with one of three insect viruses that carry the genetic blueprints to make the proteins. Then the researchers either allowed wasps to lay their eggs in the caterpillars or exposed wasp larvae to hemolymph — the insect equivalent of blood — from infected caterpillars.  </p>



<p>Virus-infected caterpillars were poor hosts of the parasitoid wasp <em>Cotesia kariyai</em>; most young wasps died before they had the chance to emerge from the caterpillars into the world. Hemolymph from infected caterpillars was also an efficient killer of wasp larvae, typically destroying more than 90 percent of offspring.</p>



<p><em>C.</em> <em>kariyai</em> wasp larvae also didn’t survive in caterpillars, including the beet armyworm (<em>Spodoptera exigua</em>), that make their own PKF. When the researchers blocked the genes for the proteins in these caterpillars, the wasps lived, a sign that the proteins are key for the caterpillars’ defenses.</p>



<p>Some parasitoid wasps, including <em>Meteorus pulchricornis</em>, weren’t affected by PKF from the viruses and also beet armyworms, allowing the wasp offspring to thrive inside caterpillars. That finding suggests that the wasp-fighting ability is species-specific, says Elisabeth Herniou, an insect virologist at CNRS and the University of Tours in France who was not involved in the work. Pinpointing why some wasps aren’t susceptible could reveal the details of a long-held evolutionary battle between all three types of organisms.  </p>



<p>The study highlights that “single genes can interfere with the outcome of [these] interactions,” Herniou says. “One virus may have this gene and the other virus doesn’t have it,” and that can change what happens when virus, caterpillar and parasitoid all collide.</p>
