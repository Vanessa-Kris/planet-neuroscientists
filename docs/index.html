                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/11/26/marijuana-and-sexual-dysfunction-could-your-marijuana-usage-be-hindering-your-performance-in-bed/">Marijuana And Sexual Dysfunction — Could Your Marijuana Usage Be Hindering Your Performance in Bed?</a></h4>

<p><strong><em>What is marijuana?</em></strong> Marijuana, also called pot, cannabis, weed, reefer, Mary Jane, dope, broccoli, chronic, reefer, and 420, among countless others, consists of a mixture of dried plant leaves, flowers, and/or stems of the <em>Cannabis Sativa</em> plant. In addition, there is a resin-based version of marijuana that is called hash. Most people either smoke marijuana or vape it (warming it, but not cooking it), but it can also be ingested in oil form. The most common way to ingest marijuana is to roll it up and smoke it like you would a cigarette or cigar, or use a smoking tool like a pipe. Some users, however, consume weed by infusing foods (i.e., butter and cooking oil) or teas.</p>
<p><strong><em>What happens to your body when you ingest marijuana?</em></strong> <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/26/cannabinoids-hold-promise-for-alzheimers-disease-treatment/">THC</a> (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the most active ingredient in marijuana. When you smoke this herb, it travels to your lungs before entering your bloodstream. Once in your blood, it travels to your brain and other organs (i.e., heart, tissues, etc.). FYI: Drinking or eating marijuana can delay the effects of THC. But, once it bonds with your brain’s neural receptors you become “high.”</p>
<p>THC can also affect the sections of your brain that control memory, thinking, concentration and focus, and coordination. When this occurs, it can trigger unpleasant side effects like distorted thinking, delayed learning, lethargy, increased appetite, low inhibitions, hallucinations, distorted perception, clumsiness, and memory loss. These side effects are normally temporary; however, they can still lead to dangerous consequences, especially if you drive while under the influence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is marijuana legal in the U.S.?</em></strong> Yes and no. The state legalization process (for medical marijuana) first began during the seventies. But, unfortunately, even though the process started 40-plus years ago, there has been very little progress on this front, in many states. Why not? Because each state is tasked with developing and enforcing its own laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
<p>Ironically, marijuana possession (in small amounts) has been legalized in other parts of the world (i.e., Czech Republic, Canada, and Israel), yet only <a href="https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881">29 states </a>(Oregon, Montana,  Alaska, Ohio, New Mexico, Arkansas, California, Illinois, New York, Colorado, Delaware, Washington, DC, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Vermont, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Arizona, Maine, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia) have moved to decriminalize the herb for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that medical marijuana has not been thoroughly tested due to government regulations and production limitations. However, research suggests that it may ease nausea and vomiting during chemo treatments, alleviate chronic pain, boost appetite in those with HIV/AIDS, and relieve muscle spasms. In November 2016, Nevada, Massachusetts, California, and Maine also passed measures to legalize recreational marijuana.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Common Sexual Dysfunctions and the Effects of Marijuana</span></h2>
<p><strong><em>What are sexual dysfunctions?</em></strong> Sexual dysfunctions, also known as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/06/excessive-porn-consumption-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction-myth-or-truth/">erectile dysfunction </a>(ED), sexual disorders, premature ejaculation (PE), sexual malfunctions, and sexual arousal disorders, are issues that can occur during any stage of the sexual response cycle (i.e., anticipation, plateau, orgasm, and decline). This issue can prevent couples from experiencing sexual fulfillment during sexual intercourse.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are the different types of sexual dysfunctions?</em></strong> They usually involve four categories: (1) desire disorders (a lack of sexual desire or a loss of interest in sex); (2) arousal disorders (an inability to become or stay aroused during sex or sexual activities; (3) orgasm disorders (unable to climax (orgasm) or a delay in climaxing); and (4) pain disorders (pain that occurs during sexual intercourse).</p>
<p><strong><em>Should I use marijuana for my issue?</em></strong> Regarding marijuana and sexual dysfunction, THC can negatively affect penile function, possibly leading to premature ejaculation. How? Well, there are receptors in a man’s penile tissue that when confronted with THC, increases the risk of erection and orgasm issues. <strong><em>Why does this happen?</em> </strong> Marijuana boosts dopamine levels in the body. Dopamine regulates moods and emotions. If you get accustomed to really high levels of dopamine, you may subsequently find that your natural level of this hormone may not be high enough to sexually stimulate you, thus, making it harder for you to maintain an erection.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Is it Even Safe?</span></h2>
<p><strong><em>Is it safe to use pot for sexual dysfunctions?</em></strong> Unfortunately, the answer is complicated. Study results have been both inadequate and variable. For instance, a recent La Trobe University study interviewed over 8000 Australian men and women, between 16–64 years old, to determine how marijuana usage could affect sexual function. Researchers focused on condom use, sexual partners, sexual dysfunctions, and sexual-transmitted diseases (STDs).</p>
<p>Results indicated that men, who use marijuana daily, are four times more likely to have orgasm problems and three times more likely to experience premature ejaculation, than men who do not use it or don’t use it regularly. In addition, researchers also found that daily male marijuana users are at-risk for delayed orgasms. So, why do men use it if it has serious side effects? Well, the researchers of the La Trobe University study believe that some men with premature ejaculation use marijuana because they believe that the herb will help them “last longer” – the reality is, however, that for many men, it actually worsens their conditions, causing them to ejaculate even faster. The common practice methods used to fix premature ejaculation don’t involve the use of marijuana.</p>
<p>Similarly, another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6090909">study</a> on sexual dysfunctions and marijuana found that marijuana usage is linked to lower testosterone levels, which is a contributor to erectile dysfunction. Like the previous study, the results also suggested that cannabis (marijuana) is associated with orgasm problems like premature ejaculation and an inability to achieve orgasm. Likewise, a <a href="http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(08)01499-1/abstract/localization-and-function-of-cannabinoid-receptors-in-the-corpus-cavernosum-basis-for-modulation-of-nitric-oxide-synthase-nerve-activity">2010 study</a> found that marijuana can affect sexual functions by disrupting the part of the nervous system that regulates erections, thereby, possibly leading to sexual dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">What are the Signs of Overuse?</span></h2>
<p>To better understand the possible signs of overusing marijuana, it is important to answer the following questions. Have you gained or lost any weight, since using marijuana for sexual dysfunction? Do you need a higher amount of pot to get the same results, i.e., “last longer?” Are you spending exorbitant amounts of money on this herb hoping it will improve your sexual performance? Do you suffer from terrible <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/">withdrawal symptoms</a> (i.e., cravings, insomnia, increased hunger, mood swings, irritability, depression, and/or anxiety) when you ease up on it or quit taking it all together? And lastly, is it creating a disturbance at work and/or issues in your relationship?</p>
<p>The truth is, most people believe that marijuana, in general, is harmless, but this is certainly not the case when it is being overused for sexual dysfunctions. Dr. Juan Paredes, a South Beach Clinic board-certified psychiatrist, specializing in male sexual dysfunctions, asserted that one of the major consequences of marijuana overuse, when treating sexual dysfunctions, is that it can lead to extremely weak orgasms, premature orgasms, or no orgasms at all.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, marijuana usage and allowances have started to relax in some states and countries. And, legal restrictions and people’s perceptions of the herb have also eased over the last ten years. Because there is an increased acceptance of marijuana usage for a variety of reasons (i.e., from recreational to medicinal), it is important to learn the possible consequences of regularly ingesting it. <em>Why?</em> Well, because more and more studies are finding that there is a relationship between marijuana and male sexual dysfunctions. And, although smoking, eating, or even drinking marijuana <em>may</em> relieve some symptoms for some men, for others, it could end up being a disaster waiting to happen—in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Julia will be continuing on from last week and present the paper by Naud et al (2008) 'Firing patterns in the AdEx IF model'.</p>
<p>In the article the authors explore the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model as a good tool to simulate large-scale spiking neuron networks.
They show that the AdEx model generates multiple firing patterns in response to the parameter values.
In order to describe the transition from one pattern to another, the phase diagrams are analysed in the article.
To further classify the firing patterns, the transient response to step current is studied.
The analytical solutions are given for continuous adaptation, initial bursting, regular bursting, tonic spiking and irregular spiking as a response to the constant current.
It is also concluded, that the network simulations of a large systems, such as thalamocortical, require the description of different neuron types.
Parameter sets for three neuron types are provided, but further work is needed to extend this to a larger number of neuron types.</p>

<p>Learning to ride a BMX obviously helps you handle a racing bike. How about a motorbike? A unicycle? A helicopter? The question of how far learning generalises beyond the original context has continued to vex psychologists. The answer has real-life implications for education and health. For instance, it bears on whether, by undertaking activities like brain training or learning chess, we can expect to boost our overall memory or intelligence – what’s known as “far transfer”. In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721417712760">new review</a> in <i>Current Directions in Psychological Science</i>, Giovanni Sala and Fernand Gobet of the University of Liverpool conclude that in fact the evidence for far-transfer is very weak.</p>
<p><span id="more-32784"></span></p>
<p>Proponents of “far transfer” point to highly-cited studies suggesting it can happen, such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18443283">a paper from 2008</a> that claimed the kind of “working memory” exercise that’s found in many brain training programmes led to improvements in problem-solving abilities or what’s known as “fluid intelligence”. However, it can be risky to read too much into single studies, so Sala and Gobet conducted three meta-analyses (which combine the data from multiple previous studies), involving three activities that are strong candidates for far transfer: chess, music and working memory training. The research was all focused on children, because you would expect any far-reaching benefits to be greater in those whose cognitive ability is still very much in development.</p>
<p>The results suggested that instruction in chess or music, or working memory training, all led to small-to-moderate gains in broader abilities, like memory, general intelligence, and academic attainment. On the face of it, this is evidence for far transfer. But Sala and Gobet picked apart the studies within the analyses to find something dispiriting: “the size of the effects was inversely related to the quality of the experimental design.”</p>
<p>Limiting the analysis to the best-designed studies, they found little or no evidence of far-transfer. The only exception was a robust effect of working memory training on other memory tasks, which is arguably “near transfer” rather than far transfer. This tallies with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/">an in-depth evaluation of brain training published last year</a> that concluded such training improves performance at the specific skills being practiced, but that claims about its broader benefits have little support once you discount the less stringently designed studies.</p>
<p>So far transfer remains a weakly supported concept. Theoretically, the evidence lines up with the “common elements theory” of learning, proposed by Thorndike and Woodworth more than one hundred years ago: learning will have the most relevance for the domains precisely being practiced, some relevance for domains with lots in common, and little for those more removed. The practical implications for education are straightforward: if you want to acquire a skill, train that skill, or at least something closely related.</p>

<p>Although psychotherapy is effective for many people, it doesn’t help everyone. In fact, in some cases <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-1/when-therapy-causes-harm">it can do more harm than good</a>. And while clinical researchers publish many studies into the outcomes of different therapeutic approaches, such as CBT or psychoanalytic psychotherapy, we actually know relatively little about the specific therapist behaviours that clients find beneficial or unwelcome.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.22531/abstract?campaign=woletoc">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>, although it involves only a small sample, has broken new ground by asking clients to provide detailed feedback on a second-by-second basis of their experience of a recent therapy session, and to explain their perspective on what took place. Intriguingly, the very same therapist behaviours were sometimes identified as helpful and at other times as a hindrance, showing just what a challenge it is to be a therapist.</p>
<p>“It is important to recognise that all therapists are going to make mistakes,” write Joshua Swift at Idaho State University, and his colleagues. “Perhaps the success of the session does not depend on whether errors are made but on the frequency of mistakes and how quickly therapists are able to repair them.”</p>
<p><span id="more-32773"></span></p>
<p>Swift and his colleagues recruited 16 individuals, most of them women, attending therapy sessions at a training centre for clinical psychologists. They were seeking help for various problems including depression, anxiety and a history of trauma or abuse. The clients each saw one of ten therapists at the clinic (eight were women), who between them either endorsed CBT, person-centred therapy or integrative therapy.</p>
<p>The researchers asked the clients to watch back a video recording of their most recent therapy session and equipped them with a dial-rating device, which they could rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise to indicate how helpful or hindering they found each stage of the session on a second-by-second basis (the researchers call this a “micro-process approach”).</p>
<p>There was a lot of up and down variability through a session, which the researchers said shows the limitation of client feedback approaches which involve them filling out questionnaires at the end of each session, and which therefore might miss this variability.</p>
<p>Using the dial ratings, the researchers identified the three most helpful and three most hindering therapy segments for each client and then asked them to explain what was happening in those moments, and then why they found each moment helpful or hindering.</p>
<p>The most helpful therapy moments involved specific treatment techniques, such as times the therapist gave the client a concrete strategy they could use in everyday life; instances when the therapist made connections for the client (such as identifying events that affected their depression symptoms); or helped them process their emotions. Other helpful moments involved fundamental therapist skills, such as listening and expressing empathy, offering support or praise, or when the therapist discussed the process of therapy, including what the client wants from it.</p>
<p>The clients said they found these moments helpful because they learned a new skill, felt heard or understood, gained insight and/or were better able to process their emotions.</p>
<p>In terms of hindering therapist behaviours, these often seemed the same, superficially at least, as the helpful behaviours, including instances when the therapist listened, attempted to express empathy, or attempted to structure the session. The difference seemed to be in the execution or timing of these behaviours. The clients said they found these moments unhelpful when they were off-topic (for instance, their therapist listened to them “rambling” on about irrelevant details without intervening); when they felt like they were being judged; or they felt it was too soon for them to confront a particular issue.</p>
<p>Other unhelpful moments involved the client perceiving that their therapist was giving a perspective that they considered unwelcome (in one case, for example, the therapist suggested it was not a good idea to make long-term decisions when drunk), or their therapist revealed their own perspective through their body language, such as stretching and seeming frazzled.</p>
<p>The fact that the same therapist behaviours can be seen as helpful or harmful in different contexts shows, the researchers said, “the delicate balance that therapists must obtain while conducting therapy.”</p>

<p><em>By Corey Moran</em></p>
<p>If you have particularly poor eyesight like me, you’ll be able to relate to the feeling of uncertainty that comes with removing a pair of glasses or contacts. Your once sharp and crystal clear surroundings take on a formless, fuzzy appearance. Each object in view, from the known to more familiar, is reduced to little more than a blob. As soon as those glasses go back on, however, everything comes into focus and the world makes sense again. Much in the same way, biological scientists use the technique of super-resolution microscopy to place a pair of prescription glasses on a conventional microscope. The result? Cellular structures, both familiar and unfamiliar, come into focus in a spectacular way. This microscopy yields an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cell with nanoscale precision. What was once deemed too small to visualize with conventional microscopy, is now attainable with the resolution that this cutting-edge technique provides. Here at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), I have had the exciting and unique opportunity to work with the Stimulated Emission Depletion microscope (STED) from Abberior Instruments, the first of its kind here in the US.</p>
<p>“The addition of the STED microscope to our institute enables previous boundaries to be broken — driving innovative research and critically important discoveries in brain function,” explained Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, Scientific Director of MPFI.</p>
<p>Modernized microscopy would astonish the likes of Janssen and Leeuwenhoek, the fathers of the compound light microscope invented in the early 1600s. One of the most commonly used imaging platforms in current biological research, the confocal laser scanning microscope, boasts high-powered lasers, detectors for multi-color imaging, ultrafast scan speeds, and even software automation. Despite the many advances and revamps to the humble light microscope, one inherent property has remained constant over the hundreds of years; a lateral resolution limit of about 200 nanometers (for reference, that’s about 1,000 times smaller than the average dust mite).</p>
<p>The field of super-resolution microscopy was born out of the need to surpass the optical limits of traditional light microscopy. So, what is this optical limit exactly? The resolution of a microscope can be thought of as the closest distance two objects can be apart and still be identified as two distinctive points in a subsequent image. For instance, an image taken on a confocal microscope of two point sources of light that are closer together than the 200-nanometer resolution limit would appear as a single, blurred object instead of two discrete points. This limitation is due directly to the wave-like physics of light itself.</p>
<p>As innovative as this technique is, it also has very tangible applications in real-world research. A concrete example of this would be a publication by Wijetunge, Lasani S. et al. Defects in synaptic dysfunction are extremely common in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. With the greatly enhanced resolution of STED, Wijetunge and colleagues could better visualize the shape of these dysfunctional neuronal spines. Their results conflicted with previously published research using lower resolution microscopes and furthered the understanding of the Fragile X condition.</p>
<p>Many super-resolution techniques such as SIM, STORM, PALM and STED have been designed specifically to circumvent this barrier. STED microscopy, the modality that I have been using the past several months, was developed by Dr. Stefan Hell, who later shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his founding contributions to the field of nanoscopy. STED utilizes two separate lasers to break through the resolution barrier. The first being the excitation, the laser that excites fluorescent dyes/proteins and produces the actual light for the image, and the second being the depletion, an auxiliary laser that “turns-off” excess fluorescence in a doughnut-shaped pattern. Yes, you absolutely read that correctly, I did, in fact, say “doughnut” and as the name would suggest, that’s where the magic happens.</p>
<p>As the power of this confectionary-shaped laser is increased, more and more fluorescence is turned off at the periphery. What remains is an extremely focused and restricted excitation beam directed right through the empty center of the depletion (doughnut-shaped) laser. When the two laser beams are superimposed, the magic becomes instantly visible by eye, a new image is produced with remarkable clarity and sharpness, almost as if a microscope ophthalmologist was hard at work.</p>
<p>This technology is absolutely fascinating and has far-reaching implications for the future of the field of neurobiological research. This newly-acquired resolution will make possible novel discoveries on the tiniest of scales in both neuropathology and basic science alike, envisaging the development of new therapeutics that will have enormous and lasting impacts.</p>

<p>After a traumatic experience, why do some people develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), while others don’t? Work to date has found evidence that various factors play a role, including a lack of social support and low levels of the neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (due to its role in the body’s stress response). Into this mix come <a href="http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Citation/2017/10000/The_Microbiome_in_Posttraumatic_Stress_Disorder.14.aspx">new findings</a>, reported in <i>Psychosomatic Medicine</i>, that an individual’s complement of gut bacteria (their gut microbiome) may contribute to their vulnerability to trauma. The researchers are now investigating whether tweaking the gut microbiome could help to prevent or treat PTSD.</p>
<p><span id="more-32617"></span></p>
<p>Lead author on the paper, Sian Hemmings, is based at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, where about three quarters of the population experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and more than half experience multiple traumatic events. PTSD is a debilitating anxiety disorder, which can persist for years. While estimates of its prevalence in South Africa, as well as other countries, vary widely, in the US, for example, <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/PTSD-overview/epidemiological-facts-ptsd.asp">about 6.8 per cent of adults are diagnosed with PTSD at some point in their lives</a>. There’s a pressing need for new insights into the factors that contribute to PTSD, and new strategies for prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>Clues to the involvement of the gut microbiome in PTSD come from its role in the body’s response to infection and physical injury (the inflammatory response), which can be affected by stress. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the normal regulation of inflammation, and lowered levels of Tregs have been found in people after they are exposed to stress in the psych lab, and in refugees with chronic PTSD, compared with controls. Since the human microbiome can influence levels of Tregs, the researchers wondered if there might be any differences in the gut microbiomes of people with and without PTSD.</p>
<p>The researchers analysed the gut bacteria (via their faecal samples) of 30 South Africans who had experienced a traumatic event. Eighteen of them had subsequently developed PTSD and they had lower levels of three phyla of bacteria – Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae and Verrucomicrobia – compared with those who hadn’t developed PTSD. Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia include many microbes that have been found to have immunoregulatory properties, such as mycobacteria, and <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, and lower levels may be a sign of an exaggerated inflammatory response.</p>
<p>Christopher Lowry at the University of Colorado, Boulder, a senior author on the new paper, told us he and his colleagues believe that low levels of these bacteria contribute to risk of developing PTSD, although the new findings don’t prove that link.</p>
<p>If future research is consistent with the gut microbiome influencing vulnerability to PTSD, the potential mechanisms for now are unclear. “We currently do not have a good understanding of why elevated inflammation, at the time of trauma, increases risk of PTSD,” Lowry said. “This may involve priming of microglia [a type of cell] in the brain, so that exposure to trauma induces an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response.”</p>
<p>But this study, along with other work linking heightened inflammation to PTSD, does suggest that it’s worth exploring whether raising levels of these bacteria might reduce the risk of the disorder, or even help in treatment. Lowry and his colleagues are in the process of doing just that. In collaboration with US Veterans Affairs scientists, they are currently conducting a clinical trial evaluating the effects of a probiotic (which stimulates the growth of desirable bacteria) on the stress response in veterans with PTSD.</p>

<p>The human gut microbiota produces dozens of metabolites that accumulate in the bloodstream, where they can have systemic effects on the host. Although these small molecules commonly reach concentrations similar to those achieved by pharmaceutical agents, remarkably little is known about the microbial metabolic pathways that produce them. Here we use a combination of genetics and metabolic profiling to characterize a pathway from the gut symbiont Clostridium sporogenes that generates aromatic amino acid metabolites. Our results reveal that this pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host serum. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) serve as substrates for the pathway, and it involves branching and alternative reductases for specific intermediates. By genetically manipulating C. sporogenes, we modulate serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice, and show that in turn this affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. This work has the potential to provide the basis of a systematic effort to engineer the molecular output of the gut bacterial community.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24661">doi: 10.1038/nature24661</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/LirmVHPUbtA" width="1" />

            regeneration</a></h4>

<p>
             The ability to regenerate missing body parts exists throughout the animal kingdom.
                Positional information is crucial for regeneration, but how it is harboured and used
                by differentiated tissues is poorly understood. In planarians, positional
                information has been identified from study of phenotypes caused by RNA interference
                in which the wrong tissues are regenerated. For example, inhibition of the Wnt
                signalling pathway leads to regeneration of heads in place of tails. Characterization of these phenotypes has led to the
                identification of position control genes (PCGs)—genes that are expressed in
                a constitutive and regional manner and are associated with patterning. Most PCGs are
                expressed within planarian muscle; however, how muscle is specified
                and how different muscle subsets affect regeneration is unknown. Here we show that
                different muscle fibres have distinct regulatory roles during regeneration in the
                planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. myoD is required for formation of a
                specific muscle cell subset: the longitudinal fibres, oriented along the
                anterior–posterior axis. Loss of longitudinal fibres led to complete
                regeneration failure because of defects in regeneration initiation. A different
                transcription factor-encoding gene, nkx1-1, is required for the formation of
                circular fibres, oriented along the medial–lateral axis. Loss of circular
                fibres led to a bifurcated anterior–posterior axis with fused heads forming
                in single anterior blastemas. Whereas muscle is often viewed as a strictly
                contractile tissue, these findings reveal that different muscle types have distinct
                and specific regulatory roles in wound signalling and patterning to enable
                regeneration.

<p>Eukaryotic transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is an important and well-conserved sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that preferentially removes DNA lesions from the template strand that block translocation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB, also known as ERCC6) protein in humans (or its yeast orthologues, Rad26 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhp26 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is among the first proteins to be recruited to the lesion-arrested Pol II during the initiation of eukaryotic TCR. Mutations in CSB are associated with the autosomal-recessive neurological disorder Cockayne syndrome, which is characterized by progeriod features, growth failure and photosensitivity. The molecular mechanism of eukaryotic TCR initiation remains unclear, with several long-standing unanswered questions. How cells distinguish DNA lesion-arrested Pol II from other forms of arrested Pol II, the role of CSB in TCR initiation, and how CSB interacts with the arrested Pol II complex are all unknown. The lack of structures of CSB or the Pol II–CSB complex has hindered our ability to address these questions. Here we report the structure of the S. cerevisiae Pol II–Rad26 complex solved by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals that Rad26 binds to the DNA upstream of Pol II, where it markedly alters its path. Our structural and functional data suggest that the conserved Swi2/Snf2-family core ATPase domain promotes the forward movement of Pol II, and elucidate key roles for Rad26 in both TCR and transcription elongation.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24658">doi: 10.1038/nature24658</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/pc_eyVbaBcI" width="1" />

<p>Environmental nutrient levels impact cancer cell metabolism, resulting in context-dependent gene essentiality. Here, using loss-of-function screening based on RNA interference, we show that environmental oxygen levels are a major driver of differential essentiality between in vitro model systems and in vivo tumours. Above the 3–8% oxygen concentration typical of most tissues, we find that cancer cells depend on high levels of the iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic enzyme NFS1. Mammary or subcutaneous tumours grow despite suppression of NFS1, whereas metastatic or primary lung tumours do not. Consistent with a role in surviving the high oxygen environment of incipient lung tumours, NFS1 lies in a region of genomic amplification present in lung adenocarcinoma and is most highly expressed in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. NFS1 activity is particularly important for maintaining the iron–sulfur co-factors present in multiple cell-essential proteins upon exposure to oxygen compared to other forms of oxidative damage. Furthermore, insufficient iron–sulfur cluster maintenance robustly activates the iron-starvation response and, in combination with inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis, triggers ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death. Suppression of NFS1 cooperates with inhibition of cysteine transport to trigger ferroptosis in vitro and slow tumour growth. Therefore, lung adenocarcinomas select for expression of a pathway that confers resistance to high oxygen tension and protects cells from undergoing ferroptosis in response to oxidative damage.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24637">doi: 10.1038/nature24637</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/8igmNg9zONg" width="1" />

<p>Although individuals age and die with time, an animal species can continue indefinitely, because of its immortal germ-cell lineage. How the germline avoids transmitting damage from one generation to the next remains a fundamental question in biology. Here we identify a lysosomal switch that enhances germline proteostasis before fertilization. We find that Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes whose maturation is arrested by the absence of sperm exhibit hallmarks of proteostasis collapse, including protein aggregation. Remarkably, sperm-secreted hormones re-establish oocyte proteostasis once fertilization becomes imminent. Key to this restoration is activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a proton pump that acidifies lysosomes. Sperm stimulate V-ATPase activity in oocytes by signalling the degradation of GLD-1, a translational repressor that blocks V-ATPase synthesis. Activated lysosomes, in turn, promote a metabolic shift that mobilizes protein aggregates for degradation, and reset proteostasis by enveloping and clearing the aggregates. Lysosome acidification also occurs during Xenopus oocyte maturation; thus, a lysosomal switch that enhances oocyte proteostasis in anticipation of fertilization may be conserved in other species.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24620">doi: 10.1038/nature24620</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/nfW1gVtS_d0" width="1" />

<p>
 Small, approximately 10-kilobase microhomology-mediated tandem duplications are abundant in the genomes of BRCA1-linked but not BRCA2-linked breast cancer. Here we define the mechanism underlying this rearrangement signature. We show that, in primary mammalian cells, BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses the formation of tandem duplications at a site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier imposed by the binding of Tus proteins to an array of Ter sites. BRCA1 has no equivalent role at chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks, indicating that tandem duplications form specifically at stalled forks. Tandem duplications in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by a replication restart-bypass mechanism terminated by end joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming complex tandem duplication breakpoints. Solitary DNA ends form directly at Tus–Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in tandem duplication formation. Furthermore, BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with ~10 kilobase tandem duplications in ovarian cancer. This tandem duplicator phenotype may be a general signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/Trollback__Company_office-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Many of us spend the majority of our work day seated at desk jobs, despite the common knowledge that long periods of inactivity can be <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-296">detrimental to our health</a>.  While some inventions to improve health have been introduced into workplaces, such as sit-stand desks, they fail to take into account worker preferences. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-017-2829-9">New research published in <em>BMC Research Notes</em></a> investigates the activity preferences of employees in order to better understand how to integrate various measures into the workplace, which may improve the overall health of the office-based workforce.</p>
<p>This nationwide study took place in Germany in the form of an office worker survey, where 2830 adults over the age of 18 took part in the questionnaire with a 53% male and 47% female split. The results give an indication of what workers want; to sit less and stand, walk and undertake physical activity more during their working day. The longer the work day, the less time survey participants wanted to spend sitting and the greater their desire to stand.</p>
<p>An inactive lifestyle can increase the risk of developing heart disease and certain types of cancer and diabetes.  Inactivity can also decrease <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612610319?via%3Dihub">overall life expectancy</a>. A recent study found that the ideal amount of time spent standing and undertaking physical activity for our health in a standard 8 hour work day is a <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/04/23/bjsports-2015-094618">progression from 2 to 4 hours</a>. Interestingly, the study mirrors the results of the <em>BMC Research Notes</em> study wherein researchers found there was a preference by workers to sit for no more than 4 hours in an 8 hour work day.</p>
<p>Despite the desire to remain seated for only half of the working day, workers reported spending on average 70% of their day seated. Changing this behavior requires various interventions and changes to the workplace. Sit-stand desks and other measures to increase standing have often been introduced without taking workers preferences for standing, walking or other physical activity into account, which may give an indication as to why there has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040784">limited success</a> in the overall reduction of sitting time in the workplace. This study indicates that physical activity and walking is preferred to simply standing and on average found that workers would rather spend 46 minutes more each day walking, and 26 minutes more standing in a standard 8 hour work day.</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9632 aligncenter" height="277" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/Untitled1-300x277.jpg" width="300" />
<p>To integrate potential interventions requires a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029215000084">change in behavior</a>, a change in the social norms for office workers, a positive attitude as well as personal regulation and control. With the right motivations, such as taking worker preferences into account, a reduction in the amount of time spent sitting at work could be achieved through introducing complimentary countermeasures which may encourage compliance.</p>
<p>Interventions should therefore exist with the intention of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232166545_Fit_or_sit_Is_there_a_psychology_of_sedentary_behaviour">habit-breaking</a>.

<p>Operating in our second language can have some intriguing psychological effects. We swear more freely and linger longer on embarrassing topics than normal. We’re also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/03/18/how-thinking-in-a-foreign-language-makes-you-more-rational-in-some-ways-but-not-others/">less susceptible to cognitive biases</a>. According to psychologist Constantinos Hadjichristidis at the University of Trento, this is because a second language discourages us from relying on intuitive thinking. In a <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2017.1371780?src=recsys">new paper</a> in <i>The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, </i>Hadjichristidis and his colleagues have shown another way that this manifests – when thinking in a foreign language, we’re less prone to superstition.</p>
<p><span id="more-32761"></span></p>
<p>In one experiment, 400 native German speakers with proficiency in English imagined themselves in various scenarios, described either in German or English text, about an important day, like the morning before an exam or the day of a job application deadline. Each scenario involved a break in the routine, which was either mundane (like discovering the kitchen sink being blocked or spotting an airplane in the sky), or had a superstitious connotation – negative, like a mirror breaking, or positive, such as spotting a falling star in the sky. Participants rated how positive or negative they would feel in these situations, responding in the same language as the text.</p>
<p>Reading and responding in English, rather than German, made no difference to participants’ ratings of how they’d feel following a mundane event, but led to them describing less intense emotional reactions to the events with a superstitious connotation: they said they’d feel less negative about the bad luck events and less positive about the good luck events.</p>
<p>What’s happening here? Intuition depends on easily accessible connections, such as the term “broken mirror” being repeatedly associated with dismay or discomfort. These connections tend to be built in earlier life, and invariably in our native tongue (the German participants in this research had only begun learning English from age 12, on average). When we encounter a concept loaded with superstitious symbolism in our second tongue, we know what it means literally, but the emotional associations don’t come along automatically.</p>
<p>Left unchecked, our thinking is always influenced by our intuitions, which means even those who want to live as hard-nosed materialists may find magical thinking creeping in through the side gate. One way to combat this is to monitor the ideas that form and try to expel the unwanted influences. But this research suggests another approach: bar the gate so the influences don’t enter in the first place. For now, this option is only available to bilinguals, but it opens a route for discovering other modes of thinking that are more intuition-free.</p>

The emergence of foodbanks – charitable organizations that provide <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/emergency-food/food-parcel/">emergency food</a> for those in need – represents a shocking manifestation of severe poverty and food insecurity in contemporary Britain. In the absence of more direct information, foodbank use is commonly taken to represent extreme levels of uncertainty in obtaining sufficient, suitable food.</p>
<blockquote><p>When people visit foodbanks more than once, they are also counted more than once, so the true prevalence of foodbank use in Britain is unknown.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite highly publicized <a href="http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CSI-28-Food-insecurity-revised.pdf">growth</a>, the scale of foodbank use has been subject to <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm">heated debate</a>. Food insecurity is associated with poor <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/4/324">mental</a> and physical health, and <a href="https://trusselltrust.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/06/OU_Report_final_01_08_online.pdf">disabilities</a>, so the recent growth in foodbank use could warn of an escalating nutrition and public health crisis in Britain.</p>
<p>This work aimed to address a key evidence gap in estimating the scale of foodbank use. The Trussell Trust – Britain’s largest foodbank network – collects <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/">headline data </a>on the number of food parcels given to adults and children. However, when people visit foodbanks <a href="https://wandsworth.foodbank.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2016/05/WANDSWORTH-FOOD-POVERTY-REPORT-2016.pdf">more than once</a>, they are also counted more than once, so the true prevalence of foodbank use in Britain is unknown.</p>
<p>In this project, each household’s annual number of visits was estimated by cross-referencing the names and addresses of people receiving emergency food from West Cheshire Foodbank. This approach made it possible to identify the unique number of households receiving assistance. This work therefore presents the first attempt to estimate the scale of UK foodbank use among adults and children.</p>
<p>I found that an estimated one per cent of the population of West Cheshire received emergency food between 2013 and 2015. Worryingly, this figure was higher among children. If scaled up, this would equate to approximately 850,000 people in Britain – nearly the population of Liverpool – who rely on emergency food to feed themselves and their families. This proportion rose slightly over time, consistent with <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/">national trends</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_9634" style="width: 837px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9634" height="452" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/fig-1.png" width="827" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Number of unique and total recipients of emergency food in West Cheshire, 2013-2015</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Detailed analyses revealed that the growth in repeat visits outpaced the increase in total visits (see Figure 1), suggesting that foodbank use is becoming more entrenched among certain groups. Repeat visits were more common among working-age and one-person households, groups who have been particularly badly impacted by the recent recession and consequent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743516300846">welfare reform</a>. This finding <a href="https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/working-papers/the-impact-of-benefit-sanctioning-on-food-insecurity-a-dynamic-cross-area-study-of-food-bank-usage-in-the-uk.html">replicates existing research</a> on the topic and strengthens the evidence linking economic and social policies to foodbank use.</p>
<blockquote><p>If scaled up, this would equate to approximately 850,000 people in Britain – nearly the population of Liverpool – who rely on emergency food to feed themselves and their families.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, these results do have some limitations. First, they relate to a single foodbank, which cannot fully represent Britain’s diverse population. Nonetheless, these results are consistent with what is known <a href="https://westcheshire.foodbank.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2016/07/stillhungry.pdf">nationally</a>.</p>
<p>Taking a localized approach also enabled unique households to be identified, a time-consuming task. The next step to a more complete impression of UK foodbank use would require the same strategy to be repeated among a carefully selected sample of foodbanks – a daunting undertaking that may not be practically possible. This approach would still under-estimate the number of people using foodbanks as <a href="http://www.foodaidnetwork.org.uk">independent foodbanks</a> would not be included.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that foodbanks are commonly considered a ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/food-aid-research-report">last resort</a>’ and used by only a <a href="http://www.gowellonline.com/assets/0000/3896/BP28_food_banks_web.pdf">small minority</a> of food insecure people, often because people feel <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0038038515594092">embarrassed</a> or <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/jpsj/2016/00000024/00000003/art00005">ashamed</a>. Separate estimates that between <a href="http://foodfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FoodInsecurityBriefing-May-2016-FINAL.pdf">10</a> and <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/food-and-you-w4-combined-report.pdf">20</a> per cent of people in Britain experience food insecurity demonstrate that foodbank figures drastically underestimate the scale of the issue.</p>
<p>This new work adds to growing evidence about foodbank use in the UK. Practitioners are increasingly well versed in the problem of food insecurity, and may have seen its effects first-hand: <a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/hot-topics/practice-news/one-in-six-gps-asked-to-refer-a-patient-to-a-food-bank-in-the-past-year/20005889.fullarticle">one in six of GPs</a> reported having been asked to refer patients to foodbanks in 2014. The health consequences of food insecurity are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592315/pdf/187e429.pdf">costly to the public purse</a>. Wide-reaching measures to reduce food insecurity are crucially needed and should especially target the particularly vulnerable groups identified here.</p>

<p><strong>With nearly 50 million people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease worldwide, it is more important than ever that we find new treatments and hopefully a cure for this devastating illness.

Podcasts bring an interactive, personal approach and sense of intimacy to topics that might be dry when presented in written form. Plus, you can listen during your commute to the lab, library or office, while you’re exercising, cooking, or anytime you’re in headphone mode.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/ecology/2017/07/31/the-lab-bench-in-stereo-science-and-science-podcasts/" target="_blank">growth in science podcasts</a></strong> provides evidence of their potential to deliver important stories to a broad audience. Podcasts are not just about stories, though. Ciencia Puerto Rico (CienciaPR) has increased the amount of culturally relevant scientific news content in Puerto Rico through essays, articles and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001740" target="_blank">articles distributed as podcasts</a></strong>, and the University of California considered podcasts as a mechanism to <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000289" target="_blank">enhance and accelerate</a></strong> research. Podcasts were integral to an early proposal for an <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002632" target="_blank">online bioinformatics curriculum</a></strong> and are an appropriate component to <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000787" target="_blank">transform science communication</a></strong> through incorporation of rich media.</p>
<p>At PLOS, we’re celebrating the two-year anniversary of our own podcast, <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/" target="_blank">PLOScast</a></strong>. According to PLOScast founding host and PLOS staff researcher Elizabeth Seiver, PLOScast was established to give the organization a modern forum for thought leadership in the publishing space, but it quickly moved beyond this boundary. PLOScast engages listeners through interviews with innovators and thought leaders on the changing experiences of scientists in a digital world, the future of academia and its ongoing challenges, and scholarly publishing developments in an increasingly diverse landscape. These are serious issues, and PLOScast approaches them with integrity, diligence and humor. The show explores all things Open (access, peer review and science), including research tools; ideas for improving science communication; and exemplary, practical habits of successful scientists in all disciplines.</p>
<blockquote><p>“PLOScast enables us to discuss issues that are important to scientists, with some of the thought leaders in their fields. It also increases the visibility of the work that the greater scientific community contributes, every day.”—Elizabeth Seiver</p></blockquote>
<p>When PLOScast launched at the end of 2015, development involved getting the logistics and day-to-day operations straightened out. None of the team members had experience with podcasting, so they needed to learn the basics, including what kind of equipment was needed, how to edit a sound file, and how to best promote each episode. Over time, the script itself has evolved to better engage the audience and optimize the listener experience. “I try to keep the listener in mind more now,” says Seiver. “I think at the beginning I was more focused on having the conversation itself, but now I try to have a running voice in the back of my mind thinking about the listener, asking ‘will other people understand this reference? Is this what other people want to know about this topic?’”</p>
<p>Scientists and those interested in academics are certainly listening—PLOScast has over 16,000 plays in the past two years. With its reputation growing, plans are to diversify beyond the traditional one-on-one interview format and to expand its voice to provide early career researchers (ECRs) an opportunity to participate. The manager of PLOS’ ECR Community, Sara Kassabian, recently joined the PLOScast hosting team (yes, two people make a team), contributing an interview with preprint maven Jessica Polka for her inaugural episode. In “<strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2017/10/24/episode26/" target="_blank">How ECRs like Jessica Polka are reinventing science publishing</a></strong>,” Polka goes beyond the topic of preprints to discuss opportunities for ECRs in #scicomm and the role of twitter in creating positive change in #science.</p>
<p>The top 10 most popular episodes by number of plays cover issues ranging from altmetrics and their history (episode 14) to big data in the social sciences (episode 23) and how to work with public information officers to increase the visibility of your science (episode 8). The top 10 (including number of plays as of October 31, 2017) in order are:</p>

<p>Interestingly, PLOScast launched with a broad ranging discussion on <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2015/10/19/introducing-ploscast-a-podcast-on-on-science-academia-and-the-future-of-scholarship/" target="_blank">c<strong>ollaboration and publications</strong></a> with <strong><a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/Cameron.Neylon" target="_blank">Cameron Neylon</a></strong>, formerly PLOS’ Advocacy Director. Part of this conversation covered bioRxiv, prior to that preprint server’s current phase of rapid growth. The second year began with an interview with James Fraser from UCSF on preprints and their ability to help <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/10/24/the-power-of-preprints-an-interview-with-james-fraser/" target="_blank">authors stake a claim</a></strong> on ideas, methods or results. The interview with Polka marks the beginning of year three for PLOScast; as with the rest of the scientific community, preprints are an increasingly central part of PLOS’ conversation on how to move science communication forward.</p>
<p>To mark this achievement milestone for PLOScast, we have a new icon that’s fun and quirky yet at its core remains PLOS. We leave listeners around the globe with the top five favorites of the PLOScast crew:</p>

<p>Moving along the treadmill of life, many of us succumb to the ever-present pressures to be faster, stronger, more efficient, and smarter. Perspective on what is happening in our lives is lost. We focus on failure and lacking within ourselves, rather than the abundance and opportunities for growth that surround us.</p>
<p>We stop taking the time to appreciate the simple pleasures of our lives as we spiral our way into a depleted existence—physically, emotionally, and mentally. Now more than ever, there is a global need to circumvent this pattern of being. We need to learn to unconditionally love and appreciate ourselves just as we are, how we are.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, it was believed the cause of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/04/less-stress-less-psychosis/">stress</a>, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/02/mindfulness-for-children-may-prevent-anxiety-and-mental-illness/">anxiety</a>, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/20/a-scientific-review-of-hbo-documentary-film-my-depression/">depression</a> was attributable to genetic disposition, personality traits, the existence of stressful events, physical health problems, and substance abuse, as well as serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine imbalances within the brain. Whilst this is largely still the case, this perception has altered over the last decade or so.</p>
<p>In our fast-paced world, we judge ourselves as harshly as we judge others. We are encouraged and manipulated to compete with others with whom we continually compare ourselves. We try so hard to emulate or exceed expectations placed upon us that we forget our personal needs in the process (no time for that!). Stress and anxiety often manifest as a result as we try and prove our worth to the world, and depression looms when we judge ourselves as falling short of the benchmark that is set for us to achieve.</p>
<p>Prolonged periods of stress wreak havoc on the human mind and body. Chronic muscle tension leads to tension headaches and migraines. The cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine systems become over-taxed and the risk increases for the development of diseases like <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/03/can-an-anti-asthma-drug-rejuvenate-the-brain/">asthma</a>, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/19/link-between-diabetes-and-alzheimers-disease/">type 2 diabetes</a>, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/21/cartoon-nuts-reduce-heart-disease-and-death/">heart disease</a> (just to name a few).</p>
<p>In recent times the media has reported stress, anxiety, and depression as reaching epidemic proportions, reportedly attributable to numerous causes including an increase in hours in front of computer screens, national and cultural competitiveness, the exposure to a broadening range of choices due to advances in technology, and the belief that worthiness is related to monetary success.  Additionally, there is a sense of “collective stress” in regards to issues such as climate change and terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness &amp; Self-Reflection </strong></p>
<p>Whilst living a faster pace, society has forgotten the art of living in the present moment, and yet there is much evidence to support that engaging in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/">mindfulness </a>and self-reflection enables sufferers to break the cycle of anxiety, stress, and depression as it promotes a greater sense of well-being and perspective.</p>
<p>Those who engage in the art of mindfulness and self-reflection can improve their ability relate to the world around them in a more compassionate and empathetic manner.  A feeling of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/26/learning-how-to-practice-being-grateful-and-reap-the-benefits/">gratitude</a>, joy, and abundance is also often a pleasant side effect.</p>
<p><strong>The Value of Meditation &amp; Journaling </strong></p>
<p>Studies have shown that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/03/writing-away-your-worries/">journaling </a>can positively impact a person’s mental health as it allows one to “capture” a thought for long enough to acquire a 360-degree perspective on what that thought is about, where it came from, and how acting on that thought might impact those around us.</p>
<p>Many forms of meditation, like mindfulness meditation, work particularly well with journaling as it takes the mind out of a conscious, judgmental state and into a reflective, sub-conscious state. Such meditative practices smooth the path for writing down thoughts and feelings by prompting less judgment of the thoughts being written down.</p>
<p>Meditative practice can be merely taking five minutes to go for a walk in the park or to focus on breathing patterns—anything that promotes being in the present moment. Likewise, there are many effective journaling techniques that may help people with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/31/meditate-to-learn-compassion/">self-reflection</a> and mindfulness that work well with meditation, and they are not restricted just to writing.</p>
<p>For many, mindfulness can be achieved through writing, art, photography – any means that allows a person to step into a reflective zone. It is for an individual to explore what takes them to that special place where they can set down their emotional and mental baggage to touch base with their soul, and nurturing a sense of gratitude and appreciation for all the simple attainable pleasures within day to day life.</p>

<p>If a friend sees you suffering and tells you “<i>I feel your pain</i>”, it may be more than an expression of empathy. For about a quarter of people, it could be literally true. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759805">recent study</a>, led by Thomas Grice-Jackson at the University of Sussex, found that 27 per cent of participants experienced so-called “mirror pain” – watching someone falling off a bicycle or receiving an injection, for instance, caused them to experience physical pain of their own.</p>
<p>Now in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00507/full">a paper</a> in <i>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</i>, the same team of researchers has explored the neurological underpinnings of mirror pain. When some people have this experience, they don’t just show more activity in the so-called “pain matrix” (the network of brain regions linked to the experience of pain), they also show unusual patterns of neural activity that suggest they struggle to distinguish other people’s experience from their own.</p>
<p><span id="more-32595"></span></p>
<p>The researchers studied 44 participants, 18 men and 26 women, who had completed a survey that involved watching 16 movies depicting people experiencing injections and sports injuries, and reporting whether they experienced any pain themselves, and if so, what it was like.</p>
<p>Twenty-one of the participants had said they didn’t experience any pain sensations; 13 others were “Sensory/Localiser responders” – they experienced a discrete pain in the same body locations as the injured people in the videos; and the rest were “Affective/General responders” – they described a more whole-body response. For the last group, watching someone getting hurt may trigger a general “nauseating” kind of pain, for example.</p>
<p>The researchers used fMRI to scan all these participants’ brains while they looked at a series of 16 images depicting hands and feet suffering a variety of everyday painful incidents (like fingers being caught in a car door) as well as similar but pain-free images (like a hand closing a car door). After each image, they were asked to rate how much pain they’d experienced, if any.</p>
<p>The researchers expected the Sensory/Localiser types to show more activity in the somatosensory cortices (neural areas involved in processing touch) whereas the Affective/General volunteers would show more activity in affective, motivational brain regions, like the anterior insula. In fact, they didn’t find this. When witnessing pain, both types of mirror pain volunteers showed greater activity in all these regions than the non-responders.</p>
<p>However, differences between the mirror-pain subgroups emerged in the way that different parts of their brains communicated with each other. When the Sensory/Localiser group witnessed painful incidents, there was greater communication between the anterior insula and the right temporal-parietal junction (rTPJ) regions of their brains, for example. There is evidence from other studies that the rTPJ is involved in representations of the self and “other”. “Our explanation of the Sensory/Localised group is that they systematically fail to attribute shared bodily representations to others,” the researchers wrote. There were hints of distinct patterns of neural communication for the other subgroup, but the researchers admitted: “The explanation for the Affective/General group is presently lacking.”</p>
<p>The research highlights how there is great variety in our experience of seeing other people in pain. But it’s clear we are only just beginning to understand the brain basis of these different ways of empathising.</p>

<p>We are the only species on the planet known to practice religion. This feature is universal among humans: there is no nation on Earth that does not practice one or another form of spiritual belief.</p>
<p>The question is what makes our brain different so that we practice <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/11/does-spirituality-and-religion-guard-against-depression/">spirituality</a>? Does religion serve any purpose to our species in terms of benefiting survival and progress? These questions are very philosophical. Many thinkers believe that religiosity is what distinguishes <em>Homo sapiens</em> from the rest of the animal kingdom and brought our species to dominate this planet. On the other hand, a large numbers of thinkers believe that religion impedes progress and keeps our society in a barbaric state. There is no doubt that religion played a very important role in early human history: providing the first explanations for the existence of the world around us. The need for such explanation highlights an important step in the development of the brain and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/15/brain-training-can-we-really-enhance-our-cognitive-skills/">cognitive </a>processes.</p>
<p>Behavioral traits might become strengthened by evolution if they bring survival benefits. Researchers think that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/29/neurological-basis-of-altruism/">altruism</a>, for instance, is this kind of behavioral trait: it might be disadvantageous for a particular individual at a particular instance, but it brings advantages to the species in general. Altruistic behavior is promoted by the majority of the world’s religions. Therefore, religious practices might have provided evolutionary advantages for early humans in terms of survival too.</p>
<p>Some people are so deeply religious that the system of beliefs they practice shapes their whole life. It would be reasonable to assume that something interesting should be going on in their brain. It is also quite likely that these brain processes are different from the processes in the brains of unbelievers. This is what the new science of neurotheology is aiming to study. Neurotheology investigates the neural correlates of religious and spiritual beliefs. Such studies may help to uncover why some people are more inclined towards spirituality, while others remain deeply skeptical about the whole idea of God’s existence.</p>
<p>There are already some interesting findings from the field of neuroscience that can help to open the window into the spiritual brain.</p>
<p>First, there is no single part of the brain which is “responsible” for an individual’s relationship with their God/s. Like any emotionally intense human experience, religious experiences involves multiple parts and systems of the brain. Several experiments with the use of brain scanners confirm this point of view. In one study, Carmelite nuns were asked to remember their most intense mystical experience while neuroimaging of their brain was conducted. The loci of activation in this experiment were observed in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, right middle temporal cortex, right inferior and superior parietal lobules, right caudate, left medial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, left insula, left caudate, and left brainstem.</p>
<p>Similarly, an fMRI study on religious Mormon subjects found areas of activation in the nucleus accumbens, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and frontal attentional regions. The nucleus accumbens is the brain area associated with reward. It is also involved in emotional responses to  love, sex, drugs, and music. One recent study also identified a number of changes in regional cortical volumes that are associated with several components of religiosity, such as an intimate relationship with God and fear of God.</p>
<p>It appears likely that life-changing religious experiences may be linked to changes in brain structure. For instance, one study demonstrated that the brains of older adults who reported such experiences feature a degree of hippocampal atrophy. Hippocampal atrophy is an important factor in the development of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/">depression</a>, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/22/older-age-dementia-and-circadian-rhythms/">dementia</a>, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/15/environmental-factors-in-development-of-alzheimers-disease/">Alzheimer’s disease</a>. It remains unclear exactly how structural changes in the brain and the level of religiosity relate to each other.</p>
<p>It is well known that some drugs simulate spiritual experiences. For instance, psilosybin, the active ingredient in “<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/22/magic-mushrooms-for-mental-health/">magic mushrooms</a>”, stimulates temporal lobes and mimics religious experiences. This implies that spirituality is rooted in neuronal physiology. It is no wonder that psychoactive compounds are often used in ritualistic and shamanistic practices around the world.</p>
<p>All studies that involve brain imaging of people in specific states suffer from one major limitation: it is hard to be sure that people are actually in that particular state at the time of measurement. For instance, if we measure the brain activity when a subject is supposed to solve a mathematical task, we can’t be 100% sure that his or her mind is not wondering around instead of focusing on the task. The same applies to the measurement of any spiritual state. Therefore, the patterns of brain activation obtained through brain imaging should not be viewed as ultimate proof of any theory.</p>
<p>Various religious practices have the potential to influence our health, in both positive and negative directions. It was noted that religious people, in general, have a lower risk of anxiety and depression. This, in turn, is linked to a stronger immune system. On the other hand, people engaged in religious struggles might experience the opposite effects. Research into the brain’s response to religious practices might help to develop further our understanding of the connection between health and spirituality.</p>

<p>Medicinal plants still comprise a nebulous cloud in biomedical science. We know they have been used since the dawn of man, but there are precious few good quality scientific studies that support their use. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, plant medicines consist of many different molecules that interact together in the body to have a variety of, poorly understood, pharmacological effects. Despite variably successful attempts to identify single molecules in plants for drug development, we should acknowledge that the whole is greater than a single part. There is an increasing number of clinical studies which strongly imply that root, leaf, and flower extracts of medicinal plants can influence the brain and are effective at treating cognitive disorders. This article series will examine plants where we have double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to support their medicinal influence on the human brain.</p>
<p><strong>St. John’s wort</strong> is a commonly known plant that is native to Europe and yields bright yellow flowers. Its name comes from flowering around St. John’s day on the 24th June. St. John’s wort has been used as long ago as the ancient Greeks, and the physician Dioscorides (40–90AD) used it in the treatment of sciatica. However, St. John’s wort has become known as less of a treatment for nerve pain and more so for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/12/sad-and-in-pain-the-link-between-migraine-and-depression/">depression</a>, with multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled trials confirming its antidepressant properties. Authors typically compare St. John’s wort with mainstream anti-depressant drugs and find it has a preferable side effects profile. It is not without its downsides however, as excessive use has been linked to serotonin syndrome, sun sensitivity, and easy skin burning, and more generally with increased pharmaceutical drug metabolism by the liver. This means St. John’s wort may not be suitable for applications alongside other pharmaceutical drugs, and it is contraindicated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p><strong>American skullcap</strong> is a member of the mint family that is native to North America and grows wild in meadows and swamps. It was used by the Native Americans as a sedative and America’s 19<sup>th</sup> century physicians, the Eclectics, widely used the herb for complaints involving an overactive nervous system such as insomnia, anxiety, and epilepsy. A human double-blind, placebo-controlled study supports skullcap’s application against <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/04/phobias-part-ii-new-social-anxiety-treatments-mdma-testosterone-less-serotonin/">anxiety</a>, and a mood elevating effect has also been noted. Herbalist’s view both St. John’s wort and American skullcap as ‘nervine tonics’, meaning that they act upon the nervous system medicinally and are also considered to have a long-term renewing effect. While, this claim is yet to be verified by scientific studies, it certainly warrants further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Ashwagandha</strong>, the root of which is a popular home remedy in India, is a plant native to India that is mentioned in the traditional Ayurvedic medical text, the <em>Charaka Samhita</em>, approximately 2000 years ago. Here it is recommended as a tonic for emancipation, reproductive ability, and longevity. In Ayurveda, it is classified as a ‘rasayana herb’, a class of plant that are considered to restore and support long-term health and that overlaps to some degree with the Western definition of a ‘tonic herb’. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled human studies support ashwagandha’s role in the reduction of anxiety. It’s wide-ranging medicinal properties are supported by two additional well-controlled, human clinical studies on <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/11/13/pain-in-osteoarthritis/">osteoarthritis</a> and subclinical hypothyroidism. The emerging picture is that ashwagandha possesses a wide range of medicinal properties that will likely be better understood in the future. Ashwagandha has been well-tolerated across clinical trials, with a side effect profile similar to placebo.</p>

<p>In the world we humans spend a great deal of time connected to the internet, this is especially true for younger people – who are growing up surrounded by this technology. You can see this huge change over time in graph from Our World in Data below!</p>

<p>Increasingly, researchers and companies are leveraging this remote access to behaviour to answer questions about how humans behave. Companies have been collecting ‘user data’ for years from online platforms, and using this inferred information about people to improve user experience, and in some cases sell more products to the correct people. The amount of data we are able to collect on behaviour is expanding exponentially, and at the same time so is the quality and modality of this data – as people connect different devices (like activity monitors, clocks, fridges). Wearable sensors are becoming particularly more frequent – often this data is stored using internet-based services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/3370/wearable-device-forecast/" title="Infographic: The Predicted Wearables Boom Is All About The Wrist | Statista"><img alt="Infographic: The Predicted Wearables Boom Is All About The Wrist | Statista" class="aligncenter" height="auto" src="https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_3370_Wearable_device_forecast_n.jpg" width="100%" /></a><br />

<p>Psychology and cognitive science is starting to catch up on this trend, as it offers the ability to carry out controlled experiments on a much larger scale. This offers the opportunity to characterise subtle differences, that would be lost in the noise of small samples tested in a lab environment.</p>
<p>However, for many the task of running an online experiment is daunting; there are so many choices, and dealing with building, hosting and data processing can be tricky!</p>
<h1>Web Browsers</h1>
<p>A good starting point, and often the most straightforward, is building experiments to work in a web browser. The primary advantage of this is that you can run experiments on the vast majority of computers, and even mobile devices, with no installation overhead. There are some limitations though:</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Internet Explorer - sigh" class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn.discourse.org/sitepoint/uploads/default/21195/0bc6a8ea7fc9f167.jpg" width="70%" /></p>
<p>With multiple different web browsers, operating systems, and devices, the possible combinations number in the 1000s. This can lead to unexpected bugs and errors in your experiment. A workaround is to restrict access to a few devices (see below for tips on how to do this in JavaScript) – but this is traded off with how many participants you would like to access.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy: </strong></p>
<p>Web browsers were not designed to run reaction time experiments in, or present stimulus with millisecond precision. Despite this, some research has shown equivalent precision for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0678-9">Reaction Time</a>, and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109812">Stimulus Presentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you are very concerned still, you may utilise<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API"> WebGL</a>, a web graphics engine, which allows you to gain analogous presentation times to native programs, and even use a computer’s graphics card. Although this will be limited by the operating system and hardware of the user!</p>
<p>There are a number of tools that can help you with browser experiments. From fee-paying services like <a href="https://gorilla.sc/">Gorilla</a>, which deals with task building, hosting and data management for you, to fully open source projects like <a href="http://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a>, and <a href="http://www.psychopy.org/online/fromBuilder.html">PsychoPy’s PsychoJS</a> – which deal with building experiments and data, but not hosting (although <a href="https://discourse.psychopy.org/t/wellcome-trust-funding-psychopy-is-going-properly-online/2809">there are plans to develop a hosting and data storage solution</a>). All of these offer a graphical user-interface, which allows experiments to be built without any prior knowledge of programming!</p>
<h1>Unity</h1>
<p><img alt="unity" class=" alignright" src="https://answers.unity.com/storage/temp/56640-screenshot-2015-10-21-15-35-36.png" width="70%" /></p>
<p>One intermediate tool – which we are currently using – is cross platform development environment called <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. Whilst originally intended for creating video-games, Unity can be repurposed for creating experimental apps. The large advantage is an easy capability to build to a vast variety of operating systems and platforms with minimal effort: a Unity project can be built for a web browser, iOS app, Android app, Windows, OSX, Linux…. and so on. You can also gain access to sensor information on devices (hear rate monitors, step counting, microphone, camera), to start to access the richness of information contained in these devices.</p>
<p>The utility of this tool for experimental research is huge, and apparently appears to be under-utilised – it has an easy to learn interface, and requires minimal programming knowledge.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Whilst this post is largely non-instructional, hopefully it has shed some light on the potential tools you can use to start running research online (without employing an expensive web or app developer), or hopefully just piqued your interest a tiny bit.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>There’s been a lot of talk of the crisis in psychology. For decades, and often with the best of intentions, researchers have engaged in practices that have made it likely their results are “false positives” or not real. But that was in the past. The crisis is ending. “We do not call the rain that follows a long drought a ‘water crisis’,” write Leif Nelson at UC Berkeley and Joseph Simmons and Uri Simonsohn at the University of Pennsylvania. “We do not call sustained growth following a recession an ‘economic crisis'”.</p>
<p>In their paper, <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011836">due for publication in the <em>Annual Review of Psychology</em></a>, the trio observe that had any psychologists been in hibernation for the last seven years, they would not recognise their field today. The full disclosure of methods and data, the pre-registration of studies, the publication of negative findings, and replication attempts – all of which help reduce risk of false positives – have increased immeasurably. “The improvements to our field have been dramatic,” they write. “This is psychology’s renaissance.”</p>
<p>As well giving the field of psychology a pep talk, their paper provides a useful review of how we got to this point, the reasons things are getting better, and the ongoing controversies.</p>
<p><span id="more-32642"></span></p>
<p><strong>The crisis before the renaissance </strong></p>
<p>Nelson and his colleagues believe that starting in 2011, several key developments led to psychology entering a period of self-reflection about its methods. First, a weird, controversial study was published in a prestigious journal. It applied widely used statistical methods to demonstrate “transparently outlandish” effects (our regrettably gullible coverage at the time: “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/11/12/dramatic-study-shows-participants-are-affected-by-psychological-phenomena-from-the-future/">Dramatic study shows participants are affected by psychological phenomena from the future</a>“).</p>
<p>The same year there were several <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/07/03/fake-data-or-scientific-mistake/">fraud scandals</a>. There was also Nelson and his colleagues’ own <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417632">influential paper</a> demonstrating how easy it was to use selective reporting and strategic data analysis to extract a ridiculous positive result from random data (in this case, listening to music was shown to decrease your age). They called this approach p-hacking, which is a reference to the fact that psychologists frequently use a statistic known as the p-value – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/09/made-it-an-uncanny-number-of-psychology-findings-manage-to-scrape-into-statistical-significance/">specifically whether it is below 0.05</a> – to determine whether their result is statically significant or not. Not long after, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/">a survey</a> of psychology researchers showed that “questionable research practices” indicative of p-hacking were commonplace.</p>
<p>Nelson and his colleagues believe that p-hacking helps explain how for several decades psychologists have used underpowered studies with too few participants, and yet succeeded in publishing countless positive results (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/04/10/serious-power-failure-threatens-the-entire-field-of-neuroscience/">a similar problem afflicts neuroscience</a><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/04/10/serious-power-failure-threatens-the-entire-field-of-neuroscience/">a similar problem afflicts neuroscience</a>). “P-hacking has long been the biggest threat to the integrity of our discipline,” they write. Researchers have prodded and pushed their results, dropping participants here, running new trials there, selectively reporting just those conditions that seemed to work. For years, the prevailing ethos was that to succeed you do what you can to extract a positive finding from your experiments.</p>
<p>P-hacking could explain why <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">so many famous findings in psychology have failed to replicate</a>, often when tested under more rigorous conditions. But this is open to debate, and in some cases ill-tempered argument (the authors of past studies that haven’t replicated have sometimes bristled at the suggestion that they did not conduct their studies robustly enough, or that their findings are not real).</p>
<p>Nelson and his colleagues believe all sides can agree that most researchers are honest and well-intentioned. As self-confessed former p-hackers, they write that “p-hacking is not categorised as such by the researcher who is doing it. It is not something that malevolent researchers engage in while laughing maniacally.” Regardless of how frequent p-hacking has been, Nelson et al. hope that everyone recognises that it’s better to reduce p-hacking. Or put differently, that it’s better to do science in a way that reduces the risk of false-positives.</p>
<p><strong>The renaissance begins</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, a consensus seems to have emerged around this position. Amidst all the drama, a revolution is underway. A key player is the psychologist Brian Nosek at the University of Virginia who helped launch the <a href="https://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a>, an online platform that makes it easy to share methods and data online, and then in 2013 he co-founded the Center for Open Science (read <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/05/20/a-replication-tour-de-force/">our</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">coverage</a> of some of the large-scale replication efforts organised by the Center).</p>
<p>Other positive changes include key journals such as <em>Psychological Science</em> and <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> implementing the requirement for researchers to disclose all of their measures and manipulations. Even better, pre-registration of methods (publishing your planned methods and hypotheses before you collect your data) is becoming easier and more widespread (two key sites for this are <a href="https://aspredicted.org">AsPredicted.org</a> and the <a href="https://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a>), and an increasing number of journals now publish “registered reports”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/20/psychology-registration-revolution">a cause championed by psychologist Chris Chambers in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>“We expect that in 3-5 years, published pre-registered experimental psychology studies will be either common or extremely common,” write Nelson et al. Some have complained that pre-registered stifles scientific exploration, but Nelson’s team counter “it does not preclude exploration, but it does communicate to readers that it occurred”.</p>
<p>There has also been a welcome “surge of interest” in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/11/11/a-recipe-for-attempting-to-replicate-existing-findings-in-psychology/">replicating</a> previous studies – one of the main ways to uncover and address the possible effects of p-hacking on previously published research (according to the <a href="http://curatescience.org">CurateScience</a> database, 96 per cent of over 1000 replication attempts have been conducted since 2011). With regard to the debates that often ensue after a failed replication attempt (such as whether the replication was similar enough to the original), Nelson et al. propose a compromise: “the burden of proof is on the researcher espousing the least plausible claim”.</p>
<p>For instance, if the author of the original finding complains that the replication study took place on a different day of the week (and that’s why it didn’t work), it’s beholden on her or him to demonstrate why day of the week should moderate the effect that they originally claimed to have uncovered. On other hand, if the replicators used an obviously inferior manipulation (e.g. in a study testing the effects of hunger, they used just a few minutes without food to induce hunger), it’s up to them to show that the lack of effect persists when hunger is induced in more robust fashion. “Neutral observers often agree on who has the burden of proof,” write Nelson et al.</p>
<p>Another issue for psychology’s renaissance is how to categorise a replication attempt as a success or failure. In fact, Nelson et al. explain how this is often not straight forward and in many cases it is more fair and accurate to interpret unsuccessful replications as inconclusive.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing debates</strong></p>
<p>Other issues going forward include finding optimal ways to check the veracity of collections of prior studies, such as through using a statistical technique known as “p-curve analysis”. No one approach is flawless. More also needs to be done to check for innocent errors (which are extremely common) and outright fraud (thankfully rare, although Nelson’s team say that “for every case of fraud that is identified, there are almost certainly may more that are not”).</p>
<p>One of the simplest solutions is simply to require researchers to post their data and materials online. “Public data posting not only allows others to verify the accuracy of the analyses, but also incentivises authors to more carefully avoid errors,” write Nelson and his colleagues.</p>
<p>Some readers may be surprised that Nelson et al. don’t welcome all the efforts at reform in psychology. For instance, many have called for a greater emphasis on meta-analyses, in which the findings from many studies are combined. But Nelson’s group argue that this can make matters worse – for instance, biases in the studies can accumulate rather than cancel each other out. “The end result of a meta-analysis is as strong as the weakest link; if there is some garbage in, there is <em>only</em> garbage out.”</p>
<p>Nelson’s team are also sceptical of those who say psychology should <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/14/reformers-say-psychologists-should-change-how-they-report-their-results-but-does-anyone-understand-the-alternative/">ditch p-value based significance testing for other metrics, such as confidence intervals and Bayesian results</a>. “It is not the [particular] statistic that causes the problem, it is the mindlessness [with which they are relied upon].”</p>
<p><strong>“The Enlightenment is just around the corner”</strong></p>
<p>These are healthy debates and they will continue for years to come. For now though, let’s join Nelson and his co-authors in recognising the positive and welcome changes underway in psychological science. “Practices that promise to increase the integrity of our discipline – replications, disclosure, pre-registration – are orders of magnitude more common than they were just a short time ago. And although they are not yet common enough, it is clear that the Middle Ages are behind us, and the Enlightenment is just around the corner.”</p>

<p>When we are confronted with the acts of excessive and unprovoked violence, we can’t help but wonder what is wrong with individuals committing such crimes. Think of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/04/18/mass-murderer-psychology-the-patterns-of-horror/">serial killers</a>: what motivates them? Both researchers and society, in general, have wanted to know how to explain the extreme brutality observed in some people. In most cases, they have no mental disorders that could explain their behavior. Even without going to the extremes, most of us did at some point in life come across people whose level of aggressiveness seemed beyond any reasonable explanation. Think of a hooligan looking for any excuse to pick a fight and beat someone up. Or a young boy torturing a defenseless animal with a smile on his face.  Multiple theories were invented to this end, ranging from religious explanations (satanic possession) to scientific and psychological theories that involve a variety of mental disorders or problems with brain development.</p>
<p>The idea that excessive aggressiveness and criminal tendency might be heritable traits gained popularity with the publication of Dr. Cesare Lombroso’s book “Criminal Man” in 1878. In the book, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/18/decoding-the-neural-pathway-from-psychopathy-to-serial-murder/">Lombroso </a>introduced the concept of the “born criminal”. He also developed the field of criminal anthropology that studied specific anatomical differences between normal and criminal individuals. Lombroso’s theory contributed to the science of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/15/star-wars-yesterdays-sci-fi-is-todays-reality/">eugenics </a>that played a crucial role in the Nazi ideology of selective breeding of a superior race and the policy of exterminating the <em>Untermenschen</em>.</p>
<p>Although Lombroso was eventually proven wrong, the concept that criminal behavior might be linked with genes survived. Evidence that criminal and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/03/who-is-and-is-not-a-violent-sexual-offender/">violent behaviors </a>run in some families was a particularly strong argument to investigate the issue further. These investigations produced rather interesting discoveries.</p>
<p>The question to what degree the predisposition for crime might be genetically determined was first answered by a twin study performed in Denmark. Twins are ideal subjects for genetic research: identical twins have exactly the same sets of genes, while non-identical twins are as similar to each other as usual brothers and sisters. However, both identical and non-identical twins, if brought up together, can be considered as having the same upbringing. The study compared the rate of crime offenses among the identical twins with this rate in non-identical twins. It turned out that a Danish man with an identical twin who has a criminal record is 50% more likely to be an offender himself, as compared with the average Danish man. In non-identical twins, the chances of both of them having the criminal records are 15-30% higher than the average for the population. The findings definitely point to a degree of genetic predisposition. In addition, another study performed in Sweden has shown that when the identical twins were brought up separately, the chances of developing a criminal career were higher among children from parents with criminal records, even when the children were brought up in law-abiding adopted families.</p>
<p>Twin studies can detect correlations but certainly can’t help in finding out which genes are behind these correlations. The study performed in the Netherlands provided important information on the possible identity of such genes. Researchers have studied genetic defects in one particular family with 14 males spanning 4 generations that displayed an unusually high level of aggression and criminal offenses. The subjects in question had very low IQ (around 85) and were prone to impulsive behavior and physical and sexual violence. The researchers found a specific hereditary defect in the family: the gene for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/12/06/the-science-of-raising-a-friendly-psychopath/">monoamine oxidase A</a> (MAOA) was mutated. Mutation prevented the enzyme from working properly. This is important as this enzyme is responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline. A lack of MAOA activity leads to the rising of neurotransmitter levels in the brain and they, in turn, cause the over-excitation of neurons. The gene for MAOA is located on the X chromosome, and this explains why high levels of aggression were observed only in males. Meanwhile, females have a second X chromosome with the non-mutated functional version of the gene.</p>
<p>An important question, which sparked fierce ethical debate, is to what extent criminal behavior might indeed be genetically programmed. This is a classic discussion of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/12/06/the-science-of-raising-a-friendly-psychopath/">nature vs nurture</a>. To what extent do our genes make us who we are? We easily accept the fact that some people are born smarter or physically stronger than the rest of us. We know that genes are involved in making these individuals who they are. Genes responsible for stronger muscles or better brain connections allow these people to excel where others may struggle. Nonetheless, the idea that some of us are born with a predisposition for a higher level of aggression or reduced empathy appears very unpalatable to many people. However, this idea makes perfect biological sense. We evolved as hunter-gatherers, and at this stage of our evolutionary history, aggressiveness was crucially important for survival. Genetically, we didn’t change since the Stone Age. And this aggressiveness still plays an important role in our society, from competition in the workplace to multiple armed conflicts around the world. Aggression levels, like many other human behavioral traits, can be genetically determined to a degree. This means that there is variability: in some people, the level of aggressiveness is very low, while in others it can be quite high.</p>
<p>Aggressiveness still doesn’t equal crime: although violent crime requires a perpetrator to be aggressive, the two things are not the same. Social factors still play a key role when it comes to the expression of aggressive behavior. It works the same way with other genetic attributes. A born athlete will never reach his Olympic dream and could turn into a couch potato if they don’t train. Most scientists, even the very successful ones, are not born geniuses: they simply worked and studied hard. Similarly, people with a predisposition for higher levels of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/20/the-role-of-serotonin-and-glutamine-in-aggression/">aggression </a>are at higher risk of becoming criminals when they are exposed to the social factors that lead them in that direction.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical inactivity is the fourth-leading risk factor for global mortality, causing an estimated 3.2 million deaths around the world annually. Readers of this blog need no convincing that it’s important to be active every day. But is spending more time on it enough to reduce the risk of early death? Not necessarily. How we perceive this activity turns out to be just as important. We learn of this from the authors of an <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31316-001">intriguing study</a> in <i>Health Psychology</i> devoted to physical activity and mortality.</p>
<p><span id="more-32582"></span></p>
<p>Octavia Zahrt and Alia Crum at Stanford University were inspired by an <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/04/16/is-the-benefit-of-exercise-a-placebo-effect/">earlier experiment</a> involving hotel room attendants who completed a 20-minute intervention informing them that their daily work satisfied exercise recommendations and highlighting the benefits of this active lifestyle. This intervention not only shifted room attendants’ perceptions, but also resulted in health improvements including lower blood pressure and reductions in weight and body fat.</p>
<p>Zahrt and Crum examined data from 61,141 Americans (selected to be representative of the general population) to determine whether the way we think about our own physical activity could be of major and long-term significance for health. The data came from the US National Health Interview Survey and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which included questions assessing how much exercise individuals think they get compared with their peers. The surveys also asked respondents detailed questions about actual physical activity they had undertaken, and in some cases participants wore an accelerometer to measure their activity objectively. The researchers cross-checked these survey data against the National Death Index records as they stood 21 years after the exercise surveys had been completed.</p>
<p>As the researchers expected, perceived physical activity relative to peers was closely associated with risk of dying. Even after adjusting for actual levels of physical activity, individuals who perceived themselves as less active than others were up to 71 per cent more likely to die in the follow-up period than those who perceived themselves as more active. One can say with confidence that individuals’ perceptions about their level of physical activity were strongly related to their longevity, even after accounting for the effects of actual physical activity and other known determinants of mortality such as smoking or obesity.</p>
<p>There are a few potential explanations. A convincing one is that perceptions can affect motivation. For instance, a room attendant’s awareness that she is getting exercise at work might increase her confidence and commitment to a healthy lifestyle, and motivate her to act on this “active” identity. Conversely, longitudinal research shows that individuals who perceive themselves as unfit compared with their friends are less likely to exercise a year later.</p>
<p>Another potential mechanism is that perceptions can have emotional consequences. Public health messages often warn of the “life-threatening consequences” of physical inactivity. A person’s perception that she/he is inactive might thus lead to fear and stress about not getting enough exercise, with harmful consequences for health.</p>
<p>Still another explanation is that our positive beliefs and expectations can directly induce physiological responses, even following inert treatments, as shown by the placebo effect (similarly, negative expectations can lead to a harmful “nocebo effect”). Following this logic, participants in the current research who failed to realise that they were getting good exercise may not have experienced its full physiological benefits. Conversely, negative expectations related to the belief that one is not getting enough exercise could have become self-fulfilling because of nocebo-like effects.</p>
<p>Today we are not able to give a conclusive answer to the question of which of these mechanisms is most important. Perhaps a constellation of them? Or maybe there is another, unknown process involved.</p>
<p>Whatever the mechanisms at play, what do these results mean for mere mortals, and for those who are involved in promoting an active lifestyle? Instead of working out, should we stand in front of the mirror and repeat to ourselves “I’m an active and physically fit person”? To be clear, the authors warn that their findings don’t mean exercise is unimportant. Separate from the influence of our perceptions, physical activity continues to be a crucial determinant of health. However, a more thorough understanding of these results could help us optimise public health messages, finding the happy medium between highlighting that people need to exercise more, but not to the extent that they become downhearted about the exercise they do get.</p>
<p>Further studies will doubtlessly bring us more answers, but before that happens, let’s get up, walk away from the desk, and look at our activity with friendlier eyes than before.</p>

<p>
 Treatments that target immune checkpoints, such as the one mediated by programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, have been approved for treating human cancers with durable clinical benefit1,2. However, many cancer patients fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, and the underlying mechanism(s) is not well understood3–5. Recent studies revealed that response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade might correlate with PD-L1 expression levels in tumor cells6,7. Hence, it is important to mechanistically understand the pathways controlling PD-L1 protein expression and stability, which can offer a molecular basis to improve the clinical response rate and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in cancer patients. Here, we report that PD-L1 protein abundance is regulated by cyclin D-CDK4 and the Cullin 3SPOP E3 ligase via proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibition of CDK4/6 in vivo elevates PD-L1 protein levels, largely by inhibiting cyclin D–CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of SPOP and thereby promoting SPOP degradation by APC/CCdh1. Loss-of-function mutations in SPOP compromise ubiquitination-mediated PD-L1 degradation, leading to increased PD-L1 levels and reduced numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in mouse tumors and in primary human prostate cancer specimens. Notably, combining CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy enhances tumor regression and dramatically improves overall survival rates in mouse tumor models. Our study uncovers a novel molecular mechanism for regulating PD-L1 protein stability by a cell cycle kinase and reveals the potential for using combination treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade to enhance therapeutic efficacy for human cancers.

<p>Julia will present the paper by Naud et al (2008) 'Firing patterns in the AdEx IF model'.</p>
<p>In the article the authors explore the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model as a good tool to simulate large-scale spiking neuron networks.
They show that the AdEx model generates multiple firing patterns in response to the parameter values.
In order to describe the transition from one pattern to another, the phase diagrams are analysed in the article.
To further classify the firing patterns, the transient response to step current is studied.
The analytical solutions are given for continuous adaptation, initial bursting, regular bursting, tonic spiking and irregular spiking as a response to the constant current.
It is also concluded, that the network simulations of a large systems, such as thalamocortical, require the description of different neuron types.
Parameter sets for three neuron types are provided, but further work is needed to extend this to a larger number of neuron types.</p>
