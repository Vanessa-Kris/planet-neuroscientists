                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/24/the-brain-of-an-introvert/">The Brain of an Introvert</a></h4>

<p>In the age of social media, networking and global never-ending communication, introverts are often viewed as rather inefficient. They are considered as people who would not happily express their opinion during the staff meetings or actively participate in brainstorming sessions. They are often considered to not be good at multitasking or be particularly charismatic. They are rarely at the center of attention at a party, and they often ignore their smartphones for hours in a row. These days, when we believe that big tasks require the active participation of large groups of people working together, being an introvert could come as a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But don’t discard introverts altogether: some of the most successful people in the world are introverts. Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and even social media inventor Mark Zuckerberg are all self-confessed introverts. So how do these people who apparently lack some of the basic skills needed for a successful career manage to achieve so much? What makes the brain of an introvert so different and so special?</p>
<h2><font size="6">Being a loner has its upsides and downsides when it comes to health and success</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>It is well known that personality traits are not just the result of social conditioning – they have more to do with the genetics and brain structure. People are born or inherit specific personality traits quite like they inherit any particular physical parameters and characteristics. These personality traits bring their advantages and disadvantages. Studies have also demonstrated the anatomical difference between the introvert and extrovert brain. Imaging studies have shown the differences in both the grey matter and the white matter volumes in the various parts of the brain, thus confirming that personality traits are hard-wired into the brain.</p>
<p>Introverts do not like prolonged social interactions, and they feel uncomfortable in large social gatherings. Introverts don’t mind remaining isolated for extended periods. They love to think and dream. However, this self-imposed social isolation comes at a price. Lower social interaction increases the risk of certain disorders; it may negatively affect cognitive functioning, increase the risk of metabolic disorders, and negatively impact the immune system.</p>
<p>Extreme social isolation and its negative consequences are well studied. People living in orphanages or imprisoned for prolonged periods may go through periods of mental instability, and some may even experience hallucinations. However, being introverts is different, and self-imposed social isolation may not necessarily indicate idle brain or lack of resilience towards these health issues. The latest research studies show that these periods of being alone may have positive impacts on emotional and work life.</p>
<h2><font size="6">Focus on creativity</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>One of the benefits of being more focused on own thoughts is the improved creativity. Introverts are more open to different ideas; they may have a higher level of confidence and independence. Introverts are less concerned about what others may think. Studies have shown that prominent feature of both scientists and artists is the dislike for too much of social interaction: avoiding it leaves them with more time to focus on their ideas.</p>
<p>Introverts have more time to perfect their crafts than those who spend most of the time socializing. They have time to make sense of their thoughts and experiences. All this means that they have higher chances of achieving a eureka moment.</p>
<p>However, it should be understood that not every kind of social withdrawal is the same. Some type of non-socializing is an indicator of psychological and physical health issues. Social withdrawal may be due to shyness and anxiety, or it may be due to a dislike of socializing. Both may have a negative impact on health and would not necessarily better the creativity. On the other hand, those who socialize less just by choice (rather than due to anxiety or dislike) are more probable to be healthy and creative.</p>
<p>These findings are important, as earlier it was believed that unsociability can be harmful. Now the researchers demonstrated that unsociability might be even beneficial. Healthy introverts prefer to spend more time alone, but this does not mean a complete social withdrawal. They would usually have just enough of social interaction. Creative people prefer being alone, and at the same time, they spend enough time in the company of others.</p>
<p>The researchers also noticed that cultural differences may play an important role too. For instance, unsociable children in China had more academic problems in comparison to their Western counterparts. However, this difference is becoming less visible due to globalization.</p>
<p>There is a general belief that specific profession demand more sociable personality and extroverts are better in the leadership roles. However, this is not always accurate, and research shows that a lot depends on the collective nature of the employees. Introvert bosses are more successful if the employees are more sociable. On the other hand, extrovert bosses are better in a leadership role if the employees are less proactive.</p>
<h2><font size="6">Meditation, hermits, and health</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>If we look back into the human history, we understand that self-imposed isolation was commonly practiced by individual members of society. Hermits would practice solitude to achieve nirvana. Daydreaming in the absence of social interactions activates the so-called default mode of the brain. Thus, isolation helps in consolidating the memories and emotions, at least to a certain extent. Isolation helps a person in re-organizing thoughts. Interestingly, when people come out of self-imposed isolation, they are likely to socialize better and more effectively.</p>
<p>Researchers also warn that the boundary between the dangerous isolation and useful solitude is quite blurry. Extreme loneliness could be somewhat harmful or indicative of poor health. Practicing solitude to stay productive and creative does not mean being completely unsocial. On the other hand, there is a real danger for the physical and mental health of those who are never alone. Furthermore, research indicates that introverts have fewer but stronger bonds with others that lead to better satisfaction in life and greater happiness.</p>
<p>If a person does not like to socialize too much, there is nothing wrong with him or her. It is important that the solitude is a person’s choice and not forced upon him/her: even the classical introverts need few good friends.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/news-media-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worldwide</a>, 1 in 3 women experience some form of gender-related violence.  Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) doubles a woman’s risk of depression and alcoholism and can have an impact on her risk of AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and on her children’s health.</p>
<p>In its <a href="http://www2.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/csw/57/egm/report-of-the-egm-on-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls%20pdf.pdf?v=1&amp;d=20140917T100704" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> on prevention of violence against women and girls (VAWG), the UN Commission on the Status of Women named many stakeholders in prevention efforts.  Among these are mass and new media, which play a big part in contributing to and maintaining gender stereotypes that can lead to cultures of violence and victim-blaming.</p>
<p>In order for media to play a role in preventing VAWG, we must first understand how VAWG is currently reported.  A <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0621-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> published today in <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>BMC Women’s Health</em></a> used frame analysis to examine representation of VAWG in Ghanaian media.  Lead author Dr. Ebenezer Owusu-Addo of the <a href="https://www.knust.edu.gh/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kwame Nkrumah University of Science &amp; Technology, Ghana</a> explains the reasons for doing this study:</p>
<p>“The media has been identified as one of the key stakeholders that could help prevent VAWG through responsible news coverage that informs the public about the causes and effects of VAWG. However, to date, studies conducted on media coverage of VAWG have largely focused on high-income country settings such as the US, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada, leaving a major gap in the literature regarding media coverage of the issue in low- and middle-income country settings where VAWG is endemic. In this study, we examined how VAWG in Ghana, a lower-middle-income country, is framed by the media, and the implications of this for health promotion.”</p>
<h3><strong>What did the coverage look like?</strong></h3>
<p>In examining 48 news articles, Dr. Owusu-Addo and colleagues found that most reported incidents were covered only by a single, short article without any in-depth reporting.  The vast majority of the articles, 44 out of the 48, framed VAWG as individual incidents with no discussion of the broader social context.</p>
<blockquote><p>Defining the scope of the problem, as the authors have done here, is the first step in reducing VAGW …</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that 80% of the incidents examined in this study were forms of IPV, perpetrated by a spouse, fiancé, or other intimate partner, stems from prevailing attitudes in which “… the typical Ghanaian family is still a patriarchal institution. Currently, attitudes in Ghana about VAWG include men considering it a marital right to control and discipline their wives, and perceived culpability of women and girls for acts of violence meted out against them,” says Dr. Owusu-Addo.</p>
<p>He continues, “The most prevalent attitudes that maintain the status quo include harmful social norms arising from gendered culture which sees women and girls as subordinate to men and boys, respectively. For instance, married men are perceived to have unreserved sexual access to their wives, leading to various forms of sexual assaults against women.”</p>
<p>Other problematic trends identified in the studied articles included normalizing incidents of VAWG as commonplace, coverage that focused on the perpetrator as the subject and victim/survivor as the object of the news story, exoneration of perpetrators, and victim blaming.  These are largely comparable to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1557085113480824" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studies</a> conducted in high-income countries, suggesting that initiatives to change these trends could work across multiple settings.</p>
<h3><strong>Changing media coverage</strong></h3>
<p>When asked how the media could promote social change and support VAWG prevention initiatives, Dr. Owsu-Addo suggested that news coverage could “thematically frame VAWG by focusing on social construction of the issue, challenging gender/social norms that are inimical to prevention efforts, raising awareness about support services available to victims, and eliciting political will for investment of resources for health promotion interventions focusing on prevention of VAWG.”</p>
<p>He adds that “the ideal news coverage of VAWG that would promote social change and contribute to VAWG prevention efforts moves beyond primary sources of information such as perpetrators and criminal justice officials (which often lead to victim blaming) to utilizing the perspectives of VAWG experts/advocates and providing statistics which help contextualize and frame the issue thematically.”</p>
<p>Defining the scope of the problem, as the authors have done here, is the first step in reducing VAGW, which will have to be a joint effort by many stakeholders including policy makers, health professionals, journalists and advocates.</p>

<p>For decades, personality psychologists have noticed a striking, consistent pattern: extraverts are happier more of the time than introverts. For anyone interested in promoting wellbeing, this has raised the question of whether it might be beneficial to encourage people to act more extraverted. Evidence to date has suggested it might.</p>
<p>For example, regardless of their usual disposition, people tend to report feeling happier and more authentic whenever they are behaving more like an extravert (that is, more sociable, active and assertive). That’s a mere correlation that could be interpreted in different ways. But lab studies have similarly found that prompting people, including introverts, to act more like an extravert makes them feel happier and truer to themselves.</p>
<p>Before we all start doing our best extravert impressions in pursuit of greater happiness, though, a team of researchers led by Rowan Jacques-Hamilton at the University of Melbourne urge caution, writing in their new <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8ze6w/">pre-print</a> at <em>PsyArXiv</em> :</p>
<p>“Until we have a well-rounded understanding of both the positive and negative consequences of extraverted behaviour, advocating any real-world applications of acting extraverted could be premature and potentially hazardous.”</p>
<p>To help, these researchers have conducted the first ever randomised-controlled trial of an “act more extraverted” intervention, and unlike in previous research, they looked beyond the lab at the positive and negative effects of such an intervention on people’s feelings in daily life.</p>
<p><span id="more-34599"></span></p>
<p>Dozens of participants were allocated at random to either the “act like an extravert” condition or to an “act unassuming, sensitive, calm and modest” control condition (the idea was that this control condition would match the extravert condition for social desirability and the experience of being in an intervention, and that it would encourage the adoption of behaviours representative of several of the other main personality traits, such as agreeableness and emotional stability).</p>
<p>There was also a second control group who completed some of the same measures but who did not follow any instructions to change their behaviour.</p>
<p>The true aims of the study were concealed from the participants and they didn’t know about the conditions they weren’t in. For the extravert and first control groups, their challenge was to follow the behavioural instructions they’d been given for seven days straight whenever interacting with others in their daily lives (though not if doing so would be inappropriate for the situation they were in).</p>
<p>The participants completed baseline and follow-up surveys about their feelings and behaviour, and through the seven-day period of the study they also answered in-the-moment psychological surveys six times a day whenever prompted by their smart-phones. Their phones also gave them periodic reminders to alter their behaviour according to the condition they were in.</p>
<p>For the average participant, being in the “act like an extravert” condition, as compared to the first control condition, was associated with experiencing more positive emotions (excited, lively and enthusiastic), both in the moment, and in retrospect, when looking back on the week. Compared with the second control condition, the benefits to positive emotion were only seen retrospectively. On average, participants in the “act extraverted” condition also felt greater momentary and retrospective authenticity.  These benefits came without any adverse effects in terms of levels of tiredness or experience of negative emotion.</p>
<p>“Thus, the main effects of the intervention were wholly positive, and no costs of extraverted behaviour were detected for the average participant,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>At least in relation to their experience of more positive emotion, if not so much authenticity,  the advantages of being in the “act like extravert” group were to a large extent mediated by participants in this condition following the instructions and actually acting more extraverted more often (though interestingly, not with being in more social situations, suggesting a change in the quality of their social interactions, not the quantity of them).</p>
<p>However, the story does not end there because the researchers looked to see whether the apparently cost-free positive benefits of the “act extraverted” intervention also manifested for the introverts in their sample. Although previous research has suggested introverts and extraverts alike benefit just the same from acting more extraverted, this was not the case here.</p>
<p>First and unsurprisingly, introverts did not succeed in increasing their extraverted behaviour as much as other participants. And while the introverts in the “act like an extravert” condition did enjoy momentary gains in positive emotion, they did not report this benefit in retrospect at the end of the study. Unlike extraverts, they also did not show momentary gains in authenticity (it didn’t suffer either, though), and in retrospect they reported lower authenticity. The “act extraverted” intervention also appeared to increase introverts’ retrospective fatigue levels and experience of negative emotions.</p>
<p>Jacques-Hamilton and his team said that these were perhaps their most important findings – “dispositional introverts may reap fewer wellbeing benefits, and perhaps even incur some wellbeing costs, from acting more extraverted”. They also made an important point that strong introverts may not desire to experience positive emotions as frequently as extraverts.</p>
<p>The idea that introverts could gain something from learning to be more extraverted more often is not dead, though. Not just because this is only one study and more research is obviously needed, but also because those in the “act extraverted” condition did, after all, still report more positive emotions in the moment than the first control group. And their failure to do so in retrospect (and their purely retrospective reports of increased fatigue and inauthenticity) could possibly reflect a memory bias, mirroring earlier research that found introverts do not expect acting extraverted to make them feel good.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider was that this was a one-size-fits-all extraversion intervention that provided little guidance on how exactly to achieve the aim of acting more extraverted. It’s possible that a less intense version, together with support and guidance to make any behavioural changes become habitual (and therefore less effortful), could help even strong introverts enjoy the benefits of acting more extraverted than they would do normally. “By allowing more freedom to return to an introverted ‘restorative niche’, a less intensive intervention might also result in fewer costs to negative affect, authenticity and tiredness,” the researchers added.</p>

<p>In humans, vision is the major channel for receiving information about the world. The same applies to the majority of animals, even those that are nocturnal and have to rely more heavily on the inputs from other senses. There are, however, exceptions: some mammals use echolocation to construct a picture of their surroundings, effectively using it instead of vision. How effective is this method of gathering information, and can it substitute vision successfully?</p>
<h1><font size="6">Echolocation</font></h1><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>Echolocation is used by several kinds of animals for navigation in various environments. Whales, dolphins, and bats emit calls (high-frequency sounds) and then listen to the echoes returned from different objects surrounding them. The distance to objects can be estimated based on the time delay between the production of the call (click) and detection of the echo. Since the sound travels in the air with the speed of 340 m/s, a delay of 2 milliseconds, for instance, would mean that the object/target is about 34 cm away.  In addition, sounds travel faster in water than in the air, making the clicking signals produced by whales of shorter duration than the signals produced by bats. Some echolocation signals produced by dolphins and sperm whales are even audible to humans.</p>
<p>Echolocation and its importance in the animal kingdom have been widely studied. Nature provides remarkable examples of how efficient echolocation can be. Bats easily detect tiny insects several meters away in complete darkness. Some species of bats in China and South America can fish in the darkness using echolocation, detecting ripples on the water surface that are indicative of the presence of fish under the surface. Sperm whales use echolocation to find and catch prey, mostly giant squids, deep in the ocean. These whales can dive to the depth of well over 2 kilometers and navigate through underwater canyons where their prey lives.</p>
<p>Although echolocation can be very efficient, it is not particularly common in the animal kingdom and was, in fact, developed independently by several groups of evolutionarily unrelated species. This is markedly different from vision, which is present in the majority of animals, with mechanisms perfected over millions of years of uninterrupted evolution.</p>
<h1><font size="6">Echolocation and Vision in Bats</font></h1><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>If echolocation delivers essentially the same information as vision, can echolocation rely on the brain processes related to the processing of visual information?</p>
<p>To answer this question, scientists have investigated brain mechanisms underlying the processing of echo signals that allow animals to map objects in term of distance and direction.</p>
<p>Recently, an interesting study was conducted in bats with the aim of revealing what is happening in their brain while they fly through a room filled with obstacles (i.e., acoustically reflective plastic cylinders hanging from the ceiling). In order to determine the mechanisms underlying the bats’ navigation around these obstacles, researchers performed simultaneous chronological neural recordings.</p>
<p>The results show that the bats adjusted their flight and sonar behavior in order to respond to the echoes coming from the objects in the room. The objects’ positions were changing across the recording sessions, and bats started their flight from different start points to make sure that they didn’t rely on spatial memory from previous sessions and used only echo feedback to navigate.</p>
<p>The most important finding was the identification of the brain region that helped the animals to locate the objects in their environment. Echolocation signals were processed in the superior colliculus, a structure located in the midbrain. The superior colliculus consists of several layers that respond to different kinds of stimuli. Deeper layers of the superior colliculus are known to be involved in the processing of visual information. Thus, it seems that echolocation may indeed help animals to obtain a picture of their environment that is as authentic as the picture received through visual channels.</p>
<h1><font size="6">Echolocation and Vision in Humans</font></h1><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>According to scientists, echolocation is not a phenomenon completely alien to humans. It seems that some blind individuals can be trained in echolocation.</p>
<p>Using this technique, they can locate objects by generating mouth clicks and listening to their echoes. The returned echoes can provide them with important information such as position, distance to and even the size or shape of the objects.</p>
<p>Several studies were conducted in order to determine the underlying neural mechanisms involved in human echolocation. One study investigated two individuals skilled in echolocation, one early and one late blind. The authors of the study measured brain activity in both participants while they were listening to their own echo sounds. They compared brain activity with clicks that produced echoes with the brain activity of control sounds that did not result in echoes.</p>
<p>It turned out that the processing of echo sounds activates brain regions that are typically associated with vision rather than hearing.  More specifically, echo signals were processed in the visual cortex (rather than in superior colliculus like in bats and other echolocating animals). However, the processing of visual information in humans is centered around the visual cortex rather than the superior colliculus, as the human visual cortex has significantly expanded compared to most animals.</p>
<p>Thus, in both animals and humans, the information received through echolocation is processed in those regions that are also predominantly responsible for the processing of visual information. The curious examples of human echolocation are a perfect illustration of the plasticity of our brain and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances (blindness in this case).</p>
<p>A recent publication on echolocation in humans reviewed the applications of this phenomenon as well as the processes occurring in the brain of echolocation experts (i.e., individuals that are skilled in echolocation). They have reported that echolocation may enable blind people to sense small variations in the location, size, and shape of objects, or even to distinguish different materials the objects are made of, simply by listening to the echoes of their own mouth clicks.</p>
<p>It seems that echolocation may be perfected by blind individuals to facilitate the handling of daily tasks and achieving a higher degree of independence. Based on neuroimaging studies, the review confirmed that the processing of input signals from echoes activates the visual cortex, a brain part that would normally support vision in the sighted brain.</p>

<p>Workplace wellness programmes are an assemblage of wellbeing activities like yoga or cycling clubs, packaged together with diagnostic activities like biometric screenings; their aim is to reduce sickness, increase productivity and cut insurance costs for an organisation’s members. This is big business – in the USA, the market is around $8 billion – with a return-on-investment claim, thanks to a plethora of studies that tout the benefits of these programmes (for example, see this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075081">meta-analysis</a> from 2010). But whether staff enter these kind of initiatives in the first place is usually up to them, making it hard to evaluate their effectiveness, as those who choose to participate may differ in key ways from those who do not. To assess the benefits of the programmes accurately therefore requires a randomised-controlled study. This is what the National Bureau of Economic Research <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24229">published recently</a>, and it leaves these programmes looking sickly.</p>
<p><span id="more-34593"></span></p>
<p>Damon Jones and his team set up a staff wellness programme at the University of Illinois containing the three core elements of such programmes: a biometric screening to give an indicator of overall health and a health risk assessment to flag up specific risks for the individual and indicate routes to improvement. Finally there were the activities themselves, including programmes for weight management, guidance on smoking cessation and healthy workplace habits, and tai chi sessions. Over 12,000 university employees were invited, of which nearly 5,000 showed an interest and completed surveys covering their health status, health-care use, job satisfaction and productivity.</p>
<p>Around a third of these interested people were then randomly assigned to a control condition and received no further support. The others were invited to be screened, risk assessed, and then to take on the available wellness activities offered over two semesters. Finally, at the end of the academic year in July, one year after they first enrolled in the programme, the participants completed a follow-up survey covering the same topics as at baseline, plus some additional questions.</p>
<p>Sickness takes a toll on national economies – the cost to the US economy where this research was conducted is <a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/pr/2015/worker-illness-and-injury-costs-us-employers-225-billion-annually">over $200 billion per year</a>. Based on the new evidence, do wellness programmes show promise in making a dent in it? Unfortunately not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Compared to the control group, participants in the programme did not take significantly fewer sick days. Nor were they more likely to stay in their job, nor get a promotion or get a pay hike. They didn’t spend any less on medication or hospital visits, undermining the financial rationale in reducing medical insurance claims (or in the UK, burden on the health service). And those in the programme showed no improvement in health behaviours such as using the gym or taking part in a popular annual running event. A few effects proved statistically significant – feeling subjectively happier at work and one measure of job satisfaction – but the remaining 37 measures were non-significant.</p>
<p>It seems that the past studies that <i>did</i> find effects have been riding on a selection effect due to the kind of people who choose to get involved in such programmes.</p>
<p>Looking at the 7,000-plus people who declined to engage in the wellness programme on offer in the current study, we see they were, on average, older and had either more medical spend than average, or were zero-spenders on health (i.e. suggesting either unusually poor or good health prior to the start of the study). Those who signed up and were enrolled in the programme, but dropped out, were also more likely to be either high-spenders or zero-spenders on their health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These group differences in health were mirrored in income, where those who didn’t engage in the programme tended to be rather wealthy or poor. Those who did engage were already, before the study, much more likely to be active at the gym or go running.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To summarise, those staff most inclined to opt to take part in the wellness programme were active, fairly young, and moderately well-off, with little evidence of chronic health problems. If these patterns generalise to the opt-in patterns at other organisations, it makes it unsurprising that prior wellbeing programme research (that hasn’t used a randomised design) has tended to find good health outcomes for participants – they would probably be doing well regardless.</p>
<p>This stringently-designed study suggests that there is no “return on investment” case for these programmes, at least in the form investigated here. The programmes may have a tangential benefit in attracting healthy workers to the organisation – a sort of targeted perk – but not in raising wellbeing as they proclaim. And the population you would most hope to aid – those who are poorer, currently less active, and with more pressing health issues – are the least likely to engage, although they will still be paying towards the programmes through insurance premium hikes (or taxation in other systems).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This study can’t speak to why certain individuals are deterred from signing up, but perhaps it has to do with their other commitments and dependents, and their perceptions of the programmes as somehow not for them. To increase up-take among these groups will therefore likely require addressing these perceptions and providing additional support to help overcome any obstacles to taking part.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now, the impression of a positive impact given by wellness programmes looks largely a mirage.</p>

<h4>Distrusting biological metaphors</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/836/1*x_sqdM_Mi4Q2ULWQBlvosA.jpeg" /></figure><p>“The aim of science is to seek the simplest explanation of complex facts. We are apt to fall into the error of thinking that the facts are simple because simplicity is the goal of our quest. The guiding motto in the life of every natural philosopher should be ‘Seek simplicity and distrust it.’”</p><p>— Alfred North Whitehead</p><p>Simplicity is powerful. Economists seek minimal models to describe market fluctuations, and our greatest mathematicians use the guiding light of elegance to discover their next great truths. But is this preference a fundamental reflection of nature’s workings, or an aesthetic one? Occam’s razor — positing that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one — is particularly abused in biology. As Eve Marder has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721233/">long argued</a>, biological systems are equipped with redundant strategies and contingencies that confound the interpretation of even the most tightly controlled biological experiments. Even the idea of probing a “controlled” biological system merits careful reflection. By controlling for variables, we stray from reality, instead describing an abstract, manipulated system, and often still failing to account for the hundreds of cellular mechanisms we don’t yet know about. (Take, for example, surprising work from Didier Stanier and colleagues, who recently reported that knocking out a gene with CRISPR leads to the expression of homologous genes to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/22/328153">compensate for the loss</a>.) In a debate held a decade ago, <a href="http://www.voicesfromoxford.org/video/Homage-to-Darwin-part-2/63">Richard Dawkins and Lynn Margulis argued</a> about the role of symbiosis in evolutionary theory. An exasperated Dawkins asked: “why on earth would you want to drag in symbiogenesis when it’s so unparsimonious and uneconomical?” Margulis replied: “because it’s there.” Parsimony for parsimony’s sake is not parsimonious in the biosciences.</p><p>It’s important to recognize that our formalization of biology is fundamentally historical — philosophers like Hans-Jorg Rheinberger, Bachelard, and others have argued that biology has been primarily technology (rather than hypothesis) driven. The ideas of biology are inextricable from the technology that produces them. As Rheinberger put it: “phenomena and instrument, object and experience, concept and method are all engaged in a running process of mutual instruction.” Our resultant understanding of nature is dominated by our choice of experimental system, which includes our instruments, the model organism, even the culture wherein a discovery is made: the knowledge generated is, in some very real ways, as contingent as the processes it describes. We fit discovered phenomena with simple handles — reduced, for practical purposes, to a sort of currency to be exchanged between labs, resorting to pale metaphors when communicating the natural mysteries.<br /> <br /> It’s clear why we do this. It’s in part a heuristic shortcut, making things easier to wrap our heads around. We want to <em>understand </em>nature — we, being individual humans, not as the vague “human collective.” We therefore seek truths <a href="http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/08/18/if-we-already-understood-the-brain-would-we-even-know-it/">comprehensible to a single intellect</a>; and so, as the parable goes, we’re searching for our keys under a streetlamp. Even so, it seems so inherently <em>obvious</em>, so inarguable that true things should be simpler things. The instinct to discover the rules of nature is older than man: the nervous system is biology’s greatest prediction algorithm, and it dutifully learns patterns whose knowledge might enhance its chance of survival (science being the formal application of this impulse). Thus, human thought is underpinned by an unconscious aesthetic laid down in the nervous system itself.</p><p>Studies suggest we naturally tend to find satisfaction in simplicity, in learnability (often through <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-repetition-can-turn-almost-anything-into-music">repetition</a>)— in that which is <a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/TICS686.pdf">easy</a> to process. In music, for example, the most universally enjoyable songs lie somewhere between tedious simplicity (like the worst of pop) and unpredictable entropy (like some modern composers). We’re just acting after our nervous system’s modus operandi when we seek learnable patterns. Maxims that appear to be self-evident — e.g. something along Occam’s logic, “a simpler explanation is better” — may only appear to be so because they’re rewarded within the system that evaluates them. That is, they’re self-reflective: the nervous system, itself effectively a simplifying model of its environment, seeks to uncover patterns that render its existence more manageable. It’s evaluating a reductive internal model against its own implicit function. The mind is a causality inferring machine: the impetus to ascribe linear causal relationships is inbuilt to our nervous system. Armed with this hammer, the whole messy universe looks like an elegant nail.</p><p>Of course, ultimately, what we want to do with science is to uncover what Dawkins has referred to as “economically expressed rules.” We are interested in the <em>objects</em> of life primarily because they point us to the <em>process</em> of life. We don’t count the color bands of a beetle for the sake of knowing this fact, but because our understanding of rules often emerges from collections of observations — in the beetle’s case, for example, untangling the logic of developmental programs. But is there even a clear boundary between biological object and process?</p><p>For example, it’s often said that biological entities perform computations (we’ll ignore, for the time being, the fact that no one can agree what is meant by computation): the organism an object, and computation its process. In doing so we suppose a separation between software and hardware, algorithm and data. But organisms are also the <em>result</em> of computations: cells can be thought of as “<a href="http://emboj.embopress.org/content/36/5/568.long">testing hypotheses</a>” during the development of an embryo, for example. Both evolution and nervous systems are the results of computations becoming embodied in the architecture of their computers. Even in machine learning, as Sunderhauf et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06557.pdf">recently argued</a>, “there is a spectrum — rather than a dichotomy — between programming and data.” Indeed, the success of machine learning, despite its inelegance, underscores the fact that simplicity isn’t necessarily a useful goal.</p><p>Evolution has never (until, perhaps, soon) operated by reason, but rolls of a die. The resultant systems are rife with feedback loops and interdependencies. Neuroscientists too often conflate observational studies with causal explanations of behaviors, but a description or manipulation of what neurons or networks are active during a behavior is not the explanans of that behavior. ‘Necessary and sufficient’ doesn’t work the way <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/12543/1/GomezMarin2016_CausalCircuitExplanations_FINAL.pdf">neuroscientists usually use it</a>. Thirty years ago, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3916328">Randolf DiDomenico and colleagues proposed </a>that we avoid making causal claims in individual papers, and instead build them from multiple studies using various techniques and approaches. Given the sheer complexity of these networks and amount of data we’ve generated, this is increasingly beyond the scope of individual human intellect. All this is to say: think hard about what it is you wish to show with your studies. Be humble in your claims. Pragmatism may be a more holy grail than Truth. Or, as Hemingway (perhaps apocryphally) advised: kill your darlings.</p><p><em>Want more?

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/22/the-brain-and-genes-in-addictive-behavior/">The Brain and Genetics in Addictive Behavior</a></h4>

<p>Addictive behavior is a major global health concern. Addiction is commonly defined as the repetitive use of substances or a repetitive pattern of behaviors that are harmful. It is believed that addiction is a brain disorder, meaning that it is caused by the impact of drugs or other addictive substances/influences on the brain and it can be modified by different environmental factors.</p>
<p>The presence of specific variants of some genes may promote or decrease the chances of developing an addiction. According to scientists, genetic factors may play an important role in determining both the vulnerability to addiction and the response to treatments aimed to cure addiction.</p>
<h1><font size="6">The Brain and Genetics in Addictive Behavior</font></h1>
<p>One group of researchers demonstrated that polymorphisms in the genes encoding for opioid receptors and opioid ligands, and more specifically the MOPR gene (<em>OPRM1</em>), is associated with drug addiction. It has been found that one variant of this gene contributes to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/08/02/the-genetics-of-alcoholism/">alcoholism</a> and heroin addiction.</p>
<p>Another study has found that carriers of the same gene variant experience a more pronounced sensitivity to pain and decreased analgesic response to opioids, which means that they require higher doses of morphine in the management of pain, such as pain associated with cancer.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Heroin and Opioids</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p>Some authors underlined that addiction to MOPR agonists, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/11/11/opioid-addiction-inherent-differences-in-brain-functions/">including heroin</a>, has become epidemic in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. According to the same authors, the endogenous opioid system interacts with other neurotransmitter systems in the brain. More precisely, opioid receptors regulate the release of dopamine and serotonin, neurotransmitters with important roles in mood.</p>
<p>Additionally, the opioid system seems to interact with noradrenergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic pathways, as well as with neural growth factors. Furthermore, these studies indicate that chronic exposure to opiates alters gene expression in the brain, and this causes long-term changes in neuronal networks.</p>
<p>Activation of opioid receptors leads to changes in the expression of genes in the above-mentioned neurotransmitter pathways. Variations in the genes of those pathways may determine whether someone is more prone to the development of opiate addiction.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Cocaine</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p>One very recent study published this year revealed that the use of cocaine and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/15/gambling-addiction-is-it-as-bad-as-cocaine/">cocaine addiction </a>are associated with certain variants of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, along with lower expression of this gene.</p>
<p>More specifically, the authors of the study compared the expression level of this gene in chronic cocaine users and healthy controls. Apart from significantly lower gene expression in the cocaine users, the carriers of some gene variants were at increased risk of cocaine addiction. In addition, they scored higher on depression scales.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Dopamine</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font> </p>
<p>It seems that the major challenge in understanding and treating addictive disorders is understanding why some individuals develop addiction while others do not. According to research findings, whether or not a person will become addicted depends largely on genetic factors, which contribute ~50% of the risk for addiction.</p>
<p>The processes in our brain are also important. It is well established that the rewarding effects of drugs and addictive substances, in general, are based on their ability to increase the level of dopamine in the brain. Accordingly, imaging studies have shown that individual variations in brain circuits modulated by dopamine, including circuits involved in the mechanisms of reward, contribute to the inter-individual variability in the vulnerability to addiction. Thus, it seems that the roles of genetic factors and brain pathways in the addiction may be intertwined via dopamine.</p>
<h2><font size="4">Alcohol and tobacco</font></h2><font size="4">
</font><p><font size="4"></font></p>
<p>Apart from drug addiction, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/21/a-long-way-to-sobriety/">addiction to alcohol</a> seems to depend on genetics and is influenced by heritage. A recent study has investigated the effects of parental drinking on the use of alcohol in young adults. More than 3500 adolescents and their parents have been included in this prospective research. As results have indicated, young adults whose parents are moderate or high alcohol consumers are more prone to alcohol consumption than those young adults whose parents don’t consume alcohol or consume it in low quantities.</p>
<p>Alcohol and tobacco use represent leading global health risks, which are responsible for 3.3 and 6 million premature deaths per year respectively, according to the World Health Organization. Genetic factors were estimated to contribute 40-60% and 40-85% to the development of alcohol and tobacco addictions respectively.</p>
<p>Finding out which genetic variants are associated with alcohol and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/25/smoking-behavior-and-the-transtheoretical-model-of-the-stages-of-change/">tobacco addictions</a> would be an important step in understanding their underlying mechanisms and developing the effective therapies. Over the last years, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been performed in order to elucidate the role of certain genes and their variants in alcohol and tobacco use. These studies have recognized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP, i.e., gene variants with a difference in a single nucleotide) are important for developing these addictions.</p>
<p>For alcohol addiction, SNPs include polymorphisms in the <em>KLB</em> gene, as well as in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene cluster. In the latter, different variations of genes differently influence the metabolism of alcohol. In the case of tobacco use, the most evident variations have been detected in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes cluster.</p>
<p>However, only a small number of common genetic variants have been studied, and they account for a modest proportion of alcohol and nicotine addiction heritability. Thus, further investigation into the role of low frequency and rare genetic variants is required in order to fully understand the heritability of both alcohol and tobacco use.</p>
<h1><font size="6">In Sum<p></p>
<h1><font size="6"><p></p>
<p>Considering all of these facts together, it seems that genetics does indeed play an important role in the development of addiction to substances such as opioids, alcohol, and tobacco. Some of these factors include differences in gene expression and gene variants in brain neurotransmitter pathways. Further research is needed in order to develop working strategies for treating heritable addictions.</p>

<p><i>That which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger…</i> It’s an adage that’s backed up in part by studies of people who’ve been through a trauma, such as a car accident or a robbery. While it’s true that around 7-8 per cent of trauma survivors develop chronic PTSD and experience persistent intrusive, unwanted memories of the event, most people recover quickly, and some even report better mental health than they had before (generally when the trauma has been moderate, rather than severe). But what underpins so-called “post-traumatic growth?” A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-34715-001">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i>, argues that it has to do with trauma triggering a form of mental training that increases some survivors’ control over their own minds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>“Our findings suggest that traumatic experiences – as horrible as they may be – might naturally contribute to the adaptation of cognitive control skills, thereby improving survivors’ later resilience, at least [for] those who experienced only moderate levels of trauma,” write Justin Hulbert at Bard College, US, and Michael Anderson at the University of Cambridge. If these researchers are right, there could be implications for the treatment of PTSD.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two studies, each of 48 students, suggested that those who had experienced a relatively high number of traumas (including witnessing or experiencing accidents, violence, and the death of significant individuals) before the age of 18 showed a greater ability to inhibit, when instructed, their memories of a word pairing they had previously learned, compared with those who reported no or little trauma.</p>
<p>The participants initially viewed a set of 60 word pairs, which consisted of a neutral cue word (such as “violin”) and either a neutral or a negative response word (such as “street” or “corpse”). They were given up to three training cycles to correctly recall at least half of the response words. Next, they were given a series of “Think/No Think” trials. If a cue word was presented on the screen in green, they had to say the response word as quickly as possible. But if the cue word appeared in red, they were told to avoid both thinking about and saying the response word for the next four seconds. Then came some surprise recall tests. This time they were given either the original cue word, or a new semantic cue plus the initial letter of the response word – such as “anatomy c_____” for “corpse”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Hulbert and Anderson found that while those in the high and low trauma groups were equally good at learning the initial word associations, those in the high trauma group showed superior performance on the subsequent “No Think” trials, indicating they had a “robust ability” to forget the specific response words when required to do so. This held for both neutral and negative words, “suggesting that this effect reflects a generalised skill at suppression, regardless of valence,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data is consistent with the idea that experiencing trauma – at least for this group of people who successfully made it to university – may encourage resilience by training the ability to inhibit unwanted memories, in particular, and perhaps even a general inhibitory control mechanism, which could extend to unwanted emotions and actions, Hulbert and Anderson propose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If these new findings are reliable – and obviously the study requires that we trust the students’ self-reports of their history of trauma – then they could have implications for how to optimise CBT treatments for trauma. Standard cognitive-behavioural therapy for PTSD encourages patients to confront reminders of their experience and the memories that are triggered by them – the idea being that over time this exposure will lead the traumatic memories to become less distressing. However, Hulbert and Anderson believe their results suggest that while it is important not to avoid reminders of the trauma, it may actually be beneficial to practice suppressing the memories that are triggered by them (mirroring what seems to happen naturally for people who experience post-traumatic growth). “Training in retrieval suppression may augment the benefits of cognitive-behavioural therapy,” Hulbert and Anderson write, “by enabling patients to confront reminders and redirect to more benign thoughts.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>People who do not recover well from a trauma and who develop chronic PTSD may perhaps have general deficits in inhibitory control, or an impaired ability to adapt control mechanisms over time, perhaps in part because of a genetic variation in cortical plasticity, Hulbert and Anderson suggest. However, the new results suggest that “… for many victims living with trauma, efforts to achieve emotional balance by down-regulating intrusive thoughts may act as a natural form of cognitive training.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/fhbBFBkj6QA/">PLOS Update</a></h4>

<p>In 2009, we launched <em>PLOS Currents </em>as an experimental platform for rapid communication of non-standard publications. A few communities embraced the experiment enthusiastically from the start, and the contributions of researchers who volunteered as editors and reviewers was fantastic. Over the years, we have seen important applications, for example, in small communities collaborating on rare diseases research in <em>PLOS Currents Huntington Disease</em>, and in rapid communication of preliminary results in the context of disease outbreaks in <em>PLOS Currents Outbreaks</em>. In particular, there was a surge of submissions during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak.</p>
<p>However, in recent years the technology supporting this platform has aged rapidly, the user experience has been subpar, and submissions have substantially decreased. We have undertaken a thorough review to understand these concerns, and to evaluate whether <em>PLOS Currents</em> was still meeting our original aims – and the needs of its communities. Our conclusion: it does not. Much has changed in the years since <em>Currents’</em> launch and we think there are now better ways of serving the original aims. We have therefore made the difficult announcement to cease its publication.</p>
<p>From today, <em>PLOS Currents</em> will no longer accept new submissions. Authors who currently have a submission under review have been contacted with details on their options going forward. All <em>PLOS Currents</em> content will remain available, citable, indexed in PubMed and permanently archived on the <em>PLOS Currents</em> site and publicly archived in PubMed Central.</p>
<p>In assessing how <em>PLOS Currents</em> measured against its original vision we learned three major lessons and a new path forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite the flexibility of the format and invitations to submit wide-ranging research (e.g., negative results, single experiments, research in progress, protocols, datasets, etc.), the majority of submissions to <em>PLOS Currents</em> were traditional research articles</li>
<li>The platform which underlies <em>PLOS Currents</em> has not evolved as rapidly with the needs of the community it was meant to serve.</li>
<li>A common thread has been the desire to publish rapidly, which was particularly obvious in the case of <em>PLOS Currents Disasters</em> and <em>PLOS Currents Outbreaks.</em> However, since <em>PLOS Currents</em> was launched new publishing tools have emerged that can facilitate the rapid sharing of work.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have partnered with like-minded organizations to provide more adapted and specialized solutions. Today we offer the option for rapid dissemination across all of our journals through our <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent partnership with the preprint server bioRxiv</a>.  We have also partnered with other platforms that specialize in specific content types such as <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">protocols.io</a>, an open access repository for laboratory protocols, with customized features for protocols publication, execution, adaptation, and discussion. Through a series of <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preferred repositories</a> that host specialist dataset and our close collaboration with <a href="https://datadryad.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dryad</a> and<a href="https://figshare.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> figshare</a>, PLOS champions the sharing of data sets according to the FAIR principles.</p>
<p>We continue to seek partnerships to facilitate the dissemination of research outputs that do not conform to the traditional research article mold. Meanwhile, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a> has reinforced its commitment to continue to publish negative results and replication and confirmation studies.</p>
<p>To bring together all these features, we have built <a href="https://channels.plos.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PLOS Channels</a>, which integrate content from all PLOS titles, the wider literature, preprint servers, blogs, and the other content platforms types described above. Channel Editors curate this content to create a highly-valuable community resource, developed and maintained by communities for communities. By extending beyond a single title or platform for original content, we believe that Channels are well suited to build on the initial objectives of <em>PLOS Currents.</em></p>
<p>For example, last year, we launched a <a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disease Forecasting &amp; Surveillance Channel</a> to which one of the Editors of <em>PLOS Currents Outbreaks</em> and a member of our Currents review board already contribute. In May, as the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo worsened, we rapidly <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/plos-responds-to-ebola-outbreak-with-new-channel-expedited-peer-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched an Ebola Channel</a> to serve responders. When the WHO announced the end of the outbreak, we paused activity on the Channel but stand ready to activate it, or another channel, as researchers and clinicians mobilize to fight outbreaks as they occur. These are only two examples of the potential we see for Channels to support specific communities.</p>
<p>The initial objectives of <em>PLOS Currents</em> remain vibrantly alive at PLOS and we are enormously grateful to all the <em>PLOS Currents</em> Editors and Reviewers, past and present, who have made this experiment possible. We will continue to work with these communities to find new ways to facilitate communication of research that fit their specific needs.</p>

<p>The last time you and your class-mates or co-workers pulled an all-nighter before a deadline, you may have noticed:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>there are always those lucky individuals who seem to do just fine after a lack of sleep, while others feel drowsy and confused – almost like they had too much to drink.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>New research conducted at the German Aerospace Center suggests this could be because alcohol intoxication and sleep deprivation are more similar than we once thought.</p>
<p>In their study <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/10/1803770115">published recently in PNAS</a>, Eva-Maria Elmenhorst and David Elmenhorst and their colleagues show how both affect us via a shared mechanism. And what’s more, if you’re sensitive to one, you’re likely to cope poorly with the other as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-34569"></span></p>
<p>The researchers tested the ability of 49 healthy volunteers to sustain their attention over a long period of time. The tests took place on four different days, under different conditions: baseline, after drinking alcohol, and after either partial or full sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Sustained attention was measured as reaction time on the 10-minute Psychomotor Vigilance Task, in which participants had to press a button as fast as possible in response to a randomly occurring light that appeared on-screen. On test days the task was repeated every 3 hours.</p>
<p>For the alcohol condition, the volunteers had to drink enough vodka to reach a blood alcohol level of at least 0.06 per cent – over the drink drive limit for most European countries. Some participants even reached levels of almost 0.1 per cent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When the researchers then looked at how much the participants’ reaction times were slowed down by alcohol compared to baseline, they saw big differences between them. But crucially, this wasn’t explained by the level of alcohol in their blood. Some participants with the highest alcohol levels had almost no impairments, while others closer to the lower limit had much slower reaction times. You may have witnessed a similar phenomenon with your friends. Even though you’ve all had the same amount of drinks, some can have a perfectly normal conversation, while others can’t even build a clear sentence.</p>
<p>The researchers then split the group into two – those with low or high sensitivity to alcohol – to see if the same groups would be more or less sensitive to sleep deprivation as well.</p>
<p>Indeed, after either 35 hours of total sleep deprivation or 4 successive five-hour nights, the participants most adversely affected by lack of sleep were also the ones who had been most sensitive to alcohol.</p>
<p>On a molecular level, this similarity in response to alcohol and sleep deprivation had previously been shown in animal models and cell cultures. Both alcohol and sleep deprivation affect the adenosine system, which could help explain the performance differences between participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Adenosine is a molecule formed during normal energy metabolism and which accumulates in the brain through the day. By binding to its receptors, of which the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor is the most common, adenosine makes us sleepy. When we are sleep deprived, more of these receptors become available on cell surfaces, thus giving adenosine more binding sites, which makes us even more sensitive to the molecule.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, alcohol increases the concentration of adenosine and thereby induces sleepiness. But what hadn’t been shown before this study is how alcohol affects the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor in the human brain. By using a kind of brain scanning called positron emission tomography (PET) with more volunteers, the researchers showed that alcohol, like sleep deprivation, increases the availability of A<sub>1 </sub>adenosine receptors, in a similar way to sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>This study therefore provides evidence that alcohol and sleep deprivation affect the adenosine system in very similar ways, and that personal differences in this system likely contribute to the way our sensitivity or resilience to both manifests as an individual trait (although the full picture is more complicated – sensitivity to alcohol, for example, is known to depend on a number of factors and has been linked to several <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4037586/">genetic variations</a>).</p>
<p>Though these results are important, they have several limitations. The volunteers underwent more experimental conditions than included in the key analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation and alcohol intoxication. In fact they spent a total of 12 days in the sleep laboratory, including an adaptation night and other challenges, including exposure to air low in oxygen or alcohol followed by partial sleep deprivation. Although these conditions were always followed by recovery nights, there may have been some carry-over effects that influenced the currently discussed results.</p>
<p>The study samples were also relatively small and uneven (for instance, of the 47 volunteers from the total sleep-deprivation group, 12 could not complete the alcohol condition, and only 14 participants completed the partial sleep deprivation condition). The results should be replicated using bigger samples to confirm that sensitivity to alcohol and sleep deprivation is a true individual trait.</p>
<p>Moreover, although sustained attention is a key function, it would also be interesting to look at other cognitive functions next. If the individual trait “sensitivity to alcohol and sleep deprivation” exists, does it also affect abilities like memory or problem-solving? These measures would give us a deeper understanding of how volunteers will cope with their daily tasks after having a drink or a short night.</p>
<p>As a first step for yourself, it could be useful to be more aware of how your body reacts to alcohol and sleep deprivation, and especially to consider if you are sensitive to both. For example, if you’re the kind of person who wouldn’t dare give an important presentation, or drive a car, even after just a single, weak drink (because you know your own sensitivity to alcohol), this is a good indicator that you probably shouldn’t undertake such challenges after a short night either. Taking sleep seriously can be hard, given that external pressures and stress cannot always be influenced. But being aware of the full impact of sleep deprivation can be an important first step for a healthier lifestyle.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/08/life-in-reciprocal-space-outsourcing-trends-in-structural-biology/">Life in Reciprocal Space: Outsourcing Trends in Structural Biology</a></h4>

<p>Recently, Science Exchange spoke with Joshua Carter, PhD, co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/helix-biostructures-llc">Helix BioStructures</a>, about the increasing demand for outsourced structural data collection services, particularly for R&amp;D teams pursuing structure-based drug design projects. Helix BioStructures is a contract research organization (CRO) specializing in fast and efficient structure biology services.</p>
<h3><b>Structural Data Collection: 16+ Hour Shifts, 10 Crystals Per Hour</b></h3>
<p>Thanks to advances in rational drug design, the demand for x-ray crystal structures is higher than ever. Parallel advances in automated crystal screening, remote access to beamlines, faster data collection, and improved phasing/structure solution methods have yielded steady increases in the number of structures solved per year.</p>
<p>Even though structural data collection is faster today than in the past (~10-12 crystals per hour in 2017, compared to ~4 crystals per hour in 2007), data collection remains a demanding task.</p>
<p>“Data collection shifts require a scientist to be attentive for 16+ hours (usually overnight) and be able to multitask continuously while recognizing details correlated to the experiment,” describes Carter.</p>
<h3><b>Reasons for Outsourcing Structural Data Collection</b></h3>
<p>Given the demanding aspects of the task, companies outsource structural data collection for multiple reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cost savings: Compared to the cost of an internal full-time employee dedicated to structural data collection, it can be cost-effective to outsource this role to an experienced provider.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand access to synchrotrons: Because Helix BioStructures does not require minimum sample numbers, customers can send crystal samples as soon as they harvest them.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Speed: Customers can expect high quality data within 1-1.5 weeks.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Expertise: CRO scientists, such as the Helix BioStructures team, have a breadth and depth of experience in structural data collection unattainable by most researchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our customers get my expertise of nine full years of industrial data collection,” promises Carter.</p>
<h3><b>Critical Decisions During Structural Data Collection</b></h3>
<p>Carter’s description of data collection, requiring absolute attention and real-time, complex decisions (possibly on little sleep), illustrates why having years of experience can be essential for quality data.</p>
<p>“Not only are we continuously interpreting diffraction quality and characteristics on the fly, but we are simultaneously determining experimental parameters for data collection that will allow us to achieve the highest quality data possible,” he explains.</p>
<p>In addition to data quality, the team are experts in recognizing and solving frequent beamline malfunctions. They are constantly on the lookout for robot failures, beam misalignment, and user interface errors.</p>
<h3><b>Use Case: Solving A Membrane Protein Structure From Incomplete Data</b></h3>
<p>Helix BioStructures has performed very complex data collection experiments for major R&amp;D organizations, including one study involving a challenging membrane protein.</p>
<p>The team used their expertise to effectively mesh-scan the LCP (lipidic cubic phase) crystallization drop, find the most intensely diffracting crystals, and collect multiple data sets for the target of interest.</p>
<p>“Since this was a membrane target, we were faced with radiation damage leading to incomplete data sets,” recalled Carter. “But using my knowledge of various programs, I was able to combine the data sets for data reduction and successfully merge for a complete data set that was statistically sound.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>There’s a popular idea in psychology that among the important factors shaping our honesty and generosity is our belief in the concept of free will. Believe more strongly in free will, so the theory goes, and you will be more inclined to prosocial behavior. Supporting this, studies that have momentarily undermined people’s belief in free will – for instance, by giving them a text to read about genetic determinism, or about how neuroscience shows our decisions are out of conscious control – have found that this increases people’s propensity for <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed">cheating</a> and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167208327217">selfishness</a>.</p>
<p>Such an effect seems understandable – after all, the notion that humans can choose whether to behave well or badly is fundamental to how we think about moral responsibility. It’s plausible that if you portray free will as an illusion then you provide people with a ready-made excuse for bad, selfish behavior, thus increasing the temptation for them to act that way.</p>
<p>As ever, however, reality is refusing to conform to a simple, intuitively appealing story. Recent attempts to replicate the influence of changing people’s free will beliefs on their subsequent moral behavior <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-10372-009">have failed</a>, or have applied <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173193">only to specific groups</a> of people, but not others.</p>
<p>Now a series of four large studies conducted on Amazon’s survey website, each involving hundreds of people, has failed to find a correlation between people’s beliefs about free will and either their generosity toward charities or their inclination to cheat. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618780732">Writing up their findings</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>, Damien Crone and Neil Levy at the University of Melbourne and Macquarie University said “… we believe there is good reason to doubt that free will beliefs have any substantial implications for everyday moral behaviors.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34552"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked their participants to complete two different comprehensive measures of their beliefs in free will, then gave them the opportunity to share some of their profits from a financial game with charities of their choice. The studies also included a measure of how central the participants saw virtuous traits as being to their identity. And in an online dice game, there was a chance to cheat secretly to earn a larger financial bonus.</p>
<p>Across all four studies, people who believed more strongly in free will were no more generous (if anything there was a trend in the other direction, toward less generosity), and cheated just as often. On the other hand, seeing virtuous traits as more central to one’s identity <em>was</em> associated with more prosocial behavior – suggesting the outcome measures were sensitive enough to detect meaningful associations in the data.</p>
<p>The new studies aren’t perfect, of course – for example, there are lots of other ways that one could conceptualize moral behavior – and should be seen as adding more detail to our understanding of this interesting area of inquiry, rather than shutting it down.</p>
<p>But in the context of the recent failed attempts to replicate the moral consequences of momentarily undermining belief in free will, the new findings do give reason to question the claims of those psychologists and commentators who have already <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/">raised the alarm</a> rather loudly about the potential adverse effects for society of disseminating scientific findings that challenge the concept of human free will. As Crone and Levy conclude, “more research is required before actively discouraging free-will skepticism out of fear of moral degeneration.”</p>

<p>What do <a href="http://www.marianarickmann.com">parents who also happen to be scientists (like me)</a> do when faced with a subject they know nothing about but affects their lives directly? We research!</p>
<p>However, I found very little information about early child development that was evidence-based enough to satisfy me, and at the same time simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>So, I decided to write myself the article<em> I</em> was looking for!</p>
<p>I started with a bit of research about the scientific facts supporting early childhood education and childcare. Being a new mom I had no idea of what I was doing, and the scientist in me needed evidence.</p>
<p>I was curious because our girls go to a daycare with a specific non-traditional approach, and also because neurobiology is so fascinating to me.</p>

<h2>Fact 1: During the first years of life children’s brains grow faster than at any other period</h2>
<p><strong>Early brain development sets the foundations for emotion, memory and decision-making in adulthood.</strong></p>
<p>The brain of a newborn has nearly as many neurons as an adult brain. During the first few years of life, infant’s and children’s brain undergo massive restructuration of their neural networks, new neurons are born, and new connections sprout and existing connections are refined.</p>
<p>Around age 3, children have twice as many synapses (neuronal connections) as an adult; some will remain throughout adulthood but others will be gradually eliminated during late childhood and adolescence according to the unique experiences each child has.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support brain development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give the child the chance to participate in daily activities according to each child’s age; for example, helping to prepare food, cleaning or personal hygiene.</li>
<li>Encourage children to have a close relationship with nature.</li>
<li>Give them the time to engage and repeat the activity of their choice. This allows their brain to rest on the experiences that are more important for them in the moment.</li>
<li>Don’t expect children to spend long periods of time sitting down. Give children the freedom to move around the class.</li>
<li>Give children time to explore: this is called free play. They can decide what material and activity they will use.</li>
<li>Children learn with their hands; they enjoy touching the toys or materials. This way of learning is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O2wm1pUGZ0">hands-on experience</a>. The brain is receiving information from all senses, and this is how brains develop and understand the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: The brain develops by having experiences: give the child space and time to experiment.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“You can’t make children grow faster by pushing them, just as you can’t make flowers grow faster by pulling them.” Otto Weininger</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 2: Sensitive periods are critical for learning and refining cognitive functions</h2>
<p>Our brain goes through during periods of intense development known as critical periods. Most occur in infancy, but some arrive as late as the teenage years. During critical periods, brains rapidly develop abilities such as vision, language and social skills. Experience in the form of sensory input — vision, sound and so on — is needed to form new synapses, strengthen existing connections, prune superfluous dendrites, and add more myelin when faster communication is required.</p>
<p>Critical periods are when the brain not only uses but absolutely <em>requires</em> sensory experiences to remodel and refine the neural circuits.</p>
<p><strong>Myelination is related to sensitive periods</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V7RZwDpmXE">Myelin</a> coats and insulates axons and helps neurons conduct signals efficiently, which in turn helps the brain perform complex tasks. Myelinated axons conduct information 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons (which means quicker thinking).</p>
<p>The process of myelination is the last step in the maturation of the neuronal network: is the brain’s way of saying: “This skill is important in the world around me, I need to pay attention to this”.</p>
<p>Babies are born with few myelinated axons. As the baby grows, the extent of <strong>myelination is based on experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Experiences and repetition</strong>, especially during the sensitive periods, are critical to establish more efficient connections and support the healthy development of the brain.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support sensitive periods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let each child engage in what interests her most at each moment.</li>
<li>Give the child the time to repeat the activity and help only when needed.</li>
<li>Don’t expect all children to learn at the same rate.</li>
<li>Teachers and carers should observe the child and guide each of them according to each child’s interests.</li>
<li>Provide a safe and prepared environment that is filled with interesting age-related activities, and where the child has the freedom to explore without interruption.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Observe the child to spot a sensitive period and provide according to her interests (not yours).</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: What happens if a child misses a sensitive period?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Neuroscientific research has identified that children facing deprivation or a lack of stimulation in particular areas during sensitive periods for development will have a deficit in that particular area of brain function. However, research has also supported the idea of plasticity in the brain. Given that the human brain can adapt and even produce new neurons over its lifespan, learning and a strengthening of connections within the human brain occur throughout one’s lifespan.” Blakemore &amp; Frith, 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>So missing out on appropriate experiences within sensitive periods means harder work to learn a skill later in life. <strong>Is like learning a language when you are older</strong>; you can still do it, but it may require a bit (or a lot) more of effort.</p>
<p>For example, during the first months of life, babies recognise sounds related to all languages, but by the end of the first year, they remember only the ones related to the languages they are exposed to.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because low-level circuits mature early and high-level circuits mature later, different kinds of experiences are critical at different ages for optimal brain development, a concept called age-appropriate experience. Soon after birth, basic sensory, social, and emotional experiences are essential for optimizing the architecture of low-level circuits. At later ages, more sophisticated kinds of experiences are critical for shaping higher-level circuits.” National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>More importantly, in not stressful or traumatic environments, where the child is loved and accepted, it is improbable that she will not get the inputs she needs for healthy brain development.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 3: Executive functions develop alongside maturation of the prefrontal cortex</h2>
<p><strong>The pre-frontal cortex (PFC) is the area of the brain behind the forehead. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive functions of the PFC include self-control, attention, problem-solving, planning, reasoning, creativity and flexibility. These functions </strong><strong>develop exponentially in the pre-school years. </strong></p>
<p>All activities that have social, emotional and physical ingredients train executive functions.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments encourage executive functions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children usually can´t sit still. This is because the ‘top-down’ ability to inhibit movement develops alongside other executive functions.</li>
<li>Several studies support the interdependency between narrative skills and executive functions. Children get to practice attention, focus and resist distraction when listening to a story. Similarly, those skills help a child construct a story on their own, from pictures or ideas.</li>
<li>In some daycare classrooms where there is only one material or toy or play with, children need to be patient and wait for their turn: in doing so they practice self-control.</li>
<li>In most group activities, physical movement is linked with a sense of belonging, for example, a walk in the forest or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYBdRW-NOzM">walking on the line</a> in a group.</li>
<li>Several materials developed by <a href="https://montessori.org.au/biography-dr-maria-montessori" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr Maria Montessori</a> (a childhood educator) train the executive functions. For example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJNtEndiXQg">binomial cube</a> is excellent for developing flexible thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: activities with social, emotional and physical components like martial arts, dance, theatre or circus groups are a right way of training executive functions. Go out for a walk or a bike ride with your child!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“School readiness and learning achievement across the content areas and grades rely on Executive Function processes, which is why these skills should be promoted and trained in early childhood programs and schools”. Sabine Kubesch and colleagues, 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 4: Stress affects brain development and executive functions</h2>
<p><strong>Prolonged adversity in the absence of a caring adult disrupts healthy brain development.</strong></p>
<p>The PFC is very sensitive to stress, as well as sleep deprivation, sadness, loneliness or being physically unfit.</p>
<p>While <strong>positive stress</strong> (like meeting a new adult, or a new environment) is an important and necessary aspect of healthy development, <strong>chronic toxic stress</strong> caused by extreme situations (like poverty, abuse or severe maternal depression) adversely affects the healthy development of the brain.</p>
<p>One primary stress sources in children and young adults during the school years is the focus on achieving high grades and qualifications. Children worry about <strong>not being smart enough and not succeeding in school or life</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How children can bypass the stress related to learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The inner motivation to learn is more rewarding than learning to pass an exam, and in many cases gives better academic results. Ideally, the principal objective of education should be to encourage curiosity and independent learning, not grades.</li>
<li>Children should not be expected to perform in a standardised way. Every child learns on her rhythm and interests.</li>
<li>Each child should be respected as she is, and her interests should be acknowledged and encouraged.</li>
<li>Chaos is a source of stress. Classrooms and spaces that are beautiful, not overloaded and kept in order are calming to the senses and thus helps diminish stress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Always encourage an effort-mentality to approach goals. More than achievements, effort should be praised. Always tell your child: you do not know how to do it, <em>yet</em>. But you will do, with practice. Invariably discipline your child from a loving and calm perspective.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“Adverse caregiving experiences can affect brain structures and function, and these may in turn impact on psychological and emotional development.” McCrory and Viding, 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 5: Mirror neurons help a child learn by imitation</h2>
<p><strong>Watching an activity has almost the same effect on the brain as doing it.</strong></p>
<p>This means that the brain learns by watching, it is part of the preparation to perform the activity.</p>
<p>In brain scanning images, researchers found that the same areas of the brain were active in the person that was doing the activity as well as in the person watching it.</p>
<p>Mirror neurons exist in the premotor cortex of monkey, but neuroscientists are <a class="ext" href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/breaking-news-is-this-first-ever-direct.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still trying to find out whether they exist in humans</a>, where they are, and what exactly it is they do. Mirror neurons are fascinating but we’re only in the early stages of learning about their role in learning.</p>
<p>Role patterns have a significant implication for a child’s development. Children learn by reproducing what they see. Their brain is getting ready to replicate what they observed.</p>
<p><strong>How mirror neurons might be in action during early child development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some daycare facilities, children are welcome to watch other children as they work with any material or activity. Since there is (usually) only one or a few units of a material of each kind when they want to use it, and it is not free at the moment, they need to wait, but they can watch while the other child uses it.</li>
<li>Parents, caregivers, teachers or facilitators are crucial as a role model for the child.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Be the adult you want your child to become.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Fact 6: Working memory lays the foundation for more complex functions like language</h2>
<p><strong>Working memory is a temporary note in the brain, like the instructions for baking a cake that you forget afterwards.</strong></p>
<p>Also considered one of the brain’s executive functions, working memory is the ability to process new information that a child needs for performing a task, like following a series of steps.</p>
<p><strong>How to train working memory</strong></p>
<p>Several materials and activities specially designed for children require that the child uses her working memory. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matching colour tablets at a distance by keeping the requested colour in mind.</li>
<li>Retrieving a specified quantity of beads from across the room based on only verbal instructions.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7BM7KDUzI">constructive triangle exercises.</a></li>
<li>Any matching game like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFibQyVimh8">colour box</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Give the child short instructions and time to follow them on her own.</strong></p>

<h2>Fact 7: Cognition is linked to movement.</h2>
<p><strong>Learning is not only a brain activity, learning is a whole-body task.</strong></p>
<p>Movement is controlled in the brain by the motor cortex together with many other regions, through connections that develop as a child moves and explores her world. This explains why children who get less opportunity to move, show poor school readiness.</p>
<p>“It’s truly astonishing that the dominant model for formal learning is still “sit and git.” It’s not just astonishing; it’s embarrassing.” Eric Jensen</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support physical activity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give the child activities that require hands-on manipulation of the materials. The learning experience is practical.</li>
<li>Understand that learning is an active, enjoyable task with direct physical experience.</li>
<li>Understand that there are biological reasons why it is complicated for a child to sit and listen.</li>
<li>Children need time to explore and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVpPMOhPgJI">freedom of movement in a prepared environment.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Children and babies need the freedom to move. Give them opportunities and be prepared if you are in a situation where they won’t be able to run, escalate and jump. Understand it is a physical and developmental need, not misbehaviour.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“The child’s intelligence can develop to a certain level without the help of his hand. But if it develops with his hand, then the level that it reaches is higher, and the child’s character is stronger.” Dr Maria Montessori</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 8: Each brain is unique</h2>
<p><strong>Even identical twins are different.</strong></p>
<p>Experiences, nutrition, relationships <em>and</em> genes shape the brain of a child. Even the neurons of identical twins have variations due to genetic processes like “<a href="https://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v306/n3/box/scientificamerican0312-26_BX1.html">jumping genes</a>” that modify the inherited genes and their expression. Genetic changing events like this are highly active in brains during development.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support the uniqueness of each child</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respect each child and encourage her interests.</li>
<li>By observation, teachers, parents and carers can learn about the needs and interests of each child, and provide accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Give each child according to her needs and interests, do not make comparisons or try to unify siblings.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“Follow the child.” Dr Maria Montessori</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 9: Emotions and relationships shape the growing brain</h2>
<p><strong>Emotional well-being and social skills provide a strong foundation for developing cognitive abilities.</strong></p>
<p>Emotional, cognitive and physical capacities that develop in the early childhood years are the essential foundation for success in later adult life.</p>
<p>Emotions support the development of executive functions when they are well regulated, but interfere with them when they are out of control, impeding attention and decision-making.</p>
<p>In the long run, <strong>reduced emotional regulation in early childhood affects a child’s social capacities and the ability to adapt to school.</strong></p>
<p>The development of emotional capabilities run along with more evident skills like mobility, thinking and communication.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to a child’s emotions, and it should be considered a fundamental part of her brain development. It is impressive to see how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0">children actively react to emotional changes in their parent or carer.</a></p>
<p>In some cases, learning to manage emotions can be harder than learning to count or read, and it can even be a sign of future psychological problems.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support emotions and relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attend to each child’s feelings.</li>
<li>In classrooms with a mix of ages, children learn to respect other children by observing and taking turns.</li>
<li>Set tasks such as setting the table, dusting or keeping the classroom and bedroom tidy give the child a sense of belonging and responsibility. They learn to be useful to their family and friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Always pay attention to all emotions. It may not be relevant to you, but it is for your child. All feelings are allowed, but not all behaviours are. Correct the action, not the emotion. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Important note: you want your child to be able to understand and explain when there is something that hurts her or that she disagrees.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“Healthy development can not separate cognitive development from social and emotional development.” Jack P. Shonkoff.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fact 10: Creativity is the result of network brain work</h2>
<p><strong>Brains become creative when allowed to explore.</strong></p>
<p>Creativity is different from fantasy. Creativity connects seemingly non-connected concepts. Creativity is the capacity of thinking outside the box.</p>
<p>From a neuroscience perspective, the creative process is the result of many <strong>parts of the brain working together as a network.</strong> For example, similar areas of the brain get activated during musical training and mathematical processing. Early musical experiences are also a support for language development.</p>
<p>In a recent study, fMRI scans of successful engineers showed a characteristic brain activation pattern when creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://earlyarts.co.uk/blog/creativity-in-early-brain-development">creative environment during childhood</a> not only contributes to better mental health, but lays foundation for lifelong creativity.</p>
<p><strong>How home and daycare environments support creativity and exploration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn from one another and one’s personal experience. Give children get as much help as needed, and as little help as possible. This means they “discover” how things are done, rather than being passively told how.</li>
<li>Give freedom to explore ideas and relationships between seemingly different areas of learning or disciplines.</li>
<li>Children who learn to solve problems become independent learners.</li>
<li>In the process of discovering how things work (from an adult perspective), children come up with new applications that always surprise the adult.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip: Always let the child do by herself what she can do alone. Do not take away from her the pleasure of discovering how the world works. Give your child real-life high-quality material to experiment.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>“The most innovative entrepreneurs were very lucky to have been raised in an atmosphere where inquisitiveness was encouraged. We were struck by the stories they told about being sustained by people who cared about experimentation and exploration. Sometimes these people were relatives, but sometimes they were neighbours, teachers or other influential adults.” Hal Gregersen, in <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/09/how-do-innovators-think">“How do innovators think.”</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>To summarise</h2>
<p>Growing a human brain is rather like constructing a home. It starts with laying the foundations, framing the rooms, wiring the electrical system and continues with distinctive features that give the house its individuality. The foundation of a home may not be visible when you look at a house, but every part of the house depends upon it.</p>
<p>Just like a good foundation supports a secure and robust home, <strong>the first years of a child’s life shape her personality and cognitive, emotional and social skills.</strong></p>
<p>It is in our hands to understand and nurture growing minds. Research in neuroscience, cognitive development and education are providing more evidence on the importance of the first few years in a little person’s life.</p>
<p>We can learn from the current knowledge about a child early years and know that <strong>observation and respect are vital to understanding and supporting children’s growing minds</strong>. They are also the framework for healthier and happier human relationships.</p>

Each of these researchers are (or were) at the top of their fields, recipients of huge amounts of funding. They are accused of abuses of power, bullying and abuse of their subordinates and creating a climate of fear in their institutions.

A scientist's achievements are often measured in terms of the number of papers they publish (productivity) and how many citations those papers get (impact). These 'bibliometric indicators' are widely derided but they have proven remarkably stubborn.



Now, in a new preprint on bioRxiv, researchers Peter van den Besselaar and Ulf Sandström propose a new metric that, they say, could measure another important researcher characteristic: independence.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>The phrase “sexual objectification” began popping up <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=sexual+objectification&amp;year_start=1950&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%25253B%25252Csexual%252520objectification%25253B%25252Cc0">only 50 years ago</a>, but it’s now ubiquitous, reflecting our concern that seeing someone sexually amounts to perceiving them as eye candy or a piece of meat. More recently, psychologists and neuroscientists have gathered evidence that sexualisation can literally lead us to perceive people less as whole humans and more as an assemblage of parts – the same way that the mind normally processes objects.</p>
<p>But the picture is complicated by <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218775690">new work</a> published in <i>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</i> from a team mainly drawn from the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Their experiments on the impact of various forms of sexualisation on the perception of the body find that objectification does not necessarily follow.</p>
<p><span id="more-34547"></span></p>
<p>This study relies on the discovery first made <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1969-12269-001">nearly 50 years ago</a> that when human faces and bodies are presented upside-down, it is particularly hard for us to perceive them in the same holistic way we do when we look at them the right-way up (a phenomenon known as the “inversion effect”). Supporting the concept of objectification, evidence from this decade shows that inverted sexualised bodies (for example, wearing scant clothing in a provocative pose) do not trigger the inversion effect, suggesting that we process them more like we process objects – by scrutinising their individual parts, rather than holistically.</p>
<p>To break down exactly what about sexualisation drives the switch from humanising to objectifying perception, Philippe Bernard and his team measured volunteers’ brainwaves, in particular looking for a negative spike in brain activity called the N170 that is known to be a marker of the inversion effect (the N170 is much larger when we view flipped human bodies versus upright ones, but shows little difference in size when we view flipped versus upright objects).</p>
<p>In their first experiment, Bernard’s team focused on an obvious way to sexualise a person, by reducing their clothing. Twenty-one participants (average age 22, and in all experiments a balance of genders, with no gendered effects observed) viewed pictures of males and females with pixellated faces wearing  black jeans and shirts or black swim-trunks/bikinis. The change in N170 caused by inverting the pictures was similar for both scantily-clad and well-covered bodies – in other words, at a neural level there was no evidence for greater objectification of the more sexualised models.</p>
<p>It was in further experiments that neural evidence of objectification emerged, once researchers introduced pictures of models engaged in sexually suggestive postures (see image above). Regardless of their amount of clothing, when the models posed suggestively inversion did not lead to a change in the N170, which means that they were being perceived more like objects.</p>
<p>Can it really be true that, without provocative posing, images showing a lot of skin did not provoke any sexualisation? While the study’s primary focus was on inversion effects, the researchers also looked at the overall size of the N170 in the different conditions because more sexualised images are known to trigger a larger N170. When the participants viewed bodies that were less clothed, particularly women’s bodies, the N170 was larger. So it seems that although seeing a lot of skin <i>doesn’t</i> objectify, it does generate sexual associations.</p>
<p>As far as I see it, suggestive posturing is a volitional act that we make in the moment, one that is intended to express “see what’s on offer”. That people respond to such invitations by checking out the wares rather than the person seems to me to reflect the response working as intended. In contrast, skin exposure need not be any kind of signal to a viewer – we expose skin when we wash, swim or stay cool (or just because we want to).  That seeing skin can rouse some sexual feeling, but doesn’t automatically make us see the person any less, seems to me to be a fairly decent and respectful way for our perceptual and cognitive architecture to be put together.</p>
<p>I should leaven this optimistic take by recognising that these actions take place in a cultural context. In the hunt for ways to titillate and capture attention, media and advertising have exploited the sexual and objectifying qualities of the provocative pose, in a way that inundates and threatens to normalise this way of viewing.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, the way you pose is at your discretion, a consensual act. But where people feel pressure to actively signal sexuality, whether on Instagram or on a night out, the choice is less clearly free. And individuals who through inclination or conditioning are eager to objectify may not require suggestiveness from their target in order to do so; more work is needed to shed light on this. What this study tells us is simple: you can be seen as sexual, without being seen as an object.</p>

<h4>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) have discovered a new role for inhibition, regulating how and when motor learning is acquired in the cerebellum.</h4>
<p>Almost everyone is familiar with the unique mixture of surprise and confusion that occurs after making a mistake during an everyday movement. It’s a fairly startling experience – stumbling on a step or accidentally missing your mouth when taking a drink. These actions are so ingrained that any mishap is almost always followed by the question “Why in the world did I just do that?” This momentary bewilderment is due to the fact that our brains have an extraordinary capacity for learning skilled movements. So much so that our routine actions, such as climbing stairs, become second nature. For the most part we don’t even consciously think about them…that is until we make a mistake.</p>
<p>While mistakes (errors in motor performance) don’t occur very frequently once we’ve picked something up, they are the tool used by the brain to evaluate and adjust our movements in hopes that next time, we won’t stumble or spill our drinks so easily. As the saying goes “We learn from our mistakes,” but how do our brains turn the motor errors we make into meaningful and reliable learning?</p>
<p>In a recent publication in Neuron, researchers from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), have discovered part of the answer to this longstanding question. Uncovering a surprising new role for inhibition in the cerebellum, Dr. Christie’s team has broadened the current understanding of neural computation and provided fundamental insights into the mechanisms and principles underlying motor learning.</p>
<p>“Learning isn’t a monolithic event, that either happens or doesn’t,” describes Dr. Christie. “It’s a much more complex behavior that can vary in duration, magnitude and direction. Our findings demonstrate that in the cerebellum, motor learning can occur along a continuum and what seems to be the key, is the influence of an inhibitory cell class called molecular layer interneurons.”</p>
<p>An anatomically unique region of the brain, the cerebellum plays a critically important role in regulating motor control and coordination. Despite its relatively small size- only about 10% of the entire brain- the cerebellum houses roughly half of our total neurons, around 50 billion. While receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single type of specialized neuron called a Purkinje cell. These cells receive two well characterized excitatory inputs and a lesser studied inhibitory input, helping to guide motor behavior and facilitate learning.</p>

Below are averaged test postsynaptic potentials evoked by parallel fiber stimulation from the same cell before and after the pairing protocol. (D) During the stimulus protocol, molecular layer interneurons were activated following the parallel fiber tetanus.</p></div>
<p>“Thousands of excitatory inputs by parallel fibers, set the stage for Purkinje cell activation by providing sensory and motor context for actions,” describes Audrey Bonnan, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Christie Lab and one of the publication’s first authors. “It’s these inputs that activate Purkinje cells and maintain normal coordination and movement. When we make a mistake however, a second excitatory input from a climbing fiber, arrives simultaneously and delivers an instructive signal. This new information detailing motor error, weakens the synaptic connections between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells; producing a change in behavior and ultimately allowing for learning to occur. But the function of inhibitory inputs in this process, was still largely unknown.”</p>
<p>This alteration in synaptic strength, known as synaptic plasticity, is thought to be the mechanistic correlate of learning. Uncovering how inhibitory interneurons influence plasticity is the first step in gaining insights into their role in motor learning. To address this question, the team performed simultaneous electrical stimulation of the excitatory inputs encoding contexts and those encoding signaling errors, simulating the events that occur during learning. Using electrophysiology to record the output of the Purkinje cell, the researchers then precisely activated inhibitory interneurons by use of a light-based approach for neural stimulation (optogenetics). This approach benefited from a collaboration with MPFI’s Taniguchi lab that allowed optogenetic targeting of only molecular layer interneurons.</p>
<p>“We found that inhibition allows for an entire spectrum of outcomes,” notes Dr. Christie. “Without inhibition, Purkinje cells showed the expected synaptic weakening caused by co-activation of parallel fibers and climbing fibers. By strongly activating molecular layer interneurons, there was a complete reversal of plasticity where synapses were strengthened with the addition of inhibition. Surprisingly with weak activation of these interneurons, plasticity seemed to be negated where no change occurred at all.”</p>
<p>Taking the investigation one step further, inhibition produced a similar type of reversal on learning behavior. Using dual color optogenetics, the MPFI researchers evaluated the effect of molecular layer activation during adaptive vestibulo-ocular reflex or VOR, which helps to maintain a stable gaze by moving the eyes in the opposite direction of head movement. With training, the VOR can undergo learned adaptation where eye movement during the reflex increases (gain increase). Consistent with plasticity findings, strong activation of MLIs produced a complete reversal in learning of VOR, causing dramatically less eye movement (gain decrease). With weak activation of MLIs, little to no change occurred, matching animals with untrained VORs.</p>
<p>“Inhibition seems to dramatically broaden the range with which cells can respond to stimuli,” explains Dr. Christie. “Instead of the brain having only two options -learning or not learning- there can be a tremendous amount of variation in between. For example, learning a little or learning a lot. It’s like black and white versus shades of gray, where the shades of gray allow for a greater amount of behavioral flexibility.”</p>
<p>Dr. Christie notes that the work was a tremendous effort between first authors Matt Rowan, Ph.D., now an Assistant Professor at Emory University; Audrey Bonnan, Ph.D., and Ke Zhang, a graduate student in the International Max Planck Research School for Brain and Behavior, and that their surprising findings have opened up a whole new avenue of inquiry for the future.</p>

<p>Stimulants available on prescription such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall">Adderall</a> improve cognitive functioning as well as attention in people with ADHD, but many students without this condition also take them, believing that they will act as “smart drugs” and boost their cognition, and so their academic performance. The limited research to date into whether this is actually the case has produced mixed results. A new double-blind <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2226-4787/6/3/58">pilot study</a> of healthy US college students, published in <i>Pharmacy</i>, found that though Adderall led to minor improvements in attention, it actually impaired working memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34522"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, from the US and Iceland, recruited 13 healthy college students who were given a 30 mg dose of Adderall in capsule form before one test session, and a placebo capsule before another (adults with ADHD who have been prescribed Adderall take anywhere between 5 and 60 mg per day). The sessions lasted five and a half hours. During this time, the participants completed six neurocognitive tasks (timed to occur when the drug’s effect would be at its peak – between 90 and 210 minutes after taking the capsule). Every half hour, the students also reported how much they were feeling any drug effects and their emotional state, and their heart rate and blood pressure were measured.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The neurocognitive measures assessed working memory, memory for increasingly complex stories, attention and vigilance, memory of past cognition and ability to self-regulate, and also reading. The students also indicated whether they thought the drug had positively or negatively affected their performance on the tests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results showed that the drug boosted levels of positive emotion and raised heart rate and blood pressure. It also led to slight improvements on the tests of attention and focus. But it worsened performance on one of the measures of working memory (recall of a string of digits), and also participants’ perceptions of their past cognitive and self-regulation functioning. It had no effect on reading performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“While improving attention skills, [Adderall] may simultaneously degrade students’ confidence in their abilities to problem solve, complete tasks and interact with others,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27690507">large numbers of students who report taking stimulants</a>, these results suggest that while the drugs might have a slight impact on attention, they probably won’t do much to enhance their academic performance (while Adderall can address a neurocognitive deficit – in people with ADHD – it does not seem to lead to the same improvements in already healthy people). And, besides the hit to working memory, there are other recognised downsides to taking such drugs: common side effects of Adderall include headaches, digestive problems and insomnia. But this was a pilot study, and the sample size was certainly small. More work in the area is clearly needed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It may be difficult for others to understand because, in general, women with children are considered blessed and are likely to be surrounded by friends and family. In this blog, I will address some of the reasons for this loneliness and discuss <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0625-x?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Social_media_mums" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the results of a survey</a> we conducted with new mothers in Japan and what the findings say about reducing loneliness.</p>
<p>Japan is a country with one of the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/japan/Gender2017-JPN-en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest levels of gender inequality</a> <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2017/results-and-analysis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the world</a>. Parenting tends to be regarded as a woman’s job. Moreover, due to the increase of nuclear families and the decrease of regional connections, loneliness in mothers raising children is becoming more of a concern.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors that affect loneliness</strong></h3>
<p>Loneliness is influenced by both personal and social factors. Personal factors include introverted personalities, low self-esteem or attachment styles. Attachment theory assumes that individuals construct relationships with others around them. Their actions are influenced by whether the other person is available as well as by their own estimations of whether they are accepted. This theory led to the formation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_working_model_of_attachment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Internal Working Model of attachment</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, social factors include social networks and support. Mothers raising children can now obtain a large amount of information on medical care and child health via the internet. The current generation of women who experience pregnancy, childbirth, and childrearing use social network sites (SNSs) on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To date, no study has examined how SNS use affects loneliness in mothers raising young children. It is important to assess the actual level of loneliness experienced by such mothers, and to identify social and personal factors associated with this. With this in mind, we aimed to identify predictors of loneliness among mothers raising young children in Japan, with special reference to SNS use.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our results show a U-shaped relationship between the time spent on smartphones and loneliness. … This suggests there is an optimal range of smartphone use which may be associated with lower levels of loneliness.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0625-x?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Public_Health-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Social_media_mums" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new study</a>, we conducted an anonymous self-reported questionnaire survey of mothers raising children under the age of 3 years in Nagahama City, Japan, from July 28 to September 29, 2014. Among a total of 638 respondents, data from 523 mothers were analyzed.</p>
<p>We asked the mothers for information on basic characteristics such as age, marital status, subjective economic status, health status, and education level. We also asked them about loneliness, using the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; social networks, both online and offline; and types of communication devices and information sources used.</p>
<h3><strong>Which mothers are less lonely?</strong></h3>
<p>All participants used communication devices, particularly smartphones. Our results show a U-shaped relationship between the time spent on smartphones and loneliness. Not having a smartphone and very little smartphone use (&lt;0.5 hours) were associated with higher levels of loneliness. Longer smartphone use (2-3 hours, &gt;3 hours) was also associated with higher levels of loneliness. This suggests there is an optimal range of smartphone use which may be associated with lower levels of loneliness.</p>
<p>We found that low support from SNS friends significantly correlated with high levels of loneliness among mothers raising young children. Loneliness tended to be lower as personal networks grew, both those created through SNS and traditional networks of family and friends. This indicates the potential of SNS to reduce loneliness among mothers.</p>
<p>The present study showed that SNS use may reduce loneliness among mothers raising young children. The beneficial role of bidirectional information support, including SNS, provided by public or commercial services warrants further research.</p>
<p>Although the results of our study may not be generalizable, as the questionnaire survey was conducted among mothers who came for regular health check-ups for their children during a specified time period, loneliness in motherhood is a global concern and we hope our findings will be helpful to other settings and countries.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/15/glioblastoma-treatment-new-promising-developments/">Glioblastoma Treatment: New Promising Developments</a></h4>

<p>Cancer is one of the top leading causes of mortality globally. The growing prevalence of the disease has to do with both our changing environment and longer lifespan. It is said that if all humans lived for 200 years, most people would develop cancer at some time in life. Thus, finding a cure for cancer is vital for longevity</p>
<p>Cancer is the unregulated growth of one or another type of cells. In the case of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/">glioblastoma</a>, it is the unchecked growth of glial cells in the brain. Fortunately, brain cancers are less common in comparison than those found in other parts of the body. However, when they occur, they are difficult to treat.</p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/01/06/mighty-microglia-the-brains-immune-cells-could-be-the-key-to-treating-brain-diseases/">Glial cells</a> are a group of cells that have varied functions in the brain. In the past, they were thought to merely be glue cells that help to keep neurons at the place. But now it is understood that glial cells have many other functions, and help to maintain brain health. They do the cleaning, repair, and maintenance, and also play a role in the local immunity.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/">glioblastoma</a> is a rare form of cancer—its occurrence is about 10 in 100,000. Among the brain cancers, however, glioblastomas account for 15% of all cases. It is one of the most aggressive types of brain cancers. Thus, even with the best of treatment, most patients will barely survive one and a half years. Very small numbers of patients can expect to live longer than three years, and less than 5% live up to 5 years.</p>
<p>Despite the progress in the treatment and management of other forms of cancer, only a few <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/14/glioblastoma-can-gene-therapy-really-help/">positive glioblastoma treatment developments</a> were reported in the last decades. For more than half a century, treatment of brain cancers remains based on surgery and chemotherapy. Usually, the surgeon would remove the affected part of the brain, and then they would try to suppress the remaining cancer cell with highly toxic chemotherapeutic agents. This approach has not been working well for glioblastoma.</p>
<p>These days, thanks to advancements in personalized medicine and a better understanding of cellular physiology and genetics, newer cancer treatments are being developed. Instead of mere surgical removal or the use of toxic drugs, researchers are learning ways to control various cellular mechanisms. Using these novel methods, it is possible now to force the brain tumor into remission or train the brain’s immune system to work against cancer.</p>
<h3>Exploiting what forces cancer into remission</h3>
<p>Genes and various factors control every part of cellular life. Thus, cells grow in a particular fashion, behave in a specific way and, when required, go through <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/02/06/what-stem-cells-need-to-survive-in-the-brain/">programmed cell death</a>. In the case of glial cells, this programmed cell death is called anoikis. Further, to keep the brain functioning, these supportive cells also engage in autophagy. Autophagy is a process that helps to keep the brain clear of debris and unnecessary components.</p>
<p>Autophagy can be both protective and dangerous to brain cells. Autophagy helps cancerous glioma stem cells resist anoikis. Autophagy is now known to be regulated by the MDA-9/Syntenin gene. Researchers have found that when the MDA-9/Syntenin gene is blocked, the glioma stem cells lose their protective ability and succumb to programmed death (i.e., anoikis).</p>
<p>Further, researchers found that MDA-9/Syntenin gene suppresses epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Excessive EGFR signaling has been found to be associated with brain cancer/glioblastoma. EGFR is protective against excessive autophagy or programmed cell death.</p>
<p>Scientists realized that when the MDA-9/Syntenin gene is blocked, EGFR cannot regulate protective autophagy, and more widespread death of cancer cells ensues. Now, researchers want to use this feature in a controlled manner to kill the cancer cells.</p>
<p>At present, this approach is being tested in laboratory models of tumor cells and in mouse models. Initial results seem to be encouraging. Suppression of the MDA-9/Syntenin gene in mouse models led to higher survival rates.</p>
<p>Researchers are confident that in the near future they will be able to find safer ways to suppress the MDA-9/Syntenin gene in humans and then start trials on people diagnosed with glioblastoma.</p>
<h3>Training immune system to destroy cancer cells</h3>
<p>This is another approach towards the treatment of various types of cancers. Clinical research has already shown the efficacy of this approach in glioblastoma and many other types of cancers. This approach involves creating an individualized or personal vaccine for each patient with glioblastoma. The initial human trials have already shown a better survival rate.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating a vaccine against cancer, one size does not fit all. The reason is simple; each cancer patient differs genetically. This difference in each cancer patient is linked to the fact that cancers develop due to different mutations across individuals. It means that all patients with glioblastoma have slightly different types of tumor. Therefore, one single vaccine would not work.</p>
<p>The answer to these patient-specific cancerous mutations is a personalized vaccine. This vaccine is called DCVax-L. The vaccine is created by extracting cancer cells from individuals and then training the dendritic cells of the immune system to fight against those specific mutations or cancer cells. Each patient who gets this vaccine would first go through the traditional surgical and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/">chemotherapeutic treatments</a>.  Upon completion of these treatments, the patients would receive the vaccines created specifically for them, to prolong life.</p>
<p>Good news is that this method is already in the last stages of development, and it has shown excellent results in a randomized, blind clinical trial. In these trials, the DCVax-L vaccine was given to 232 patients at various sites. This trial has not yet ended, but the initial results clearly show the higher survival rate. Around 30% of those who got this vaccine survived more than 30 months, and one-fourth survived more than 36 months. At present, 32.6% of those enrolled in the trial are still alive, and they are expected to live between 46.5 to 88.2 months. At present, the vaccine is not a curative treatment, but it provides serious benefits in comparison to traditional methods.</p>
<p>It has taken more than two decades to perfect the vaccine, and researchers believe that things will only get better in the future. In the very near future, we can expect to see much higher 5-year survival rates for glioblastoma patients, and that would already mark a big success.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>“<i><strong>Update</strong>: On Twitter, some researchers argued, reasonably in my view, that I wasn’t quite sceptical enough in relating these findings. See the update at the end of this post for more details.”</i></p>
<p>If you wanted a poster child for the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">replication crisis</a> and the controversy it has unleashed within the field of psychology, it would be hard to do much better than Fritz Strack’s findings. In 1988, the German psychologist and his colleagues published <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-25514-001">research</a> that appeared to show that if your mouth is forced into a smile, you become a bit happier, and if it’s forced into a frown, you become a bit sadder. He pulled this off by asking volunteers to view a set of cartoons (paper ones, not animated) while holding a pen in their mouth, either with their teeth (forcing their mouth into a smile), or with their lips (forcing a frown), and to then use the pen in this position to rate how amused they were by the cartoons. The smilers were more amused, and the frowners less so – and best of all, they mostly didn’t discern the true purpose of the experiment, eliminating potential placebo-effect explanations.</p>
<p>This basic idea, that our facial expressions can feed back into our psychological state and behavior, goes back at least as far as Darwin and William James, but “facial feedback”, as it is known, had never been demonstrated in such an elegant and rigorous-seeming manner. Over time, this style of experiment was replicated and expanded upon, and soon it came to be considered a true blockbuster, so famous it found its ways into psychology textbooks, as well as popular books and articles citing it as an example of the unexpectedly subtle ways our bodies and environments can affect us psychologically. Often, facial feedback has been popularised along the lines of <i>Maybe you can smile your way to happiness!</i>, which added an irresistible self-help element that likely helped spread the idea. Either way, it seemed like a genuinely safe and solid psychological finding. That changed rather abruptly in 2016. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34535"></span></p>
<p>That was when a large, multinational replication attempt of the 1988 study, organised by E. J. Wagenmakers of the University of Amsterdam (Strack had bravely volunteered his study for such scrutiny), delivered some <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/01/no-reason-to-smile-another-modern-psychology-classic-has-failed-to-replicate/">surprising results</a> from 17 labs experimenting on almost 2,000 participants: There wasn’t much evidence to support the effect after all. Nine of the labs found the expected effect, albeit in a much weaker form – a difference of just .1 or .2 points, on average, on the nine-point cartoon-amusement rating scale, between the smilers and frowners, as compared to an average difference of about .8 in the original study – while the rest found an about equally weak effect pointing in the <i>other</i> direction. Summing up the whole episode <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/08/can_smiling_make_you_happier_maybe_maybe_not_we_have_no_idea.html">in an enjoyable and comprehensive Slate article</a>, Daniel Engber writes, “When Wagenmakers put all the findings in a giant pile, the effect averaged out and disappeared. The difference between the smilers and frowners had been reduced to three-hundredths of a rating point, a random blip, a distant echo in the noise.”</p>
<p>But a failed replication is rarely the end of the story, because failed replications often spark further controversy over what they mean – or don’t. This was no exception: Some observers agreed that Wagenmakers and his colleagues’ work really did call the idea of facial feedback into question. Others, including Strack himself, argued that because the researchers had altered certain aspects of the experimental setup, these weren’t “true” replications and thus couldn’t be counted as evidence against the original finding. “I don’t see what we’ve learned,” Strack told Engber. (Strack and Wolfgang Stroebe <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~ghaeffel/AllegedCrisis.pdf">published a paper in 2014</a> making this replication-sceptical argument more generally.)</p>
<p>Now, a new paper adds a bit of evidence to the idea that the failure to replicate here might have more to do with methodological issues than with the absence of a real effect. For an <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-16714-001">article published in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i></a>, Tom Noah, Yaacov Schul, and Ruth Mayo of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem basically replicated the Wagenmakers teams’ replications, but with a newly introduced independent variable to toggle on or off: the presence of a video camera. As the authors explain, this was one of the key differences between the original studies and the replications: in the former, there was no video camera watching the participants, but in the latter there was (the footage was used to check whether the participants had followed the instructions correctly). <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-58542-015">Strack himself</a> had cited the presence of the cameras as one reason he was skeptical of the failed replications.</p>
<p>Noah and her colleagues write that there are theoretical reasons to believe that the feeling of being observed – by a camera, in this case – could have certain effects that might disrupt facial feedback. Specifically, under such circumstances “people adopt an external perspective of themselves… [and] tend to neglect internal information.” In other words, the act of smiling might cause certain internal cues that in turn cause an uptick in happiness or amusement, but the feeling of being observed could short-circuit this connection.</p>
<p>So in half the Noah team’s (re-)replications, there was a video camera. In the other half, their wasn’t one. And sure enough, there was a good-sized statistically significant effect in the no-camera group – a .83 difference between the smiling and frowning groups on that nine-point scale, which was much larger than the average effect sizes of about .1 or .2 in the successful Wagenmakers replications and right in line with what Strack had found originally – but not in the camera group, where the difference was minuscule and statistically non-significant. This, they write, provides evidence that, as per the paper’s title, “Both the Original Study and Its Failed Replications Are Correct.” In other words, it could be that facial feedback is real, but if you feel like you’re being observed, the effect is stymied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This could explain the whole sequence, from the original, exciting experiment to the dispiriting follow-ups from 2016: There were no cameras in the original paper (and the various replications of it that followed), so the effect was observed. Then Wagenmakers’ replicators introduced a new feature of the experiment – cameras – that disrupted the effect, so <i>poof</i>, the effect went away.</p>
<p>Toward the end of their paper Noah, Schul, and Mayo write of the importance of “cumulative science”, and their research is a good example of how that principle could be put to work to help resolve what has become something of a vexing controversy in social psychology. Now, researchers have a new theory to work with: being observed can disrupt the facial feedback effect. One study can’t <i>prove</i> this, of course – it’s time, as always, to run more of them, to get a few inches closer to the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>This sort of research also introduces an important cautionary note into the question of how science should be communicated to the public – as an ongoing process rather than as a generator of open-and-closed facts. It is often the case that fairly limited, difficult-to-generalise-from lab findings get popularised in overhyped ways – the reason the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/28/54-study-analysis-says-power-posing-does-affect-peoples-emotions-and-is-worth-researching-further/">power posing controversy</a>, for example, blew up the way it did has just as much to do with the way the findings were popularised and presented to the public (both by Amy Cuddy herself and by journalists and others) than with the core research itself. At the same time, when a famous finding fails to replicate, sceptics can be quick to label the entire topic as junk science. This new replication of a failed replication provides the latest reminder that psychological lab findings – particularly sexy, counterintuitive ones from social psych – can be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>quite context-dependent and can wither when even subtle changes to the experimental procedure are made. This should make us all the more sceptical about the big, bold claims made by popularisers in TED Talks and elsewhere – and all the more aware of the importance of careful, nuanced science reporting and communication.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (August 21, 2018)</strong>: After my post went live, some researchers expressed scepticism about this finding on Twitter and elsewhere. There were some good, informative threads published by <a href="https://twitter.com/maltoesermalte/status/1029983303946960897">Malte Elson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmmichalak/status/1029943889745076229">Nick Michalak</a>, among others. And Alexa Tullett, a psych researcher who was asked by <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> to peer review the paper, <a href="http://sometimesimwrong.typepad.com/wrong/2018/08/hibar.html">posted that review on Simine Vazire’s</a> website, and it makes important points as well. Check out these links if you want to better understand the full scope of the controversy surrounding these papers.</p>
<p>Overall, the critics make solid points, and after reading their thoughts I believe I may have not covered this study with a critical enough eye. Here I’ll briefly sum up what I view as the two strongest pieces of evidence that go <i>against</i> the idea that this paper significantly bolsters the hypothesis that the presence or absence of a camera can explain the disparity between the Strack study and the followups organised by Wagenmakers. I’m not going to go into some of the more technical, in-the-weeds critiques — readers interested in those can simply click the above links.</p>
<p>The two main issues:</p>
<p><b>1. In this newest study, the interaction effect between camera presence and facial expression was unimpressive. </b>Noah et al write in their paper: “Although the test of the 2 x 2 interaction was greatly underpowered, the preregistered analysis concerning the interaction between the facial expression and camera presence was marginally significant in the expected direction,” with a p value of p = .051.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The “2 x 2” here is simply referring to the four experimental conditions, smile with camera, smile without camera, frown with camera, and frown without camera. As for p = .051, to greatly oversimplify a technical subject, that means that the finding isn’t quite considered “statistically significant” by the (admittedly arbitrary) rules of statistical science: — p = .05 is the benchmark at which researchers are “confident enough” that what they’re observing isn’t random noise, the lower the better. It’s true, as a I mentioned in my report, that facial expression made a statistically significant difference to amusement when the no-camera condition was considered on its own, but the fact the interaction between conditions was technically non-significant suggests a certain statistical shakiness to the central-to-this-paper claim that the presence or absence of a camera moderates the relationship between facial expression and level of amusement elicited by the cartoons.</p>
<p><b>2. According to their preregistered experimental setup, the authors planned on running the study with 200 subjects — 50 in each of the four conditions, but they stopped well short of that.</b></p>
<p>Preregistration is a wonderful innovation when it comes to scientific transparency and replicability: It’s basically a system where researchers publicly lay out <i>exactly</i> how they’re going to run their experiments and what their hypotheses are, making it more difficult for them to engage in certain types of post-facto fiddling and statistical manipulation that have, in the past, likely contributed to the replication crisis. To take the simplest example imaginable: If I pre-register a study in which I state I plan on tossing a coin 10,000 times to determine whether it’s fair, that makes it more difficult for me to then toss it only seven times and (laughably) declare that it’s unfair because I got five tails and two heads.</p>
<p>Noah and his colleagues preregistered this study, and they deserve credit for having done so. But as <a href="https://twitter.com/nmmichalak/status/1029961528764755968">Michalak pointed out on Twitter</a>, they “preregistered 200 participants who met inclusion criteria [but, according to a footnote in their paper] decided to stop at the end of the semester,” leaving them with fewer subjects. Since the whole point of preregistration is for researchers to actually follow the procedures they have preregistered, this isn’t ideal. It could be that if they had run more subjects, their already-shaky “marginally significant” finding would have dipped into the realm of, well, not even marginally significant.</p>
<p>Again, there are other objections too, many of them more technical, so if you’re curious about this controversy make sure to click on the above links. But all this just goes to show, as I noted in the original post, that no one new study should be taken as “proving” anything. Whatever one thinks of the strength of this finding, and of the camera hypothesis, the answer is the same: Run more studies. Ideally bigger ones that are preregistered, and where everything in the preregistration is followed to the letter.</p>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-10445 size-full" height="500" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/cyberbullying.jpg" width="501" />
<p>The English Oxford Dictionary defines cyberbullying as:</p>
<p><em>“The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature”</em></p>
<p>However, cyberbullying encompasses many other scenarios and, although it might not seem as threatening as physical bullying, the psychological consequences are equally bad. Cyberbullying has been shown to result in lower self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and, in some instances, can even lead to suicide.</p>
<p>Several studies have found there are connections between cyberbullying and other socio-demographic factors such as gender and age. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5682-4">study</a> recently published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> has compared patterns of cyberbullying victimization across seven European countries and looked specifically at internet use and socio-demographic as well as psychosocial variables.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their results showed that the highest degree of online bullying occurred in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest in Spain (13.3%).</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers performed a school-based study in seven European countries (Germany, Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Spain), asking students to complete specially designed questionnaires. These contained simply phrased questions with definitions and examples of bullying behaviors online, with emphasis on the elements of hostility or hurtfulness. Their study included 12,372 14-17 years olds.</p>
<p>When comparing individual countries to each other, their results showed that the highest degree of online bullying occurred in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest in Spain (13.3%).</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the high rate of cyberbullying in Romania might be linked with the sudden rise in internet use, which has resulted in a large technological gap between parents and the younger generation. In other words, parents struggle to keep up with their children and the newest online developments, and therefore are not able to provide the right kind of education and protection (boundaries) that children require.</p>

<p>One of the most worrying findings of this study is the overall increase in cyber-victimization since the <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/33731/1/Risks%20and%20safety%20on%20the%20internet(lsero).pdf">“EU Kids Online” study</a> carried out in 2011. Though these studies are not completely the same (the ages of the adolescents vary), this shows a potential growing trend in cyber-victimization that should not be ignored.</p>
<p>To understand cyber-victimization and why some individuals are affected more than others, the authors looked at this in relation to other factors, not only including previously studied socio-demographic characteristics, but also other aspects that might provide a bit more insight.</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for more than 2 hours a day increased the incidence of cyberbullying across three countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>They combined psychological factors and the surrounding social environment to analyze the teens’ physical and mental wellness and how this might be linked to cyber-victimization. Not surprisingly, adolescents that internalized their problems (such as depression and anxiousness) were more likely to experience cyberbullying in all countries analyzed.</p>
<p>The final part of the study focused on the overall time spent online and how this might affect the chances of cyber-victimization. The use of the internet for more than 2 hours increased the risk of online bullying in Romania. However, the use of social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for more than 2 hours a day increased the incidence of cyberbullying across three countries.</p>
<p>The study findings indicate that the psychosocial impact of cyberbullying needs to be acknowledged and dealt with, as it is related to distress and psychopathological symptoms. The researchers also call for educational settings to integrate information and communications technology education into their curricula, especially where use of the internet has risen abruptly. The observational nature of the study limits conclusions about the direct causes of cyberbullying. As five years have passed since the data used in the study was collected, its ability to represent the current picture of cyberbullying may be limited.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Juggling home and work commitments is <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/31721/worklife-separation-is-impossible-heres-how-to-deal-with-it">never easy</a>, and yet there’s been surprisingly little research into how either demands – or support – at home or work may spillover into the other context. Does a frustrating or combative workday negatively affect family life that evening, for instance? Or if your partner is emotionally supportive when you both get home, will you “pass it on”, and be more supportive of colleagues the next day? And, are men and women affected in the same ways? A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/apl0000340">new paper</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>, provides some provocative answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34482"></span></p>
<p>In the first of two studies conducted in the Netherlands, Lieke ten Brummelhuis at Simon Fraser University and Jeffrey Greenhaus at Drexel University asked both members of 26 heterosexual working couples, most of whom had children, and who had been together for an average of 17 years, to fill in questionnaires each day for five days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Immediately after work, they answered questions about their emotional work demands and support that day – whether they’d been confronted with demanding clients or co-workers, for example, or whether a colleague had made time to listen to their problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Just before going to sleep, they then filled in another questionnaire, which asked about interactions at home after work. (They had to indicate how much they agreed or not with statements such as “Today, my family solved problems together”.) They also completed a brief survey that assessed both how much support they felt they’d received from their partner after work that day, and how much support they’d been able to offer their partner –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>cheering them up, or listening while they talked about work problems, for instance.</p>
<p>The results showed some intriguing gender differences. On days when the men had heavier work demands, they admitted offering less support to their partners – and their partners backed this up,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>reporting they’d received less support, and that the quality of the family relationship was lower. But when the women had had a tough day at work, there was no impact on support or family life. What’s more, when the women reported receiving more emotional support from colleagues at work in the day, they also said that evening that they had offered their partners more support, and, supporting the honesty of these claims, their partners also reported that the quality of the family relationship was higher. This positive carry-over of support from work to the home did not occur with the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To investigate what impacts home demands and emotional support – or lack of it – might have at work, the researchers then recruited 64 co-worker pairs for another five-day study. At the start of each day, all participants filled in a questionnaire that asked about home demands and support. Then, in the afternoon, they filled in another survey that asked about what support they’d offered their paired co-worker that day, and also about the quality of the team relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found a similar pattern of results to the first study: men with heavier home demands provided less emotional support to their co-worker, and team relationship quality was rated as lower by both members of the pair. For women, heavier home demands did not negatively affect the emotional support they were able to offer their co-worker – and, when they got more support at home, they offered more support at work, and the quality of the team relationship improved. Again, this positive association was not found for the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers write, “Among women, we found only positive work-home processes in both directions, whereas among men, we found only negative work-home processes in both directions.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This might be because, according to gender norms, women are expected to provide more emotional support and put more effort into maintaining relationships than men are, the researchers speculate. As they also note, equal roles for men and women are more valued in the Netherlands than in some other countries, such as the US. “It is possible that gender differences in a North American sample may be even more pronounced than in our studies,” they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are reasons to be cautious about some of the conclusions. Notably, the data on support provided and received and on relationship quality (at home and at work) was collected at the same time, so it’s impossible to be sure of the direction of the relationship. But as the researchers write, this short-term study does provide several leads for future research, which might explore the observed gender differences, and also whether there are strategies that might help to turn the negative processes observed in men into positive ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
