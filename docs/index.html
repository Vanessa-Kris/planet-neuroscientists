The aim: to ensure that all research papers resulting from work they fund are made immediately freely available on the internet. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Plan S has been controversial, not least because its </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/"><span>principles</span></a><span> outlaw the use of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal"><span>hybrid OA</span></a><span> (although a transition period is permitted if time-limited “transformative arrangements” are put in place). By banning hybrid OA, some researchers have complained, cOAlition S is effectively telling them where they can and cannot publish. This they believe to be an </span><a href="https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20181107234431569"><span>infringement of their academic freedom</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>For their part, publishers worry that the plan is being introduced too quickly and has not been thought through properly. As a result, some say, it could have “</span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1900864"><span>serious unintended consequences for the integrity of the scientific literature</span></a><span>”. And while the initial start date for Plan S has been extended from 2020 to 2021, there continue to be concerns that the timescale is too aggressive.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More importantly, while the Plan S </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/"><span>implementation guidelines</span></a><span>permit open access to be provided by publishing in open access journals, on open access platforms, or by depositing papers in a repository without embargo, most believe that the practical outcome of the initiative will be a near-universal pay-to-publish environment in which the main beneficiaries will be the </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502"><span>publishing oligopoly</span></a><span>, not the research community. Essentially, say critics, courtesy of new-style Big Deals (aka “transformative agreements”) commercial publishers will be able to continue profiting excessively by migrating their current exorbitant profits to the new OA environment.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>How successful has Plan S been? On launch cOAlition S consisted of 11 funders. Today that number is still just </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/funders/"><span>23</span></a><span>. Significantly, the coalition has failed to persuade public funders in the US or China to join (these two countries are the </span><a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php"><span>largest</span></a><span> publishers of research papers in the world). At the same time, it has lost members: the Swedish funder </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2019/06/why-did-riksbankens-jubileumsfond.html"><span>Riksbankens Jubileumsfond</span></a><span>pulled out in June, and the Italian funder </span><a href="https://twitter.com/apacx/status/1167461519124246531?s=20"><span>Compagnia di San Paolo</span></a><span>left cOAlition S in August. On the other hand, some believe that Plan S has so alarmed publishers that the coalition has already achieved its objective (depending on what one believes the objective to be). <span> </span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It is, however, clearly problematic that cOAlition S has remained an essentially European initiative. For this reason when, in February, the Indian Government’s Principal Scientific Adviser, <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_Hlk23342073"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._VijayRaghavan"><span>Professor VijayRaghavan</span><span></span></a><span></span>posted a series of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PrinSciAdvGoI/status/1095266653930024960"><span>tweets</span></a><span> saying that India was joining cOAlition S the news was greeted with great excitement by cOAlition S </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/robertkiley/status/1095301069675085824?s=20">members</a>, </span><span>as well as by Plan S supporters like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Moedas/status/1095701070624550912?s=20"></a><span>the European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Moedas/status/1095701070624550912?s=20"><span>Carlos Moedas</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The news was greeted with less enthusiasm back home in India, with concerns raised about the cost implications, the likely impact on small journals and publishers, and the way in which it would allow commercial publishers to continue to profit excessively from the research community – see</span><span>, for instance, </span><a href="https://cis-india.org/a2k/blogs/should-india-adopt-plan-s-to-realise-open-access-to-public-funded-scientific-research"><span>here</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://thewire.in/the-sciences/six-concerns-over-india-joining-the-plan-s-coalition-for-science-journals"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://confluence.ias.ac.in/plan-s-model-of-research-publication-a-serious-and-unwarranted-drain-on-money-meant-for-actual-research/"><span>here</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Following Prof. VijayRaghavan’s tweets, however, radio silence set in, with no confirmation that India had formally joined, or any updates on the status of its plans. For this reason many ears pricked up last Friday when, during a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjS7fgnNJtc&amp;feature=youtu.be"><span>lecture</span></a><span> he gave at </span><a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/"><span>IISc Bangalore</span></a><span>to mark Open Access Week, Prof. VijayRaghavan commented, “We are not committed to whatever Plan S does or does not do.” This sufficiently piqued the interest of <a href="https://thewire.in/author/mukunth">Vasudevan Mukunth</a> that he sought out Prof. VijayRaghavan and asked for clarification, which led to an interview in </span><a href="https://thewire.in/the-sciences/plan-s-open-access-scientific-publishing-article-processing-charge-insa-k-vijayraghavan"><i><span>The Wire</span></i></a><span> where it was confirmed that India no longer plans to join cOAlition S. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>As I had been trying to interview Prof. VijayRaghavan for some months, I too was piqued by his comments and so took to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RickyPo/status/1187726568854052865?s=20"><span>Twitter</span></a><span> to again invite him to answer the questions I had sent him in June. He agreed and below are his answers to an updated list of questions I emailed over to him.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name="more"></a><br /></div><h3 style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: large;">The Indian context</span></h3><h2 style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So why did India change its mind? It turns out that while little was being said in public there has been a lot of internal discussion taking place in India about open access and Plan S. This has led to a consensus that India needs to find an OA solution more suited to its specific needs. As Prof. VijayRaghavan commented to <i>The Wire</i>, Plan S “is by definition a Eurocentric approach … We will work with them to learn about what they’re doing ... [but] ... What we do will be what we think is best for our context.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What this will mean in detail is not entirely clear at the moment. However, current thinking is reflected in a document published recently by </span><span>three Indian national academies called </span><a href="http://insaindia.res.in/pdf/Publication_of_Literature.pdf"><span>Suggestions for a National Framework for Publication of and Access to Literature in Science and Technology in India</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>This document (as one might expect) argues that all scientific literature arising from public-funded research should be available in the public domain. It also recommends that there should be an explicit provision in research grants to pay publication charges (APCs) so that papers can be made open access. In addition, it says, preprints should be encouraged, and India’s various national repositories should be “synergised, strengthened, and harmonised into a single national institutional system.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Importantly, the document also says that researchers should have “the choice of final destination for the publication of their work”. This assertion alone would seem to put India’s thinking at variance with Plan S, which by banning hybrid OA is expected to significantly reduce the number of journals that European researchers will be able to publish in (by </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7"><span>some estimates</span></a><span>85% of journals will become off-limits).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Finally, the framework document proposes as an optimum choice what it calls a “One Nation-One Subscription” model. This would seem to imply that the government will negotiate the licensing of paywalled content directly with publishers – which would be a departure from current practice where individual Indian research organisations negotiate their own licensing contracts, the details of which are kept secret. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In short, it seems that India is still moving towards a national open access policy, but wants to develop its own approach rather than join cOAlition S. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It has taken India a while to get to this point. OA advocates have been calling for a national OA policy for some years, and i</span><span>n 2017 they even drafted a </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1002618#.XRDBuuhKhhE"><span>proposed policy</span></a><span> and invited organisations like the University Grants Commission (</span><a href="https://www.ugc.ac.in/"><span>UGC</span></a><span>), the Department of Biotechnology (</span><a href="http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/"><span>DBT</span></a><span>) and the Department of Science and Technology (</span><a href="http://dst.gov.in/"><span>DST</span></a><span>) to sign up to it. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>While nothing came of this effort, a number of institutional policies have been in place in India for some years, including the policy </span><a href="http://openaccessindia.org/indias-top-scientific-departments-announces-oa-policy/"><span>introduced</span></a><span> in 2014 by the DBT and the DST (</span><a href="http://www.dst.gov.in/sites/default/files/APPROVED%20OPEN%20ACCESS%20POLICY-DBT%26DST%2812.12.2014%29_1.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3BQKrwDGWb1X77c_TvbFMLdpQDgKtlpV8yVEi5GlzOrj7P1HrTTygAY4E"><span>here</span></a><span>). These policies are essentially </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Green_OA"><span>green open access</span></a><span> policies in which researchers are asked to post all their final accepted manuscripts (post-prints) either in a relevant institutional repository or in one of the Ministry’s central repositories (</span><a href="http://dst.sciencecentral.in/"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://dbt.sciencecentral.in/"><span>here</span></a><span>). These policies, however, are recommendations rather than requirements, and most researchers appear to have ignored them.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Judging by the framework document, it would seem that all the necessary elements for a national open access policy are in place and have been considered. The secret will lie in putting these elements together in a way that works, and which does not produce unintended consequences. Creating a national open access policy is not unlike playing a difficult game of chess.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It is worth noting here that the open access movement has always had two primary objectives. First to solve the accessibility problem (i.e. provide open access). Second, to solve the affordability problem (i.e. reduce the costs of scholarly communication). It has been learned over the years, however, that getting researchers to engage with open access is very difficult and OA policies often have the effect of increasing rather than reducing costs – not least because the research community needs to continue paying licensing fees to get access to paywalled content <i>plus</i> pay publishing fees to enable researchers to make their papers OA in the journals they want to be seen in.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It is for this reason that Plan S has banned hybrid open access (which leads to </span><a href="https://www.rluk.ac.uk/the-costs-of-double-dipping/"><span>double dipping</span></a><span>) and it is why transformative agreements are becoming so popular. The latter combine licensing fees with publishing fees in a single agreement that is (theoretically) cost-neutral. It does not, however, solve the affordability problem.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>India seems to be taking a different approach, insisting that publishers agree to “capped subscriptions” and “capped APCs”, with the aim both of making its research open access while also lowering costs. How this will work in practice, and whether it is possible to persuade publishers to buy into the idea, has yet to be established. Discussions are apparently only just beginning.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What does not help is that researchers are addicted to the Impact Factor and other proxy measures of quality. It is this that has allowed commercial publishers to acquire the power over the research community that they have, and which allows them to effectively name their own price for the services they provide. As Prof. VijayRaghavan puts it below, researchers have been chasing the “derivatives of science” rather than science itself that. “</span><span>The publishing industry feeds this monster of narcissism and the monster is addicted to the food.”</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Sridhar Gutam, Founder &amp; Convenor of </span><a href="http://openaccessindia.org/author/gutam2000/"><span>Open Access India</span></a><span> agrees with Prof. VijayRaghavan. “Authors in India are obsessed with commercial publishers and impact factors, and they are willing to pool money in order to pay the APCs needed to get published in OA journals like <i>Nature Reports</i>, <i>Frontiers</i>, and PLOS,” he says. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And as noted, simply exchanging subscription fees for APCs is unlikely to reduce the costs of scholarly communication (unless India can persuade publishers otherwise). “What India should do therefore is introduce a national mandatory green open access policy requiring that when researchers publish in subscription journals they self-archive copies in online repositories.

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Often when we discuss the replication crisis in psychology, the main focus is on what it means for the research community — how do <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/">research practices need to change</a>, for instance, or which <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/06/theres-another-area-of-psychology-where-most-of-the-results-do-replicate-personality-research/">sub-disciplines are most affected</a>? These are all important questions, of course. But there’s another that perhaps receives less attention: what do the general public think about the field of psychology when they hear that supposedly key findings are not reproducible?</p>
<p>So a new paper in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> should make for concerning reading. Across a series of studies involving a total of almost 1,400 participants, the researchers find that not only do low rates of reproducibility decrease public trust in the field, but that it may also be tricky to build that trust up again.<span id="more-38338"></span></p>
<p>In their first study, Tobias Wingen at the University of Cologne and colleagues gave participants a description of the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">Reproducibility Project</a>, a large 2015 study in which researchers attempted to replicate the results of 100 psychology findings. That project found that while 97% of the original results showed a statistically significant effect, only 36% of the replications did. But the participants in the new study were not told about these results — instead, they were asked to guess how many studies had successfully replicated.  They also rated their trust in psychology, answering questions like “I trust the psychological science community to do what is right”.</p>
<p>On average, participants guessed that about 61 studies successfully replicated — much higher than the actual results of the project. But there was also a significant relationship between participants’ predictions and their trust in psychology: the lower their estimates of the number of successful replications, the lower their trust in the field.</p>
<p>Of course, these data are only correlational — but a subsequent study suggested that learning about poor reproducibility actually <em>leads</em> to lower trust. Participants again read descriptions of the Reproducibility Project, but this time they were told that a low, medium, or high number of the studies had replicated (39, 61 or 83 studies respectively). Those in the low reproducibility group subsequently rated their trust in psychology as significantly lower than those in the high reproducibility group.</p>
<p>Can this trust be regained? In further studies, the team didn’t have much luck on this front. In one, participants were given reasons for the low reproducibility rate: they were either told that it was due to researchers using questionable research practices like only publishing surprising results, or that it was because research is hard and small differences in studies can have a big impact on the findings. These participants didn’t rate their trust in psychology any differently from those who received no explanations.</p>
<p>Trust wasn’t even any better when participants read that research practices had improved since the original project showing low reproducibility. In the final two studies, some participants were told about ways that the field has recently become more open and transparent — in one study they were even given the (pretend) results of a new project, which supposedly showed that now 83% of recent papers could be successfully replicated. But these participants still didn’t rate their trust in psychology any higher than those who only read about the original project.</p>
<p>It perhaps won’t come as much of a surprise that replication failures can erode trust in psychology. But the more worrying finding is that that trust seems hard to repair. The researchers are at pains to highlight that their study doesn’t necessarily mean that there is no benefit in telling people the reasons behind poor reproducibility, or in explaining the ways that the field is becoming more transparent, as there could be small effects that their study didn’t pick up on. Still, they conclude, it also doesn’t provide any evidence that these strategies are effective.</p>
<p>Of course, reading a few sentences about research practices may not be sufficient to rebuild trust: perhaps more in-depth explanation and education could be useful. But on the other hand, most members of the public probably do get their psychology education from short snippets in news reports (and blogs!), similar to those used by the researchers.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution? We could just not tell people about failures to replicate — but as the authors rightly point out, “covering up low replicability is neither an ethical nor an effective way to handle the problem”. Instead, they suggest the first step may simply be to continue working on improving replicability in the field. Although it’s not yet clear whether this will have immediate effects on people’s perceptions, the study did show that the greater the rate of successful replications <span>in the first place, the higher people’s trust, they write. “Thus, if replicability is constantly high, public trust in psychology might rise.”</span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/10/31/arxiv-ng-project-explanation/">The NG project is modernizing arXiv</a></h4>

<p>For arXiv to continue to provide reliable and rapid dissemination of research, our technical infrastructure needed to be modernized. As reliable as our classic system has been, its codebase and technologies have become antiquated and very difficult to maintain and extend. Over more than 20 years, it has evolved organically into a complicated monolith, comprised of disparate and sometimes unclear visions.  Trying to move such a system forward is not sustainable and would push it beyond its limits. Therefore, in 2017, we launched the arXiv Next Generation (arXiv NG) project.</p>
<h2>What are the goals of arXiv NG?</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Incrementally replace the classic system. </strong>Gradually phase out components from the<span style="font-weight: 400;"> monolithic, mostly Perl legacy codebase, by replacing them with services written in Python.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Improve the scaling, failure tolerance, and availability of the infrastructure.</strong> M<span style="font-weight: 400;">ove to a cloud-based infrastructure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Adopt open source practices to have higher engagement with external developers.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly all NG code is in public GitHub repositories under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Modernize user interfaces. </strong>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">ddress critical accessibility issues and provide greater </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">compatibility with mobile devices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Streamline development workflows. </strong>Operate on s<span style="font-weight: 400;">horter release cycles, enabling more (and more frequent) stakeholder feedback.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the main attributes of the architecture and its technologies?</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Maintainability: </strong>Adopt<span style="font-weight: 400;"> mainstream, well-supported technologies, like Python, Docker and Kubernetes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Evolvability</strong>: Move towards a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">modular, service-based architecture where “sticky” interdependencies are minimized.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Flexibility: </strong>M<span style="font-weight: 400;">ove away from a monolithic data architecture. Our data architecture should align with durability and evolvability goals, which vary across the platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Better support for complex moderation and administrative workflows: </strong>Provide <span style="font-weight: 400;">support for quality assurance processes and better visibility and control over the submission, moderation, and announcement processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Better API support and partner integrations: </strong>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">dopt modern standards for data serialization, authentication and authorization, as well as documentation. Increase overall throughput of APIs, and expose valuable backend services to trusted clients.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>How do we seek input from users about features?</h2>
<p>As we planned the arXiv NG project, we conducted a series of surveys of our users and moderators to get feedback about the issues and improvements our community wants to see. We continue to accept feature requests and bug reports <span style="font-weight: 400;">via </span><a href="mailto:help@arxiv.org">help@arxiv.org</a> and our feedback collectors on arxiv.org, and we also seek user input from all of our stakeholders in focus groups and direct outreach during our alpha/beta testing. This feedback continues to inform our planning and priority setting.</p>
<h2>How do we set priorities?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things we want to accomplish to modernize our infrastructure and begin to improve for our community, so how do we prioritize what will be accomplished, how, and when? Three general rules govern how we set priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Impact on core mission:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How does work effect our core mission of supporting rapid dissemination, high service reliability, durability of data, and accessibility?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Technical dependencies and technical debt:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Implementing solutions in the legacy codebase, and possibly out of sequence with arXiv NG, means that some work must be performed twice.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Opportunity cost:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is timing important due to external factors, such as the need to maintain compliance with standards and regulations?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final decisions on IT prioritization are made by the IT Lead, with direction from the Executive Director and Scientific Director, and with input from stakeholder groups.</span></p>

<p>This week on Jurnal Club session Shabnam Kadir will present the paper
"Clique topology reveals intrinsic geometric structure in neural correlations",
by C. Giusti, E. Pastalkova, C. Curto and V. Itskov, Arxiv Prepr., pp. 1–29, 2015.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Detecting meaningful structure in neural activity and connectivity data is
challenging in the presence of hidden nonlinearities, where traditional
eigenvalue-based methods may be misleading. We introduce a novel approach
to matrix analysis, called clique topology, that extracts features of the
data invariant under nonlinear monotone transformations. These features
can be used to detect both random and geometric structure, and depend only
on the relative ordering of matrix entries. We then analyzed the activity
of pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus, recorded while the animal was
exploring a two-dimensional environment, and confirmed that our method
is able to detect geometric organization using only the intrinsic pattern
of neural correlations. Remarkably, we found similar results during
non-spatial behaviors such as wheel running and REM sleep. This suggests
that the geometric structure of correlations is shaped by the underlying
hippocampal circuits, and is not merely a consequence of position coding.
We propose that clique topology is a powerful new tool for matrix analysis
in biological settings, where the relationship of observed quantities to
more meaningful variables is often nonlinear and unknown.</p>

<p>Imagine that tomorrow a catastrophe wipes out 99% of the world’s population. That’s clearly not a desirable scenario — we would all agree that a peaceful, continued existence is preferable. Now imagine that the disaster kills everyone, wiping out the human race. Most of us would rate that as an even worse occurrence.</p>
<p>But how do we see the relative severity of these different possibilities?  Is there a bigger difference between nothing happening and 99% of people dying, or between 99% and 100% of people being wiped out?</p>
<p>This <a href="https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/videos">thought-experiment</a> was first posed by the philosopher Derek Parfit, who thought most people would believe the first difference is greater — after all, going from business-as-usual to <em>almost </em>total annihilation is a big step. He, on the other hand, felt the second difference was greater by far: even if just a tiny fraction of humans survive, civilisation could continue for millions of years, but if humanity is wiped from the face of the Earth, then it’s all over.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50145-9">a new study in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> has found that, like Parfit predicted, most people don’t seem to share his view of human extinction as a “uniquely bad” catastrophe — until they are forced to go beyond their gut feeling and reflect on what extinction really means in the long term.</p>
<p><span id="more-38322"></span></p>
<p>First, Stefan Schubert and colleagues at the University of Oxford surveyed 183 Americans on their opinions on human extinction. Almost 80% believed extinction would be bad, and participants also strongly agreed that human extinction should be prevented and that we have a moral obligation to do so.</p>
<p>The researchers then gave 1,251 members of the British public five variations on Parfit’s thought experiment.  The first group were asked to rank the following three scenarios:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>(A) There is no catastrophe.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>(B) There is a catastrophe that immediately kills 80% of the world’s population. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>(C) There is a catastrophe that immediately kills 100% of the world’s population.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most participants ranked A as the best scenario and C as the worst.</p>
<p>The researchers then asked participants “In terms of badness, which difference is greater: the difference between A and B, or the difference between B and C?” Less than a quarter of people responded that that the difference between B and C was the greater of the two, suggesting that “most people did not find extinction uniquely bad”.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest this may be because people instinctively focus on the immediate victims of a catastrophe, and the leap from no deaths to 80% seems greater than that from 80% to 100%. So for two further groups they tweaked the scenarios to encourage participants to focus less on the fact that billions of people would be dying. In one, participants read that the catastrophes would sterilise people rather than kill them, and in the other they read that the catastrophes would affect zebras rather than humans. In these cases, around 45% rated extinction as uniquely bad (that is, they rated the difference between B and C greater than the difference between A and B) — significantly more than in the first group.</p>
<p>Finally, encouraging participants to focus on the long-term consequences of the scenarios led to an even greater number of people seeing extinction as uniquely bad. One group was explicitly asked to consider the fact that only the extinction scenario would leave no future for humanity, while another were told that if 80% of people died, the remaining population would recover and go on to form a utopian society. In this condition more than three-quarters of participants rated the B vs C difference as the greatest.</p>
<p>Overall, the results suggest that although we believe human extinction is a bad thing, it’s not until we’re forced to think beyond the immediate, short-term consequences that we tend to agree that extinction is a far worse outcome than any other. This was supported by the additional finding that people were more likely to consider B vs C  as the greater difference if they scored higher on a test measuring “cognitive reflection” — the ability to override gut instinct and reflect on the answer to a question. “This could mean that deliberative thought-processes lead to finding extinction uniquely bad, whereas intuitive thought-processes lead to the opposite conclusion,” the team writes.</p>
<p>Why does this real-world test of a philosophical thought experiment matter? We’re living in a time where climate change and technological progress puts humans at growing risk of extinction, say the researchers, yet we’re not doing enough to protect against these existential risks. The results suggest that there are cognitive biases in play that could partly explain why that’s the case, and that encouraging people to reflect more carefully might help overcome these. After all, the team conclude, “if it is right that human extinction is uniquely bad, then we should arguably invest much more in making sure it does not happen.”</p>

In a recent Retraction Watch guest post on the “Eysenck affair,” James Heathers notes the extraordinary possibility that as many as 61 Hans Eysenck publications might be retracted. I believe this figure is a significant underestimate. This reckoning has been a long time coming.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>With an ever-increasing focus on environmental sustainability, more and more of us are changing how — and what — we consume. We’re encouraged to recycle; charges on plastic mean we take our own shopping bags to the supermarket; and market research suggests that campaigns against fast fashion have been partly responsible for a rising interest in second-hand clothing. But how do these kinds of behaviours relate to our well-being? <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/YC-10-2018-0867/full/html">New research</a> in <em>Young Consumers</em> suggests that buying green may not be the way to personal bliss, and that instead we should be focused on curbing our materialistic urges altogether.</p>
<p><span id="more-38311"></span></p>
<p>To understand how our consumer choices affect our well-being, Sabrina Helm <span>at the University of Arizona </span><span>and her team </span><span>looked at the “culturally entrenched materialistic values” that influence millennials. The researchers were interested in two specific kinds of behaviour:  “green buying”, which refers to buying products that limit impact on the environment, and reduced consumption, which involves repairing or reusing things rather than buying replacements.</span></p>
<p>The team started with data from a longitudinal research program in which almost 1,000 college students completed online surveys, initially during their first year, aged 18 to 21, and subsequently three and five years later. The students completed scales measuring their level of materialism, and how often they engaged in proactive financial behaviours such as saving. The team also constructed a 7-item scale to measure proactive environmental behaviours, including both green buying — such as purchasing items made from recycled materials — and reduced consumption behaviours. Personal well-being, life satisfaction, financial satisfaction and psychological distress were also measured.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the results showed that the more materialistic a person was, the less likely they were to engage in reduced consumption. But they were still likely to engage in green buying — perhaps because it still involved obtaining new items.</p>
<p>“There is evidence that there are ‘green materialists,'” <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191008155716.htm">says</a> Helm. “If you are able to buy environmentally friendly products, you can still live your materialist values. You’re acquiring new things, and that fits into the mainstream consumption pattern in our consumer culture.”</p>
<p>These materialists should think twice, however: those with lower levels of consumption also reported higher personal well-being and lower psychological distress, but green buying had no link to well-being at all.</p>
<p>“We thought it might satisfy people that they participated in being more environmentally conscious through green buying patterns, but it doesn’t seem to be that way,” Helm said. “Reduced consumption has effects on increased well-being and decreased psychological distress, but we don’t see that with green consumption.”</p>
<p>It’s <span>important to note that the data gleaned from the research was not causal, but merely correlational. People with higher levels of materialism may be less happy for other reasons, or happy people may be more likely to engage in reduced consumption, not the other way around. And it’s also </span><span>possible that those with high levels of materialism are unlikely to be made any happier by reducing their consumption — after all, the factors influencing that materialism are complex and often deeply embedded in the social and cultural fabric of our lives, and undoing these desires may be slightly less straightforward than we might hope. </span></p>
<p>Changes in consumer habits are obviously not going to be the tipping point when it comes to climate change — as we probably all know by now, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change">71% of global emissions</a> are caused by just 100 companies. So whilst Helm notes that reduced consumption is “more important from a sustainability perspective,” how much single use plastic we purchase on a daily basis is unlikely to make a significant impact.</p>
<p>But how we feel about these issues will undoubtedly develop as the clock ticks on climate change: understanding how to navigate our role in environmental issues is only going to get more pressing.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/608381440/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to communicate with animals</a></h4>

<p>More than ever, humans need to find new ways to connect to other animals. In the United States alone, over 150 million people have a pet. There are over 10,000 zoos worldwide, with each of the larger zoos having several thousand animals. These and millions of other animals rely on humans for their survival. It wasn’t always like this. When humans were hunter-gatherers, we were immersed in animal life and had deep respect for other animals who didn’t need us to survive.</p><p>This changed when humans began to domesticate other animals thousands of years ago. Humans are not going to become hunter-gatherers again. But does that mean we need to experience our relationship with other animals as our domesticating them, as our taking care of them? What we mostly have now are two kinds of <em>parent-child</em> relationships with animals. One kind is the domineering parent to the submissive child. To make wild animals safe, they are made to be submissive, like “breaking” a wild mustang. The other kind is the loving nurturant parent to the dependent child…even when they are adult animals. This is the most common relationship today.</p><p>Is there another way we can relate to animals today? Yes! We can work to be <em>animal whisperers</em>.  How can we do this? By experiencing shared reality with them in an <em>adult-adult </em>relationship. We have all heard about horse whisperers. The true horse whisperers signal to the horse that what matters to the horse also matters to them. Over time this builds trust. The horse and the whisperer become partners.</p><p>And it is not just horses. Many humans have dogs whom they love and care for. But does that make them dog whisperers? Dog trainers recognize as the highest level of human–dog relationship the <em>adult–adult </em>relationship. What is this? A dog and its human partner approach another dog. The dog wants to play with this other dog. But it first looks to check how their human partner is reacting to this other dog. Is my partner having a positive or a negative reaction to this other dog? If positive, then approach. If negative, then avoid. Importantly, the complementary situation for the human also occurs. Is my dog, my partner, having a positive or a negative reaction to this other dog? If positive, then approach. If negative, then avoid. This is an equal, adult–adult relationship where the human and the dog as partners learn from each other how to react to a third party. From the beginning, they know this third party matters to both of them. They have <em>shared relevance</em>.</p><p>This adult-adult relationship with another animal is not just about the animal learning to trust the human. It is about the human taking turns with their animal partner about who takes the teacher role and who takes the learner role. It is about humans trusting their animal partner as someone to learn from. And it is even more than this. In this way, humans can learn from their animal partner about what matters in the world, what in the world is worthy of attention. The humans should signal their respect for the animal, their gratitude that the animal has taught them something about the world that they did not know before. This is the kind of respect of and learning from animals that we had as hunter-gatherers. Simply put: We should say thank you!</p><p>How can this be done with a partner who does not have language or the knowledge that we have? Most of us have already had this experience with a partner who does not have language or the knowledge that we have…and they are called children. Most of us have experienced seeing the world in a new way with a very young child who directs our attention to something we overlooked or ignored that the child teaches us is worthy of our attention. We all know how magical that can be. And when we partner with a child to learn from that child what matters in the world, the child experiences that he or she is being respected by us, is someone we can learn from. It is no longer just a parent to child interaction. And we should thank them too.</p><p>Our animals can do the same for us if we treat them with respect and pay attention to what they know that we do not—creating a shared reality with them when they are the teachers and we are the learners. And we can initiate shared reality interactions by looking for and noticing what is grabbing their attention that we could learn about. Moreover, it is not just learning from pets. We can also learn from our billions of farm animals. Have you ever seen a cow jumping for joy in the fresh spring grass? It makes you appreciate fresh spring grass in a new way.</p><p>We all need to become animal whisperers. That will be great for the animals. It will be great for our relationships with them. And it will be great for our learning about the world in which we live.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Image by Drew Hays via </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/u3o7il8s1Fc"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-to-communicate-with-animals/">How to communicate with animals</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/608381440/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/608381440/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/608381440/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/" rel="nofollow">Brexit: when psychology and politics clash</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-rivers-help-climate-change-resilience/" rel="nofollow">How rivers can help in climate change resilience</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/fake-news-gone-viral-how-misunderstanding-scientific-uncertainty-leads-epidemics/" rel="nofollow">Fake news gone viral: How misunderstanding scientific uncertainty leads to epidemics</a></li></ul> </div>

A recurring theme in evolutionary psychology is that humans did not evolve to live in the modern world. Homo sapiens emerged in the harsh conditions of small hunter-gatherer societies of the Pleistocene era. Then, in just a few thousand years, we found ourselves in a very different world of big cities, fast food and all the rest. This change happened so suddenly that evolution had no time to adapt us to the new world.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Going home from dinner out with a friend or a Sunday family lunch, you may notice you feel slightly more full than you normally do after eating. And while some of this may have to do with how many potatoes your mum insists you eat, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/110/4/842/5552759/?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new research</a> seems to suggest that there could be something else going on. Researchers analysing dozens of past studies on the “social facilitation” of eating have confirmed that people do tend to eat more when eating in groups than alone — and have come up with several social and psychological mechanisms that could explain our increase in consumption in company.</p>
<p><span id="more-38296"></span></p>
<p>Helen Ruddock at the University of Birmingham and colleagues embarked on a meta-analysis of 42 studies on the social facilitation of eating, including experimental research, where participants were observed eating alone and with others, and non-experimental studies, where participants recorded consumption in a food diary.</p>
<p>The review confirmed past findings, suggesting that we eat more when we’re with friends or family and are more likely to moderate the way we eat when we’re with people we don’t know. In that case, rather than pigging out, we choose smaller portions and eat less.</p>
<p>In studies using diary techniques, meal sizes were between 29% and 48% larger when eating with friends than when alone: one study found that an average of 23% more calories were consumed when eating in company. Three studies also found greater social facilitation effects for fatty and protein-rich foods.</p>
<p>The analysis also uncovered additional social factors that influenced how much people ate. Women tended to eat smaller portions in front of men, whether they were strangers or friends, and overweight people ate smaller portions in public for fear of being seen to overeat — one study found these groups would eat 18% less food when with others.</p>
<p>“People want to convey positive impressions to strangers,” <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2019/10/dining-with-friends-and-family.aspx">explains</a> Ruddock. “Selecting small portions may provide a means of doing so, and this may be why the social facilitation of eating is less pronounced amongst groups of strangers.”</p>
<p>So why do we eat more when we’re with others? The team suggests it could be to do with the way our ancestors ate food, sharing it to protect against future food insecurity. Thousands of years on, many of us have no problem accessing food, but the mechanism remains.</p>
<p>Or as the team put it, the “recent and rapid transition to a dietary landscape in which food is abundant has created forms of evolutionary mismatch… in the case of social facilitation, we have inherited a mechanism that ensured equitable food distribution but which now exerts a powerful influence on unhealthy dietary intakes.”</p>
<p>There are more obvious social factors, too: eating with others is, simply put, fun, and we therefore receive an “enhanced reward from social eating”, leading us to potentially over-consume. Overeating in company is also viewed less negatively than doing so alone, giving us permission to eat more with others. And if you’re a regular chef for friends and family, you’re likely to associate providing food with praise, giving you a self-esteem boost and strengthening relationships.</p>
<p>So next time you feel guilty about overindulging with friends? Fear not — you were simply strengthening your social bonds.</p>

<blockquote><p> </p>
<p>We’re all dealt our unique genetic deck of cards at conception. What matters is how we choose to play our hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>These wise words were spoken by <a href="https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-anthony-hannan">Professor Tony Hannan</a>, Head of the Epigenetics and Neural Plasticity Laboratory at the Florey Institute in Melbourne. His focus is on understanding how genes (nature) and the environment (nurture) contribute to the healthy brain and to specific brain disorders.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re trying to work out a little more about the complex interactions between genes and the environment, and how this translates into susceptibility to neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hannan and I first met in Oxford, where he was a postdoc working a few doors along the hall from my dusty ground floor corner lab. He was also delving into the new frontier of nature, nurture and brain plasticity research alongside renowned neurobiologist Colin Blakemore. During this time, Hannan worked with <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/35008142">mice</a> that had the human gene for Huntington’s disease (HD) embedded into their DNA.</p>
<p>In humans, HD is a brain disease passed down from parent to child that causes uncontrollable dance-like or jerking movements (chorea), dementia and depression. Up until that point, Huntington’s was considered to be 100 % genetically-determined but Hannan delayed the onset of the disease with environmental enrichment. The environmental enrichment Hannan is referring to is scientist-speak for rodent housing conditions.</p>
<p>Compared to their cousins in the wild, lab animals live rather minimalist, unstimulating lives with basic access to food, water and nesting material. Animals in the wild survive by foraging for food and those most adept at outsmarting their predators and competing for resources thrive. It’s reasonable to consider control laboratory animals as ‘couch potatoes’ that, compared to rodents in the wild, are sedentary, overeat and experience little cognitive challenge.</p>
<p>To simulate life in the wild, Hannan spilt his HD mice into two groups. Half maintained their couch-potato existence, and half were moved to live in environmentally enriched conditions with access to tunnels, ladders, blocks, mazes and running wheels. Hannan says,</p>
<blockquote><p>We discovered that giving this increased sensory and cognitive stimulation and physical exercise delayed the onset of Huntington’s disease in mice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hannan’s startling discovery was the first to demonstrate the benefits of enriching experiences on the progress of HD, ‘the epitome of genetic brain diseases’.</p>
<h2>Education is equivalent to environmental enrichment in lab animals.</h2>
<p>Years spent in formal education is a potential predictor of cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the evidence shows that people who attend university undergo a slower cognitive decline in older age, and are less likely to develop AD. Someone who left school at 15 will show poorer cognitive performance in old age compared to someone who stayed at university and gained a graduate degree. Although there is recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516261">debate</a> about cause and effect.</p>
<h2>Certain kinds of challenging jobs also have the potential to enhance and protect the brain.</h2>
<p>So another way to maximise your cognitive prowess is to work as a doctor, air traffic controller, financial analyst or in some other mentally-demanding profession.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635733">study</a> analysed 4182 retirees who’d worked in a wide variety of jobs and had been doing the same type of work for roughly twenty-five years before they retired.</p>
<p>The mental requirements of the job e.g. analysing data, developing objectives and strategies, making decisions, solving problems, evaluating information and thinking creatively, were matched assessed alongside each retiree’s mental functioning and memory.</p>
<p>Retirees who had worked in jobs with greater mental demands were more likely to have better memories before they retired, <em>and</em> more likely to have slower declines in memory after retiring than people who had worked in jobs with fewer mental demands.</p>
<h2>What is cognitive reserve?</h2>
<p>Work, education or any type of intellectual enrichment that involves a lot of thinking, analysing, problem-solving, creativity and other complex mental processing help build ‘cognitive reserve’.</p>
<p>Cognitive reserve refers to the brain’s resilience or ability to cope despite damage or degeneration.</p>
<p>Professor Yaakov Stern, one of the earliest proponents of the notion, explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>In people with a high degree of cognitive reserve, AD pathology will still occur, but people are somehow able to compensate for that damage. Some won’t ever be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s because they don’t present any symptoms. Some individuals have a greater number of neurons and synapses, and somehow those extra structures provide a level of protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where does that leave you if you’re not a university-educated air traffic controller with a side gig in medicine? Is it ever too late to build cognitive reserve?</p>
<p>Thankfully, the answer is ‘no’.</p>
<h2>Intellectual enrichment goes beyond education and employment.</h2>
<p>A 2014 Mayo Clinic report found that engagement in cognitively stimulating activities two or three times a week after the age of sixty-five, such as reading books and magazines, playing games or music, artistic activities, craft, group activities, social activities and computer activities, all help. Engaging in these activities at least three times a week during mid- and later life will help delay the onset of dementia.</p>
<p>Hannan’s discovery was published in the journal <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/35008142"><em>Nature </em></a>in 2000 and paved the way for hundreds of studies since extolling the virtues of exercise and cognitive challenge to enhance neuroplasticity, and prevention or treatment disease and injury. He hopes the new discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity have implications for how each of us may protect our brain from the relentless weathering of ageing and disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/608241682/0/oupblogpsychology/">Brexit: when psychology and politics clash</a></h4>

<p>With the recent publication of the UK Government’s <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/831199/20190802_Latest_Yellowhammer_Planning_assumptions_CDL.pdf">Yellowhammer document</a> outlining the financial disaster forecasted for Brexit, it would seem reasonable for people who voted to leave the European Union to change their opinions. Psychological research, however, suggests that once people commit to a decision, albeit a bad one, they are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~ubplj.org/index.php/jpm/article/view/974">reluctant to change their minds</a>.</p><p>Why do so many British voters still want to leave the EU? Brexit was supposed to be about sovereignty but it is really about ownership and taking back control as championed by the political populism that is sweeping across the Western world. Most people aren’t populists but they can easily become so. One reason is uncertainty for the future, which makes people more inclined toward the far right. In their <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062696199/can-it-happen-here/">analysis</a> of the current political environment, psychologists Karen Stenner and Jonathan Haidt concluded that a third of adults across Europe and the US were predisposed to authoritarianism, while 37% were non-authoritarian and 29% were neutral. However, when we feel we are under threat or perceive that our moral values are being eroded, we seek reassurance from leaders who articulate strong, resolute visions.</p><p>This hypothesis received support in a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB689GB690&amp;q=Kakkara,+H.+and+Sivanathan+In.+(2017),+%E2%80%98When+the+appeal+of+a+dominant+leader+is+greater+than+a+prestige+leader%E2%80%99,+Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences,+114,+6734%E2%80%93+9.&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq47Xb9aflAhVUoXEKHe4DCF4QBQgtKAA">study</a> of 140,000 voters, across sixty-nine countries over the past two decades, which revealed that those experiencing the greatest economic hardship voted for populist candidates unless they reported a strong personal sense of control. However, economics still does not explain why the populists also received the support of the predominantly rich, white males for whom hardship was not a primary concern. Ronald Inglehart, a political scientist, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cultural-evolution/34F637928AB1AA87B6409C28B4DFC9F5">argues</a> that, in addition to economic inequality, we are witnessing the effects of a “silent revolution” backlash brewing among the older generation, who see social changes in the younger generation as a threat to their traditional values.</p><p>In his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/trump-brexit-and-rise-populism-economic-have-nots-and-cultural-backlash">analysis</a> of the shifting political landscape, Inglehart discovered that the economic hardship account could not explain all the data he analysed from the demographics of voters for 268 political parties in 31 European countries. A silent revolution would explain why older members of society vote for populist politicians. Each generation wants to take back control of the values they hold most dear from the current generation who they believe are squandering them. Inglehart concludes that “these are the groups most likely to feel that they have become strangers from the predominant values in their own country, left behind by progressive tides of cultural change which they do not share.”</p><p>Voters are also unduly fearful of the future. In virtually all the key dimensions of human well-being life is much better than it was only a few hundred years ago. And yet most of us think the world is going to hell in a handcart. This is a phenomenon known as declinism– the belief that the past was much better than the present. Most citizens in prosperous countries <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317051/enlightenment-now-by-steven-pinker/">overwhelmingly believe</a> that the world is getting worse. Declinism is a distorted perspective that plays into the hands of right-wing politicians who stoke the fires of nationalism and protectionism. The reasons for declinism are many, from various biases in human cognition (including rose-tinted nostalgia and the tendency to pay greater attention to future dangers, especially if you are already wealthy) to fact that bad news gets more coverage than optimism. Social media amplify these concerns by providing a constant stream of unfiltered perspectives and biases.</p><p>Declinism explains why extreme actions and politicians seem warranted when you hold unreasonable fears for the future. In 2012, YouGov <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/%20articles-reports/2012/02/07/%20britains-nostalgic-pessimism">reported</a> that most UK citizens they surveyed thought that since the Queen’s coronation in 1953 Britain had changed for the worse, with the greatest proportion endorsing this negative view among the over sixties.  However, when the pollsters asked whether the quality of life for the average person had improved, respondents overwhelmingly agreed that it had. People can objectively recognize better healthcare, better education, and a better quality of life but this does not translate into an appreciation that things are getting better overall. When asked whether the world was getting better just before the Brexit referendum, only 11% thought the future would be better, with 58 per cent saying that it was getting worse. Again, the older participants were, the more pessimistic their responses.</p><p>Ultimately, Brexit comes down to tribalism and ownership. The trouble with ownership is that we become irrational when we feel threatened by loss. Who we are is not simply our bodies and minds, but our property, our relationships, our jobs, our opinions and our beliefs. And if someone threatens to take any of them away, we fight to keep control even when it is not in our best interests.</p><p><em>Featured image credit:</em> <em>“EU United Kingdom” by Elionas2 via </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/illustrations/eu-united-kingdom-2016-problem-1473958/"><em>Pixabay.</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/">Brexit: when psychology and politics clash</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/608241682/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/608241682/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/608241682/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexits-challenge-maritime-security/" rel="nofollow">Brexit’s challenge to maritime security</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/09/banking-regulation-after-brexit/" rel="nofollow">Banking regulation after Brexit</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/fake-news-gone-viral-how-misunderstanding-scientific-uncertainty-leads-epidemics/" rel="nofollow">Fake news gone viral: How misunderstanding scientific uncertainty leads to epidemics</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/10/OpenScienceBlog-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Sara Rouhi, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of Strategic Partnerships, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS</span></p>
<p>As Open Access Week draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on my brief time so far at PLOS — how six months fly by! — and what I understand “open” to mean now compared to when I started.</p>
<p>PLOS’ position as an early adopter of the APC business model, and the pioneer of the “megajournal,” proved to a generation of publishers that there was a real need for new means and avenues to publish and read — a demand that accounts for the astronomical<a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/01/10/future-oa-megajournal/"> growth</a> of PLOS ONE 2006-2014 (all<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/open-access-megajournals-lose-momentum-publishing-model-matures"> predictions</a> of megajournal decline aside). Along with others, we helped set the stage for the mainstream conversation we are having about OA in the scholarly communication sector.</p>
<p>But with most of the OA conversation now dominated by the notion of a <em>transition</em> to OA, what does this mean for those native OA publishers, like us, who are already OA, and have been for years? If our focus as an organization is to “ensure that research is discoverable, accessible, and useful…to create a more <strong>equitable system</strong> of scientific knowledge and understanding…” (emphasis mine), are we done?</p>
<p>My six months at PLOS has shown me that the answer is definitively NO. Being “open” has to evolve beyond Open Access in order to stay aligned with the PLOS mission. As Dr. Katie Corker commented in her closing<a href="https://cos.io/blog/open-science-is-a-behavior/"> remarks</a> at the<a href="https://improvingpsych.org/"> SIPS</a> conference in 2018,</p>
<p><em>“I want us to think hard about classifying Open Science as a <strong>behavior</strong>. Not as an identity. Not as a value. It is a set of practices that you do in order to make your work transparent to others, checkable and scrutinizable by others in the community.”</em></p>
<p>Critical to this set of practices is making publishing itself accessible and maximally inclusive and, as we have been noting for some time, <strong>APCs are not that.</strong></p>
<p>The next stage of Open Access has to include models and research objectives that remove barriers to both access AND being published. If authors, or their research budgets, have to pay APCs we are always leaving critical communities out in the cold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early-career <a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/16-things-about-ecrs/">researchers</a> (or their budgets) can’t always afford APCs.</li>
<li>Many fields don’t receive grant funding that can cover APCs. (Hello, humanities/social sciences!)</li>
<li>Funding and publishing practices in other parts of the<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/08/08/amelica-before-plan-s-the-latin-american-initiative-to-develop-a-cooperative-non-commercial-academic-led-system-of-scholarly-communication/">world</a> don’t align with Open Access as modeled by the Global North, meaning many researchers globally do not have the funds to participate in author-funded models.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>“Open for whom?”</strong></p>
<p>Equity in<a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/"> Open Access</a> is exactly what publishers should be examining as we continue to evolve our ideas around open. As I said at the SSP New Directions<a href="https://twitter.com/lisalibrarian/status/1179413329292464128"> Seminar</a> in October, “”If APCs are the end point [of this current transitional period fueled by Plan S], we’ve made reading open and publishing closed.” This is not the end point we hoped for and not the end point we should settle for.</p>
<p>As PLOS asks “What next?” regarding open, we are going back to our roots and re-examining the business models and vehicles that can make it all happen and keep it sustainable. <em>Open for whom?</em> and <em>open how?</em> These are the questions at the core of our considerations, and we are examining a mixed economy as part of our future.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges we (and most other native OA publishers) face are:</p>
<ol>
<li>In this time of transition, we don’t have anything to “flip.” Our content is already open and closing it is obviously not an option.</li>
<li>We have no existing subscription legacy pricing (and hence no immediate base from which to derive new kinds of pricing that are not APC-based).</li>
<li>APCs cannot cover the cost of higher selectivity. Bigger publishers can afford to have journals that lose money because their larger stable of offerings can simply balance things out. But PLOS only has seven journals (even if ONE happens to be among the biggest in the world…).</li>
</ol>
<p>Models that we are already exploring are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bundled APCs — lump sums for annual recurring spend</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">While, yes, this is still fundamentally an APC model, it is in high demand by institutions like the California Digital Library and European consortia, helps free authors from feeling it is their responsibility to manage payments, and may finally free us all from the phrase “author pays”!</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Journal supporter-based models</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A collective action model where group of institutions share the cost for supporting a subset of journals — this is particularly suitable for our more selective journals PLOS Biology and PLOS Medicine. The challenges around this model are not small — it has to have the right combination of incentives and “consequences” to make it compelling to participants (especially as many organizations cannot pay for something that’s already free). We’re working on identifying that combination of carrots and sticks and have great library partners helping us on this (so thank you!).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transitional models — bridge funds to give us time to pilot</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We are exploring partnerships with other funders and publishers to maintain near-term revenue while piloting. While not a particular model in itself, it underscores the importance of trialing and piloting things to get it right and understanding that maybe the next model is one we haven’t thought of yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, these are exciting times for me, PLOS, and all those who are still committed to evolving Open Access. I hope this is enough to pique your interest in what PLOS is exploring to address equity in open knowledge. Please continue to watch this space, and please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at the email below if you are at an institutional library, or other organization, and feel you can help us move towards the new business models that will keep open access evolving.</p>
<p>When the theme of OA week itself can imply OA is not yet for everyone, we know we are not done.</p>

<p><em>Note: the following perspective was published as part of Digital Science’s annual survey and report,</em><em> <strong><a href="https://digitalscience.figshare.com/articles/The_State_of_Open_Data_Report_2019/9980783">The State of Open Data 2019</a> ,</strong> to coincide with global celebrations around Open Access Week.</em></p>
<p>The biggest barrier to research data sharing and reuse seems to be a matter of trust, and in particular trust in what others may do with researchers’ data if it is made openly available. The 2019 State of Open Data survey revealed that more than 2,000 respondents had concerns about misuse of their research data.</p>
<p>Concerns about data misuse represent a multitude of issues; fears that errors could be found in their work, or that the data could be misinterpreted or research participant privacy be compromised. Researchers might also be concerned that their data will be reused for purposes they did not intend, such as commercial exploitation, or for misleading or inappropriate secondary analyses.1</p>
<p>The 2019 survey provides insights from one of the largest pools of respondents ever, but this particular barrier – concerns about misuse of data – should not come as a surprise. It is supported by several previous surveys which, when combined, total many thousands of researcher opinions.1,2,3,4 With such compelling evidence that these researcher concerns exist, there is an ever-more important need to explore why they persist.</p>
<p>Practical problems, including where, how and when to share research data, have received much attention.5,6 However, concerns about misuse, alongside the potential to lose publication opportunities (“fear of being scooped”), or going against the more conservative data sharing culture in their own field of research often feature amongst researchers’ top concerns.</p>
<p>Features of technological solutions, such as the ability to share data privately in repositories before publication, and policy-level support for researchers’ reasonable first use of their data8 go some way to addressing this issue of trust. However, trust is more a matter of culture than technology. With repositories being used by around a quarter of researchers9,10 investing in people rather than infrastructure may be a more pressing issue to change research culture, as Dr Marta Teperek, who coordinates one of the largest institutional data stewardship programmes at TU Delft in the Netherlands, has concluded.11</p>
<p>Investing in skills and training for individual researchers is one possible solution, although Professor Barend Mons has argued that data stewardship, like computer programming, is too specialist a task to expect all researchers to undertake. He recommends that universities provide one data steward for every 20 researchers.12 Like most difficult problems, there is rarely a single solution. Experimentation and collaboration are essential if we are to enable researchers to build greater trust in the power of data reuse to advance science – in the same way that the unbridled reuse of content helped grow the world wide web so rapidly.</p>
<p>Scholarly publishers have made good progress in the first step towards changing research culture to support data sharing by raising awareness through the implementation of journal research data policies in the last five years.</p>
<p>At PLOS we have invested significantly in people and processes to support a strong journal data sharing policy since 2014.13 We are seeing a steady increase year-on-year in the proportion of PLOS authors who use a data repository.14 Although less costly for publishers, journal policies that only encourage data sharing have much lower levels of compliance.15</p>
<p>With so many papers subject to a journal data sharing policy now published it is possible to explore actual data sharing behaviours, and the benefits of sharing, at a large scale. A study of more than half a million PLOS and BMC papers found that researchers who stored their data in a repository were associated with an average 25% increase in citations to their research papers.16 This is important given that the 2019 survey suggests that a full citation to research papers remains the strongest incentive for researchers to share their data.</p>
<p>While more publishers must invest further in data sharing support for researchers, we should be encouraged by collaborations between publishers and other stakeholders to enable data sharing to be more effective and rewarding. In 2019 the STM Association is collaborating with a Research Data Alliance initiative to implement consistent journal data sharing policies.17 There are indications from some large publishers that they will focus on strengthening journal policies, signalling the importance of a greater commitment than only encouraging data sharing, or “data available on request”. As publishers, we can help to build trust with researchers by being open ourselves: open with our content; our data; our policies; and open with our own data sharing insights.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly costs associated with implementation of strong policies and solutions for data sharing but, to paraphrase Dr Jean- Claude Burgelman at September 2019’s CODATA Beijing conference, open science is ultimately an investment, not a cost.18 Open science, and indeed open research, is an investment in creating more reliable and reusable knowledge for the future. While data sharing culture and fears over misuse of data persist in today’s research environment, with so many organizations invested in finding innovative solutions to the problems that prevent optimal data sharing, we can remain optimistic that these barriers will ultimately be broken down in the future.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">In 2017, in my first ever post for the Digest, I <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/10/new-review-punctures-the-myth-that-now-is-three-seconds-long/"><span style="color: black;">wrote about a paper</span></a></span><span class="None"> that challenged the popular idea that “now” — also known as the “subjective present” — is three seconds long. It’s just not possible to define the present so strictly, this review concluded.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Instead of trying to explore what constitutes “right now”, another way to get at our conceptions of time is to ask: when does the present end and the future begin? And precisely this question has now been explored in a series of studies by Hal Hershfield at UCLA and Sam Maglio at the University of Toronto. </span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In </span></span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000681"><span style="color: black;">their paper</span></a></span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">, published in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, the pair report that these perceptions can vary substantially between people — and can affect the kinds of choices that we make, with potentially significant implications for our future lives. </span></span><span id="more-38264"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the first of five studies, the pair asked 199 online participants to write down, “without giving it too much thought, off the top of your head,” when they <i>felt</i> the present to end. They found that the responses fell into a wide range of duration categories (ranging from “right now” to “longer than a year” and “at some future event”). One fifth thought that the present ended “right now”. Another 18% indicated a time between 1 second and 1 minute from the present moment; in total, almost half considered the present to end some time within the next hour. However, some participants had a much longer time-frame in mind, with 15% reporting that it ended at some future event (often indicated as being “at my own death”).</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The second study, on a fresh batch of participants, returned a very similar range of reports, but, importantly, it also showed that each participant’s view remained pretty consistent over a four-month period. This suggests that there are stable individual differences between people in when they feel that the future starts, the researchers write. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">However, they did also find that external factors can influence these perceptions, and subsequent decisions. When participants were prompted to see the present as short, and the future as coming sooner — by showing them a horizontal bar with markers labelled “present ends” and “future starts” only a short way along it, for instance — they tended to make more far-sighted, future-focused choices, opting to read tips about how to save money for the future, for example.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For a more real-world investigation, Hershfield and Maglio partnered with a “financial wellness program” at UCLA. This programme offers financial literacy bootcamps, which are advertised via flyers emailed to programme members. The researchers were allowed to modify these flyers, so that one version read “<i>The present is short and the future starts sooner: Acquire better financial habits today!”,</i> and the other “<i>The present is long and the future starts later. Acquire better financial habits today!”. </i>Horizontal bars matched the messages, with the future marked as starting sooner on the first version, and later on the second. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">To enrol in the financial literacy bootcamp, programme members had to click on a link within the email, allowing the researchers to establish which of the registrants had seen which flyer. </span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“In line with our hypothesis, the short present flyer prompted significantly more people to enrol … compared with the long present condition,” they report.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">In the final study, the researchers found that when the present was framed as being short (and so the future as coming sooner), participants were more likely to choose gift cards that allowed them to save for the future, rather than ones that could be used for immediate purchases.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“We contend that people can experience the passage of time as the self jumping through a never-ending succession of temporal bubbles, each of which consists of a new present,” the researchers write. It also seems that though these bubbles are not the same size for all of us, their size is susceptible to external influence. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“We are careful to note that this research represents a first step toward what we hope is a more complete understanding of how people partition the present and the future, how such partitions affect choice, and the mechanisms accounting for these relationships,” Hershfield and Maglio add. </span></span></p>

<div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239" rel="author" target="_blank">orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239</a></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are pleased to share results from a pilot with 13 journals that tested the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aterials </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">D</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">esign </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nalysis </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eporting (MDAR) checklist, a minimum standards reporting checklist for the life sciences.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MDAR framework, a minimum standards reporting framework for life sciences, was designed to provide a harmonizing principle for reporting requirements currently in use at various journals. It is meant to be flexible to adapt to various journal policies, and provides two levels of reporting stringency, a minimum recommendation and a best practice recommendation. The checklist was designed as an optional instrument to help adoption of this reporting framework. A statement of task can be found</span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/9sm4x/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very grateful to the 13 participating journals and platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BMC Microbiology, Ecology &amp; Evolution, eLife, EMBO journals, Epigenetics, F1000R, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, Microbiology Open, PeerJ, PLOS Biology, PNAS, Science, Scientific Reports </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for testing the MDAR checklist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot had two main goals: first, to understand whether the checklist was accessible and useful for authors and editors to help comply with journal policy and second, to understand whether the elements within the checklist are clearly conveyed so as to help fulfil policy expectations. In total, 211 authors across participating journals tested the checklist and provided their feedback.  Participating journal teams screened 289 manuscripts using the checklist and 89 of these manuscripts were subject to a dual-assessment by independent reviewers, which allowed us to determine inter-assessor agreement, and thus clarity of specific items on the checklist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are encouraged to find that about 80% of authors and editors found the checklist useful to different degrees and that the majority of participating editors reported only a small increase in manuscript processing time as a result of using the checklist. While participating authors and editors did not identify major gaps in the requirements covered in the checklist, the feedback from authors and editors and the inter-assessor agreement results have given us a better understanding of areas in the checklist and elaboration document where the language is unclear and needs to be improved.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are making the draft MDAR Framework, MDAR Checklist and MDAR Elaboration document and the pilot datasets available</span><a href="https://osf.io/2k3va/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This work was also recently presented at the NASEM workshop on</span><a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Activities/Research/DrugForum/2019-Sept-25.aspx"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing Scientific Reproducibility through Transparent Reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (slides available </span><a href="https://osf.io/byq98/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently gathering feedback on the MDAR framework, checklist and elaboration document from a broad group of about 40-50 experts on transparency and reproducibility. Based on the feedback from the pilot and the expert input, we anticipate revising all three MDAR outputs by the end of 2019.</span></p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>This Sunday marks the official end of British Summer Time, and once the clocks have gone back, it will of course begin to get dark even earlier in the afternoon. Now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48963-y">new research</a> suggests that if you find yourself feeling uncomfortably cold as you head home from work through dimmer light, the light change itself could have something to do with it. The study, led by Giorgia Chinazzo at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne and published in <em>Scientific Reports,</em> shows for the first time that levels of daylight affect our perceptions of temperature.</p>
<p><span id="more-38257"></span></p>
<p>The team used a specially designed room in which the temperature could be precisely controlled, and levels of daylight independently modified, using a range of filters applied to the large windows.</p>
<p>A total of 84 people (42 men and 42 women) were given paper-based, office type tasks to complete at three room temperature levels — 19°C, 23°C and 27°C — and in three daylight illuminance conditions (low, medium and high). The researchers used sensors to monitor the air temperature around each participant, and also their skin temperature at various spots on their bodies.</p>
<p>After each 30-minute session of tasks, the participants reported on how cool or warm they felt in the room, as well as how “comfortable” and “acceptable” they considered the room temperature to be.</p>
<p>Some clear patterns emerged. Variations in light levels didn’t affect the participants’ actual skin temperature readings, or how cool or warm they felt the room, or various parts of their body, to be. However, when the daylight levels were low, they perceived the cooler temperatures as being more uncomfortable and less acceptable than when light levels were high. Similarly, when light levels were high, the <em>higher</em> temperature (27°C) was perceived as being less comfortable and acceptable than when light levels were low.</p>
<p>The team concludes that this is a cross-modal effect, in which perceptions in one sense influence those in another. “The findings presented here provide the first evidence that daylight can affect human subjective thermal perception from a psychological point of view and that results depend on the thermal environment to which people are exposed to,” they write.</p>
<p>There are various potential implications of this finding. For example, those working in office buildings that allow in plenty of daylight may require less air conditioning on hot days that are particularly cloudy, when the light levels are lower. Similarly they may need less heating on cool days that are especially bright, potentially saving energy.</p>
<p>Although this study involved daylight, not artificial light, it also suggests one method that might help get through the next few months of darker afternoons. If you’re feeling uncomfortably cold indoors, and you really don’t want to put on another layer, you might try turning on more lights before you reach for the thermostat.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura's will talk about neuronal modelling of cerebellar Purkinje cell while referencing various papers.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cerebellar Purkinje cell is the hugest and the most complicated neuron
in the cerebellum. As well as cerebellar cortex network, some
researchers think that the cell has rich computational capacity because
of its complexity. Based on experimental studies, it was realistically
modelled in 1994 (De Schutter &amp; Bower, 1994ab), and then the model has
been recently updated (Masoli et al., 2015; Zang et al., 2018). In this
session, I will introduce details of the models (i.e., morphology and
embedded ion channels) and the differences between all three of them.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/vaccine-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Concern about vaccine hesitancy has grown dramatically in the last few years, with the World Health Organization flagging it <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019">as a top global health threat</a>. This is hardly surprising given <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/276217/WER9348.pdf">worldwide outbreaks of measles</a> and other vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
<p>Misinformation relating to vaccines is widespread on social media; <a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/f8cf580a-57b5-41f4-8e21de333af20f32.pdf">a recent survey</a> found half of parents with young children were exposed to negative messages about vaccination in this environment.</p>
<p>The hazard of misinformation is its potential to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07034-4">decrease public confidence</a> in vaccines. The challenge is knowing when and how to address vaccine misinformation without accidentally amplifying it.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we asked experts how they manage vaccine misinformation on social media. We <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7659-3">published our findings</a> in <em>BMC Public Health</em> this month.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine-promoting organizations are well-placed to address misinformation</strong></p>
<p>We developed our research around the notion that vaccine-promoting organizations are in a favorable position to address misinformation. Unlike traditional media, social media platforms offer these organizations a direct line of communication with parents and other people making decisions about vaccinations.</p>
<p>Thus, investigating their perspectives and strategies is an important means of supporting efforts to deal with vaccine misinformation.</p>
<p>We set out to gather insights by interviewing people responsible for day-to-day social media activity and strategy in vaccine-promoting organizations in Australia. We targeted organizations active on Facebook, the dominant social media platform in Australia, and Twitter, known for hosting debates around health issues.</p>
<p>In total, we interviewed 21 participants from 17 organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Trust in vaccines is perceived as under threat </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11352 alignleft" height="219" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/vaccines-300x219.jpg" width="300" />Our participants described vaccination as divisive on social media, with polarized dialogue and hostile interactions being commonplace.</p>
<p>Their main audience was parents making decisions about vaccination. They recognized that this audience extended beyond those people openly participating on social media.</p>
<p>Some speculated that this <em>silent audience</em>—users who are listening but not responding in any visible way—may have comments or questions about vaccines but avoid discussing them in public because they are worried about being attacked.</p>
<p>They identified multiple threats to their audience’s trust in vaccination in this environment. At the top of their list was the pervasiveness of misinformation. Anti-vaccine activists were also characterized as a threat because of their perceived persuasiveness and use of assertive tactics such as prolific posting of misinformation.</p>
<p>Participants spoke of an anti-science sentiment among some users of social media. The complexity of the vaccine narrative posed further difficulties; it could be challenging to discuss adverse events, for example, without alarming audiences or appearing to gloss over risks.</p>
<p><strong>Organizations use a sophisticated array of strategies </strong></p>
<p>Our participants asserted that amplifying the pro-vaccine voice—by building their online presence and boosting the visibility of like-minded organizations—was necessary to counterbalance misinformation and the voice of activists on social media.</p>
<p>They used a sophisticated array of strategies to promote vaccines. Sharing scientific evidence and facts was their primary tactic. Many attempted to create safe spaces where their audience could ask questions without fear of harassment from both pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine activists.</p>
<p>Curbing the influence of misinformation was also key. Our participants emphasized the importance of being concise and respectful when responding to posts containing misinformation.</p>
<p>Many opted to ignore, delete, or hide offending posts. This was to avoid being drawn into unproductive arguments and avoid amplifying misinformation.</p>
<p><strong>Our recommendations for responding to misinformation on social media </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11351" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/11/socialemdia-300x225.jpg" width="300" />Based on our findings, we have made recommendations to vaccine-promoting organizations to help them respond to misinformation on social media.</p>
<ul>
<li>When countering misinformation, avoid explicitly repeating the misinformation—this may inadvertently strengthen it in the audience’s memory. Emphasize the correct information instead.</li>
<li>Offer information and answer questions in an honest and forthcoming way. Acknowledge risks. This can help decrease perceptions of risk and build trust, which is key when engaging with people who lack confidence in vaccination.</li>
<li>While conveying facts is important, be cautious about overloading audiences with complex information. Complexity can reinforce misinformation, especially if the inaccurate narrative is simple and compelling. Try to offer audiences information that is straightforward and accessible.</li>
<li>While it can be tempting to combat misinformation with facts, facts may not be enough. Offering non-judgemental support can also be valuable, as can story-telling and anecdotes about positive experiences of vaccination.</li>
<li>Avoid antagonistic exchanges with anti-vaccine activists. Public arguments may send the erroneous signal that the value of vaccination is in dispute, when it is not. Keep interactions with anti-vaccine activists brief, factual and polite.</li>
<li>Bear in mind that not all negative comments come from anti-vaccine activists. Hesitant parents can have real questions about safety. Labeling them anti-vaccine risks losing trust with this important audience.</li>
<li>Finally, be aware of opportunities to influence the silent audience. It may be less resource-intensive to delete or hide offending posts rather than engage with misinformation on social media. However, when done in light of the suggestions above, responding to misinformation may influence silent audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>When dealing with vaccine misinformation on social media, organizations need to balance the potential benefits of directly responding with the risks and the amount of effort required.</p>
<p>We suggest reserving resources for when misinformation has spread beyond its source community. Having a well-defined indicator for the <em>reach </em>of a social media post, link, or comment could be an appropriate way of deciding when to act.</p>

The protesters are calling for the resignation of Senator Fraser Anning, following the statement he issued within hours of the Christchurch terror attacks on Friday 15 March, linking the shootings at two mosques to immigration. Those attacks killed 50 people and have left dozens more injured. The accused attacker, 28-year-old Australian, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged with murder and remanded in custody until April 5. The attack is the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Log on to Twitter, open a newspaper or turn on the news and you’ll soon see just how prevalent anti-Muslim sentiment is, as well as how likely collective blame is to be placed on the group as a whole for actions perpetrated by a few Islamic extremists. Though American mass shootings are <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-mass-shooting-terrorism-islam">far more likely</a> to be perpetrated by white men than Muslims, collective blame is rarely assigned to that group — instead, they are characterised as “lone wolves”, even when they explicitly belong to or espouse the views of neo-Nazi, white supremacist or misogynistic hate groups.</p>
<p>But now, Emile Bruneau, director of the Peace and Conflict Neuroscience Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues have designed a simple intervention to reduce anti-Muslim sentiment — and both a month and a year on, the effect seems to have held.<span id="more-38245"></span></p>
<p>In their new paper, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0747-7"><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>, the team asked white, Spanish participants to rate on a 100-point scale how much they blamed Muslims for individual acts of violence perpetrated by extremists (specifically, the bombing of Brussels airport in 2016); 0 indicating they placed no blame on the collective group, and 100 indicating complete blame. Anti-Muslim sentiments were also measured, by gauging participants’ agreement with statements like “We should dramatically decrease the amount of aid we provide to refugees in order to deter them from trying to come to our country”.</p>
<p>Before completing these ratings, some of the participants received a “collective blame hypocrisy intervention”. These participants were asked to read three descriptions of violence perpetrated by white Europeans (for instance, the terrorist attack by Anders Breivik in Norway in 2011) and then rate how responsible they felt the group was as a whole and how responsible they <em>personally</em> were. They were then given a description of the 2015 Islamic State terror attack in France alongside a biography of a Muslim woman who owned a bakery in the city and asked to consider how responsible she and others like her were.</p>
<p>Those who went through the intervention responded with an average score of 16 on the 100-point scale of collective blame — far lower than a control group that received no intervention, and which gave an average rating of around 44. The intervention group also showed reduced anti-Muslim sentiment compared to the control group.</p>
<p>Both groups then took part in the same rating procedure thirty days and one year later. Those in the intervention group continued to express significantly lower collective blame of Muslims after a month and showed a trend in that direction even after a year. And after a large terror attack perpetrated by Muslim extremists took place in Spain between the first and second stages of the experiment, the experimental group expressed less collective blame for the attack and less anti-Muslim sentiment than the control group.</p>
<p>The team has a number of suggestions as to why asking people to consider the hypocrisy of collectively blaming Muslims, but not white Europeans, for the actions of extremists was so successful (as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/10/researchers-have-tested-ways-to-reduce-the-collective-blaming-of-muslims-for-extremism/">we reported last year</a>, the same team also found similar results in American participants). “This activity reveals to people an inconsistency that I think they’re generally unaware of,” <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/simple-intervention-from-Penn-Annenberg-enduringly-reduces-anti-Muslim-sentiment">Bruneau says</a>. “Once they’re aware of it, a very easy way to resolve it is to decrease how much you blame Muslims”. This makes sense considering the intervention’s effects were strongest in those who had “preference for consistency” — those who are most keen to avoid hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Collective blame doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and it’s unlikely that a one-minute intervention will be able to undo the vast amount of social conditioning that leads people to harbour explicitly or implicitly discriminatory views. But understanding the logic behind collective blame, and developing strategies to deal with it, could be one arm in a wider fight against prejudice.</p>

A group of arthritis researchers in China have lost a 2019 paper which was effectively an English-language reprint of an earlier article in a Chinese journal. Two of the authors blamed a “misunderstanding of the academic rules” on the part of their colleagues for the duplication.  The article, “The clinical significance of serum sCD25 as … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/10/22/misunderstanding-of-the-academic-rules-leads-to-retraction-of-arthritis-paper/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">‘Misunderstanding of the academic rules’ leads to retraction of arthritis paper</span></a>

This collaboration further broadens global access to Repositive’s world-leading directory of preclinical cancer models and comprehensive Cancer Models Scout service, which includes expert bioinformatic analysis to ensure the right models are identified for every customer’s research project.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Repositive’s Cancer Models Directory catalogues the metadata for over 5,300 PDX and CDX models, syngeneic and humanized mouse models, GEMMs, cell lines and organoids from specialist oncology CROs around the world. Via its comprehensive, specialist and confidential Cancer Models Scout service, Repositive’s team of molecular biology and bioinformatics experts are on-hand to provide model recommendations tailored to each project’s precise requirements and search not only Repositive’s directory of models, but also its extended CRO network containing over 20,000 models. In addition, Repositive’s experts will conduct complex genomic and molecular analyses of models to find those that will be most predictive of patient response and deliver a comprehensive report outlining the best available models, including introducing pharma and biotechs to their chosen CRO to initiate project planning discussions.</p><p style="text-align: left;">“We’re delighted to be collaborating with Science Exchange to increase access to our Cancer Models Directory and specialist Cancer Models Scout service amongst the translational oncology community,” said Fiona Nielsen, CEO of Repositive. “The streamlined project management, hassle-free invoicing and simple payment options offered by Science Exchange supports Repositive’s mission to make it quicker and easier for pharma and biotech researchers to access the preclinical cancer models they need to accelerate the development of effective cancer therapies.”</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>About Repositive</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">In December 2016 Repositive announced the development of the Global PDX Directory, to act as a global data broker and network for oncology researchers and PDX model developers. In April 2018 the PDX Directory was expanded to become the Cancer Models Platform, and its scope was broadened to incorporate CDX, syngeneic and humanized mouse models, as well as 3D <em>in vitro</em> systems and other popular translational cancer models that support immuno-oncology and combination therapies. After partnering with 19 specialist CROs across the globe, including Antineo, Shanghai LIDE and Xentech, Repositive’s directory is now the world’s largest global directory of preclinical cancer models. In October 2018 Repositive announced the launch of a new Cancer Models Scout service: industry researchers working in translational oncology can ask Repositive to conduct an expert, tailored and confidential search to find the right cancer model for the hypothesis they are looking to test using its world-leading directory and extensive CRO partner network.</p><p style="text-align: left;">For more information, visit <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/repositive">Repositive on Science Exchange</a>.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FhasMnBZaYg/">Welcome to Open Access Week 2019!</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/10/OpenScienceBlog-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Open Access Week! This year, publishers, librarians, researchers, and institutions are discussing and organizing events around the theme: “Open for whom?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is that question so important? Well, over the past 20 years, OA research has surged from as few as 523 articles in 2001 (</span><a href="https://oaspa.org/steady-growth-fully-oa-journals-ccby-license/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OASPA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to as much as 45% of all new research publications (</span><a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4375/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piwowar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> et al). Now that Open Access is a staple of scientific communication, we should be using that momentum to promote greater inclusivity for every discipline, every career stage, and every demographic of researcher.</span></p>
<p><b>Increasing the accessibility of research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OA Research Articles help authors reach broader audiences and allow anyone to read, share, and reuse published research without restrictions. But is the final article enough to ensure reproducibility? Does it provide enough context for readers of all backgrounds to understand the nuances of its claims?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more context authors give for their work, the more likely future researchers will be able to replicate and build off of their studies. PLOS introduced our </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Availability policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2013, requiring all authors to make their data accessible upon acceptance. This was a huge step in making research more reusable and, importantly for authors, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more citable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Since then, we’ve actively implemented tools to allow researchers to share additional elements of their research such as </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/04/reproducibility-and-recognition-one-year-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why stop there? In addition to full access to the research itself, we want to increase the transparency of the entire research process. Shoehorning years’ worth of investigation and discovery into a single article minimizes the recognition scientists receive for their work. Instead of molding science to fit the forms of research communication, we’re thinking of new outputs like </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cos.io/prereg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preregistration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and new article types that will empower researchers to tell the full story of their science in a more authentic sequence. At the end of the publication process, we also hope to see more authors opt-in to publish their </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, demonstrating the expert opinions which have helped shape the work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If we open additional steps of the research process and outcomes to everyone, we can increase public understanding and trust in science, while accelerating scientific advancement. </span></p>
<p><b>Ensuring Open Access is Open to All</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APC models have dominated the space from the launch of the first Open Access journals in the early 2000s. The model assumes researchers’ funding can help pay for the costs of publishing in order to make the work immediately and freely available to the public. While this model has gained widespread recognition from funders, and even become a mandate of </span><a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2013/02/us-white-house-announces-open-access-policy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxpayer-funded research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and policies like </span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not all authors who want to publish Open Access have the funding to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many journals, </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/fee-assistance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like PLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offer fee-assistance programs for authors who lack the funding, particularly for researchers in low and middle-income countries. But these programs don’t cover every researcher or every paper.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/8291_4553118035_6f9e5c0517_o-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I remember 1994: South Africa became a democracy and the entire nation, regardless of race, color, religion, or creed went to the polls. At this time, pediatric HIV infection was an emerging and growing public health problem. At a meeting held in Ghent, Belgium, in 1992, principal investigators of 14 studies reported that vertical HIV transmission (MTCT) ranged from 13 – 32% in developed countries and from 26 – 48% in resource limited settings. By 1995 although intrauterine MTCT had been described as early as 12 weeks gestation, most data demonstrated that the majority of intrauterine MTCT occurred during the last two months of pregnancy. Initial data quantified the risk of postnatal MTCT as being highest in the first few months post-delivery and reducing thereafter. Soon these results were superseded by a meta-analysis which reported, for the first time, a constant risk of postnatal MTCT during breastfeeding.</p>
<p>By the year 2000, experts in the field of MTCT reached a consensus agreement on the absolute and relative risk of MTCT in the absence of antiretroviral medicine. The risks being 5-10% during the intrauterine period, 10-20% during the intrapartum period, and 15-20% through 18-24 months of breastfeeding. During this time, the health care resources available for mothers currently living with HIV, and for the prevention of MTCT (PMTCT), remained low. Children were hospitalized with HIV infection or AIDS almost daily. Now, 20 years later, South Africa and the world is a different place.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, 20 years later, South Africa and the world is a different place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Medical professionals offer HIV triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all pregnant and lactating women as soon as their HIV diagnosis is confirmed. Policies recommend regular viral load monitoring, infant HIV testing is conducted at birth, and ART is provided to infants with confirmed HIV infection – almost immediately. Whereas we initially advised avoidance or early cessation of breastfeeding to prevent MTCT, common sense, supported by data, has prevailed with the global agreement being that HIV-free survival (having a child that is HIV-free, alive, healthy, and thriving) is more important than just preventing MTCT alone. Thus, between 2010 and 2016, breastfeeding with maternal viral suppression has been re-positioned as a key child survival strategy both globally and especially in South Africa.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11363" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11363" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/HIV-infected_H9_T_cell_6813396647-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">HIV-infected H9 T-cell</div><div class="attachment-image--source">NIAID [CC BY 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)]</div></figure>
<p>Under the leadership of the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNAIDS, and UNICEF, we are actively working towards the elimination of MTCT as a public health problem. In South Africa, survey, routine laboratory, and district health information system data demonstrated that antiretroviral medicine could reduce MTCT from approximately 25% at delivery to 2.6% at six weeks in 2013 and to 0.9% by ten weeks. However, many countries, including South Africa, still have no systematic way to measure final infant MTCT outcome at cessation of breastfeeding. Community, and facility, based surveys which measure early (4-12 weeks post-delivery) and late (18-24 months post-delivery) outcomes have been attempted, at high cost. Guided by key global documents, countries are establishing routine monitoring systems to track MTCT outcomes, nationally or in sentinel sites, using birth registers or mother-infant registers.</p>
<blockquote><p>(…) we are actively working towards eliminating vertical transmission of HIV as a public health problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside the critical need to monitor long-term PMTCT outcome for mother and baby, there is a non-negotiable need: (i) to support HIV uninfected mothers in high risk settings so they test regularly, (ii) for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers living with HIV to initiate ART on HIV diagnosis, and (iii) to optimize ART adherence and maintain viral load suppression in mothers living with HIV. Uninfected children exposed to HIV are emerging as a high risk group for short and long-term morbidity including sub-optimal growth, development and mortality. Consequently, all PMTCT interventions and monitoring systems need to be framed within a maternal, newborn, and child health framework and a life-course approach to ensure sustainable inter-generational outcomes.</p>
<p>Such an approach is needed to optimize the lives of mothers in general, mothers living with HIV, their partners, their children living with HIV and their HIV exposed uninfected children.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11348" style="width: 266px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11348" height="256" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Fotolia_59891471_Subscription_Yearly_XL-300x300.jpg" title="Fotolia" width="256" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Fotolia</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Health programs are often funded through different sources and donors/partners often have their own priorities, emphasizing particular aspects of maternal and child health interventions, such as number of children on triple ART, over other aspects. We cannot forget the long-term importance of strengthening health systems for program implementation and monitoring, and of a coordinated response that includes other related systems such as education and social support. Such integrated approaches are needed to optimize the lives of mothers in general, mothers living with HIV, their partners, their children living with HIV and their HIV exposed uninfected children.</p>
<p>As a service to our communities in high HIV prevalence settings and a tribute to public health leaders such as <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32172-5/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Sanders</a>, let us commit to achieve even better, wholistic outcomes for mothers, children and their families, over the next 20 years!</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>For many teenagers, being popular is the ultimate form of success. But how to get there is not always so clear. Past research has identified two types of popular teens: the aggressive and the prosocial. Aggressively popular teens are more likely to be coercive or hostile whilst seeking popularity; the prosocial are co-operative and more likely to be stereotypically “nice”.</p>
<p>But in new <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13269">research</a> <span>from Florida Atlantic University and the University of Montreal,</span><span> </span><span>published in</span><span> </span><em>Child Development, </em><span>a third group has emerged: the “bistrategic” teen. This group is neither stereotypically aggressive nor stereotypically nice: instead, they walk the line, using aggression when needed but also being able to smooth things over with strategies usually seen in a more prosocial teen. And this seems to be such a successful tactic that these teens are the most popular of the lot.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-38231"></span></p>
<p>Researchers collected survey data from 568 students at three secondary schools in Montreal, twice while they were in the 7th grade (around 12 years old) and twice in the 8th grade. In some of these surveys, participants were asked to nominate members of their peer group who were particularly popular, likeable, aggressive or prone to being bullied, amongst other measures. Other surveys involved participants rating themselves on social and emotional measures like depression and loneliness.</p>
<p>The team then used the data on popularity, aggression, and prosocial behavior in a statistical model to understand what distinct kinds of popular teens exist. Three groups emerged: the aggressive and prosocial types identified by previous research, and the newly discovered bistrategic teen, consisting of teens who were often nominated by their peers as being aggressive but also as being co-operative and kind. This group was neither the largest nor the most rare: 12% of the sample was classified as bistrategic, compared to 20% prosocial and 5% aggressive. But it was the most popular, with its members identified as popular by around a third of classmates.</p>
<p>“These teens are, by far, the most popular among their peers,” senior author <span>Amy C. Hartl </span><span>says over email. “They appear to balance their aggression with beneficent behaviour and gain the most reward for doing so.”</span></p>
<p>Hartl and her team are now interested in looking at teens who aren’t popular. “Our study helps define what makes adolescents popular, but it doesn’t distinguish between those who <em>aren’t</em> popular from those who <em>are</em>,” she says. “Most adolescents fall into a ‘typical’ group, which is neither popular nor unpopular, largely because particular effort isn’t placed into status-attaining behaviours.” Those who try to gain status and fail, she also notes, may become even more unpopular than they were to  begin with.</p>
<p>There’s lots to be learned for teachers, parents and others who work with children, too. The study demonstrates what many of us already know from our own school days: aggression can often be socially rewarded. Hartl believes that parents and teachers should work cooperatively to remove this social reward. “Teachers need to be careful not to reward popularity gained through aggression and manipulation so that other students don’t mimic the unwanted behaviour,” she says.</p>
<p>What the study couldn’t answer is whether popularity is good or bad, instead suggesting that it’s context dependent. For prosocial teens, popularity can often be just as good as it’s cracked up to be. But for bistrategic or aggressive teens, it may be a double-edged sword, accompanied by problematic behaviours like bullying, physical aggression or intimidation. Identifying these behaviours in teens is key to ensuring that aggressive or antisocial strategies are not taken with them into adulthood.</p>

<p><strong>Time to stop complaining about the youth of today — it’s you that’s the problem, according to a new study</strong>. Adult participants believed that today’s children are less respectful of their elders and enjoy reading less than kids of the past — but that was especially true if they themselves were particularly respectful or well-read. In other words, we seem to judge children harshly in areas that we are skilled at, perhaps because we (wrongly) believe that these are abilities we’ve had since childhood rather than built up in the intervening years, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/10/16/why-weve-been-hating-on-kids-these-days-for-thousands-of-years/">reports Nathaniel Scharping</a> at <em>Discover’s</em> D-brief blog.</p>

As part of a project funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation, brain activity will be recorded from 500 participants during tasks related to consciousness. Researchers hope the results will distinguish between the “global workspace theory” and the “integrated information theory”, which make different predictions about how consciousness is represented in the brain.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>As humans we all have psychological needs that we are driven to fulfil, be they companionship or safety, a sense of belonging or personal growth. And we often meet these needs through our relationships with others: they care for us, make us feel secure, and help us develop as individuals.</p>
<p>When we are in romantic relationships, our partners are commonly the main source for fulfilling those needs. But sometimes they are away, or are simply not equipped to meet our particular needs. In those cases we turn elsewhere, to friends, family and others in our lives. This may benefit us personally — but how does it affect our relationship?</p>
<p><span id="more-38197"></span></p>
<p>To find out, Laura Machia and Morgan Proulx at Syracuse University conducted <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167219877849">a series of studies</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, looking at need fulfilment amongst American adults in relationships. The first study drew on data collected in the mid-1990s from almost 4,700 participants of the Midlife in the United States longitudinal study. Participants reported how many hours per month <span>their partner, and others outside of their relationship, </span><span>fulfilled one particular need </span><span>— emotional support.</span><span> They also completed a number of scales measuring the quality of their relationship and how often they’d thought that their relationship could be in trouble.</span></p>
<p>The researchers found that the more emotional support people received from outside their relationship, the more negatively they rated their relationship and the less stable they felt it was. And it wasn’t simply that these participants were making up for a lack of fulfilment from within the relationship: the findings held even when the researchers took into account the extent of support provided by participants’ partners.</p>
<p>Instead, the team wondered whether having one’s needs met outside of a relationship made people more aware that there were other viable options to turn to than just a partner. In a subsequent study, they gave 413 university students questionnaires measuring the “perceived quality of alternatives”, rating their agreement with statements like “My needs for intimacy, companionship, etc., could easily be fulfilled in an alternative relationship.” Participants also completed scales measuring how often their partner, and other people, met their needs (for instance, self-improvement or companionship), as well as how often they thought about ending their relationship.</p>
<p>The team found that the more participants’ needs were fulfilled within a relationship, the worse they perceived the option of going to other people to meet their needs. But the more they actually received fulfilment from those outside sources, the better they rated them <span>—</span> and the more they thought about ending their relationship.</p>
<p>It’s an intuitive finding: when people go outside of their relationship to try and meet their needs, they learn there are other options out there and they don’t have to rely just on their partner. And that doesn’t necessarily mean they are finding other romantic partners, the authors add. Rather, receiving fulfilment from outside their romantic relationship “allows an individual to feel that being single, spending time with friends, or finding a new romantic partner at some point is a more viable option for them, in that their need fulfilment would not suffer considerably, should they opt to take one of those paths.”</p>
<p>For the most part the study didn’t distinguish between different kinds of psychological need, so it remains to be seen whether there are particular needs to which the results apply most strongly — perhaps those that are closely linked to romantic relationships, for instance, like security and intimacy. There may also be individual differences in how susceptible people are to the effects, something the authors say they will look at in future work.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/METH-D-18-00111-Blog-Image-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>The H3Africa Consortium</strong></p>
<p>The Human Health and Heredity (<a href="https://h3africa.org/index.php/projects/#1558347616787-f81a7088-297e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H3Africa</a>) Consortium fosters genomic research on the African continent, by supporting infrastructural development, capacity building and research. It is comprised of 48 funded projects with 11 focusing on exploring pertinent ethical issues including issues around informed consent, community engagement, stigma and return of individual genetic research results.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns about genomics research in Africa</strong></p>
<p>When H3Africa first got funded in 2012, genomics was new to most of the institutions and countries in which research was to take place. At the time, only few medical genomics research projects had involved African participants, with projects like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19079050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MalariaGEN</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1351" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HapMap</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1000Genomes</a> as notable exceptions. In particular, the proposed storage and sharing of large amounts of African DNA samples and data – integral to genomic science and increasingly common in medical research – raised considerable concerns by African regulators and scientists. Amongst a range of concerns, what stood out most clearly were concerns about exploitation and harm.</p>
<p>Concerns around exploitation were articulated mostly with regard to questions about the role that African researchers would play in H3Africa research. The worry was that they would simply be sample collectors and would not be empowered to lead study design, data analysis and write-up. On the issue of harm, concerns were raised about whether and how African research participants – who may have low research and health literacy – could be harmed by the research, for instance through an increase in stigma or reputational harm.</p>
<p>With a goal of clinical application of findings from genomics research in mind, which usually takes a while and would require further studies on the samples and data collected from H3Africa projects, a more general concern arises of when, if ever, research participant communities and the health systems would benefit from such genomics studies.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11365" style="width: 325px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11365" height="210" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/p072814ps-04798-300x200.jpg" width="315" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><strong>Engagement matters</strong></p>
<p>The concerns raised by regulators and researchers from Africa are germane. The inclusion of African samples in genomics studies is likely to improve the robustness of any genomics findings. Generally, with implications specific for African populations. Thus, promoting genomics research in Africa is of value to both the global scientific community and African populations with the presence of mechanisms needed so as to address the concerns raised by African researchers and regulators being paramount.</p>
<p>Against this background, the H3Africa Working Group on Ethics and Community Engagement – which all three authors have chaired previously – recognized the importance of having a platform to foster a substantive discussion about the ethics of African genomics research on the continent. This discussion would not only need to be premised on conceptual analysis, empirical data and guideline development but also importantly would need to engage individuals who are involved in research ethics regulation around the continent. In other words – we recognized that in order to fuel a substantive African engagement with the ethics of genomics research, we needed to engage the community of research ethics regulators.</p>
<p>As an initial response to this need, H3Africa supported a series of broad consultations with members of research ethics committees, national ethics councils and policy makers from across the continent. Over the course of three years, we held consultations that progressively involved  close to 200 of these <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685153/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stakeholders</a>. From these <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870421/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consultations</a>, there was consensus that there is a critical need for a document that puts forward a set of principles that resonates with African communitarian world view and provides guidance on ways to look at and address some of the concerns of exploitation and harm, when considering the desirability of proposed genomics research. Thus, our engagement informed the development of the “<a href="https://aasopenresearch.org/articles/1-13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ethics and Governance Framework for Best Practice in Genomic Research and Biobanking in Africa</a>”. This document was developed in collaboration with a community of ethics regulators and has been lauded as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04589-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcome development for genomics research in Africa</a>. We also designed training on genomics research for research ethics committee members, guidance documents on community engagement and informed consent in genomics research. These are tools which would help African researchers and regulators engage in meaningful negotiation with collaborators and sponsors to, as much as possible, assuage any potential for exploitation or harm.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11366" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11366" height="240" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/METH-D-18-00111-Blog-Image-3-300x240.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© ktsdesign / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our engagements had resulted in tools that help address the immediate concerns of exploitation of African researchers and potential harm to participants. The degree to which these tools are used beyond H3Africa projects is not known. With emerging ethical concerns, such as those to do with return of individual findings of genomics research and use of results for commercial purposes, insights from African researchers, regulators and potential participants remains invaluable.</p>
<p>Emerging from its ongoing 14<sup>th</sup> meeting in Accra Ghana, the H3Africa Consortium is keen to support the implementation of more consultations to debate ethical issues in genomics research in Africa and develop tools to help address them. For sustainability, there is the need for African governance institutions to also progressively support these initiatives. Institutions like the African Academy of Sciences are already stepping up, however something more substantive from the African Union would be ideal.</p>

<p><em>Note: Come to our </em><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odyssey-2030-the-future-of-research-and-publishing-tickets-62371020401"><em>free</em></a><em> interactive event on Monday, October 21 at the Cambridge </em><a href="https://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/"><em>Festival of Ideas</em></a><em> 2019</em><em> for a discussion with our panellists from Laser Analytics Group and Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication, University of Cambridge, the Company of Biologists and EMBL-EBI.</em></p>
<p>If you could reinvent scholarly communication from scratch, what would it look like? The ways in which we interact and communicate are changing at an accelerating pace and, as a consequence, the way research is conducted is evolving. Research projects have become increasingly interdisciplinary and fruitful collaborations across disciplines that have not traditionally come together are becoming the new norm. The relentless flow of methodological and technical advances continues to move established fields forward and to make way for novel research disciplines. While it remains a fundamental part of the scholarly process, the way in which research is communicated and shared has to some degree been playing ‘catch up’ to these developments over the last few years.</p>
<p>In response, scholarly publishing is also experiencing signs of change. Open Access journals launched and thrived at the turn of the century, catalysing the move from traditional print to online articles and providing free and fully-accessible content. However, for the most part scholarly journals have kept to the traditional format that recognises the ‘article’ as the final step in the publication process. This appears to be slowly shifting as new creative initiatives have started to transform traditional publications. Preprints, commonly used in physics for decades, are now being adopted by many other disciplines as a means for authors to share their work publicly and as soon as it’s ready for feedback — an alternative to the more traditional, but lengthier, peer-review process in journals. Bolder researchers can even share their experiments ‘fresh from the oven’ in digital lab books, and can openly deposit data, software, tools or educational materials, making those available instantly via web platforms and social media.</p>
<p>In this context, what is the place of an article in a scientific journal? Can we think of alternatives that will better serve our current and future needs in research dissemination? At our event entitled: “<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/odyssey-2030-the-future-of-research-and-publishing-tickets-62371020401?utm_campaign=new_event_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_term=viewmyevent_button">Odyssey 2030: the future of research and publishing</a>,” we’ll be discussing the future of the research ecosystem and what scholarly communication will look like in 2030 and beyond. The University of Cambridge will be celebrating the Cambridge <a href="https://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/">Festival of Ideas</a> (October 14-27) and after the excellent discussion we had <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/02/how-do-we-define-success-rethinking-failure-and-success-in-science/">last year</a> (‘Rethinking failure and success in science’), we have decided to participate again. The theme of this year? ‘Change’ — the perfect opportunity to explore initiatives that will drive a re-appraisal of how research is communicated.</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/10/2019-Open-Access-Week-ENGLISH-986x310-600x300-1-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Note: this announcement was originally published by Nick Shockey on June 4, 2019. He is the Director of Programs &amp; Engagement at <a href="https://sparcopen.org/">SPARC</a></em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/advisory-committee">2019 Open Access Week Advisory Committee</a> is pleased to announce that the theme for the 2019 International Open Access Week, to be held October 21-27, will be “Open for Whom? Equity in Open Knowledge”.</p>
<p>As the transition to a system for sharing knowledge that is open by default accelerates, the question “open for whom?” is essential—both to consider and to act upon. Whose interests are being prioritized in the actions we take and in the platforms that we support? Whose voices are excluded? Are underrepresented groups included as full partners from the beginning? Are we supporting not only open access but also equitable participation in research communication? These questions will determine the extent to which emerging open systems for research will address inequities in the current system or replicate and reinforce them.</p>
<p>This year’s theme will build on the groundwork laid last year when discussions focused on “Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge.” The 2018 theme highlighted the importance of making a central commitment to equity as we transition toward new systems for sharing knowledge, and the past twelve months have only seen the pace of that transition increase. Because of this, the Open Access Week Advisory Committee decided it was important to focus on equity again in 2019—to deepen our conversations about being inclusive by design and to turn those conversations into action.</p>
<p>We find ourselves at a critical moment. The decisions we make now—individually and collectively—will fundamentally shape the future for many years to come. As open becomes the default, all stakeholders must be intentional about designing these new, open systems to ensure that they are inclusive, equitable, and truly serve the needs of a diverse global community. Asking ourselves and our partners “open for whom?” will help ensure that considerations of equity become and remain central in this period of transition.</p>
<p>Established by SPARC and partners in the student community in 2008, International Open Access Week is an opportunity to take action in making openness the default for research—to raise the visibility of scholarship, accelerate research, and turn breakthroughs into better lives. This year’s Open Access Week will be held from October 21st through the 27th; however, those celebrating the week are encouraged to schedule local events whenever is most suitable during the year and to utilize themes that are most effective locally.</p>
<p>The global, distributed nature of Open Access Week will again play a particularly important role in this year’s theme. Strategies and structures for opening knowledge must be co-designed in and with the communities they serve—especially those that are often marginalized or excluded from these discussions altogether.</p>
<p>International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussion and action that must continue throughout the year, year in and year out. Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community events.</p>

The official twitter hashtag for the week is #OAWeek, and we encourage those having discussions around this year’s theme in the lead up to the week to use the hashtag #OpenForWhom.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/607807506/0/oupblogpsychology/">Fake news gone viral: How misunderstanding scientific uncertainty leads to epidemics</a></h4>

<p>Recently, I went to a top oral surgeon at a university hospital to have a fairly routine procedure. While I was being prepped for surgery the attending nurse took me through the usual battery of questions: Are you on any medications? Who is your emergency contact? Will you accept blood if necessary? And so on. This time, however, I was asked a question that surprised me: Have you, or anyone you have been in contact with, had the measles or symptoms of the measles? The question stood out to me because I have not been asked this sort of question in the past 20 years. Why has this been added to the barrage of pre-treatment questions?</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html"> reports</a> that over 1200 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in the US as of 15 August 2019. That is just for 2019! This is particularly shocking given that measles was declared eliminated in the US just under twenty years ago in 2000. How in the world can an eliminated illness come back with more and more cases each year? (There have already been almost four times as many cases of measles in 2019 as there were in 2018.) The answer seems to be because we stop doing what is required to keep measles, and other illnesses for which we have vaccines, from coming back—some people simply are not getting vaccinated. Perhaps unsurprisingly the unvaccinated make up the majority of this year’s cases of measles.</p><p>A cynic might be content to conclude that the anti-vaxxers are reaping what they have sown, and that is that. After all, the majority of those who contracted measles were unvaccinated. This stance is problematic for at least a couple reasons though. First, some of those who got the measles were vaccinated. This happens because, unfortunately, no vaccine is 100% effective. The recommended two doses of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffeatures%2Fmeasles%2Findex.html">MMR are about 97% effective</a> for preventing measles. Second, not everyone who is not vaccinated is an anti-vaxxer. For example, the CDC recommended <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffeatures%2Fmeasles%2Findex.html">schedule for the MMR vaccine</a> has children receiving their first dose, which is around 93% effective, when they are 12-15 months old and the second dose when they are 4-6 years old. So, children under a year old whose parents follow the CDC’s recommendations are at high risk of contracting measles, if exposed. Hence, while anti-vaxxers are causing the problem, and some are suffering for their actions, they are not the only ones in danger.</p><p>What should we do? One obvious answer is that we need everyone – who is not unable for a legitimate medical reason – to get vaccinated. How can we do this though? Forcing anti-vaxxers to receive vaccinations seems to be a serious violation of autonomy. And, while the intention behind a policy of forced vaccinations might be good, such a policy opens doors for paternalism. A better option involves education. It is plausible that at the heart of the anti-vaxx movement there is ignorance. Perhaps in some cases the ignorance is willful, or even culpable, but in other cases it may not be. Regardless, ignorance is a problem. Anti-vaxxers, like many Americans, are woefully undereducated when it comes to uncertainty.</p><p>When an anti-vaxxer learns that vaccines are not 100% certain to be effective and not absolutely certain to have no adverse effects (because there are some in very rare cases), they may be apt to think that the science relied upon in developing and distributing such vaccines is lacking. This thinking, of course, involves a number of mistakes. It is a mistake to think that uncertainty implies flawed science. Uncertainty is inherent in all science—it actually <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/uncertainty-9780190871666?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>makes science advance</em></a>. Likewise, it is a mistake to think that since there is some slight risk of adverse effects from vaccination that that somehow undermines the much, much higher risk of adverse effects from not vaccinating.</p><p>Part of the problem here seems to be, as psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309675/risk-savvy-by-gerd-gigerenzer/9780143127109/">has said</a>, “our educational system has an amazing blind spot concerning risk literacy. We teach our children the mathematics of certainty — geometry and trigonometry — but not the mathematics of uncertainty, statistical thinking.” We fail to teach the sort of skills that are necessary for truly understanding and dealing with uncertainty. Perhaps with more training in the nature of uncertainty and how to make decisions when faced with it, we can work toward removing the ignorance that threatens us with epidemics of illnesses that should have stayed eliminated.</p><p>Featured image credit: Vaccines Save Lives by Johnny Silvercloud.

A very weak paper in PNAS has attracted some attention lately: An experimental test of the ovulatory homolog model of female orgasm



The paper aims to be a test of the hypothesis that the human female orgasm is a kind of evolutionary relic from an earlier stage in evolution.







In humans, ovulation happens on a monthly cycle and is not related to sexual activity. However, in some mammal species, such as rabbits, ovulation is triggered by sex (or copulation, as biologists say). In the new

This helps connect complementary research groups with unique and diverse perspectives to solve outstanding research problems.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your area of study and why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>My substantive areas of research as of now are genetics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuropsychological/neuropathological endophenotypes in aging humans. There are many unanswered questions in dementia research and understanding some of those will lead to better therapeutics, clinical care, and services for individuals living with dementia, their caregivers, and families.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What first drew you into the field?</strong></p>
<p>My background is in Mathematics and Statistics. I always wanted to apply my knowledge to real life world problems and when the opportunity came to join UW and perform aging research it was a no-brainer for me.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there any trends in your field right now?</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot going on in AD genetics research right now including multi-omics approaches in genetics, precision medicine, transethnic analyses, resilience to AD, and exploring modifiable risk factors via polygenic risk scores.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you believe in Open Science?</strong></p>
<p>Open science has not only led to reproducible research but it has also made researchers more visible to the world, which has had direct/indirect impact on networking and funding. Widespread adoption of open science has not yet been achieved but researchers have started to notice significant benefits compared to more traditional practices.</p>

<p>This week on Jurnal Club session Reinoud Maex will present the paper <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10827-008-0083-9">"Computer simulations of neuron-glia interactions mediated by ion flux"</a>
, by Somjen, Kager and Wadman(2008) J. Comput. Neurosci. 25, 349-365.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper resolves two questions that have bothered me since long:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How can (neuronal or glial) potassium channels contribute to the re-uptake of potassium, hence how can the outward flow of potassium become an inward flow?</li>
<li>Why is the sodium-potassium pump electrogenic, hence why are three sodium ions exchanged for only two potassium ions?</li>
</ul>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/MEED-D-18-01035-Blog-Pic-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is the first month of medical school, and you hear the word <em>pimping </em>in an unfamiliar context: medical education. You learn that <em>pimping</em>, also known as “<a href="https://icenetblog.royalcollege.ca/2018/12/11/an-overdue-rant-on-pimping-toxic-quizzing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">toxic quizzing</a>”, happens when a junior trainee is asked a series of obscure or intentionally unanswerable questions, usually publicly, by a more senior physician. You may adopt <em>pimping </em>into your vocabulary, which is already rapidly expanding with medical terminology. Or you may not be able to shake the colloquial connotations of <em>pimping – </em>a form of sex-trafficking – and you may silently disengage when classmates and professors casually use the term. Or you may begin to question the culture of your profession, which has retained qualities of exclusion for women, non-binary individuals, and people of color throughout its evolution.</p>
<p>We are adding our voices alongside medical educators and learners who are<a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(19)30419-X/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> calling into question</a> the use of the word, and the practice of <em>pimping </em>in medical education.</p>
<blockquote><p>(…) seeing the very good has helped us to recognize the very bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be clear, we do not fear hard work. We are not afraid to meet the limits of our own knowledge, or the exciting challenges of learning the science and art of medicine. We wouldn’t be here if we did. Instead, we have each had the privilege of experiencing effective clinical teaching. When a senior physician maps out how to localize a neurologic lesion, or stays an hour after clinic to teach us how to read EKGs and chest x-rays, or shows us how to properly hold an otoscope. We have each reaped the benefits of these learning moments. These are the opportunities in which physicians, our teachers, seek to understand how much we know so they can show us what is beyond. We have experienced the good, and seeing the very good has helped us to recognize the very bad.</p>
<p>The word pimping, as described in our <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-019-1761-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commentary</a>, was popularized in a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/377862" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">satirical 1989 JAMA article</a>. At that time, <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/75776/data/aibvol5no2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">women comprised less than 20% of medical faculty positions and around 30% of medical student graduates</a>. The word to describe the practice of toxic quizzing was born from a system that not only excluded <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/182255?casa_token=cTqmT62bo4gAAAAA:ph23voqfZ7HGNZ-j4LDGYbEKtrXbdQAbaCwD1DqhRqOV9WJ-JP3kXS-naU0qYmx1aNeoQ54wuw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">people of color</a> and non-male identified persons, but trampled on the practices of <a href="https://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Barbara-Ehrenreich-and-Deirdre-English-Witches-Midwives-and-Nurses-A-History-of-Women-Healers.-Introduction..pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traditional woman-identified healers</a>. The result is a training system the perpetuates the abuse of power hierarchies. A symptom of this system is the normalized culture of using words that some (and certainly not all) would describe as “locker room talk”, including <em>pimping</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is time to rethink the practice of <em>pimping, </em>and the elimination of the use of the word will naturally follow.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have arrived, after centuries long-struggle, to a moment of reckoning in the face of the <a href="https://time.com/5574163/tarana-burke-metoo-time-100-summit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#MeToo movement</a>. We are questioning not only what language we use as leaders, but also what toxic behaviors exist within society, and in places of learning. We must work to stop harms that persist, particularly in spaces where hierarchies are the foundation of systems. It is time to rethink the practice of <em>pimping, </em>and the elimination of the use of the word will naturally follow.</p>
<p>Can medicine, and particularly medical education, make this change? It can, it should, and it must to meet the evolving demands and needs of a contemporary physician workforce. We see this work, this evolution, related to the ongoing<a href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2019/03000/Student_Perspectives_on_the__Step_1_Climate__in.9.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> discourse on licensing exams</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmhpr022383" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rethinking resident work hour limits</a><u>, </u><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/05/643298219/a-medical-school-tradition-comes-under-fire-for-racism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questioning the harms of medical honor societies</a><u>,</u> and calling out <a href="https://www.elle.com/life-love/a28125604/nonconsensual-pelvic-exams-teaching-hospitals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the lack of patient consent in medical training</a>. When practice changes, the labels used to describe the practice will follow. When toxic quizzing is eliminated, the term <em>pimping</em> in medicine will become irrelevant, because these behaviors will cease to exist.</p>

<p>The use of the word, and practice of <em>pimping</em> within medicine is not devoid of cultural and contextual meaning. Pimping occurs in a training system in which up to <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">50% of women medical students experience gender harassment from faculty and staff</a>, and a society in which <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1 in 4 undergraduate women are sexually assaulted</a> by the time they graduate. For now, the use of the term <em>pimping</em> serves as a label for a behavior that is culturally ingrained within the medical education system. In addition to asking the medical community to stop using this degrading word, we are also calling for the end of this practice.</p>
<p><strong>Support Services</strong></p>
<p>In the United States, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) and the Clery Act are federal laws that require educational programs to address and remedy any known sex and gender discrimination, including sexual assault and harassment on campus. All institutions that accept federal financial support are required to stop discrimination, prevent the recurrence of the behavior and mitigate its effects. Contact the Title IX Coordinator at your institution for more information about your rights and resources.</p>
<p>Some institutions have non-reporting, private resources on campus, such as privileged or confidential advocate programs (resources will vary by institution and state).

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11322" style="width: 386px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11322" height="212" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/iStock-934123382-300x169.jpg" width="376" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Metal clips are widely used for surgical procedures such as wound closure, vessel ligation or bowel reconstruction. Unfortunately, most of the currently used metal clips are made of titanium or titanium alloys which, when exposed to a magnetic field, can interfere with imaging techniques and induce local tissue damages. The need to find an alternative to titanium is, therefore, a surgical necessity. As of late, magnesium alloys have shown promising properties for surgical use due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. Such alloys are already used for bone screws, orthopedic implants and various dental surgery procedures. The Graduate School of Medicine of Kobe University has recently developed a novel surgical biodegradable metal clip constructed from magnesium alloy. The developers have reported the tolerance, biocompatibility and mechanical strength of their clips compared with those made of titanium in a rat model of hepatectomy. The results of the study demonstrate that magnesium alloy clips are safe, cheap to produce, less prone to interfere with imaging techniques, and could be used shortly after further examination on larger animals and other complex surgical interventions.</p>

<blockquote><p>It may be prudent for academics and policymakers to identify policies that increase general social welfare in order to solve the mass shootings epidemic in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Multiple sources report that there has been roughly one mass shooting a day in the United States since 2013, more than any other country. Several factors contribute to creating an environment fertile for such violence, but there is a paucity of research on whether the recent increase in income inequality is associated with the rise of mass shootings. The impact of the recent mass shooting events is particularly concerning as they extend beyond the events’ targeted areas and have major social repercussions. In 1968, the American sociologist Robert Merton observed that communities with large differences in household income maintain an environment of anger, frustration, resentment, and hostility. In BMC Public Health, Kwon et al. published results of a combination of socioeconomic data from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and media sources from 3,144 counties between 1990 and 2015. The results of this study strongly suggest that the recent growth of income inequality is significantly correlated to mass shootings in the United States. Poverty rates were however not shown to be associated with these tragic events. This study, combined with others from the mass shooting literature, reinforces the idea that socioeconomic factors are the main driving factors of mass shooting events and that improving general social welfare has more impact than policy strategies to reduce gun violence.</p>

<p>Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting more than 300 million people. It is a chronic condition associated with a high rate of recurrence, relapse, and comorbidity. The collaborative care management (CCM) model has been shown to greatly improve the treatment outcomes of patients suffering from depression. However, its effect varies depending on the studied population. Physicians from a medical center based in Rochester, Minnesota performed a retrospective cohort study including 3,870 patients diagnosed with depression residing in different geographical patterns (rural vs. urban area). Surprisingly, patients with depression living in a rural setting had better treatment outcomes when compared with patients living in urban areas. This may be associated with the greater support and sense of community observed in rural areas, along with phone calls and online visits performed by the collaborative care management. The collaborative care management improved depression outcomes regardless of the residential area, but the improved outcomes seen in rural settings declined as the patient’s distance away from their primary care clinic increased.</p>

<p>Pregnant women presenting a risk of preterm delivery have a higher risk to develop depression and anxiety symptoms. As maternal stress further increases the risk of preterm birth as well as adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes, it is essential to provide psychological support to women at risk. A university hospital in Finland conducted a pilot study including 13 women presenting risks of preterm delivery. The study focused on three main axes to increase the future mother’s general wellbeing. During ultrasound sessions, under the guidance of a psychologist and obstetrician, emphasis was placed on including the mother as an active participant, considering the fetus as a real person rather than an object, and strengthening mental images of the baby. Taken together, these simple changes awakened emotions and reinforced the mother-baby bond. Although the sample size was a limitation, this study provides promising information about reducing the stress in high-risk pregnancy and encourages practitioners to adopt a more personalized approach.</p>

<p>Intracellular fluctuations of calcium are the main driving force of heart contractility. They are induced and coordinated by electrical current. Calcium flux also regulates DNA expression and cardiac muscle cell growth during development and cardiac pathology.  The prevalence of altered calcium homeostasis in a high number of cardiac diseases illustrates the importance of understanding the regulation of calcium signals in cardiac research. As of late, many imaging techniques have allowed scientists to map and record both electric currents and calcium flux at different cellular levels. These techniques however, are extremely costly, technically challenging, and often require genetically modified models. Recently, researchers from the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric and Surgical Innovation in Washington have developed an innovative tool to increase the accessibility of optical mapping techniques allowing scientists to step up their research. Jaimes et al. have described for the first time, a mapping system recording simultaneously both electric and calcium currents in both single cell and multicellular preparations, using commercially available equipment. This novel platform allows a fast and successful implementation of high-tech recordings providing good spatio-temporal resolution, which is necessary for the investigation of electric and calcium currents both in physiological and pathological situations.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since our partnership with bioRxiv started in May 2018, we’ve been collecting data on submissions that choose to be posted as preprints, as well as those that do not. Recently, we’ve been delving into these data to unearth any interesting trends: Who’s posting preprints? How do they affect publication? Is preprinting still increasing in popularity? Read on for the answers!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Preprint posting is on the rise</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the launch of bioRxiv in 2013, the number of life science preprints posted by the scientific community has been </span><a href="https://rxivist.org/stats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’ve seen the same trend in research posted via our preprint posting program at PLOS, in the year since our service took full effect in August 2018. Hopefully we’ll reach the milestone of 300 posted preprints in a single month soon!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not only PLOS-facilitated preprinting that is on the up, we’ve also seen an increase in the number of authors telling us they’ve already posted a preprint of their manuscript </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">submitting to a PLOS journal.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Authors from African institutions want preprints to be posted</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint posting service appears to be very popular among scientists based in African institutions. While we have posted the highest volume of preprints from the USA, China and European countries, it is African countries that dominate our opt ins – with eight of the ten highest opt in rates. At the top of the list are Uganda and Tanzania, where over 30% of corresponding authors chose to post a preprint at submission.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shared my work as a preprint as I just couldn’t wait for it to go public once I had put it all together. Preprints also offer a DOI and make your work easy to find on the web and in a way this gives the work legitimacy.</span></i></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Time to Publish </b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Arguably the best feature of preprints is the ability to share your work with the community when you’re ready. You can stake a claim on your results and even start receiving citations and attention before your final article publishes. But preprinting could also have a positive effect on time to publication.</p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to do a preprint because we felt the information was important for the field to know as soon as possible and we were not sure how long the review process would take, especially in the summer…. It was great to get the social media response right away and know that the field was getting the information.  </span></i></p></blockquote>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there could be numerous explanations for the reasons behind this, our data suggests manuscripts that have been preprinted generally move more quickly through the peer review process to publication. Preprints that have gone on to be published at PLOS receive a first decision from the editors and average of 4.4 days earlier than non-preprinted manuscripts and time to publication is even faster, coming in 8 days earlier. So far in 2019, these timings have been even more pronounced, where time to publication for preprinted manuscripts was on average 19 days faster than non-preprinted research.</span></p>
<p>We’ve been excited to see the data so far and see so many satisfied authors trying preprints for the first time. As we learn more from this program, we’ll share what we find!</p>

<p>A central theme of the computational neuroscience research in the Biocomputation Research Group is synaptic plasticity, the activity-dependent strengthening and weakening of connections between neurons in the brain. In this talk, I will describe a number of previous PhD projects in the group that have studied computational functions, and the underlying mechanisms, of synaptic plasticity. I will focus on the functional roles and mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum, a brain structure that is important for the control of movements, motor learning and many higher cognitive functions. Our results suggest that different forms of synaptic plasticity at different  time scales can implement many diverse functions such as associative memory, noise resistance, multiplicative operations and the transformation  between different types of neural code. Moreover, I will discuss the relation between cerebellar synaptic plasticity and movement disorders that are based on cerebellar dysfunction, and I will describe the application of machine learning algorithms to analyse neuronal activity during epileptic seizures.</p>

No? Then what if I told you that unrelenting grief — and associated feelings of sheer panic, fear, terminal aloneness, and existential crisis — isn't “suffering”. It's actually rewarding!<br /><br />Well I'm here to tell you that it isn't.<br /><br />Looking back on a <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/02/is-mourning-rewarding.html">post from 2011</a>, you never realize it's going to be you.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M1eJqCdum7c/XZpSivrt7eI/AAAAAAAAM9o/q3051xLnW0gguxpABtuT2aJnZO_1zH3XQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/paragraph%2Bdivider.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="50" data-original-width="384" height="25" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M1eJqCdum7c/XZpSivrt7eI/AAAAAAAAM9o/q3051xLnW0gguxpABtuT2aJnZO_1zH3XQCLcBGAsYHQ/s200/paragraph%2Bdivider.png" width="200" /></a></div><br />The top figure shows that activity in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens" target="_blank">nucleus accumbens</a> was greater in response to grief-related words vs. neutral words in a group of 11 women with “Complicated” Grief (who lost a mother or sister to breast cancer in the last 5 years), compared to a group of 10 women with garden-variety Non-complicated Grief (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18559294">O'Connor et al., 2008</a>). Since the paper was published in 2008, and the standards for conducting fMRI studies have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28053326" target="_blank" title="Poldrack et al. (2017).

The death of a cherished loved one can create a situation  that seems totally intolerable. Almost everyone agrees that navigating  such loss doesn't rely on one acceptable road map. Yet here it is.  Normal people are supposed to move through a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374" target="_blank">one year mourning period</a>  of “sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these  feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward.” If  you don't, well then it's Complicated. This is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-That-Youre-Not-Understand/dp/1622039076" target="_blank" title="It's OK That You're Not OK">stigmatizing and limiting</a> view of what it means to grieve the loss of a loved one.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span><br /><br />But is there really such there a thing as Complicated Grief? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384440/" target="_blank">Simply put</a>,  it's “a chronic impairing form of grief brought about by interference  with the healing process.” There are “maladaptive thoughts and  dysfunctional behaviors” according to <a href="https://complicatedgrief.columbia.edu/professionals/complicated-grief-professionals/overview/" target="_blank">The Center for Complicated Grief</a>. However, it's not named as an actual disorder in either of the major psychiatric manuals. In <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/revision/en/" target="_blank" title="International Classification of Diseases">ICD-11</a>, preoccupation with and longing for the deceased, accompanied by significant emotional distress and functional impairment <span style="color: #990000;"><i><b>beyond six months</b></i></span>, is called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990943/" target="_blank">Prolonged Grief Disorder</a>. In DSM-5, Complicated Grief has morphed into Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, a <a href="https://complicatedgrief.columbia.edu/professionals/complicated-grief-professionals/diagnosis/" target="_blank">not-exactly-reified</a> condition subject to further study.<br /><br /><br /><b>Dopamine </b><b><span class="st">≠</span> Reward </b><br /><br />Dopamine and its putative reward circuitry are way more complex than a simple one-to-one mapping. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that the nucleus accumbens (NA) can code for negative states, as well as positive ones, as shown by the existence of “hedonic coldspots” that generate aversive reactions, in addition to the usual hotspots (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425246/" target="_blank">Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2015</a>). These studies involved microinjections of opioids into tiny regions of the NA.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yaGqTOsH3P4/XZpPYm-Vg1I/AAAAAAAAM9c/JgSNuvnape4kVvyuH_EvT44uTTEGxteQACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Hedonic%2BHotspots%2Band%2BColdspots.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="431" data-original-width="556" height="308" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yaGqTOsH3P4/XZpPYm-Vg1I/AAAAAAAAM9c/JgSNuvnape4kVvyuH_EvT44uTTEGxteQACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Hedonic%2BHotspots%2Band%2BColdspots.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />If a chronically anguished state is portrayed as rewarding, it's time to recalibrate these terms. As I said in 2011:<br /><br /><i>If tremendous psychological suffering and loss are associated with activity in  brain regions such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_tegmental_area">ventral tegmental area</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens">nucleus accumbens</a>, isn't it time to abandon the simplistic notion of dopamine as the <a href="http://www.adhd-becalmd.com/dopamine.html">feel-good neurotransmitter</a>? To quote the authors of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18614688">Mesolimbic Dopamine in Desire and Dread</a> (Faure et al., 2008):</i><br /><blockquote><i>It    is important to understand how mesocorticolimbic mechanisms generate    positive versus negative motivations. Dopamine (DA) in the nucleus    accumbens is well known as a mechanism of appetitive motivation for    reward. However,<span style="color: #990000;"><b> aversive motivations such as pain, stress, and fear    also may involve dopamine in nucleus accumbens</b></span> (at least tonic dopamine    signals).</i> </blockquote><br /><b>Grief-Related Words Are Rewarding </b><br /><br />So what happens when you take a disputed diagnostic label and combine it with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16406760" target="_blank">reverse inference</a> in a neuroimaging study? (when you operate under the assumption that activity in a particular brain region must mean that a specific cognitive process or psychological state was present).<br /><br />The NA activity was observed while the participants viewed grief words vs. neutral  words that were superimposed over a photograph: a photo of the participant's deceased mother or a photo of someone else's mother. And it didn't matter whose mother was pictured, the difference was due to the <i><b>words</b></i>, not the images.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>3</sup> </b></span><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmoveH2QtwA/TWlvb4mgqaI/AAAAAAAAEug/eXkNVJF3rrs/s1600/face%2Bemotion%2Bword%2Bstroop%2Beffect.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5578112138316130722" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rmoveH2QtwA/TWlvb4mgqaI/AAAAAAAAEug/eXkNVJF3rrs/s200/face%2Bemotion%2Bword%2Bstroop%2Beffect.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 200px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 174px;" /></a><br /><span>Sample stimulus provides an <span style="font-size: 85%;">[unintentional?] </span>example of the <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Human_Neuroscience/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00234/abstract" title="conflict between the emotion depicted in the image vs. the word">emotional Stroop effect</a>.</span><br /><br /><br />That's pretty hard to explain by saying that “the pangs of grief would continue to occur with NA activity, with reward activity in response to the cues motivating reunion with the deceased” if the effect is not specific to an image of the deceased.<br /><br /><br /><b>Yearning and the Subgenual Cingulate</b><br /><br />Why beat a dead horse, you ask? Because a recent study (<a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(18)30899-5" target="_blank">McConnell et al., 2018</a>) did not heed the advice above (sample size should be increased, beware reverse inference). The participants were 9 women with Complicated Grief (CG), 7 women with Non-complicated Grief (NG), and 9 Non-Bereaved (NB). The NA finding did not replicate, nor were there any differences between CG and NG and NB (over the entire brain). A post-hoc analysis then extracted a single question from a 19-item inventory and found that yearning for the dead spouse in all 16 Bereaved participants was correlated with activity in the subgenual cingulate (“<a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.156.5.675" target="_blank">depression-land</a>” or perhaps “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21098808" target="_blank">rumination-land</a>”), for the comparison of an anticipation period vs. presentation of spouse photo. There were 5 spouse photos and 5 photos of strangers (note that it was not possible to predict which would be presented). The authors recognized the limitations of the study, yet pathologized yearning in Complicated and Non-complicated Grief alike.<br /><br />I realize that the general motivation behind these experiments might be admirable, but you really can't come to any conclusions about how grief — a highly complex emotional response unique to each individual — might be represented in the brain.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span>See <b><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2018/10/there-is-giant-hole-where-my-heart-used.html">There Is a Giant Hole Where My Heart Used To Be</a></b> from October 2, 2018.<br /><br />The posts on illness and death that I never wrote:<br /><ul><li>Update on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic" target="_blank" title="drugs to prevent, or alleviate, nausea and vomiting">Antiemetics</a></li>  <li>The Neurology of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/96/9/623/1522594/" target="_blank">Liver Failure</a></li></ul>(yes, I was really serious about these)<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span>I was skeptical when someone sent me this book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-That-Youre-Not-Understand/dp/1622039076" target="_blank"><i>It's OK That You're Not OK: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn't Understand</i></a> (by Megan Devine).

<p>Mental Illness Awareness Week occurs in the first full week of October. This year, we’re focusing on the breaking down the barriers that prevent people with mental health issues from receiving adequate treatment. One in three people worldwide <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00505-2/fulltext?code=lancet-site">will experience disruptions in their mental health</a> over the course of their lives. Yet most people in need of psychological services do not receive professional help.</p><p>We’ve put together a reading list of articles which expose a number of barriers to treatment of mental illness – including stigma, financial constraints, and global inequalities – and explore potential strategies to overcome these obstacles.</p><p><strong>Treatment gap: barriers to providing and receiving services</strong></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190463281.001.0001/med-9780190463281-chapter-3">This article</a> exposes the gap between mental health services that are needed and those that are provided. It examines the key problems and impediments that currently exist, and which new models of treatment and delivery could help surmount current barriers.</p><p><strong>Barriers and facilitators to acceptance of mental illness</strong></p><p>In this <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780190204273.001.0001/med-9780190204273-chapter-4">piece</a>, the authors ask people with serious mental illness to talk about what has helped them feel acceptance, and what tends to stand in their way.</p><p><strong>Stigma</strong></p><p>The stigma attached to mental illness can prevent people from seeking treatment. Fear of disclosing one’s mental or substance use disorder is the most commonly reported reason for people, especially youth, not seeking help. <a name="p602"></a>This <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780199928163.001.0001/med-9780199928163-chapter-29">piece</a> summarizes research on stigma for the general population, and addresses specific issues facing young people.</p><p><strong>In my voice: speaking out about mental health and stigma </strong></p><p>In his stirring <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780195320268.001.0001/med-9780195320268-chapter-5">contribution</a>, psychologist Jeffrey Liew tackles the shame and stigma of admitting mental illness in Chinese-American culture.</p><p><strong>Overcoming stigma II: media and mental health professionals</strong></p><p>This <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780199730926.001.0001/med-9780199730926-chapter-10">piece</a> discusses strategies geared toward altering negative portrayals of mental illness in various forms of public media. Such strategies are important for those interested in stigma reduction. The article addresses the need for mental health professionals to confront their own views toward mental illness and promote change.</p><p><strong>Cultural competency in mental health services</strong></p><p>Disparities in access and quality in health and mental health services and treatment outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities have been well documented. This <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/socialwork/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.001.0001/acrefore-9780199975839-e-887">entry</a> chronicles the history of mental health services and the development of cultural competency in social work practice.

While no country has exemplary mental health care, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med:psych/9780195392494.001.0001/med-9780195392494-chapter-9">this article</a> reviews how various nations have worked to improve mental health for their citizens.</p><p><strong>Mental illness: worldwide </strong></p><p>Mental health issues are a major public health concern. The indirect costs to the global economy of mental illness—encompassing productivity and the spending on mental health services and other direct costs—amount to approximately $2.5 trillion a year. By 2030 it is expected that depression will be the leading cause of the global disease burden.  <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/socialwork/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.001.0001/acrefore-9780199975839-e-1154">This article</a> outlines the scope of the problem and possible interventions to help combat this health crisis.</p><p>These articles show the many barriers to mental health services. The magnitude of these barriers is particularly concerning given the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders">high prevalence</a> of depression and other mental disorders across the world. Many of these barriers are  ingrained deeply in the fabric of socio-economic life, and will take considerable efforts to overcome. With some of the solutions here, we can began to address these issues.</p><p>Featured image: “Silhouette” by Gift Habeshaw.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/iStock-1152828165-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The low appeal of General Practice (GP) and primary care as a career option is a recurrent difficulty for healthcare systems throughout Europe. The European Commission projects that the shortage of health workers across the European Union will increase to more than 2 million by the year 2020 if nothing is done to improve measures for recruitment and retention of the workforce. Without this, 13.5% of Europe’s health needs will fail to be met. This shortage is particularly high in rural areas of European countries, most notably in France. Moreover, in several countries, 50% of  all general practitioners are over 50 years of age.</p>
<p>Research into retention and recruitment of General Practitioners has so far mainly focused on negative factors without any improvement in the size of the workforce. An innovative path was to look at the positive elements that encourage young people to choose general practice and which support GPs already in practice in a bid to increase motivation to continue their clinical work.</p>
<p>Consequently, <a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0985-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this study</a> recently published in <em><a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BMC Family Practice</a></em> and supported by the European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN), explored job satisfaction among GPs in seven European countries, and in Israel, by asking the following question: What contributes to job satisfaction for the GP workforce?</p>
<p><strong>Six main themes were found during the analysis.</strong></p>
<p><em>The GP as a person<br />
</em>A GP is a person with intrinsic characteristics. these include an interest in people’s lives and a strong ability to cope with a variety of situations and a variety of patients. GPs love their work and their patients.</p>
<p><em>GP skills and competences needed in practice<br />
</em>All GPs told us about the need for specific skills for diagnostic reasoning and for coping with uncertainty, for communication and for achieving a correct diagnosis with low technical support. The profession is challenging and offers a broad spectrum of experiences. Together with long-lasting doctor-patient relationships, this was listed as one reason to make general practice attractive. One GP said: <em>“This is intellectually extremely stimulating and challenging work”.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>With a good GP, patients expect respect and mutual trust. To be a GP you need a lot of love.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Doctor-patient relationships<br />
</em>Recently, an older French GP said in the media: “<em>with a good GP, patients expect respect and mutual trust.To be a GP you need a lot of love”</em>. This is exactly what was found in the study.  Rewarding interpersonal relationships, with mutual trust and respect, contributed positively to GP self esteem.</p>
<p><em>Supportive factors for work-life balance<br />
</em>Satisfied GPs need a good family life not restricted to a healthy work-life balance. The living environment is as important, with sufficient facilities for leisure pursuits and schools for the children. An efficient doctor is self-sufficient but does need other people’s perspectives and opportunities for discussion with colleagues.</p>
<p><em>Teaching in general practice<br />
</em>Teaching students and young colleagues is a positive challenge for GPs and they feel gratified when universities recognize the value of their discipline.</p>
<p><em>Autonomy in the workplace<br />
</em>The freedom to choose their practice location is an issue of major importance and conflicts with the need for GPs in rural areas. GPs also needed well-functioning, inter-professional networks. This was illustrated by a Bulgarian GP: <em>“This is the most important issue in our practice: that I decide when and how to work”. </em>This may well be part of the problem why rural regions are not attractive to young GPs.</p>
<p><strong>How can we use these results to attract and retain GPs?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This article is a wake-up call for everybody who loves general practice.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article is a wake-up call for everybody who loves general practice. Starting with the selection of young people who have a strong intrinsic motivation. Universities should stress the scientific dimension and the added value of general practice, instead of cultivating a negative perception. Additionally, policymakers should respect GPs in the same way. It is time that Europe took responsibility for promoting the recognition general practice deserves as a difficult and invaluable specialty in every country. This would then motivate universities to have a specific faculty of General Practice led by full professors of General Practice. This is the only way to train students in specific <em>GP skills and competences </em>and to organize traineeships in primary care practices and not in hospitals.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11203" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11203" height="220" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/Fotolia_57897273_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-1-300x220.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© apops / Fotolia</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The intrinsic motivation factor, within the ‘<em>GP as a person’ theme,</em> is one key to achieving satisfaction in this profession.<br />
There is a need to think about how these characteristics can be taken into account in the medical students selection process.<br />
The<em> Supportive factors for work-life balance </em>should be taken into account by all stakeholders to attract GPs to the  workforce, including providing well-organized out-of-hours services.</p>
<p><em>Autonomy in the workplace </em>should not be forgotten and is a highly significant requirement in the drive to retain and to attract a strong GP workforce. Until now, most policymakers have tried to stimulate young GPs to start a practice in a rural environment by offering financial incentives. However, money will not solve this problem and more creative solutions are necessary. One possibility is to rethink new practice formats: larger practices with facilities in main centers of habitation within rural areas. Local governments can support young GPs in their search for appropriate practice locations.</p>
<p>General practice is challenging and extremely intellectual and needs the best students to handle global care.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/HPepyenyLOo/">Crushing bites, crushing politics, and the other “Twitter”</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/10/kangaroo-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extinct giant short-faced kangaroos had massive jaws and cheekbones, enabling a powerful bite that could have crushed tree branches, describes a new PLOS ONE </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221287"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t let this scare you–the study authors compare this massive beast’s eating habits to that of our own modern giant panda, gentle giants who only crush bamboo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead author Mitchell says: “The skull of the extinct kangaroo studied here differs from those of today’s kangaroos in many of the ways a giant panda’s skull differs from other bears. So, it seems that the strange skull of this kangaroo was, in a functional sense, less like a modern-day kangaroo’s and more like a giant panda’s.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(And if that doesn’t soothe you, hopefully the friendly little grin on this reconstruction image will!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recent PLOS ONE </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222062"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Stylistic variation on the Donald Trump Twitter account: A linguistic analysis of tweets posted between 2009 and 2018,” takes a look at how Trump’s rhetoric has changed over time, with special focus on how his presidential campaign used Twitter to propel him to the White House. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors Clarke and Grieve add: “Regardless of one’s political persuasion or one’s opinion of Donald Trump, we believe it is of critical importance to understand the unique and ultimately effective communication strategy Trump and his team implemented on social media during the 2016 campaign”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in much cuter news, it turns out  grey squirrels use their own version of “Twitter” by eavesdropping on birds to make sure their surroundings are safe, as described in new PLOS ONE </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221279"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eavesdropping grey squirrels infer safety from bird chatter”. Apparently, hearing birds return to casual chatter after a predator’s call helps these squirrels relax post-threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors add: “We knew that squirrels eavesdropped on the alarm calls of some bird species, but we were excited to find that they also eavesdrop on non-alarm sounds that indicate the birds feel relatively safe. Perhaps in some circumstances, cues of safety could be as important as cues of danger.”</span></p>

<p>While scientific work and output was traditionally limited to relatively small
expert communities, the landscape is rapidly changing. Modern Science is far
too complex to be carried out in isolation, and the need to increase the uptake
of scientific output in society now seems far more pressing. As a result,
scientific communities are pushing to make Science more <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open</a>.</p>
<p>The Neuroscience research community has also made this commitment. The
philosophy of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/">Free/Open</a>
Science, however, must be backed by <a class="reference external" href="http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/">Free/Open standards and tools</a>.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensourcebrain.org/">Open Source Brain</a> project
is one of many initiatives that focus on developing Free/Open tools and
standards for Neuroscience. A recent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30444-1">publication</a> summarises
their work.</p>
<p>While initially targeting computational Neuroscience, following the renewal of
their funding from the Wellcome Trust, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensourcebrain.org/">Open Source Brain</a> project are
expanding their deliverables to support experimental data as well.
With this in mind, they organised a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video/">workshop</a>
in September to discuss two key themes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accessible sharing of cellular Neuroscience data: by supporting the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.nwb.org/">Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)</a> format.</li>
<li>Modelling the cortex across scales: by further expanding the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuroml.org/">NeuroML</a> model description language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I was fortunate enough to attend this workshop, in this talk, I will
summarise the main points that were discussed here. Time permitting, I will
hope to begin a discussion in our group on how we can ensure that we follow and
contribute to these standards and tools to make our research work and
its outputs "default to Free/Open".</p>
<p>I will conclude with a (another?) short marketing pitch for our <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> project which shares these goals.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m happy to announce PLOS’ participation in a new service, Review Commons, that will provide a platform for rapid, objective, journal-independent peer reviews for manuscripts and preprints. We are excited to be part of this initiative and to learn from our community’s response how we can rethink peer review to save authors’, reviewers’, and editors’ time and enhance transparency and objectiveness. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What it is</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by ASAPbio and EMBO Press, </span><a href="https://www.embo.org/news/press-releases/2019/embo-and-asapbio-to-launch-a-pre-journal-portable-review-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will organize a single round of journal-agnostic review for manuscripts in the life sciences submitted to the service. Upon receiving the reviews, the authors can decide to simply post them alongside their preprint on bioRxiv and/or to submit their manuscript — including reviews–to one of the 17 journals affiliated with Review Commons. If the chosen journal decides to proceed with the submission, it commits to not involve new reviewers unless a specific aspect of the article needs to be further evaluated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the PLOS journals within scope — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Computational Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Genetics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Pathogens</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — will welcome submissions reviewed at Review Commons. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Saving researchers’ time and increasing transparency</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal-independent portable review has the potential to accelerate and streamline the process of publishing. Authors can use their peer reviews to inform their journal selection and find the best fit for their work from the start. Because the reviews carry over to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affiliate journal, it will also reduce re-reviewing at multiple journals that currently imposes a large burden of duplicated activities across the scientific community (estimated at </span><a href="https://www.aje.com/arc/peer-review-process-15-million-hours-lost-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of hours of reviewer time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we also hope to learn about how authors, reviewers and editors approach peer review conducted outside of a specific journal context. It is not the first time that journal-agnostic peer review has been tried, but in this case the association with preprints provides a much better opportunity for transparency of the entire peer review process, and gives authors more control over how they share and contextualize their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peer reviews provided by Review Commons can be posted on bioRxiv using the new functionality that the preprint server is unveiling today — TRiP (Transparent Review in Preprints) an annotation layer powered by </span><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hypothes.is</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to post reviews by a journal or peer-review service. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Your feedback is key</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are really eager to learn how journal-independent portable peer review changes the submission experience, and how peer reviews posted in real-time can enrich the preprints on bioRxiv and help authors refine their work. We’ll be monitoring</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the efficacy of the service so that we can share back the results and inform broader improvements to peer review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage you to explore the TRiP functionality on bioRxiv and to stay tuned for the opening of Review Commons in December!</span></p>

St Carlos of Oviedo almost was canonised as Spain's first living martyr, but now Nature revoked his mentoring award. Spanish media and science elites are desperate, even the Queen is not amused.

And in fact, publishers had begun to take advantage of the new digital network a decade before open access became a thing. Elsevier, for instance, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://richardpoynder.co.uk/sciencedirect.htm">launched</a></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;"> its online database of electronic journals ScienceDirect</span></span> eight years prior to BOAI. But publishers had assumed they would simply port the traditional subscription model to the online environment and carry on much as before, all be it a subscription model re-imagined as the now infamous <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.infotoday.com/it/sep11/The-Big-Deal-Not-Price-But-Cost.shtml">Big Deal</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In other words, as the name suggests, what was radical about the BOAI was not its recognition that journals could now be put online, but the assumption that this could be done without the imposition of paywalls. In retrospect, we can see that this simple idea has ended up calling into question practically every aspect of traditional scholarly publishing, not excluding traditional peer review and the need for legacy publishers. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Yet …</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Yet for all its revolutionary potential, and the significant mindshare that open access has acquired over the past 16 years, some of the key <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">aspirations articulated</a></span> by BOAI have yet to be realised. And they may never be. Yes, today more research is freely accessible. But leaving aside the fact that the openness of that content <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osf.io/uaw27/">is fragile</a></span><a name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[1]</span></span></span></a>, the truly revolutionary potential of making it open has not yet been exploited. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So, for instance, OA has yet to solve <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144706/">the affordability problem</a></span> that BOAI promised it would, and in pursuit of which goal most librarians joined the OA movement in the first place.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More importantly, OA has failed to create the more equitable knowledge infrastructure envisaged by BOAI. Let’s recall: the promise was that removing access barriers would allow the world to “accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich … and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The reality today, however, is that paywalls are simply being replaced by publication walls, a development that threatens to disenfranchise those in the global South even more thoroughly than paywalls. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>These failings are a product of the fact that the strategies adopted and promoted by OA advocates have too often had unintended consequences. Above all, they advocated for the use of pay-to-publish gold OA. In doing so they enabled legacy publishers to co-opt open access, and so lock themselves and their high profits into the new environment, not least by introducing overpriced <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal">hybrid OA</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The pay-to-publish model also gave rise to a plague of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open-access_publishing">predatory publishers</a></span>, and the accompanying tide of fake science now threatens to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/07/new-international-investigation-tackles-fake-science-and-its-poisonous-effects/">corrupt the scientific record</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The nub of the problem is that OA advocates too often fail to think through their ideas and strategies, with the result that their interventions often worsen rather than improve the situation. It does not help that they are susceptible to groupthink and tend to flock around any idea that has superficial appeal. The way that dissident voices are challenged and policed on Twitter is indicative of this tendency. Moreover, OA advocates will often cling to a faulty idea long after it has become clear that it is flawed. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And while there were plenty of warnings about likely unintended consequences, these were ignored or poo-pooed. In 2004, for instance, the world’s largest and most experienced publisher Elsevier <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-submits-evidence-on-scientific-publishing-to-committee-of-uk-mps">cautioned</a></span>: “By introducing an author-pays model, Open Access risks undermining public trust in the integrity and quality of scientific publications that has been established over hundreds of years.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Elsevier added, “Because the number of articles published will drive revenues, Open Access publishers will continually be under pressure to increase output, potentially at the expense of quality.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Elsevier is of course not a disinterested party. Nevertheless, its point was a valid one and should have been listened to since it is also an obvious one. (Ironically, as soon as it realised that gold OA would allow it to increase its profits Elsevier quickly distanced itself from its warnings, thus proving the point it had made!).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But the most knowledgeable and far-sighted commentator has been publishing consultant <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/author/jesposito/">Joseph Esposito</a></span>. True, Esposito is not a disinterested party either, and he has a habit whenever a change to the <i>status quo</i> is mooted of muttering darkly “be careful what you wish for” (e.g. <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/ListArchives/0610/msg00029.html">here</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://twitter.com/JosephJEsposito/status/1020025202607120384?s=19">here</a></span> and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/02/24/inadvertent-innovation">here</a></span>). Nevertheless, his warnings have generally been on the money. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In 2004, for instance, Esposito <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1163/1083">predicted</a></span> that in an OA environment, “the overall cost of research publications will rise, though the costs will be borne by different players, primarily authors and their proxies.” This has proved accurate.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In the same vein, in 2014 Esposito predicted that open access would be additive rather than substitutive, and so further increase the costs of scholarly communication. As he put it, “revenue from OA will be additive to the revenue from traditional journals.”  That is today’s reality.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And in 2105 Esposito <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/14/return-of-the-big-brands/">predicted</a></span> that open access would be co-opted by legacy publishers. Few would now deny that that too is today’s reality.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>For open access advocates, this is all hugely frustrating and the cause of a lot of hand-wringing. The uncomfortable truth is that almost every initiative, idea or proposal introduced by the OA movement is rapidly derailed, subverted, or co-opted by publishers for their own benefit, or leads to undesirable developments like predatory publishing.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Too gloomy a view?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But is this to take too gloomy a view? While many of Esposito’s predictions may be today’s reality, it does not mean that they will be tomorrow’s. After all, we are in the middle of a revolution, and perforce seeing through a glass darkly. We may simply be witnessing the inevitable teething problems that any largescale social change can expect to experience. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To put my cards on the table: I am a sceptic by nature and so Esposito’s views resonate more with me than the perpetual Pollyannaism of many OA advocates. Nevertheless, I can see that it may just be that the research community is going to have to wade through a lot more mud before it reaches the promised land. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>I assume, however, that whether the vision of BOAI is ever fully realised will to a great extent depend on whether those who support, promote and implement open access learn from experience and adapt and change their strategies as a result. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Here there are encouraging signs. Conscious that the institutional repository movement <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/09/q-with-cnis-clifford-lynch-time-to-re_22.html">has failed</a></span>, for instance, the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coar-repositories.org/">Confederation of Open Access Repositories</a></span> has developed a new strategy focused on creating what it calls a “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/advocacy-leadership/open-science-and-sustainable-development/">Sustainable Knowledge Commons</a></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;">”. </span></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name="more"></a></div><h3><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">New determination</span></span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>More interestingly, in Europe we are seeing a new determination to insist that publishers start offering big deals that include a clear transition path to an all-OA environment. These deals, those pushing for them assert, must be fairly priced and they must consist of a package that includes both access to existing paywalled content <i>plus</i> the ability for researchers to publish papers OA on a constantly increasing basis. The Association of Universities in the Netherlands (</span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB">VSNU</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>), for instance, has been flexing its consortial muscle to that end and </span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/news/!/2018/3/79107/no-new-agreement-with-royal-society-of-chemistry-and-a-new-agreement-with-springer">turning down deals</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span> it does not feel meet its requirements.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>Meanwhile in Germany, </span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="https://www.projekt-deal.de/about-deal/">Project Deal</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span> is insisting on what it calls “</span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/bold-open-access-push-germany-could-change-future-academic-publishing">Publish and Read</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>” contracts that make even greater demands of publishers. This has led to a long-standing faceoff between Elsevier and the German research community. And after Sweden followed Germany’s lead</span></span><span> earlier this year Elsevier <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05754-1">cut off access</a></span> to its electronic journals in both countries.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What has focused European minds is a fast-approaching deadline. In 2016, the EC made <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/28/eu-ministers-2020-target-free-access-scientific-papers">a rash promise</a></span> that by 2020 all European publicly-funded research would be freely available. Two years out, it has become apparent that Europe will need to take dramatic action if it wants to fulfil its promise – or pay legacy publishers ever larger wads of public money in order to do so. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>One response has been the EC’s announcement that it plans to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=3418">build its own publishing platform</a></span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More significantly, hard hitter <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/team/robert-jan-smits_e">Robert-Jan Smits</a></span> (“<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://sciencebusiness.net/framework-programmes/news/eu-research-chiefs-next-act-changing-future-academic-publishing">one of Europe’s most powerful figures in research</a></span>”) has been appointed Senior Advisor on Open Access within the European Political Strategy Centre at the European Commission. His task is to ensure that the 2020 goal is met.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To that end, Smits is currently working on what has been dubbed <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceeurope.org/making-open-access-a-reality-by-2020">Plan S</a></span>. Strikingly, the signals are that Plan S could see legacy publishers excluded from the solution proposed, or assigned a significantly curtailed role. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>A similar message is coming from Project Deal. In May, for instance, Gerard Meijer, director of the German Fritz-Haber Institute and member of Project Deal <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceguide.nl/2018/05/open-access-negotiators-prepare-for-a-future-without-publishers/">indicated</a></span> that academic publishers may not be included in its future plans. This may be necessary, he said, because “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;">If we keep moving at this pace, we’ll never reach our goals</span></span>.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Much of this may be little more than sabre rattling (we don’t know), but we can surely expect it to focus minds.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span>One problem with Europe’s more aggressive stance is that it is seeing it double down on an anti-democratic and authoritarian trend already evident in its push for OA. We have seen, for instance, ever more demanding and oppressive OA mandates imposed on European researchers – a development at its most extreme in the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/02/open-access-and-research-excellence.html">OA policy</a></span> announced in 2014 by the (former) Higher Education Funding Council for England (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/">HEFCE</a></span>). </span></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>There are now also noises being made to the effect that European researchers may have to give up publishing with legacy publishers and begin using “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05191-0">alternative platforms</a></span>” (presumably platforms like the one planned by the EC). And it has been suggested that researchers who do not make their work OA could be <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://sciencebusiness.net/framework-programmes/news/eu-research-chiefs-next-act-changing-future-academic-publishing">fined</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>As such, Plan S could end up alienating not just publishers, but the people who actually produce the research in question, even as they are told that they will be the main beneficiaries of open access. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Librarians could also find themselves being sidelined. Smits </span><span lang="EN-US">has </span><span>suggested, for instance, that librarians are acting as a brake on progress. As he <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/open-access-scientific-publications-must-become-reality-2020-robert-jan-smits_en.html">put it</a></span>, “They want to preserve the money and power they have to finance the subscriptions to the prestigious journals. They fear that if they don’t have this money anymore, their role will be less important.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Since they pride themselves on being the premier OA advocates and leaders of the movement this will feel like a punch in the face for librarians. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>True, the increasingly robust stance Europe is taking in its war with publishers <i>could</i> speed up the transition to OA. But there must be concern that it will cause collateral damage, with researchers and librarians the most likely potential victims.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Back in the USA</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What we learn from this is that the most high-profile OA activity today is taking place in Europe. But what about the country that gave us the ground-breaking 2004 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">NIH Public Access Policy</a></span>, and the 2008 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/">Harvard OA policy</a></span>? What is the state of play in the US today?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Certainly, we can see new OA policies regularly rolled out, and these are invariably Harvard-style policies.<a name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[2]</span></span></span></a> (The Harvard policy model, we could note, is unlike the top-down compulsory ones being imposed on researchers in Europe. Rather, it involves faculty voluntarily agreeing to adopt policies that invariably include a no-questions-asked waiver element).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>We can also see a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/preprints-growth-rate-ten-times-higher-than-journal-articles/">re-invigorated preprint movement</a></span> gathering pace in the US, in part as a result of the advocacy and technology of the Virginia-based <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science">Center for Open Science</a>, but also, of course, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>, <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/">PeerJ Preprints</a> etc.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition, the long-standing attempts to have OA legislation like <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Access_to_Science_and_Technology_Research_Act">FASTR</a></span> and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act">FRPAA</a></span> enacted continue. (With little success to date). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What we are not seeing in the US, however, is the same determination to take on publishers. This is doubtless in part because academic culture is different in the US, but also because it would be difficult to organise. As Roger Schonfeld has <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/06/18/will-european-contagion-spread">pointed out</a></span>, the US university system is not centralised in the way it tends to be in Europe. As such, he says, there is “no national-level common negotiating posture” for dealing with publishers. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, there is clearly the same desire to move forward with open access, if by different means. And it would seem that the University of California (UC) is keen to take <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2018/06/championing-change-in-journal-negotiations/">a leadership role</a></span> in this, judging at least by the range of OA activities and initiatives it is involved in. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>For instance, UC Libraries have been taking part in <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2009/01/22/uc-libraries-and-springer-sign-pilot-agreement-for-open-access-journal-publishing/">OA pilots</a></span> since at least 2009, and since <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/open-access/policy/">2012</a></span> the University has introduced a series of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/">open access policies</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Then in 2015 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/">UC Press</a></span> launched the OA journal <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.collabra.org/">Collabra</a></span> (Now <i>Collabra: Psychology</i>) and an open access monograph publisher called <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.luminosoa.org/">Luminos</a></span> (some background <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-oa-interviews-alison-mudditt.html?m=0">here</a></span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>A year later (2016), the California Digital Library (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.cdlib.org/">CDL</a></span>) took part in <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/icis/uc-pay-it-forward-project/">a joint study</a></span> designed to estimate what the institutional costs would be if subscription journals were converted<i> en masse</i> to an entirely APC business model. This was preparatory to proposing a “global flip” strategy in which a largescale conversion of subscription journals to pay-to-publish would be engineered. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The US study came in the wake of a similar exercise undertaken by the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Digital Library</a></span>. Max Planck concluded that there is already enough money in the system to pay for a large-scale transformation to OA and published its findings in a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2148961:7/component/escidoc:2149096/MPDL_OA-Transition_White_Paper.pdf">white paper</a></span> in April 2015. This became the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://oa2020.org/learn_more/">foundational document</a></span> for the 2016 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://oa2020.org/">OA2020 Initiative</a></span>.

In February it published <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/groups/files/about/docs/UC-Libraries-Pathways%20to%20OA-Report.pdf">Pathways to Open Access</a></span> (some context on this <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2018/07/27/pathways-to-open-access-choices-and-opportunities/">here</a></span>), followed in April by a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/ucolasc/scholcommprinciples-20180425.pdf">Declaration of Rights and Principles to Transform Scholarly Communication</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And in June the University published a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2018/06/championing-change-in-journal-negotiations/">Call to Action</a></span> with the stated aim of addressing the “twin challenges of journal affordability and the moral imperative of achieving a truly open scholarly communication system”. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What does this vision mean in practice, and how will it be achieved? What is the endpoint being worked towards? What, in short, is the University’s current thinking on open access? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Who better to put these questions to than <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/content/virginia-steel">Virginia Steel</a></span>, the Norman and Armena Powell University Librarian at UCLA, and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://sparcopen.org/people/virginia-steel/">Chair of the SPARC Steering Committee</a></span>?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Nuanced and undogmatic</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In contrast to many OA advocates in Europe, Steel’s views on open access are nuanced and undogmatic. For this reason, perhaps, she seems to be wary of “big idea” solutions like the global flip. As she puts it, “Succeeding with OA will require multiple models that will vary depending on disciplinary needs and the cultures and scholarly communications models of those disciplines.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>She also appears to be more independently minded than many OA advocates, and not shy to challenge and question proposals she has doubts about – as evidenced by her decision in 2016 to write <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.library.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/Ginny-Steel_open-letter_OA2020-PIF_October-2016_0.pdf">an open letter to the academic community</a></span> setting out her concerns about the OA2020 Initiative and the notion of a “global flip”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Steel’s approach is doubtless partly a product of the more democratic academic culture evident in the US. As a result, discussions about OA tend to major on voluntarism, persuasion and academic freedom, not compulsion, confrontation and punishment, as we see in Europe today.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Explaining the reasoning behind her more consensual approach Steel says, “Incentivising adherence to OA is better than compelling faculty to comply – the carrot will be better received than the stick – and it’s likely that more faculty will adopt OA practices sooner rather than later if they have a positive reason to do this.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nor does Steel believe we can rush the transition to OA. “[T]urning the scholarly publication system upside down will probably take several decades,” she says, adding that convincing researchers to get on board “requires continued effort to explain, cajole, and convince”. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The process cannot be hurried, she suggests, not just because it will require a lot of persuasion, but because there is still no consensus on many aspects of open access. As she puts it, “Making content openly available … will take time and discussion since there isn’t consensus on, say, whether or not content should be available for reuse by commercial publishers.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span><span style="font-size: large;">Risks</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>This last point is an important one. It reminds us that there has never been consensus within the OA movement. It is for this reason that funders, universities and governments in Europe have adopted a top-down compulsory approach. The danger of this approach, however, is that it will diminish and erode important academic values, alienate key stakeholders, and maybe even prove counterproductive.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On the other hand, the more <i>laissez-faire</i> approach we see in the US might mean that by the time a consensus is reached, and by the time researchers have been persuaded in sufficient numbers of the merits of embracing OA, legacy publishers will have so fully embedded themselves into the OA environment, and indeed across the entire research workflow, that it will prove impossible to stand up to them, or even to contemplate doing without their services, whatever they might charge for those services. Such an outcome would mean that any hope of resolving the affordability problem would have to be abandoned, as would any hope of creating the more equitable knowledge infrastructure envisage by BOAI.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In conclusion, the vision articulated at BOAI in 2002 has yet to be realised, and there must be doubts that it will be. For sure, we are seeing more research made open access, but it is often <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osf.io/uaw27/">a fragile openness</a></span>, and the problem of affordability remains. Most disappointingly, the possibility of COAR’s “sustainable knowledge commons” ever becoming reality looks increasingly unlikely. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It may be that I take too sceptical a view. but whatever happens, it is unclear to me that the European approach of confrontation and compulsion will prove any more successful than the US emphasis on persuasion and consensus building. And both approaches would seem to come with risks. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In short, the future is uncertain. In fact, sitting in the middle of the OA revolution as we are, we might even be tempted to think that the outcome will depend as much on luck as on schemes, strategies and plans. Like Pierre Bezukhov wandering around the chaos of the Battle of Borodino in <i>War and Peace</i>, we might have to conclude that the actions of leaders, and of plans and policies, are far less effective than we like to think! </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US"><b>The interview with Virginia Steel is available in a pdf file <a href="http://www.richardpoynder.co.uk/Interview_ginny_steel.pdf">here</a>. </b></span></div><br /><div><br clear="all" /><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /> <br /><div id="ftn1"><div class="MsoFootnoteText"><a name="_ftn1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"> “[M]ore documents are freely available in unsustainable sources and/or in violation of their copyright, than through sustainable and legal ways.” <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osf.io/uaw27/">https://osf.io/uaw27/</a></span> </span></div></div><div id="ftn2"><div class="MsoFootnoteText"><a name="_ftn2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US">[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Additional_resources">73 universities</a></span> have introduced a Harvard-style OA policy to date, mostly institutions in the US. </div></div></div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/607102346/0/oupblogpsychology/">Music and spirituality at the end of life</a></h4>

<p>Music and spirituality are two mediums frequently – almost ubiquitously – partnered in cultures around the world with the intention of enhancing engagement with the divine. Spiritual practices are infused with music to intensify the transpersonal components of worship, meditation, and ritual. Correspondingly, musical encounters are infused with spiritually-based beliefs and practices to provide individuals connections with themselves and others in uniquely powerful ways.</p><p>For many, this easy, reciprocal flow from music to spirituality may come as no surprise: both are malleable mediums responsive to the people engaging with them and the settings in which they are engaged. For instance, <em>Amazing Grace </em>performed at a funeral in a church with a large congregation might be led with a louder volume, increased pressure, and heightened resonance to match the congregation’s energy as they worship through song. In contrast,<em> Amazing Grace </em>performed bedside in a hospital room with a patient and caregivers might embody quieter, more prayerful qualities intending to comfortingly hold the patient in their depleted physical state and engender intimate musical sharing.</p><p>As music and spirituality intertwine, their boundaries become increasingly fluid to the point that distinguishing between one and the other becomes trivial. To be spiritual is to be musical, and to be musical is to be spiritual.</p><p>A similar malleability is also present in individuals’ health journeys. Objective characteristics of health – such as symptom acuity/chronicity; treatment dosage and frequency; and curative versus palliative outcomes – are subjectively experienced in response to the individual’s values, morals, and disease trajectory. For instance, one person’s 6 out of 10 pain is their daily baseline and thus easily managed, while another’s 6 out of 10 pain is breakthrough and requires treatment. Similarly, one person may prioritize the improved quality of life offered by palliative care while another may prioritize the potential increased longevity offered by curative treatments.</p><p>These dynamic, emergent qualities of music, spirituality, and health are a result of each being culturally situated phenomena. That is, the manner in which music, spirituality, and health are conceptualized and engaged with is directly informed by the distinct cultures in which they manifest. This leads to a fraught but important question: If music, spirituality, and health are each unto themselves complex phenomena derived from cultural factors, how do all three interact when they intersect in a singular encounter?</p><p>Board-certified music therapists frequently navigate this encounter in hospice. Hospice is a philosophy of care that prioritizes quality of life with six months or less to live, putting critical health issues at the forefront with limited time to facilitate resolution and closure. At such a juncture, spirituality can be a critical resource for patients and families who are simultaneously managing in the moment and preparing for the future. The type of resource spirituality can become (e.g., comfort in ritual, strength from scripture or peace through prayer/meditation/worship) is determined by the specific faith traditions of the patient – not just an identified denomination but the explicit experiences patients engaged in as part of their spiritual practice.</p><p>Music therapists assess those faith traditions for each patient and, coupled with a similar assessment of patients’ music traditions, craft music experiences that help patients become aware of and engage with their spiritually-based resources. These culturally informed clinical music processes interweave music, spirituality, and health in a way that affords patients agency in dictating the circumstances of their death. Yet, contemporary discussions in the music therapy literature have tended to frame spirituality from such a broad and generic stance that it becomes difficult for music therapists to locate spiritually-based resources in patients.</p><p>To address this limitation, my co-author (Cathleen Flynn) and I recently authored a paper that explored a specific culturally informed music, spiritual, and health intersection: music therapy for Christian patients and caregivers during imminent death. Using this intersection as a foundation, we developed a theoretical model positioning music therapy as a psychospiritual ministry providing patients and caregivers access to a faith-based resource – the Holy Spirit – that assists with transcendence as end-of-life transitions neared.</p><p>Transcendence, a difficult concept to lock down, is a movement beyond the typical, readily accessible experiences that define our day-to-day to experience the self and other in new ways that push beyond our known thresholds. For Christian patients who are imminently dying, that transcendence is vertical, an upward trajectory that moves them closer to an integration with the divine as they move beyond the corporeal. For Christian caregivers, that transcendence is horizontal, an outward trajectory that moves them closer to mortal support structures that assist in their transition to bereavement. The Holy Spirit, an intermediary between the mortal and divine, is the faith-based avenue through which these different but concomitant transcendences occur. From this vantage point, the music therapist assumes a ministerial role, constructing dynamic music experiences that facilitate interactions with the Holy Spirit promoting patient and caregiver transcendence.</p><p>Such explicit framing is ethically fraught. First, we do not argue that adopting a Christian lens is the “only” way or the “correct” way for music therapy to be practiced in hospice; rather, we introduce this theoretical model as a broad template for conducting spiritual assessments of patients from diverse traditions and beliefs. Second, this is a person-centered model wherein any implementation of Christian theology into music therapy processes is cued by the patient rather than introduced by the music therapist; this is an essential aspect as it avoids the perception that music therapists might leverage privilege to proselytize to patients. Third, there are numerous avenues for ethical and effective clinical support of Christian patients and families at the end of life, and this model is not meant to be a linear prescription; rather, it is an exploratory avenue that opens a multitude of additional doorways for providing psychospiritual care.</p><p>As the baby boomer generation continues to advance in age, it will be increasingly important that healthcare systems are well positioned to provide comprehensive end-of-life care addressing mind, body, and spirit as equal partners in whole-person health. Music and spirituality continue to be important day-to-day aspects for many people, and exploring diverse permutations of music, spirituality, and health intersections can be an important contribution to this pursuit of the good death.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: “selective focus photo of brown guitar on white pillow” by Kari Shea.

Um... but there is an explanation, we may not know what it is yet, but there is an explanation for these behaviors, and so uh... but the use of the word 'evil' doesn't get us any closer to understanding that. It leaves us in this supernatural rut rather than thinking of these behaviors as things that do have unfortunately human motivations .. but that are not the totality of the person.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/607042276/0/oupblogpsychology/">The long trauma of revenge porn</a></h4>

<p>In case you haven’t been paying attention, the intersection of sexual violence and technology has become an invisible tidal wave heading for the shores of our smart phones. Revenge porn – academically known as image-based abuse, non-consensual pornography, or the non-consensual sharing of intimate images – is one of a host of cyber-sexual violations clustered as technology-based sexual violence.  The most popular cases in the United States press show how wide the epidemic has spread. Celebrity scandals like the one involving Blac Chyna, Congressional hearings on its presence in the United States Military, and a recent filing with the United States Supreme Court about the dating app, Grindr, and its responsibility in the harassment of an man whose ex-boyfriend impersonated him and sent over 1,400 Grindr (as many as 23 a day over 10 months) users to his house and work for violent, and forced, sex, are just a few examples.</p><p>Beyond spiteful ex-lovers and predatory peeping toms, revenge porn includes hacking hard drives, under-skirting, and the use of deep fakes where a victim’ face is overlaid onto someone engaging in sexual acts. The seamless nature of this technology can make it hard for victims to convince observers it is not them in the video, which can have lasting consequences on victim’s lives and their mental health.</p><p>Image based sexual abuse is a form of cyber-harassment or bullying that involves publicly posting an intimate image that the victim has not consented to have shared. Scenarios include when victims consent to sharing an image or video with a single person (often an intimate partner) that is then shared by the recipient without consent, having images hacked from personal storage then posted on porn sites, or the sharing of images that were recorded without the victim’s consent at all.  Sometimes the victim’s personal information is shared along with these images, leading to ongoing harassment far beyond the public display of the image. Other times the victim is unaware of the crime for months or years until discovered on the dark web or a porn site.</p><p>Revenge porn is widespread throughout the globe. In 2017, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative shared data from a US survey that showed 1 in 8 adults are victims of non-consensual image sharing and one in 20 admit to sharing intimate images without consent. Other researchers found similar rates in a nationwide sample in Australia, citing one in 10 had been victimized online, with more than half of those reporting the incident occurring in the last year.  Women are victimized in this crime more than men, with LGBTQ communities and women of color experiencing the highest rates.</p><p>Sexual trauma in face to face violence has decades of research showing a cluster of symptoms that most survivors have in common, including confusion, changes in sleep and eating patterns, nightmares, and a heightened startle response in the short term that will prevent them from engaging socially. Longer term symptoms include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Are these symptoms the same for victims of image based sexual abuse? We don’t really know for sure.</p><p>The mental health community is just starting to understand the short and long-term outcomes of being victimized online. Most studies have shown that survivors victimized online have significantly worse “mental health outcomes” and “somatic symptoms” than those who have never been victimized online.  One researcher interviewed 18 women in Canada who were sexually victimized online and discovered PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and trust concerns. Research by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative uncovered a prevalence of suicidal thoughts while other research has found that victims of non-consensual image sharing often experience debilitating levels of shame and humiliation along with reduced self-esteem.</p><p>These reports indicate revenge porn appears to have the same post-assault symptoms as “face to face” sexual violence. However, what is drastically different in online abuse is the duration the violation. With the exception of domestic violence, kidnapping, and torture, ‘face to face’ sexual assault commonly takes place in hours of time whereas revenge porn often entails the ongoing  re-victimization as images spread across the digital landscape to new audiences and are viewed multiple time by the same audiences for months or even years. Many victims report having the image taken down off of one online platform, only to have it reappear on another one. For some survivors of revenge porn, they never succeed at removing their image and have to endure the long term effects of knowing someone is looking at their naked image at any moment in the day. The length of time that a person endures this kind of trauma has a significant effect on how mental health symptoms like PTSD will take hold, suggesting revenge porn victims might also have longer trauma recovery periods than survivors of what therapists call single incident trauma. But this is all speculative, more research needs to be done to show these effects.</p><p>A glimmer of hope is that the legal world is beginning to take note and pass legislation to protect the public. Australia now has a national office dedicated to fighting cyber-crimes, specifically revenge porn. Recently the US military has updated the Uniform Code of Military Justice to prevent revenge porn while many states have begun passing varying forms of legislation. The bad news is that more laws are not translating into more convictions. One reason is victim-blaming attitudes by police.  Another is inconsistent laws across jurisdictions, highlighted by the recent debate on a New York law, which advocates say is deeply flawed.  The outcome of cases like Herrick V. Grindr will also determine if digital and social media companies are legally accountable for crimes committed by users on their platforms.</p><p>What can we do in the meantime? One is to educate ourselves.  Talk to our friends, students, therapists, and professors about these types of crimes. Another is to support one another in efforts to prevent this nature of victimization from spreading. If someone tells you they have been victimized in this way, believe them, listen to them, and help them feel safe in whatever way that means for them (both digitally and privately in their community). Nobody has to go it aloneFF.</p><p>Together we can all push back against the tide of image based sexual abuse and digital victimization, and hopefully prevent the scurrilous mental health impacts that come with it.</p><p>Featured image via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/WiONHd_zYI4">unsplash</a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/09/the-long-trauma-of-revenge-porn/">The long trauma of revenge porn</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/607042276/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/607042276/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/607042276/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/nine-articles-problems-access-mental-health-services-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">Nine articles on problems in access to mental health services [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/" rel="nofollow">Brexit: when psychology and politics clash</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-birth-shapes-human-existence/" rel="nofollow">How birth shapes human existence</a></li></ul> </div>

Libet et al. asked volunteers to tap their fingers at will, freely choosing the time of each action. EEG revealed an electrical potential occuring "several hundred milliseconds" before people reported a conscious decision to perform each tap.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/606980256/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why hurricanes are deadly for older people</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/">Meteorologists</a> have pinpointed 10 September as the peak of hurricane season. September is the most active month of the year for Atlantic hurricane season, and 2019 is no exception. In early September, Dorian devastated the Bahamas, and wreaked havoc on the southeastern United States. Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico in September 2017, just weeks after Harvey and Irma touched town, while other late-summer storms – most notoriously Katrina in 2005 – have left death and destruction in their paths. Climate experts say rising temperatures will <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/27/1/3/520821">increase the risk of more intense storms</a>. Temperature increases also may hasten melting glaciers and ice caps, and rising sea levels – making coastal flooding more severe when storms hit shore.</p><p>Hurricanes have far reaching impacts for all people, yet these impacts are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/59/Supplement_1/S50/5491125#135809706">particularly devastating for older </a>people, especially those already suffering from poor health and financial insecurity. Older people make up 12% of the overall U.S. population, yet they made up two-thirds of the estimated 1,800 people who died in Katrina, and more than half of the 117 who succumbed to Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>What makes older people vulnerable? It’s not simply the frailty of old age that killed these victims; most deaths were a consequence of environmental and social factors that the victims could not overcome. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, two-thirds of older victims either drowned or dead from illness or injuries brought about from being trapped in their houses, surrounded by water. The remaining one-third fell to injuries, infections, and other health conditions worsened by the difficult evacuation process. The physical wear-and-tear of evacuation can hasten the fatal effects of pre-existing health conditions like heart disease or weakened immune systems. Some frail older people seek medical care in local hospitals that have lost power and can’t provide life-sustaining treatments like oxygen. The most tragic case occurred during 2017’s Hurricane Irma, when twelve Florida nursing home residents, ages 71 to 99, died of heat-related causes after the facility’s air conditioning failed.</p><p>Some disaster experts say that deaths occur following hurricanes and floods because local residents fail to evacuate promptly. Yet for older people, this is less a matter of willful defiance and more a matter of an inability to comply with evacuation orders. Poor and socially isolated older people are least capable of evacuating. Some stay put because they have nowhere to go, and no one to help them move. People with cognitive impairments may not understand how sever the risk is, and may require help in making timely decisions. The notion of relocating to an area where one has no social ties and has to start over again is also difficult. Some lack the social support to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/58/1/57/4741067">help them safely prepare</a> for the storm. The first North Carolina fatality of Dorian this month was an 85-year-old man who fell from a ladder while trying to prepare for the storm.</p><p>Others don’t want to abandon the few meager possessions they have, a legitimate concern for destitute older people. For socially isolated elders whose main source of emotional support is a pet, evacuation to a shelter may mean a separation (often permanent) from one’s faithful friend, as shelters are not dog- and cat-friendly. Some one-third of older pet owners in the Miami-Dade area needed assistance evacuating with their pets. Older people often live on the city’s outskirts, considerable distances for the area’s few pet-friendly shelters. These obstacles in traveling to the pet-friendly shelters were a major factor in their failure to evacuate.</p><p>For elderly people who decide to stay in their communities, services and supports may not be readily available. During a major disaster, local medical resources like hospitals and EMT services may be overwhelmed and out-of-state assistance like disaster relief teams may face obstacles reaching remote, isolated, or frightened older people. Pharmacies often are closed or without power and older people may lack the transportation, money, or assistance needed to obtain additional medications. In some cases, support services provide only a short-term fix. In the case of Katrina, the city of New Orleans received federal and state money that paid for buses, trucks, and trains to relocate local residences to government-funded shelters. Yet the stress of the move and uncertainty about what the future would hold after leaving the shelter kept many frail and socially isolated adults in their unsafe homes and communities.</p><p>Life also doesn’t necessarily get easier for elderly people after the storms pass. Older people are more likely to have been displaced after storms. They experience high levels of community and storm damage that prevents them from returning to their houses. If older people are to withstand the escalating number of September storms projected to strike in the coming years they need, pet-friendly shelters, family and community support, and safe housing, health care, and transportation.</p><p><em>Photo by </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/12019-12019/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=81664"><em>David Mark</em></a><em> from </em><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=81664">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/09/why-hurricanes-are-deadly-for-older-people/">Why hurricanes are deadly for older people</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/606980256/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/606980256/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/606980256/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/brexit-when-psychology-politics-clash/" rel="nofollow">Brexit: when psychology and politics clash</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-birth-shapes-human-existence/" rel="nofollow">How birth shapes human existence</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/10/how-alternative-employment-contracts-affect-low-wage-workers/" rel="nofollow">How alternative employment contracts affect low wage workers</a></li></ul> </div>

She suggested </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmoudkhalifa/"><span>Mahmoud Khalifa</span></a><span>, who works as a librarian at the </span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/cairo/"><span>Library of Congress Cairo Office</span></a><span> and is </span><a href="https://doaj.org/"><span>DOAJ</span></a><span> Ambassador for the Middle East and Persian Gulf. He is also President of <a href="http://cybrarians.info/en">Cybrarians</a>, which publishes an information science journal and runs two conferences.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To provide a voice from the developed world I invited </span><a href="http://www.jeff-mason.com/"><span>Jeffrey MacKie-Mason</span></a><span> to take part. MacKie-Mason is UC Berkeley’s University Librarian and Chief Digital Scholarship Officer. The resultant Q&amp;A with MacKie-Mason was published on April 8<sup>th</sup> (</span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/north-south-and-open-access-view-from.html"><span>here</span></a><span>), and a response to that Q&amp;A from Khalifa on 19<sup>th</sup> (</span><span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/north-south-and-open-access-mahmoud.html">here</a></span><span>). Today I am publishing a Q&amp;A with Khalifa (below), which I will ask MacKie-Mason to comment on. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>One topic I have been particularly keen to explore is the growing interest in Europe and the US in engineering a global “flip” of legacy subscription journals to a pay-to-publish open access model. I asked MacKie-Mason to take part partly because he is an </span><a href="http://madlibbing.berkeley.edu/economic-thoughts-about-gold-open-access"><span>enthusiastic advocate</span></a><span> for journal flipping. In fact, he believes it to be the only practical way of achieving open access in the near term.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>A global flip would imply a future in which the pay-to-publish model would come to dominate the scholarly publishing environment. Instead of readers (or their institutions) paying to access other researchers’ papers, authors would have to pay to publish their own papers – by means of article-processing charges (APCs). Currently, APCs are around $3,000 a paper, although they can be both higher and lower than this.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Not conformant with the philosophy of OA?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Many in the global North remain sceptical about the global flip proposal – for reasons I have explored </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/the-open-access-big-deal-back-to-future.html"><span>here</span></a><span>. For those in the global South the prospect of all international subscription journals converting to pay-to-publish gold OA is particularly daunting, and would surely be discriminatory since researchers in developing countries could expect to see today’s paywalls replaced by publication walls, threatening to further exclude them from the global scientific endeavour.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Indeed, Khalifa believes the use of APCs is not actually conformant with the philosophy of OA. And he says: “One of the aims of open access is to provide access to information free of charge, and that is much needed in developing countries. If APCs start to be widely applied it will create new hurdles for researchers in the global South looking to contribute to science.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To support his argument, Khalifa points out that a $2,000 APC is equivalent to six months’ salary for a professor in Egypt. In light of this, he suggests developing countries might be better to build up their local journals and focus on publishing in them. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The problem here, however, is that researchers in the developing world are increasingly being told by their governments and institutions that they must publish in international journals. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>A further problem, says Khalifa, is that local journals are not generally indexed in international citation databases like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"><span>Scopus</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science"><span>Web of Science</span></a><span>. This means that they are not visible to the global research community. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The journals could, of course, try and persuade these indexing services to include them. And they could apply for an impact factor (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor"><span>IF</span></a><span>). But this could backfire, says Khalifa, because most of the citations that local journals attract are from resources that are also not recognised by the global indexing services. “As a result, the total number of citations a journal will be seen to have received will be very low, and so it will not get a good IF.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>So even if local journals managed to gain greater visibility, they could find they are deemed to be low-quality journals in the process. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Another possibility, says Khalifa, is for the global South to develop its own own regional tools and databases. “This would enable us to evaluate our own journals and develop our own IF reports and other metrics.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But this would be a big task and would presumably require substantial funding. Currently, governments and research institutions in the South appear more focused on having their researchers publish in international journals than building up local solutions.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is therefore hard not to conclude that a global flip of legacy subscription journals to open access would be bad news for the developing world. For more on the issues please read the Q&amp;A with Khalifa below.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>One further thought: Those who maintain that publishers of international journals do not (as frequently claimed) overcharge for their products might like to ponder on the fact that it costs Khalifa just $250 a year to publish his journal. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">The Q&amp;A begins …</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><i><span>Q: Can you say something about yourself, your institution, and why and when you started to take an interest in open access?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span>MK:</span></b><span> I work at the </span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/cairo/"><span>Library of Congress Cairo office</span></a><span>.

Open access is mainly a way of promoting the publishing of information resources. The resources included in EKB are commercial, and the government pays the publishers to provide it.

For example, in Egypt one USD is equivalent to 17.6 LE [Egyptian pounds], so if I need to publish a paper internationally, and the APCs are $2,000, I have to pay 35,000 LE!

<p><strong>Re-purposing of diabetic drugs to treat cardiovascular disorders</strong></p>
<p>Four new ESC <a href="https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidelines</a> were released at the ESC Congress. One, released in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (<a href="https://www.easd.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EASD</a>), details the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz486" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">management and prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes or prediabetes</a>. These recommendations come after recent positive findings from large outcome trials with new classes of diabetes drugs, which demonstrated improvements in cardiovascular health independent of metabolic outcomes. These glucose-lowering compounds include the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. These guidelines also aim to reclassify cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients based on co-morbidities, with the plan to prevent cardiovascular disorder (CVD) initiation in those at high risk. These <a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/guidelines-on-diabetes-and-cardiovascular-diseases-published-today" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidelines</a> are timely given the global prevalence of diabetes is set to rise to more than 600 million people by the year 2045.</p>

<p>Other guidelines addressed acute pulmonary embolism, supraventricular tachycardia, chronic coronary syndromes, and dyslipidaemias. Aggressive targeting of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from &lt;70 mg/dL to &lt;55 mg/dL <span style="font-size: 16px;">is now advocated in high-risk patients; as </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455/5556353" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-size: 16px;" target="_blank">unequivocal evidence</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> shows a causal effect of LDL in the development of atherosclerotic CVD. Lipid-lowering drugs such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, have shown success and can be prescribed in combination with statins to achieve these targets.</span></p>

<p><strong>A need for greater funding in cardiovascular research?</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11301" style="width: 308px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11301" height="224" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Image-3-300x225.jpg" width="298" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><strong>Figure 1: Excellent improvements in life expectancy due to cardiovascular medicine advancements have meant funding for cardiovascular disorders has been reduced in recent years.</strong></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Despite excellent increases in life expectancy, partly as a result of cardiovascular medicine, there was a consensus that <em>“the war is not over”</em> particularly in developing nations (<a href="https://twitter.com/borjaibanez1?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Borja Ibanez</a>). In a symposium presided over by Professor <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/valentin-fuster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Valentin Fuster</a> (Mount Sinai Hospital, USA), he implored delegates of the need to communicate that cardiovascular disease is <em>“still the number one killer in the world and that more funding for CVDs research is urgently needed”</em> (Fig. 1). One strong recommendation given to cardiologists was to form multi-disciplinary teams to research and deliver interventions, especially with endocrinologists treating type 2 diabetes (<a href="https://twitter.com/drmikefarkouh?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michael Farkouh</a>).</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11304" style="width: 329px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11304" height="239" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/09/Image-6-300x225.jpg" width="319" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><strong>Figure 2: The ESC Digital Health Area catered for impressive technological advancements in data science, technology, and digital health.</strong></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><strong>Digital health in cardiology</strong></p>
<p>The Digital Health Area provided a space for all exciting new developments in cardiovascular technology (Fig. 2). In recent times, machine learning predicts deaths/ heart attacks better than clinical experts and/or physical measurements <a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/machine-learning-overtakes-humans-in-predicting-death-or-heart-attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(Luis Eduardo Juarez-Orozco</a>), wearable watches can perform electrocardiograms (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicstraiton" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nicola Straiton</a>), while eHealth virtual care helps patients reach blood pressure targets more effectively than standard care (<a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/3817" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carl Lavie</a>). As Professor <a href="https://twitter.com/profhhemingway?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harry Hemingway</a> (University College London, UK) stated, the challenge now is applying the power of large scale health data into clinically-meaningful discoveries that address health challenges and improve people’s lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This wonderfully well-organised ESC Congress was able to cater for more than 30,000 delegates from around the world. Services included practical-based tutorials (Fig. 3), breakfast networking events, and interactive ESC guideline sessions, facilitating the dialogue and integration of new clinical practice codes. The extensive material from ESC TV, online-accessible presentation videos and slides will ensure that cardiovascular health professionals can review content all the way up to 2020’s congress held once again in Amsterdam for the first time since 2013 (Fig. 4).</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/FcKahPTJr_o/">Opening Peer Review Options for Recognition, Credit, and Accountability</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/09/peer-review-week-gradient-slower-2-150x150.gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s Peer Review Week is all about Quality in Peer Review. When we talk about quality, it’s easy to focus on the review comments themselves: are they accurate, well-written, constructive? If these were the only factors contributing to peer review quality, the solution would be more robust and accessible training resources. These tools are undoubtedly important and available, but in limiting the discussion to the comments themselves, we miss one fundamental driver of the entire process: what’s in it for reviewers?</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equal Credit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To facilitate peer review, journals need a healthy supply of external researchers willing to volunteer their time and expertise to the academic process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make peer review equally rewarding for reviewers as it is for the authors who are hopeful of publicizing months of hard work and building up their scholarly profiles, we need to improve the ways we provide credit and visibility for the work of reviewers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why not offer reviewers the same benefits? Earlier this year, we implemented ORCID for reviewers so that they can receive automatic, authenticated credit for their reviews in our submission system. By making the same efficient system of credit available to reviewers as we do for authors, scholarly profiles become more nuanced and we add value to the diverse contributions researchers make to science everyday. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID is very valuable to the research community since it provides a full portrait of each researcher, and not only their list of publications…By integrating this information, ORCID allows a better evaluation of researchers’ contributions in their scientific fields.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– PLOS ONE author, Patricia Pintor dos Reis</span></p></blockquote>
<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparent Research Record</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer review shapes published research behind the scenes. We want to bring that work to the forefront to reveal the entire process. Published reviews let you know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what effect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> peer review has had on the authors while signed reviews let you know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who contributed. </span></i></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparency in the review process should make reviews focus on making the publication better and not simply be a barrier to publication </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology Author and PLOS Pathogens Editor, Laura Knoll</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see how published review works in action, take a look at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article, </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220451"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (HPBMC) populations and T-cell subsets associated with arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposures in a Bangladesh cohort</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The entire decision letter is available to show the dialogue that ultimately shaped the article for publication. Every suggestion made by the reviewers is documented, alongside the response from the authors culminating in a published article.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through broader visibility, we can demonstrate the importance of peer review, give reviewers more opportunities for recognition, and even educate students and the public about the scientific process. By elevating peer review as a recognized scholarly output, we also increase accountability and incentive to provide more high-quality comments.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Science for the Future</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the sharing, reviewing, and publication of research becomes fully open, everyone benefits. To get a look at the future of Open Science practices working in concert,take a look at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000364"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intestinal delta-6-desaturase activity determines host range for Toxoplasma sexual reproduction</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This article had been posted as a </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/688580v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on bioRxiv before submission, already garnering the attention of the media. Putting their work out there early helped the authors’ research get discovered, not only by their peers, but also from our staff editors who encouraged the authors to submit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors also chose to make public their peer review history public, completing a truly Open review process of important research. From preprint to publication, we readers now have a documented history of the article’s beginnings, edits, and final product. We hope to see more science open to this level of transparency, to encourage review comments on preprints themselves, and to increase opportunities for review at all stages of research-sharing.This is what the future of Open Science looks like.  </span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The placebo effect is a curious phenomenon. A wealth of literature has shown that inert treatments can not only produce medical benefits like pain relief, but <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/11/the-placebo-effect-digested-10-amazing-findings/">also have cognitive effects</a> like boosting creativity and learning. And while many of those studies involve misleading people into thinking that they are receiving an effective intervention, <span>a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49466-6">new study in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> shows </span><span>that this deception is not always necessary. Researchers have found that taking a placebo can reduce people’s anxiety before a test — even when they know they are taking an inactive pill. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37869"></span></p>
<p>As many as 2 in 5 people experience test anxiety, which can involve physical symptoms like high heart rate and sweating, negative thinking, and even impaired performance or avoidance of the test in the first place. Some sufferers take medications or have psychotherapy <span>—</span> but Michael Schaefer from Medical School Berlin and colleagues wondered whether just taking a placebo could help.</p>
<p>The team recruited 58 university students who were approaching their end of term exams. Half of the participants were given no treatment, while the other half were asked to take two placebo pills per day for two weeks. Importantly, there was no deception involved: the researchers told participants in the placebo condition that their pills were inactive. Before starting the course of treatment, and again at the end, the participants completed questionnaires that measured their level of test anxiety, physical and mental well-being, and self-management skills (for example, coping mechanisms and belief in one’s own ability to succeed).</p>
<p>The control group didn’t show any difference in the measures before and after the treatment period. But the story was different for the placebo group: after “treatment” with the placebo, their anxiety had significantly reduced, and they also showed improved self-management abilities. It wasn’t clear, however, whether these changes had any knock-on effect on exam grades (within the placebo group, participants who showed a greater improvement in their self-management skills tended to achieve higher grades, but this correlation didn’t reach significance).</p>
<p>It’s a mystery how placebos decrease anxiety even when people are aware that they are taking an inert substance, the researchers write. One possibility is that the positive way in which the researchers discussed the intervention with participants may have played a role: participants were told that placebo effects could be “powerful” and that the body may respond automatically. But while the results might seem surprising, they are consistent with previous research that has found “open label” placebos can be effective for conditions like irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
<p>Still, the results are very preliminary. The sample size was pretty small, and it’s unclear whether what seems to be a fairly modest drop in anxiety scores has practical relevance. It would be interesting to see more detailed evidence of exactly how the placebo intervention affected participants — did it alter their negative thinking, for instance, or have more of an effect on physical symptoms of test anxiety?</p>
<p>And even if placebos reduce the kind of anxiety people experience before a test, that doesn’t necessarily mean they work for more chronic anxiety or in other stressful situations. There are, of course, many other ways for dealing with high pressure situations — for more on those, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/17/how-to-cope-under-pressure-according-to-psychology/">see this week’s feature from Emma Young</a>.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/606904576/0/oupblogpsychology/">Cancer patient or cancer survivor? Understanding illness identity.</a></h4>

<p>The good news is that many people now survive their cancer. They are either cured or live with cancer as a chronic illness. However, life after cancer can vary between cancer survivors. Some are almost symptom free and return to a normal life after completion of treatment, while others could experience persistent side effects of cancer and treatment long after treatment has ended.</p><p>With the number of people living with cancer growing, there is increasing interest in how these people perceive themselves and their illness.  With the advent of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953608001809">cancer advocacy</a>, traditional terms such as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-009-0993-x"><em>cancer patient</em> or <em>cancer victim</em></a>, are being replaced by the more empowering <em>cancer survivor</em>. Although some might consider the differences in these terms as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182266">semantics</a>, many argue the label <em>cancer patient</em> is dehumanizing, emphasizing the disease over the people themselves.</p><p>So why is understanding illness identity important? For example, people who consider themselves as patients might feel less empowered to contribute actively to their treatment decisions, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28622019">deferring</a> instead to the treating medical specialist. On the other hand, people who are still grappling with cancer and its after effects might feel <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953608001809?via%3Dihub">alienated being described as a <em>survivor</em></a>, perceiving that their struggles or feelings of suffering are not validated.  Previous research report that people who perceive themselves as patients were more likely to be <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07357900600896323">depressed</a> and have <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12110">poorer quality of life</a>. In contrast, people who identify themselves as cancer survivors report <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11764-016-0521-z">better health outcomes</a>.</p><p>In Germany, it is still not common for people living with cancer to describe themselves as a <em>cancer survivor</em>. About a third of people there who had been previously diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer still considered themselves cancer patients 5 to 15 years after the diagnosis. This perception is associated with many factors, such as type of cancer treatment received, whether the disease has recurred or progressed, whether a new cancer is diagnosed, and psychological problems. People who still consider themselves patients were also more likely to make cancer-related visits to a health care specialist or facility.</p><p>Besides illness identity, we also need to consider <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515801">illness perceptions</a>. People with similar clinical characteristics could have vastly different interpretations of the seriousness of their illness. How people perceive and respond to their cancer and treatment could be important in how they cope with and adapt to life after cancer. These perceptions can be shaped by previous experience, current observations, or shared information on illness and symptoms. People with negative or pessimistic illness perceptions were more likely to report poorer self-management of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028218">illness side effects</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24664984">less likely to stick to treatment recommendations</a>, report higher levels of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=gray%2C+predictors%2C+anxiety%2C+colorectal+cancer">problems like depression and anxiety</a>, and make <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30215142">more visits to health specialists</a> for general or cancer-related matters. Furthermore, negative perceptions have been associated with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30192384">poorer quality of life and a higher risk of mortality</a>. However, these negative perceptions <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006141">can be fixed</a>. Therefore, health care providers should consider exploring and identifying perceptions that could be unhelpful to adapting to living with cancer. Addressing how people see their cancer in a more positive light may reduce further medical problems and improve well-being.</p><p><em>Featured image credit: “Man and Woman Raising Hands” by rawpixel.com.
