<p>Becoming a father is an extremely important life event for a man. Fathers can experience new emotions, feelings, and changes initiated by the transition into parenthood. Some evidence shows that around <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185905">10% of new fathers experience depression</a>, and yet this is still little understanding about this let alone appropriate support. Most new mothers perceive the father to be a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03701.x">crucial source of support</a>. Poor paternal support can exacerbate <a href="https://www.ajan.com.au/archive/Vol33/Issue1/4Wynter.pdf">maternal mental health problems</a>. However, many <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1229-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">fathers feel alienated and have little knowledge</a> about how they can support their partner at this time.</p>
<p>These days, around 98% of fathers are present at the birth of their child. If that birth becomes traumatic, the father witnessing these events can also become traumatized. While research exists about the impact of <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-88?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">birth trauma on mothers</a>, little is known about the impact on fathers. Some evidence shows that fathers encountered ‘<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1259-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">a rollercoaster of emotions, characterized by isolation and abandonment</a>’ when witnessing their partners’ birth trauma. Previous studies have shown that <a href="https://fn.bmj.com/content/97/6/F439">fathers get little information and support</a> in the event of a traumatic birth.</p>
<p>Fathers’ mental health matters for many reasons; we need to understand more about how we can help dads. My recent research has sought to explore that in more depth, while my campaigns urge better support for fathers. It’s not about support for fathers instead of mothers; it’s as well as. If we help fathers, we help mothers. If we help them both, we also help their children.</p>
<h3><strong>My research with fathers’ mental health</strong></h3>
<p>So far, my work has focused on three areas: what information and support fathers need to help their wife/partner should they experience poor mental health in the perinatal period; what support we need to give to fathers to deal with their own mental health in the perinatal period; and what information and support we need to give to fathers should their wife/partner experience what might perceived to be a traumatic birth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our research shows that fathers feel that they are not properly considered when it comes to providing information and support regarding their own postnatal mental health.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are currently finalizing work on our research focusing on what support we need to give to fathers to manage their own mental health in the perinatal period, while the other two areas have been addressed in our recent papers in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p><u>Fathers and birth trauma </u></p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02902-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our study</a> of fathers who witnessed their partner’s traumatic birth, 61 fathers took part in a qualitative study that asked them to reflect on what information and support they were given. From those responses, three main themes were identified.</p>
<p>1.  Fathers’ understanding after the experience</p>
<p>Dads told us that ‘nothing could prepare them’ for the experience. One father said, “<em>At no point was there any explanation to either my partner or myself to calm the situation</em>.”</p>
<p>Fathers also confirmed that they felt the experience was ‘not about them’, as one dad expressed his exclusion:  “<em>No. I’m the male. My presence was often not acknowledged let alone my feelings</em>.”</p>
<p>2.  Life after birth trauma</p>
<p>Many fathers expressed concerns about what happened after the event:  “<em>The trauma of my son’s birth put me immediately into what felt like sole-responsibility for my entire family 24/7, ultimately excluded me from colleagues and friends and I struggled to cope</em>.”</p>
<p>The trauma clearly had an impact on many of the fathers’ mental health. One father told us he was “<em>Upset, distressed and unable to cope very well. It was a feeling about the fragility of life during the birth and the overwhelming nature of the birth and the subsequent days</em>.”</p>
<p>For some fathers, the traumatic experience had an impact on the relationship with their partner and infant. For example:  “<em>I wanted to be with my wife but I felt guilty that I didn’t want to be with the baby. When I was with the baby I didn’t feel the level of love that everyone says you do and I felt guilty about that</em>.”</p>

<p>3.  Support fathers received vs. what they wanted</p>
<p>Fathers told us that they were not getting that support from healthcare professionals. One father said, “<em>I should have been more included from the beginning. A mother and father should both complete questionnaires regarding depression and a father should be asked how he is feeling or if there is anything that he wants to ask or doesn’t understand. These questions are solely aimed at the expectant mother whilst a father has to butt in and speak during a conversation he is only there to witness</em>.”</p>
<p><u>Fathers supporting partner’s poor postnatal mental health</u></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03043-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">second study</a> sought to explore fathers’ experience of their partners’ postnatal mental health. Twenty-five fathers took part in a qualitative study that asked them to reflect on what information and support they were given when their partner became unwell. From their responses to an online questionnaire, we revealed several important themes.</p>
<p>1.  Fathers not getting enough support</p>
<p>Focusing on the amount of support received, one father told us “<em>I didn’t know how to help her.</em>”</p>
<p>Other fathers felt that any support given was of a poor quality. One commented that the support offered “…<em>didn’t cover anything about the father and I felt lost</em>.”</p>
<p>2.  Fathers not getting enough information</p>
<p>Fathers told us that they felt poorly informed. For example, one dad reflected on how he desired a “<em>…basic understanding of depression and how to help when dealing with psychosis episode</em>s.”</p>
<p>3.  Having someone to talk to</p>
<p>Many fathers would welcome having someone to talk to. One father explained how “… <em>a specialist to sit with me and explain the situation and care plan</em>” would have been useful.</p>
<blockquote><p>International Fathers Mental Health Day is a global event illustrating why fathers’ mental health matters.</p></blockquote>
<p>4.  Health professionals not taking fathers seriously</p>
<p>Many fathers said that they experienced very little help from the health professionals caring for their partner. One said, “<em>My wellbeing was of little interest to midwifes, health visitors… I had not given birth so had no cause for sympathy. A leaflet for my wife and a page for the fathers to read which wasn’t enough</em>”</p>
<h3><strong>Global impact for fathers’ mental health</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, the outcomes from our latest research show that fathers feel that they are not properly considered when it comes to providing information and support regarding their own postnatal mental health, including the impact of birth trauma, and for helping their partner should she need support.</p>
<p>Today, June 22, is <a href="https://www.postpartum.net/news-and-blog/ifmhd/">International Fathers Mental Health Day</a> (IFMHD; the day after Fathers’ Day each year). In addition to research, <a href="https://www.andrewmayers.info/index.html">my work</a> involves campaigning for better perinatal mental health. I lead the UK side of IFMHD with global campaigner <a href="https://www.reachingoutpmh.co.uk/">Mark Williams</a>. IFMHD is led in the USA by Daniel Singley (<a href="https://www.menexcel.com/">The Center for Men’s Excellence</a>) with support from <a href="https://www.postpartum.net/">Postpartum Support International</a>. Bronwyn Leigh, Director of the <a href="https://www.centreforperinatalpsychology.com.au/">Centre for Perinatal Psychology</a>, leads from Australia.</p>
<p>IFMHD is a global event that shares blogs, videos, research and news items illustrating why fathers’ mental health matters. In recent years, truly powerful stories have been posted across <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ifmhd&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dadsMHday/">Facebook</a> and we have featured in some noteworthy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/when-postpartum-depression-stole-my-husband/2019/09/06/e560822c-be07-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html">global print and broadcast media</a>. Publicity and evidence from IFMHD and other research-led campaigning has enabled us to influence change in mental health support services for fathers, at least in the UK. Research by groups such as ours helped persuade NHS England to begin screening fathers for their mental health for the very first time. We hope that our new evidence, highlighted here, will have similar impact, perhaps even beyond the UK.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/academic-precarity-and-the-single-pi-lab-model/">Academic precarity and the single PI lab model</a></h4>

<p>Brilliant young scientists are struggling to obtain a stable faculty position, all over the world. It seems that “publish or perish” was actually quite hopeful. Now clearly, at least in biology, it is more like “publish in Science, Nature or Cell every other year or perish”. Only a small proportion of PhD holders manage to obtain a stable academic position, and only at an advanced age after multiple postdocs. Of course, this competition for publishing in certain venues also has a great impact on science; encouraging dishonesty and discouraging both long-term creative work and solid incremental science. Everyone complains about the situation.</p>
<p>What should we do about it? What I hear most frequently is that governments should increase the budget and create more faculty positions. That is certainly necessary but I think it is a reductionist view that largely misses the point. Of course, at the time when you start hiring more faculty, the proportion of young scientists who get a faculty position increases. However, if each of them then opens their lab and hire dozens of postdocs, then this proportion quickly reverts to what it was before.</p>
<p>What is at stakes is the general organization of research, in particular the “X lab” model (e.g. the Brette lab), with one group leader (the “PI”) surrounded by a number of graduate students and postdocs (I will discuss only the research staff here), with a complete turnover every few years. It seems that in many countries, to get a faculty position means to start their “own” lab. This is not the case yet in France, but this lab model is spreading very, very fast. With the new law on research currently in discussion (“discussion” might not be the appropriate word, though), it is planned that about 25% of all new recruitments will follow this model (a tenure-track system).</p>
<p>The math is easy. In a stable world, each faculty member will train on average one student to become a faculty member. For example, if a typical lab consists of 1 PI with 3 graduate students, rotating every 4 years, then over 40 years the PI will have trained 30 students, one of which would become a PI. The “success rate” would therefore be 1/30. Even with just one student at any given time, the chance for a student to end up getting a faculty position is 1/10.</p>
<p>Of course, one does not necessarily pursue a PhD with the goal of obtaining a faculty position. It is completely respectable to do a PhD then go to the industry. In many countries, holding a PhD is an asset. It is generally not the case in France, though. One may also want to do a PhD not for career, but because it is interesting in itself. This seems perfectly valid. Note that in that case, implementing a subtask of the PI’s project and doing all the tedious bench work might not be ideal. In any case, it must be emphasized that in this lab model, training students for research is only a marginal aim of a PhD.</p>
<p>How about postdocs? A postdoc is not a diploma. It typically doesn’t improve employability much. Of course, it could be done just for its own interest. But the experience I hear is mostly that of a highly stressful situation, because many if not most postdocs are hoping to secure a stable faculty position. Let us do the math again, with a simplified example. Suppose each lab has just 1 postdoc, rotating every 4 years. Compared to the above situation, it means that 1 out of 3 graduate students go on to do a postdoc. Then each of these postdocs has a 10% chance of getting a faculty position.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at funding questions now. What seems very appreciated is that when you start a lab, you get a “start-up package”. There is a blog post on Naturejobs entitled “<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2015/11/16/the-faculty-series-top-10-tips-on-negotiating-start-up-packages/">The faculty series: Top 10 tips on negotiating start-up packages</a>” that describes it. We can read for example: “<em>There’s no point having equipment if you don’t have any hands to use it. One of the largest costs you can expect to come out of your start-up fund are the salaries of PhD students and postdocs. They’re the most crucial components of the lab for almost all researchers</em>.”. It is very nice to provide the PI with these “components of the lab”, but as argued above, a direct consequence is to organize academic precarity on a massive scale. This remains true even if the entire budget of the State is allocated to research.</p>
<p>The same goes for the rest of the funding system. Project-based funding is conceived so that you hire people to implement your project, which you supervise. Part of these people are students and postdocs. For example, an ERC Starting Grant is 1.5 million euros for 5 years, or 300 k€ per year. In France, a PhD student costs about 30 k€ / year and a postdoc about the double. Of course, to that must be added the indirect costs (25%) and the grant also covers equipment and your own salary. But this is generally sufficient to hire a few students and postdocs, especially as in many countries graduate students are funded by other sources. Then the budget goes up to 2 million € for the consolidator grant and 2.5 million € for the advanced grant. The ERC has become a sort of model for good funding schemes in Europe, because it is so generous. But is it? Certainly it is for the PI who receives the grant, but a world where this mode of funding is generalized is a world where research is done by a vanishingly small proportion of permanent researchers. It is a world that is extremely cruel to young scientists, and with a very worrying demographic structure, most of the work being done by an army of young people with high turnover. You might increase the ERC budget several fold because it is such a great scheme, it will not improve this situation, at all.</p>
<p>Ending academic precarity is a noble cause, but one has to realize that it is inconsistent with the one PI - one lab model, as well as with project-based funding. I want to add a couple of remarks. Precarity is obviously bad for the people who experience it, but it is also bad more generally for the academic system. The excessive competition it generates encourages bad practices, and discourages long-term creative work and solid incremental science. We must also look beyond research per se. The role of academia in society is not just to produce new science. It is also to teach and to provide public expertise. We need to have some people with a deep understanding of epidemiology that we can turn to for advice when necessary. You would not just hire a bunch of graduate students after a competitive call for projects to do this advising job when a new virus emerges. But with a pyramidal organization, a comparatively low proportion of the budget is spent on sustaining the most experienced persons, so for the same budget, you would have much lower expertise than in an organization with more normal demographics. This is incredibly wasteful.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? Well, first of all, research has not always been organized in this way, with one PI surrounded by an army of students and postdocs. The landmark series of 4 papers by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 on the ionic basis of neural excitability did not come out of the "Hodgkin lab"; they came out from “the Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge”. The Hubel and Wiesel papers on the visual cortex were not done by graduate student Hubel under the supervision of professor Wiesel. Two scientists of the same generation decided to collaborate together, and as far as I know none of their landmark papers from the 1960s involved any student or postdoc. What strikes me is that these two experienced scientists apparently had the time to do the experiments themselves (<em>all</em> the experiments), well after they got a stable faculty position (in 1959). How many PIs can actually do that today, instead of supervising, hiring, writing grants and filling reports? It is quite revealing to read again the recent blog post cited above: “<em>There’s no point having equipment if you don’t have any hands to use it.” </em>- as if using it yourself was not even conceivable.</p>
<p>In France, the 1 PI - 1 lab kind of organization has been taking on gradually over the last 20 years, with a decisive step presumably coming this year with the introduction of a large proportion of tenure tracks with “start-up packages”. This move has been accompanied by a progressive shift from base funding to project-based funding, and a steady increase in the age of faculty recruitment. This is not to say that the situation was great 20 years ago, but it is clearly worsening.</p>
<p>A sustainable, non-pyramidal model is one in which a researcher would typically train no more than a few students over her entire career. It means that research work is done by collaboration between peers, rather than by hiring (and training) less experienced people to do the work. It means that research is not generically funded on projects led by a single individual acting as a manager. In fact, a model where most of the working force is already employed should have much less use of “projects”. A few people can just decide to join forces and work together, just as Hubel and Wiesel did. Of course, some research ideas might need expenses beyond the usual (e.g. equipment), and so there is a case for project-based funding schemes to cover for these expenses. But it is not the generic case.</p>
<p>One of the fantasies of competitive project-based funding is that it would supposedly increase research quality by selecting the best projects. But how does it work? Basically, peers read the project and decide whether they think it is good. Free association is exactly that, except the peers in question 1) are real experts, 2) commit to actually do some work on the project and possibly to bring some of their own resources. Without the bureaucracy. Peer reviewing of projects is an unnecessary and poor substitute for what goes on in free collaboration - do I think this idea is exciting enough to devote some of my own time (and possibly budget) on it?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the problem of academic precarity, of the unhealthy pressure put on postdocs in modern academia, is not primarily a budget problem. At least it is not just that. It is a direct consequence of an insane organization of research, based on general managerial principles that are totally orthogonal to what research is about (and beyond: teaching, public expertise). This is what needs to be challenged.</p>

<p>Circulating groundwater <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb0779">triggered a four-year-long swarm</a> of tiny earthquakes that rumbled beneath the Southern California town of Cahuilla, researchers report in the June 19 <em>Science</em>. By training computers to recognize such faint rumbles, the scientists were able not only to identify the probable culprit behind the quakes, but also to track how such mysterious swarms can spread through complex fault networks in space and time.</p>



<p>Seismic signals are constantly being recorded in tectonically active Southern California, says seismologist Zachary Ross of Caltech. Using that rich database, Ross and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-million-tiny-earthquakes-revealed-southern-california">have been training computers to distinguish</a> the telltale ground movements of minute earthquakes from other things that gently shake the ground, such as construction reverberations or distant rumbles of the ocean (<em>SN: 4/18/19</em>). The millions of tiny quakes revealed by this machine learning technique, he says, can be used to create high-resolution, 3-D images of what lies beneath the ground’s surface in a particular region.</p>



<p>In 2017, the researchers noted an uptick in tiny quake activity in the Cahuilla region that had, at that point, been going on for about a year. Most of the quakes were far too small to be felt but were detectable by the sensors. Over the next few years, the team used their computer algorithm to identify 22,000 such quakes from early 2016 to late 2019, ranging in magnitude from 0.7 to 4.4.</p>

<h3>Quakes galore</h3>





<p>From early 2016 to late 2019, about 22,000 earthquakes rumbled beneath Cahuilla, Calif. The quakes ranged in magnitude from 0.7 to 4.4. The earliest quakes (in red) were all within a small region just tens of meters long. Over the next few years, the number of quakes grew and moved outward (from orange to blue). That evolving, diffusive earthquake front suggests that circulating groundwater triggered the long-lasting swarm of tremors.</p>

<p>Such a cluster of small quakes, with no standout, large mainshock, is called a swarm. “Swarms are different from a standard mainshock-aftershock sequence,” which are typically linked to the transfer of stress from fault to fault in the subsurface, Ross says. The leading candidates for swarm triggering come down to groundwater circulation or a kind of slow slippage on an active fault, known as fault creep.</p>



<p>“Swarms have been somewhat enigmatic for quite a while,” says David Shelly, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist based in Golden, Colo., who was not connected with the study. They are particularly common <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mauna-kea-volcano-dormant-tiny-earthquakes-gas-magma">in volcanic and hydrothermal areas</a>, he says, “and so sometimes, it’s a bit harder to interpret the ones that aren’t in those types of areas,” like the Cahuilla swarm (<em>SN: 5/14/20</em>).</p>



<p>“This one is particularly cool, because it’s [a] rare, slow-motion swarm,” Shelly adds. “Most might last a few days, weeks or months. This one lasted four years. Having it spread out in time like that gives a little more opportunity to examine some of the nuances of what’s going on.”</p>



<p>Data from the Cahuilla swarm, which is winding down but “not quite over,” Ross says, revealed not only the complex network of faults beneath the surface, but also the evolution of the fault zone over time. “You can see that the sequence [of earthquakes] originated from a region that’s only on the order of tens of meters wide,” Ross says. But over the next four years, he adds, that region grew, creating an expanding front of earthquake epicenters that spread out at a rate of about 5 meters per day, until it became about 30 times the size of the original zone.</p>



<p>That diffusive spread, Ross says, suggests that moving groundwater is triggering the swarm. Although the team didn’t directly observe fluids moving underground, the scientists speculate that beneath the fault zone lies a reservoir of groundwater that previously had been sealed off from the zone. At some point, that seal broke, and the groundwater was able to seep into one of the faults, triggering the first quakes. From there, it moved through the fault system over the next few years, triggering more quakes in its wake. Eventually, the seeping groundwater probably ran up against an impermeable barrier, which is bringing the swarm to a gradual halt. </p>





<p>Being able to identify what causes such mysterious events is extremely important when it comes to communicating with people about earthquake hazards, Ross says. “Typically, we have very limited explanations that we can provide to the public on what’s happening,” he says. “It gives us something that we can explain in concrete terms.”</p>



<p>And this discovery, he adds, “gives me a lot of confidence” to continue to apply this technique, such as on the last 40 years of amassed seismic data in Southern California, which likely contains many more previously undetected swarms.</p>



<p>The study highlights how seismologists are increasingly acknowledging the importance of fluids in the crust, Shelly says. And, he adds, it emphasizes how having so many tiny quakes can illuminate the hidden world of the subsurface. “It’s kind of like having a special telescope to look down into the crust,” he adds. Combining this wealth of seismic data with machine learning is “the future of earthquake analysis.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-built-artificial-smell-mouse-brain-nerve-cells">How to make a mouse smell a smell that doesn’t actually exist</a></h4>

<p>Scientists have implanted an artificial odor directly in the brains of mice. It doesn’t mean that mental Smell-O-Vision technology is coming soon. But the results, published June 18 in <em>Science</em>, deliver clues to how the brain processes information.</p>



<p>Details about the synthetic smell may help answer “fundamental questions in olfaction,” says computational biologist <a>Saket Navlakha</a> of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, who wasn’t involved in the study. Studies on the senses offer a window into how brains shape signals from the outside world into perceptions, and how those perceptions can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manipulating-nerve-cells-makes-mice-see-something-not-there">guide behavior</a> (<em>SN: 7/18/19</em>). </p>



<p>To build artificial smells in mice’s brains, researchers used <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/let-there-be-light-1">optogenetics</a>, a technique in which light prods genetically engineered nerve cells to fire signals <em>(SN: 1/15/10</em>). Neuroscientist <a>Dima Rinberg</a> of New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine and colleagues targeted nerve cells in mice’s olfactory bulbs. There, clusters of nerve endings called glomeruli organize the smell signals picked up in the nose.</p>



<p>Like playing a short ditty on a piano, Rinberg and colleagues activated nerve cells in six spots (each of which might include between one and three glomeruli) in a certain order. This neural melody was designed to be a simplified version of how a real odor might play those nerve cells. (It’s not known what the artificial odor actually smells like to a mouse.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="smell nerve bundles mouse brain" class="wp-image-3088966" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/061820_ls_fakesmells_inline1.gif" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088966">In response to a real odor, nerve bundles called glomeruli become active (red) in a particular sequence in a mouse’s brain.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088966">Hirofumi Nakayama/Rinberg Lab/NYU Langone Health</span></figure>



<p>Mice learned to signal the presence of this artificial smell by licking one of two spouts. The synthetic odor didn’t objectively exist, but the mice behaved as though they smelled it anyway, the researchers found. After “smelling” the synthetic odor, mice reliably licked the correct spout. Other scrambled signals, also delivered by optogenetics, didn’t cause the same reaction.</p>



<p>Together, the individual spots the researchers stimulated built the perception of the odor, just as a string of notes makes a melody. Because the smell was completely synthetic, though, researchers could mess with it. By slightly changing some of the signals generating the artificial odor, the researchers could test which qualities of the sequence were important, and which changes rendered the odor unrecognizable.</p>





<p>The beginning of the smell sequence seemed to be key. When the researchers swapped the order of the first few spots’ activity, the mice had more trouble identifying the smell than they did when the spots toward the end of the sequence were changed. And delays near the beginning mattered more than delays toward the end. “If you modify the first few notes, you more easily ruin the song,” Rinberg says.</p>



<p>This result supports an idea called the primacy effect, which holds that the neural signals that come first in a sequence carry more weight, says <a>Tatyana Sharpee</a>, a computational neuroscientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>More generally, these results offer an example of how changes in neural activity can affect a perception, Sharpee says. “Ultimately, this hints at the fundamental properties of the neural code.” </p>



<p>Sharpee suspects that similar properties might apply to other kinds of information processed by the brain, including vision and hearing signals, and perhaps even to more complex tasks such as memory. Such processes all rely on the same basic transformation, she says — “a general mathematical problem of coding inputs to outputs.” In this way, the brain takes incoming information about the world and stitches it into useful perceptions.  </p>



<p>In addition to following the synthetic smells into other parts of the brain, Rinberg and his colleagues want to test whether similar rules apply to real smells. “A synthetic odor is fantastic. It’s a super interesting tool,” Rinberg says. “But at the end of the day, I want to know how odors are formed in the brain.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, memes have played an increasingly important part in online political discussion: in 2016, the <em>Washington Post </em>dubbed the 2016 presidential election “the most-memed election in U.S. history”, and CNN has already christened the 2020 race “the meme election”.</p>
<p>But politicians may want to pause for thought before they hit send on that jokey tweet. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08824096.2020.1767047">New research</a> in <em>Communication Research Reports, </em>from Ohio State University’s Olivia Bullock and Austin Huber,<i> </i>suggests that humour doesn’t always go down well online — and that this can impact what voters think of particular candidates and potentially how they vote.</p>
<p><span id="more-39800"></span></p>
<p>The researchers showed 407 participants the Twitter profile of a fictional politician, Alex Smith, displayed as either male or female and either young or old. Smith was not given a political affiliation. The profile contained five tweets related to various hot-button issues including education, healthcare and voting and campaign issues.</p>
<p>Half of participants saw formal, serious tweets on the topic (“we’re tired of getting bad healthcare! It’s time to fix our broken system”) while the other half saw informal tweets containing puns or plays on words (we’re <em>sick</em> of getting bad health care! It’s time to <em>heal</em> our broken system”).</p>
<p>After viewing the profile, participants completed a questionnaire about their perceptions of Smith. First, they indicated how humorous they found the messages, before rating how appropriate they felt the tweets were for someone running for office and how surprised they were by them (that is, how much the tweets violated expectations about a candidate’s behaviour). They also answered questions on perceived credibility and how knowledgeable, trustworthy and likeable they found the candidate. Finally, participants were asked how likely they would be to vote, campaign or donate to the candidate were they running in their area.</p>
<p>Participants did find the punny tweets more humorous compared to the more formal ones <span>—</span> but that wasn’t necessarily a good thing. Those in the informal condition felt the tweets they saw violated their expectations about how a candidate should behave far more than those in the formal condition. This, in turn, led to feelings that the candidate was less credible, and to reduced levels of support. These findings held across sex and age, neither of which had a significant impact on how participants responded to the tweets.</p>
<p>The study suggests that informal or jokey tweets could have a tangible impact on a politician’s success in the polls. But none of this is to say that well-executed jokes might not have a positive impact sometimes. <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/ejas/12158">Other work</a> has suggested that Trump and his supporters were actively boosted during the 2016 election by their successful memeing, and it’s a strategy his camp continues to use in the run-up to the next one. And in some cases, humour clearly <em>is</em> working <span>—</span> Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/12/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-twitter-social-media">widely lauded</a> for her often humorous social media presence. This could relate to a <em>lack</em> of expectancy violation: politicians like Trump and Ocasio-Cortez have built their brands on more informal (though very different) communication styles, meaning voters are not surprised by jokes online.</p>
<p>Puns, the “informal” form of communication used in this study, are not a particularly sophisticated form of humour, so future work might look at different types: irony, sarcasm or surrealism, for example. The relationship between jokes and political affiliation would also be interesting to look at: what impact humour has on floating voters, for example, or whether partisan voters have different interpretations of jokes that come from their own party or a rival party.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that political campaigns will become any less “online” <span>—</span> if anything, the influence of the internet is only set to increase. But caution is probably needed for political candidates looking to get a laugh <span>—</span> otherwise, they may <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/08/12/news/hillary-clinton-tweet-emoji-reaction/index.html">find themselves</a> the butt of the joke.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">COVID-19 case clusters offer lessons and warnings for reopening</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Several months into the COVID-19 pandemic, countries are looking for ways to restart their economies, public health officials are looking to guide safe reopening and people are eagerly looking to escape cabin fever. But tough lessons have surfaced from countries that were hit early in the pandemic and have already reopened.</p>



<p>Consider South Korea: In April, after new cases had steadily declined to single digits, the country began easing lockdown restrictions. But that respite was short-lived. On May 6, a 29-year-old man <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxSc5RNccSg">tested positive</a> for SARS-CoV-2, just a few days after visiting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNVcAhuUaBM">five dance clubs</a> in one night in Seoul’s Itaewon district. On May 8, South Korea responded quickly, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/12/854407305/south-korea-delays-reopening-schools-as-coronavirus-cases-resurge">postponing plans</a> to reopen schools and urging bars and clubs to shut down again for a month. As of June 8, the Korean Centers for Disease Control <a href="https://is.cdc.go.kr/upload_comm/syview/doc.html?fn=159160814965400.pdf&amp;rs=/upload_comm/docu/0030/">had linked</a> the sick man to 96 other clubgoers who got COVID-19, plus 178 people with whom those clubgoers came into contact.</p>



<p>That wasn’t the only cluster that put the brakes on South Korea’s reopening plans. Soon more clusters popped up in an online retail center, a theme park, a table tennis club and a handful of churches.</p>



<p>Other countries should expect similar starts and stops upon relaxing stay-at-home rules. “Reopening is not a one-way street, and we may need to make a U-turn,” says Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Irvine.</p>





<p>Studying these kinds of transmission clusters as well as common environments where COVID-19 moves easily from person to person provides a glimpse of how to avoid the U-turns. To that end, epidemiologist Gwenan Knight and her colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine <a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-83/v2">compiled a massive database of worldwide COVID-19 case clusters</a> based on media accounts, published scientific studies and government health department reports.</p>



<p>As of June 10, their database included 231 cluster events, or groups of cases tied to the same place. The data are limited to known clusters and to what the patients involved could recall and what they told investigators.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Where does COVID-19 spread?</h3>



<p>A team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has compiled a database of 231 known COVID-19 case clusters, represented in the graphic here. The settings are color-coded based on whether the virus spread in an indoor vs. outdoor setting, and each bubble’s size represents the number of cases in the cluster. As much as possible, the team looked at the first round of transmission, in hopes of getting an accurate snapshot of the risks different types of settings pose. When data were available, the team also calculated a cluster’s attack rate, or the percentage of people who got sick out of the total number of people present.</p>



<p>The most prevalent setting among reported clusters is in households, and the largest clusters occurred aboard ships. The London team’s database includes some entries that represent more than one cluster; in this chart, those have been separated out so each bubble shown represents a single cluster.</p>












</div>



<p>Some interesting trends have emerged. Indoor settings dominate, partly because the virus hit during winter, when people spend most of their time indoors, and partly because in outdoor settings an abundant flow of fresh air helps dissipate virus particles exhaled by an infected person. Ultraviolet rays from the sun might also help kill virus particles.</p>



<p>Households were the most common place for transmission, accounting for 15 percent, or 38 of 231, cluster events. And mealtime was prime time. “It’s not the eating. It’s the sitting around and talking,” Noymer suspects. SARS-CoV-2 primarily spreads via respiratory droplets and direct contact. While sharing food or utensils could theoretically pose a risk for infection, no clusters have been linked to eating itself. A study published June 3 in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> found <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-2135_article">traces of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material on chopsticks</a> used by patients in Hong Kong, but whether virus particles could survive on a chopstick and actually infect someone remains unknown.</p>



<p>The largest known clusters occurred in settings that are by now well publicized: ships (the <em>Diamond Princess</em> cruise ship and the USS <em>Teddy Roosevelt</em> aircraft carrier), food packing plants and prisons. Dormitories in Singapore, where <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-is-why-singapores-coronavirus-cases-are-growing-a-look-inside-the-dismal-living-conditions-of-migrant-workers-136959">migrant workers live in cramped conditions</a>, also saw large numbers of infections. In all of these places, people live or work in close quarters over long periods of time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img alt="worker dormitory in Singapore" class="wp-image-3088931" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/061120_ht_clusters_inline_dorm-800x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088931">Worker dormitories have had several outbreaks of COVID-19.

<p>The dataset also points to settings where one activity may be riskier than another, says Quentin Leclerc, an epidemiologist on Knight’s team who manages the database. “For example, why have we found clusters associated with one type of indoor sport, but not another?” In a cluster of <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-0633_article">112 cases stemming from Zumba classes</a> in Cheonan, South Korea, a pilates and yoga instructor from the same gym was among those infected. But that instructor did not subsequently pass the virus on to any students. High intensity sports that involve a lot of heavy breathing in confined spaces <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-indoor-high-intensity-fitness-classes">could be prime spots for transmission</a>, while lower intensity activities, like yoga, might not be as risky (<em>SN: 5/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>Only one transportation cluster — three cases on a bus — appears in the database, but that doesn’t mean the virus doesn’t spread on buses or trains. “Transport outbreaks are very difficult to identify,” says Yuguo Li, an engineer at the University of Hong Kong who studies infectious disease transmission.</p>



<p>Of course there could be other possible transmission settings that researchers don’t know about or haven’t been able to study. But the case clusters below might offer some useful insights.</p>



<h4>A restaurant with poor ventilation</h4>



<p>A cautionary tale of poor ventilation comes from Guangzhou, China, on the eve of Lunar New Year. A 63-year-old woman and her family walked into a crowded restaurant for lunch, after returning from Wuhan the day before. That same day she developed a fever and cough; she later tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>



<p>Of the 89 other customers who visited the restaurant that day, 10 fell ill with COVID-19, including the woman and four members of her family. Patients are most contagious <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear">around the time their symptoms emerge</a>, so this woman was most likely the index case — the first person in the cluster to become infected.</p>



<p>The five other infections occurred in families seated at the tables on either side of hers, less than three feet away. Security footage shows that the three families didn’t interact or touch the same objects. The droplets the woman produced as she chatted with her family were unlikely to reach the other tables on their own. So the virus probably <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article">got some help from the air conditioning unit blowing directly over the row of three tables</a>, researchers from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention report in the July <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>The restaurant had no windows. The only source of outside air was an exhaust fan in a bathroom. The air conditioning unit only recirculated indoor air, blowing the woman’s respiratory droplets to the nearby tables. With very little fresh air coming in, the concentration of droplets would get higher and higher, says Yan Chen, an engineer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>In the zone</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image" data-amp-lightbox="true"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3088942" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/061120_ht_clusters_inline_airflow_REV-450x450.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3088942">Y. Li et al/medRxiv 2020</span></figure></div>



<p>In the Guangzhou restaurant illustrated here, one sick patron infected nine others. Air conditioning units cooled different zones, and one unit blew directly over the three tables where COVID-19 cases arose. The woman believed to be the index case (magenta, just left of center at top of image) was seated with her family at the middle table. Air flowing from the air conditioning unit may have blown her respiratory droplets over to the table farthest from the AC unit. The air then bounced off the wall and brought those droplets back in the direction of the table on the other side, next to the AC unit.</p>



<p>In this computer simulation based on trace gas tests conducted at the restaurant, droplets (turquoise) congregate in the air around the three tables due to the airflow from the air conditioning unit and poor ventilation in the room. The red figures represent the other people who fell ill with COVID-19 after eating at the restaurant at the same time.</p>



<p></p>
</div>



<p>When the restaurant was empty during lockdown, Li and his colleagues tested the theory with a few human volunteers, some mannequins and harmless gas droplets to trace and simulate the spread. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067728v1.full.pdf">Their preliminary simulations</a>, posted online April 22 at medRxiv.org, show that the air conditioning flow in the room could have created a bubble of small droplets around the three tables, and that there was an exceptionally low amount of fresh air in the room. That’s where the blame for infection lies, Li’s team argues. With more fresh air in the mix, droplet concentration would probably have been lower.</p>



<h4>Long work shifts at close proximity</h4>



<p>A case cluster in a South Korean call center provides an example of how COVID-19 can emerge in a bustling open-office setting — and how to intervene and stop transmission.</p>



<p>The call center in downtown Seoul occupies four floors in a 19-story building that has commercial offices and residences. When almost all of building users — 1,143 people — were tested, 97 were positive for SARS-CoV-2; <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article">94 of them worked in call center offices on the 11th floor</a>, researchers report in the August <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>Employees sat side by side, talking on the phone for long shifts. Because a striking majority of cases were concentrated in a single open work area on one side of the building, researchers suspect that prolonged proximity, rather than, say, touching the same elevator button drove the spread.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Crowded call center</h3>



<p>Most of the 97 COVID-19 cases in a mixed residential and commercial building in downtown Seoul, South Korea, were concentrated on the 11th floor. There, 94 call center employees tested positive for COVID-19 (workstations of people who got infected shown in blue), most of them concentrated on one side of the building.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3088930" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/061120_ht_clusters_inline_call-center.jpg" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3088930">S. Park <em>et al</em>/<em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> 2020</span></figure>
</div>



<p>At the call center, the Korean CDC was extremely thorough in its attempts to find cases and stop their spread, testing 99.8 percent of the people who had any contact with the building and quickly isolating all positive cases. Beyond the building, investigators tracked 225 household contacts of those positive cases, and 34 tested positive. Through this intense screening process, the agency cut transmission chains and prevented new cases from emerging. “It shows how intervention can work,” says Werner Bischoff, an epidemiologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p>



<h4>Sharing more than memories</h4>



<p>A sobering warning about the importance of social distancing comes from a family in Irbid, Jordan, about 60 miles north of Amman. Defying a local ban on large gatherings, the family held a wedding celebration in March. Of the roughly 360 people who attended, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-1469_article">76 tested positive for the coronavirus</a> in the four weeks that followed, researchers report in the September <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>

<p>Two days before the ceremony the bride’s 58-year-old father, who had traveled from Spain, felt feverish and developed a runny nose and cough. He tested positive for the coronavirus two days after the wedding.</p>



<p>Though he did not recall having contact with anyone who had COVID-19 in Spain, scientists believe he sparked the cluster. In Jordan, it’s common for the bride’s family to greet all of the guests at the reception entrance, usually with a hug or a kiss. “These factors, in addition to crowded dancing and close face-to-face communication, likely contributed to the large number of infections from this wedding,” the researchers write.</p>



<h4>Lockdown exit strategies</h4>



<p>Some unknown variables — like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-can-fabric-cloth-masks-stem-coronavirus-spread">effectiveness of fabric masks</a> and the degree to which infected people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-case-coronavirus-spread-person-no-symptoms-found-germany">without symptoms</a> spread the virus — could influence the risk equation for coronavirus in any of these and other settings.</p>



<p>As restrictions lift, people will have to make tough choices about in-person interactions. Social distancing is still important. You might limit your contacts, but other people you encounter might not. As restrictions ease, some <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/new-zealand-quarantine-bubble-concept-america.html">public health officials</a> suggest creating <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/09/1001547/coronavirus-bubble-pod-quaranteam-social-distancing-negotiation/">COVID-19 “bubbles,”</a> or expanding social circles to people who agree to observe the same precautionary measures.</p>

<p>Restaurants and workplaces can take steps when they reopen to try to limit transmission, as some have already done. Installing plexiglass barriers between tables and improving ventilation by opening windows, serving customers outside, turning on exhaust fans and using HEPA filters could help lower transmission risk. Keeping tables or desks at least six feet apart is also a good idea. The CDC has released <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html">reopening guidelines</a> for everything from restaurants to water parks.</p>



<p>Whether more outdoor cases will emerge as temperatures rise and people spend more time outside is an open question. Fresh air and sunlight could limit cases in outdoor settings, or clusters could emerge in newly opened outdoor settings, such as swimming pools or summer camps. Data on how the virus behaves in summer just don’t exist yet.</p>



<p>If South Korea’s thwarted first attempt at loosening restrictions has taught us anything, it’s that reopening and lifting social distancing practices comes with one certainty: New COVID-19 infections will happen. Hugs and high-fives are still a long way off. “This isn’t a marathon,” Noymer says. “It’s a 26.2-mile sprint.”</p>

<p>Jets of high-energy plasma shooting
away from supermassive black holes resemble bell-bottom pants — starting out
narrow but ending with a flare. The shape can help astrophysicists <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/495/4/3576/5825365">tease out how such jets are launched and reveal
details of their black holes</a>,
researchers report in the July <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
Society</em>.</p>



<p>“From studying this region
where the geometric transition happens, we can understand the black hole better,”
says astrophysicist Yuri Kovalev of the Lebedev Physical Institute of the
Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.</p>



<p>Most galaxies in the
universe host supermassive black holes at the center. Some of those black holes
are actively eating a surrounding white-hot disk of gas and dust, and shooting twin
jets of high-energy particles many light-years into space. Those black holes and
their disks are called active galactic nuclei, or AGN, and are among the
brightest objects in the cosmos. Astronomers can see the glow from many billions
of light-years away.</p>



<p>For a long time, observations
of these jets suggested they had a cone shape, with particles shooting out from
the black holes in a straight-legged V. But in the past decade or so, closer
looks have shown that some jets start out with a parabolic shape, meaning the
sides are slightly curved.</p>





<p>In 2012, astrophysicists
reported that a jet launched from nearby galaxy M87 — whose black hole became <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the first to have its picture taken in 2017</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>) —  <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/745/2/L28">starts out parabolic and shifts to cone-shaped</a> at a certain distance. A jet from a second AGN was spotted with a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aac49f">similar flare-legged shape</a> in 2018.</p>



<p>Kovalev and his colleagues
wondered if these two galaxies were special somehow, or if bell-bottom jets
were common features of AGN. The researchers looked at published observations
of 367 AGN throughout the cosmos, spanning more than 20 years. Then the team
wrote a computer algorithm to search available images for changes in the jets’
shapes. </p>



<p>Out of that sample, just 10
jets had the shape of flared pants. But surprisingly, all of them were
extremely close to Earth, within a billion light-years. “This cannot happen
accidentally,” Kovalev says. He expects the other AGN jets would also show bell-bottom
legs if astronomers could look with higher-resolution telescopes.</p>



<p>“This transition is a common
effect in jets of AGN. We have discovered that this is absolutely typical,” Kovalev
says.</p>



<p>Masanori Nakamura, who
reported M87’s bell-bottom jets and is now at Japan’s National Institute of
Technology in Hachinohe City, thinks that’s a reasonable conclusion. “There is
growing consensus that AGN jets may follow such similar evolution,” from
parabola to cone shapes, he says. Expanding the collection of known flare-legged
jets “is a significant step.” </p>



<p>The shape shift could have
to do with how jets are launched from black holes in the first place. Astrophysicists
think magnetic fields in the disk around the black hole accelerate the jet particles
outward. The material of intergalactic space surrounding the jet also exerts a
pressure, keeping the particles bound in a tight column.</p>



<p>But at a certain distance
from the black hole, the magnetic fields and the outside pressure stop holding
such a big influence over the jet. The particles take off in straight lines, less
pushed and less smooshed.</p>



<p>That distance is exactly where the flare appears in the jets, Kovalev and colleagues report. “It’s not a coincidence at all,” Kovalev says. Future observations with more powerful telescopes can help confirm whether more distant quasars are also stuck in the ’70s.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unexpected-result-dark-matter-experiment-new-particles">An unexpected result from a dark matter experiment may signal new particles</a></h4>

<p>An experiment searching for cosmic dark matter may have finally detected something. But it’s not dark matter.</p>



<p>Scientists with the XENON1T experiment reported data June 17 showing an unexpectedly large number of blips within their detector. “We observe an excess … and we don’t know what it is,” said physicist Evan Shockley of the University of Chicago, who described the result <a href="https://efi.uchicago.edu/events/event/1361/">during a virtual seminar</a>.</p>



<p>The blips could be explained by <a href="https://www.science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/xenon1tlowersearches.pdf">weird new particles called solar axions</a>, or unexpected magnetic properties for certain known particles, neutrinos, the researchers propose.</p>



<p>Or the excess might instead be the result of a more banal scenario: A tiny amount of radioactive tritium could have found its way into the detector. None of the possibilities would explain the nature of dark matter, an unseen substance in the universe that helps stars cling to their galaxies and explains how structures formed in the early universe.</p>





<p>The XENON1T detector, located deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, searched for interactions of dark matter particles within a large vessel filled with liquid xenon, running from 2016 to 2018. Until now, the researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-particles-elude-scientists-biggest-search-wimps">come up empty</a> (<em>SN: 5/28/18</em>). But in the newest analysis of the data, they saw something unexpected. When looking for signs of electrons recoiling as other particles slammed into them, the team observed extra recoils of electrons at low energies, well beyond the number predicted by standard physics. Normal particle interactions should have produced around 232 electron recoils at low energy, but the researchers saw 285 — an excess of 53.</p>





<p>“That’s exciting,” says theoretical physicist Dan Hooper of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. “But sadly, I think it gets a little less exciting when you dig into it.” That’s because the most interesting explanations seem to be mostly ruled out by other types of measurements.</p>



<p>The XENON1T team suggested that the low-energy events could be due to solar axions, hypothetical particles with no electric charge that could be produced in the sun. But if those particles exist, they would also stream out from other stars, taking energy with them and causing the stars to cool off faster than observations suggest.</p>



<p>Another possible explanation for the extra events is impact from lightweight particles called neutrinos. If neutrinos have a magnetic moment — meaning that they act like tiny magnets — the particles would interact more strongly with electrons, resulting in more recoils. That explanation, likewise, is difficult to reconcile with what scientists observe in the cosmos, including how dead stars called white dwarfs cool.</p>



<p>For either of those proposed explanations to work, there would have to be something not fully understood about the previous stellar-cooling observations. And neither possibility would explain the existence of dark matter. While other varieties of axions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-mysterious-dark-matter-underdogs-steps">could make up dark matter</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/18</em>), XENON1T can detect only solar axions that would be too massive to fill that role. However, the existence of solar axions would help explain another long-standing puzzle of physics: why one force of nature, called the strong nuclear force, obeys a rule known as CP symmetry, unlike other interactions.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the detector might contain a minute amount of tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen with two neutrons in its nucleus. That tritium could have been trapped within the materials that make up the detector, and may have slowly leaked out. When tritium atoms decay, they emit electrons, which could be responsible for the signature seen by XENON1T. This explanation wouldn’t reveal anything new about the universe, but it would be the first time that a detector of this type was sensitive enough to spot such tiny amounts of tritium.</p>



<p>For dark matter experiments that are searching for extremely feeble signatures, even that would be a step forward, Hooper says. “This is kind of what progress looks like.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-newgrange-passage-tomb-ancient-royal-incest">DNA from a 5,200-year-old Irish tomb hints at ancient royal incest</a></h4>

<p>A man buried in a huge, roughly 5,200-year-old Irish stone tomb was the product of incest, a new study finds.</p>



<p>DNA extracted from the ancient man’s remains displays <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2378-6">an unusually large number of identical versions of the same genes</a>. That pattern indicates that his parents were either a brother and sister or a parent and child, a team led by geneticists Lara Cassidy and Daniel Bradley of Trinity College Dublin reports June 17 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>That new DNA discovery combined with the monumental tomb suggests that ruling families who wielded enough power to direct big building projects emerged among some early European farming communities, the researchers contend.</p>



<p>The man’s bones had previously been found in the Newgrange passage tomb, an earthen mound covering more than 4,000 square meters near the River Boyne. A rooftop opening in a 19-meter-long stone passage allows sunlight to reach deep into a chamber inside the mound on the shortest days of the year, suggesting the structure held <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/winter-sunrise-newgrange">astrological and religious significance</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/74</em>). It may have been built this way to mark a new year in dramatic fashion, perhaps while winter solstice ceremonies were conducted.</p>



<p>Cassidy and Bradley’s team studied DNA from 44 individuals buried in various Irish tombs and graves dating to between roughly 6,600 and 4,500 years ago. Only the Newgrange man, who was interred in the largest and most impressive structure, had inherited genetic markers of incest.</p>



<p>Socially sanctioned incest tends to be rare throughout history but is known from instances of royal inbreeding. Mating between brothers and sisters, for example, occurred in some ancient societies with ruling families headed by men regarded as gods not subject to human incest taboos. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185393">Ancient Egypt’s King Tutankhamun</a>, whose rule began 3,352 years ago, was the son of a brother and sister. So finding the offspring of inbreeding in such an impressive stone structure is highly suggestive of a practice of inbreeding among elites, even if not conclusive, the researchers say.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Whether we’re learning a new language, prepping for a job interview or simply trying to remember what we went into the kitchen for, many of us are keen to cultivate a better memory. And often strategies that add an element of effort or difficulty can help: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/22/the-act-of-drawing-something-has-a-massive-benefit-for-memory-compared-with-writing-it-down/">drawing things</a> rather than writing them down, for example, or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/10/these-two-revision-strategies-can-prepare-you-for-an-exam-much-better-than-just-restudying-your-notes/">generating questions</a> about study material rather than simply reading it.</p>
<p>So in 2018, there was much fanfare when a team from Australia’s RMIT University developed a difficult-to-read font, <a href="https://sansforgetica.rmit/">Sans Forgetica</a>, that they said could boost memory through such a “desirable difficulty”.</p>
<p>But new <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658211.2020.1758726?journalCode=pmem20">research</a> in <em>Memory</em> from Andrea Taylor and colleagues from the University of Warwick and the University of Waikato, New Zealand, has put the font to the test — and found little evidence that it actually improves our memory.<span id="more-39791"></span></p>
<p>Sans Forgetica was developed by a team of psychologists, marketers and graphic designers to create a feeling of “disfluency”. The font appears slanted and broken up, and, they claimed, this obstruction forces readers to process the information more deeply, promoting learning at the same time. Though previous research <em>had</em> suggested that disfluency can promote learning, there was mixed evidence on whether it was possible to create this effect with a font. The group of researchers behind Sans Forgetica believed that it was. Their results were never published, however, so the new team wanted to try and replicate those effects themselves.</p>

<p>An initial test established that Sans Forgetica is indeed more difficult to read than the standard font Arial; the team then conducted three experiments to establish whether the font had memory-boosting qualities too. First, 156 participants were shown a series of twenty word pairs, each of which was presented to them on a screen for 100 milliseconds. Each pair contained two associated words — <em>chip</em> and <em>potato</em>, for example — and half of the pairs were presented in Sans Forgetica and half in Arial.</p>
<p>After a short break of either ten, twenty or thirty seconds, participants took part in a memory test in which the first word of a pair was presented — their job was to type the second word. This test was presented in Times New Roman.</p>
<p>The results suggested that words written in Sans Forgetica were not more memorable: in fact, participants recalled <em>fewer</em> words that had been presented in the font than they did words presented in Arial. This was true regardless of how long the delay between tests was.</p>
<p>A second study looked at Sans Forgetica’s impact on longer, prose pieces. Three hundred participants read five educational prose passages (around 300 words long) containing some information in Sans Forgetica and some in Arial. After five minutes playing a card matching game, participants were tested on their memory of the information via multiple choice questions on the passages.</p>
<p>But despite claims that Sans Forgetica actively boosts memory, there was no difference in performance between the two fonts — participants answered 74% of questions about Sans Forgetica-printed information correctly vs 73% of Arial-printed information.</p>
<p>A final study looked at whether Sans Forgetica might have an effect on memory when people had to process information more deeply. The team asked 275 participants to read 500-word passages on different topics presented in a mix of Sans Forgetica and Arial. They were then asked to answer 12 questions designed to test their understanding of <em>concepts</em> contained in the passages, typing their understanding of a particular idea (e.g. “how does the process of gas exchange work?”) in an open-text box.</p>
<p>Again, participants’ memory for the conceptual information was no better when it had been shown in Sans Forgetica than when it had been shown in Arial: for information presented in Sans Forgetica, participants scored an average of 37.6%; in Arial, their score was 37.06%.</p>
<p>The results suggest that disfluent fonts — that is, fonts supposedly promoting desirable difficulties — aren’t actually that useful when it comes to retaining information. The team does note that individual differences, which they did not examine, could impact on the efficacy of Sans Forgetica or similar fonts. And if disfluent fonts promote <em>deep</em> learning, as their proponents claim, then an effect may also be more obvious after a longer break period — this could be a good focus of future research.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for a magic bullet to boost your memory, Sans Forgetica probably isn’t it.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about paper "Probabilistic Optimization Algorithms for Real-Coded Problems And Its Application in Latin Hypercube Problem".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm for read-coded problems called the Probabilistic Optimization Algorithm (POA). In the proposed algorithm, rather than a binary or integer, a probabilistic representation is used for the individuals. Each individual in the proposed algorithm is a probability density function and is capable of representing the entire search space simultaneously. In the search process, each solution performs as a local search and climbs the local optima, and at the same time, the interaction among the probabilistic individuals in the population offers a global search. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are studied in this paper and their effect on the search process is presented. A structured population is proposed for the algorithm and the effect of different structures is analyzed. The algorithm is used to solve Latin Hyper-cube problem and experimental studies suggest promising results. Different benchmark functions are also used to test the algorithm and results are presented. The analyses suggest that the improvement is more significant for large scale problems.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic was the elephant in the room throughout this e-Congress. Delegates sat behind their screens to view lectures and asked questions using a chatbox function. Only minor technical issues occurred, honestly to be expected in this new era of conference attendance. And while <a href="https://twitter.com/carmona_loreto/status/1268161577011773440">17,500</a> attendees connected on Day 1 of the e-Congress, the typical media channels, e.g. Twitter, appeared significantly quieter than <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/07/03/eular-2019-highlights-from-the-annual-conference/">2019’s edition</a>. Indeed, Editorial Board Members at <a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Rheumatology </em></a>remarked to me that clinical and household duties interfered with their ability to engage fully in this meeting. Good thing that all lectures and conference resources are online until 1 September 2020!</p>

<p>COVID-19 has become part of our medical reality, and the scientific programme demonstrated this. Prof <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Landewe">Robert Landewé</a>, University of Amsterdam, led an opening session on <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/05/annrheumdis-2020-217877.long">EULAR recommendations</a> related to the management of RMDs in the context of COVID-19. He noted that rheumatologists are well-placed to manage coronaviruses, given that i) they understand the immune system, ii) their medical speciality is used to treating multiple organ systems at once, and iii) rheumatologists often use the immunotherapy drugs currently being trialled in SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr Machado provided reassurance that rheumatic patients receiving immunosuppressant medications were not disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2</p></blockquote>
<p>Notable talks included <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PMMAC99">Dr Pedro Machado</a>, University College London, who <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/29/annrheumdis-2020-217871.full">reported the first findings</a> from the <a href="https://rheum-covid.org/">Global Rheumatology Alliance database</a> on the outcome of COVID-19 and impact of rheumatic disease therapy on 600 patients across 40 countries. He provided reassurance that rheumatic patients receiving immunosuppressant medications were not disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers analysed rheumatic patient data and studied potential hospitalization and course of COVID-19 infection, valuable data given its scarcity to date. The intake of glucocorticoid steroids, of anti-malarial drugs (e.g. hydroxychloroquinine), and of TNA-alpha inhibitors were associated with an increased, no change, and reduced probability of hospitalizations, respectively. Most patients with RMDs recovered from COVID-19 irrespective of their medication choice, and treatment regimens should proceed with vigilance. As this study was associative and not causative, well-designed clinical trials are needed to inform future medical practice.</p>
<p>Prof <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfJohnIsaacs">John Isaacs</a>, University of Newcastle, then talked about the <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/23.2">increased risk of rheumatic patients</a> suffering from venous thromboembolism, a blood clotting complication that can kill one third of those affected. Since these blood clots play a serious role in how COVID-19 <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003">kills</a>, new research indicates that <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/8.2">TNF-alpha inhibiting drugs</a> reduce thrombotic risk by lowering inflammation. Increased awareness of such complications and maintenance of therapies is therefore recommended in people with arthritis.</p>
<p>Even before COVID-19, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirsten_Hoeper">Dr Kristen Hoeper</a> explained that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24659148/">~50% of patients with RMDs</a> received inadequate medical care. One new study from Germany demonstrated that patient care in rheumatoid arthritis by ‘rheumatological assistants’ (i.e. specialized nurses) is just as effective as treatment by rheumatologists. Given the pressures SARS-CoV-2 is currently placing on healthcare systems, EULAR, therefore, advocates an <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/61">integrated team approach</a> comprising rheumatologists and other health care professionals in the management and psychological support of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. As telemedicine grows in parallel, the face of patient care is changing rapidly.</p>
<h3><strong>Other interesting talks</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Virtual experiences cannot truly serve as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, as the lack of physical networking opportunities is a major drawback.</p></blockquote>
<p>An increasing number of patients with osteoarthritis are taking pain-relieving opioids, such as tramadol and codeine. Recent European <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/174.1">analyses</a> found that consumption of opioids in patients has increased from 15% (2007) to 25% (2016), even when <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/58.2">anti-inflammatory drug treatment begins</a>. The <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/118.1">risk of death</a> during the first year of opioid treatments compared to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was significantly higher in another study. Calls for doctors to use these analgesics more safely is advised, given their abuse potential, and other pain control methods are encouraged.</p>
<p>The early implementation of patient and public involvement (PPI) in research, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and high-intensity exercise into rheumatology care was evident by the symposia on offer at this e-Congress. The field of rheumatology is ahead of the curve in recent years, so it may not take long until automated scoring of radiographic images and prescriptive exercise are incorporated in other clinical disciplines.</p>

<h3><strong>First thoughts on virtual conferences</strong></h3>
<p>Virtual experiences cannot truly serve as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, as the lack of physical networking opportunities is a major drawback. However, the scientific content did not significantly suffer by the switch to virtual. <a href="https://www.congress.eular.org/organising_committees.cfm">EULAR steering committee</a> should be commended for pivoting their content online and launching the <a href="https://www.eular.org/eular_virtual_research_center.cfm">Virtual Research Centre</a>, a hub to accelerate research into RMDs.</p>
<p>I personally adapted by re-connecting online with those I enjoyed meeting at EULAR 2019 and whom I was prevented from seeing this year. Others, such as <a href="https://emeunet.eular.org/">EMEUNET</a> (Emerging EUlar NETwork), hosted a networking event on the virtual world platform <a href="https://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. Behavioural adaptions such as these may be necessary in 2021, if we cannot meet in Paris for the next EULAR Congress.</p>

<p>To really understand neutrons, physicists
may have to take to space.</p>



<p>When outside the confines of an atomic nucleus,
a neutron decays into other particles in about 15 minutes on average. But exactly
how long it lives has been tough to pin down, because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-seek-neutron-lifetimes-secret">two different methods of measuring disagree</a> (<em>SN: 2/1/17</em>).
</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023316">scientists have made a third type of measurement</a>, using data from NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft.
Although the new measurement isn’t sensitive enough to resolve the discrepancy,
a future space mission could help overcome the impasse, physicists report June
11 in <em>Physical Review Research</em>. Determining
the neutron’s lifetime is essential to understanding cosmic questions like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/new-measurement-neutron-lifetime-still-puzzling">how certain elements formed after the Big Bang</a> (<em>SN: 5/9/18</em>).</p>



<p>The MESSENGER spacecraft orbited Mercury
from 2011 to 2015 and flew by Venus on the way there, taking measurements of
neutrons in the vicinity of the two planets. Neutrons are produced in reactions
set off by high-energy particles from space slamming into the planets. By
measuring how the number of neutrons detected decreased as the spacecraft got
farther from each planet, the researchers estimated how quickly those particles
were disappearing.</p>





<p>That analysis suggests a shorter
lifetime of about 13 minutes, but the large experimental uncertainty on that
figure means that it is still consistent with both previous types of
measurements. </p>



<p>MESSENGER wasn’t intended to measure the
neutron’s lifetime, so a future space mission dedicated to the task could do
much better, Jack Wilson of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel,
Md., and colleagues report. </p>



<p>“Having a third technique to break the
tie could be critically important,” Wilson says.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/feature-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Perinatal anxiety, which refers to the experience of distressing anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and up to a year after childbirth, is fairly common. In fact, research suggests under ‘normal circumstances’ around 1 in 5 women may experience significant levels of anxiety in the perinatal period. However, it seems likely that this proportion may be even higher as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and preliminary evidence we are collecting appears to support this idea.</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of perinatal anxiety, fewer than 50% of women experiencing symptoms will seek help or receive treatment (see the <a href="https://www.nct.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/hidden-half-campaign">NCT’s #hiddenhalf campaign</a> for more details). This is problematic, as research suggests that untreated perinatal anxiety may be associated with a number of long- and short-term consequences for both mother and baby, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032709001797">premature birth</a>, <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/99/9/800">excessive infant crying</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791845/">bonding issues</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-009-0109-y">developmental and mental health problems in children</a>. So it is important that we better understand, recognize, and support women who may be suffering from perinatal anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>To shed some light on this, we recently held focus groups to explore women’s experience of anxiety in the perinatal period and gain insight into their opinions of online support. While <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02990-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, was carried out before the pandemic began, some of the findings may be particularly relevant at a time when we are social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<h3><strong>Anxiety Triggers</strong></h3>
<p>The study identified a number of specific sources of anxiety for women in the perinatal period. These included:</p>
<blockquote><p>In lockdown, turning to the internet for information and online peer support may be particularly helpful.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>(1) A mismatch between mothers’ reality and their expectations of childbirth and motherhood.</em> Both social media and traditional media contain romanticized depictions of what pregnancy and having a baby should be like, which can set unrealistic expectations about motherhood and can lead women to feel anxious and like they have failed when their experiences don’t quite match up.</p>
<p>“<em>I just struggle with parenthood being completely honest. It’s like one of these things where there’s so much social media these days saying how you should be this and that. And for me that’s actually, like the biggest thing that really blocks me from thinking actually it’s OK, like this is normal.”</em></p>
<p><em> (2) Uncertainty and maternal confidence.</em> Related to point 1, many women described struggling with the adjustment to motherhood. In line with a plethora of research that shows a significant link between anxiety symptoms and feelings of uncertainty, women in this study found the unknowns of pregnancy and motherhood to be particularly anxiety-provoking. They felt generally underprepared which often translated into a lack of maternal confidence and feeling like they weren’t doing it ‘right.’ This uncertainty stemmed from a general lack of experience with and knowledge about key aspects of motherhood, from giving birth to changing nappies and feeding.</p>
<p><em>“That’s actually why people then struggle. I suppose we all go through our lives being good at a lot of things. You’ve established a career, you’ve established yourself, you’ve got qualifications. And then suddenly… this baby arrives and you’re not good at anything.”</em></p>
<p><em>(3) A lack of support. </em>Most women a spoke about motherhood being isolating at times, which was a large source of distress. Those who were far away from friends and family felt this was a particular source of anxiety. This may be of particular concern under lockdown, especially as most women in our study highlighted that their peers were the single most important source of support in the perinatal period.</p>
<p><em>(4) Mental health literacy.</em> A lack of recognition and knowledge about perinatal anxiety itself also contributed to anxiety symptoms, as women often didn’t know what was wrong with them. While many were able to find information about postnatal depression, few identified information about the anxious symptoms they were experiencing, which led them to feel distressed, confused, and increasingly anxious. This lack of knowledge and uncertainly about their situation acted as both a barrier to seeking support and as a trigger for spiraling anxiety.</p>
<h3><strong><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11960 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/iStock-471401853-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Online Support</strong></h3>
<p>One of the key aims of the study was to explore women’s opinions of existing and potential online strategies for supporting perinatal anxiety.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, women in the study thought the Internet could be a valuable source of support for women experiencing perinatal anxiety. Specifically, they felt that being able to access unbiased evidence-based information about parenthood and anxiety itself could alleviate some of the uncertainty that underlay their anxiety symptoms. However, they were generally unable to find information on perinatal anxiety specifically. To address this, we have now developed an open-access website that provides evidence-based information explicitly about perinatal anxiety. Visit <a href="https://www.openpaws.co.uk/">Open P.A.W.S.</a> for access to more information, screening tools, self-help guides, and exercises.</p>
<p>Furthermore, women were able to use the internet to access peer support, which also had the power to breakdown idealized notions of motherhood. While our research suggests using large forums (such as Mumsnet/Netmums) may be more anxiety-provoking than relieving, many mums found smaller targeted groups really helpful. These offered an opportunity to form virtual relationships with mothers in the same position as themselves, and hear more realistic stories of parenthood which could normalize their own experiences.</p>
<p><em>“So we just post whatever’s going on. So if you’re having a really naff day you’ll say Jesus Christ, the kids have done this, this and this. And someone goes oh tell me about it. And it’s just somebody, like, who’s feeling the same thing as you, so it’s not completely like… all the social media where it’s this perfect mum… it’s well I’m here with cereal stuck in my hair and it’s two o’clock in the afternoon. So at least with that it was other normal mums that were just like yeah, I’m doing the same thing as you. So you didn’t feel so alone.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Isolation and lockdown</strong></h3>
<p>In lockdown, when feelings of isolation are likely to further exacerbate anxiety symptoms, turning to the internet for information and online peer support may be particularly helpful. Finding reliable, realistic sources of information about perinatal anxiety (such as OpenPAWS) and targeted peer support (such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1732740973652517">The Perinatal Mental Health International Online Peer Support Group</a>) is likely to be particularly beneficial in alleviating symptoms of anxiety during this time.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-dexamethasone-reduce-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths">The steroid dexamethasone is the first drug shown to reduce COVID-19 deaths</a></h4>

<p>A low-cost steroid may save the lives of some people who are on ventilators or supplemental oxygen because of COVID-19, preliminary data from a large clinical trial suggest.</p>



<p>Dexamethasone, a steroid in use for decades, <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19">reduced deaths</a> of COVID-19 patients on ventilators by about a third compared with standard care, researchers reported in a news release June 16. Deaths of COVID-19 patients on supplemental oxygen were reduced by about 20 percent. Researchers found no benefit for hospitalized patients who didn’t need extra oxygen.</p>



<p>If the results hold up to scrutiny once scientists have a chance to review the full data, the drug would be the first to reduce the risk of death from the disease. For many patients who wind up in the hospital with COVID-19, “question one is, ‘Will I survive?’ and question two is ‘How long will I have to stay in hospital?’ This is the first drug that says, yes, we can increase your chances of survival,” says Martin Landray, a cardiologist at the University of Oxford. Another drug, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-supply-chain" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">remdesivir, has been shown to shorten recovery time</a> for seriously ill patients (<em>SN: 5/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>The new finding was based on outcomes of 2,104 patients taking 6 milligrams of dexamethasone once a day for 10 days either as a tablet or by intravenous injection and 4,321 people not taking the drug. The study was stopped early once a steering committee felt enough patients had been enrolled in this segment of the study to determine whether the drug worked or not. Landray and colleagues discovered that taking dexamethasone could prevent one death for every eight patients on ventilation, and one death for every 25 patients needing extra oxygen.</p>





<p>“It’s not a fix. It’s not a cure. It’s not a miracle, but it is really, really useful,” Landray says. He expects doctors around the world will embrace the therapy. He says that the United Kingdom’s National Health Service may soon declare dexamethasone the standard treatment for people on ventilators because of COVID-19.</p>



<p>“These are potentially very exciting data,” says Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious diseases doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. He has helped write COVID-19 treatment guidelines for the U.S. National Institutes of Health and for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, but says he will wait until he sees the full report to decide whether the results warrant changing treatment of severely ill patients. “Right now we have very limited information, but if it’s borne out it could be really exciting.”</p>



<p>Although the results are important for treating the sickest patients with COVID-19, those patients represent only about 5 percent of people diagnosed with the coronavirus, Gandhi says. “It’s not steroids for all.”</p>



<p>For the majority of patients, the drug probably would not do any good and may even do harm. Dexamethasone and other steroids dampen the immune system’s response to invading organisms, and have been shown to make viral infections, such as influenza and SARS worse. Researchers thought that if steroids worsened SARS, it might do the same for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Treatment guidelines suggest doctors not use steroids against the novel coronavirus.</p>

<p>The way the results were released has some scientists worried that they may not hold up. “We’ve all seen preprints and press releases about other potential therapies that have not borne out to be true,” says Brian Garibaldi, director of the biocontainment unit at Johns Hopkins Medicine.</p>



<p>Landray says he understands the criticism, but felt it was important to “get the results out into the public domain so that they’re no longer my little secrets, the world at large can see them and make their decisions.”</p>



<p>He and colleagues are writing a scientific paper with more details, but it will take time for the study to be reviewed and published. Meanwhile, he says, “the drug is already sitting in hospitals now — it doesn’t cost much money and the benefits are really obvious — and it can be used worldwide and you’re in the middle of a pandemic.”</p>



<p>Garibaldi says he’s hopeful that the results will hold up. “Certainly to have something that would reduce mortality would be a game changer,” he says, but doctors are unlikely to alter treatments for their patients based on the limited data presented. “When I go into the ICU next week, I don’t plan on using dexamethasone unless I can see the data and we can discuss it as a critical care community.”</p>

Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction<div id="content"><p>Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.quantlib.org/">QuantLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine">Open Source Risk Engine</a> (ORE), <a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system">libbitcoin</a>and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgc99cdfe"><h2 id="orgc99cdfe">About</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc99cdfe"><p>Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a <i>deep understanding</i>of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: <i>wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen</i><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup>. The situation <i>had</i> to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2">2</a></sup> to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">other complex domains</a>, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for <i>in vivo</i>communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. </p> <p>So that's that for the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. But, just <i>what</i> exactly are we researching? </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org038ff83"><h3 id="org038ff83">Scope</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org038ff83"><p>These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain "trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS" - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, <i>especially</i> when we lack competence to do so<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours "Computational Finance". Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/">Wolfram's writings</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. </p> <p>I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. </p></blockquote> <p>These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, <i>everything is interconnected with everything else</i>, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let <i>taste</i> be my guide<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are "intuitive" boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd3a5007"><h3 id="orgd3a5007">Structure</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3a5007"><p>An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. </p>  <p>Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org81de0c9"><h3 id="org81de0c9">Audience</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81de0c9"><p>The target audience for this material is the fabled <i>homo developus</i>, that non-existent "standard developer" - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the "finance" part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content <i>very</i> slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those <i>not in the know</i>, so slowness is unavoidable<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. </p> <p>With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. </p> <p>In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets "plain" software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance <i>or</i> mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04a295b"><h3 id="org04a295b">Mathematics</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a295b"><p>Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering <i>application</i>perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. </p> <p>Our core belief is that an <i>average reader</i> (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of <i>how things work</i> just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/">Experimental Mathematics</a>. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in <a href="https://codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix</a>, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3d4740f"><h3 id="org3d4740f">Cryptos</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d4740f"><p>Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i>. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as <i>cryptos</i>, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the "real" world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - <i>i.e.</i>, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs <i>vast amounts of data of the right kind</i>. Lets elaborate further on this point. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7" id="fnr.7">7</a></sup>. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a <i>simulated world</i> - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate <i>all</i> of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for "immersive" exploration. In fact, the <i>very processes for data generation</i> will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. </p> <p>Of course, generated data is not perfect - <i>i.e.</i>, <i>realistic</i> it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can <i>assume</i> the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos <i>as if they were regular currencies</i>, except where they are just <i>too different</i> - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org92cf76f"><h3 id="org92cf76f">Non Goals</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92cf76f"><p>If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-titan-flat-spots-may-be-ancient-lake-bed-floors">Flat spots on Saturn’s moon Titan may be the floors of ancient lake beds</a></h4>

<p>Peculiar flat regions on Saturn’s moon Titan could be the dry floors of ancient lakes and seas. The suggestion, published June 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, may <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16663-1">solve a 20-year-old mystery</a>.</p>



<p>Starting in 2000, astronomers using radio telescopes on Earth have seen particularly bright radio signals coming from Titan’s equator. Those signals, called specular reflections, occur when electromagnetic waves bounce off of a flat surface at the same angle they went in, like light off a mirror.</p>



<p>The most natural explanation for the reflections was that Titan had large bodies of liquid in its equatorial tropics. When NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/cassini-mission-to-saturn">Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn</a> in 2004, it did in fact show that Titan is speckled with lakes and seas — although the liquid is ethane and methane, rather than water.</p>



<p>“Titan is still currently the only other place in the universe that we know to have liquid on its surface, just like the Earth,” says planetary scientist Jason Hofgartner of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>





<p>But the lakes and seas are concentrated near Titan’s poles, not the tropics. The regions where the specular reflections show up are bafflingly dry.</p>



<p>To solve the riddle, Hofgartner and his colleagues revisited data from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia and the Cassini spacecraft. After correcting discrepancies between the ways the various observations referred to locations on Titan, the team realized that the specular reflections all come from a few specific spots.</p>



<p>The researchers considered whether rainfall, dunes or dry lake beds could be responsible for the reflections, and found that only lake beds explain the timing and locations of the signals. It does rain on Titan, but not frequently enough to explain the reflections, and Titan’s dune fields are in the wrong spots. And the specular reflections come from two specific regions that look like other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moon-titan-hydrocarbon-lakes">empty lake basins near Titan’s poles</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>).</p>



<p>“I think it’s a compelling argument,” says planetary scientist Zibi Turtle of Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study. “It’s great to have an answer to this outstanding question and one more piece of Titan that we understand better now.”</p>



<p>Turtle is the principal investigator on NASA’s Dragonfly mission, which will <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragonfly-nasa-saturn-moon-titan">land a dronelike spacecraft on Titan</a> in 2034 (<em>SN: 6/27/19</em>). Dragonfly is not going to visit the dry lakes region near the equator, “but there’s always … comparative geology that you can do from one place to another,” she says.</p>



<p>So if the reflections come from lost lakes, where did the liquid go? One possibility is that it moved from the equator to the poles as part of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-complete-map-titan-reveals-connected-seas-and-cookie-cutter-lakes">Titan-wide methane cycle</a> (<em>SN: 12/8/17</em>). Another is that the liquid evaporated and was destroyed by sunlight striking Titan’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if both were happening,” Hofgartner says.</p>



<p>The finding could sound a note of caution for astronomers looking for exoplanets friendly to life, Hofgartner says. “The lesson is that we have to be very, very strict … when we’re trying to find, say, oceans on other planets,” he says, because evidence of oceans could easily dry up.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>As shops re-opened in the UK this week, social media users were quick to pour scorn on the hundreds of eager shoppers who queued up to get in. Yes, it’s <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/shops-reopening-coronavirus">unclear whether it was a good decision</a> to re-open businesses — but there was a certain snobbishness to many of these posts. Most of the ire was directed at those lining up outside Primark, which sells clothes at prices more affordable to those on low incomes than most other high street stores. Meanwhile, queues also formed outside high-end shops like Selfridges and Harrods — but these shoppers somehow escaped the wrath of most social media commentators.</p>
<p>This situation seems to reflect a broader inequality in how we judge other people’s purchase decisions: we’re much more willing to scrutinise — or even dictate — how people on lower incomes spend their money compared to those on higher incomes. There are countless examples of this — think of the low-income mother who is criticised for treating her children to a rare meal out, or the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/why-do-refugees-have-smartphones-syrian-woman-explains-perfectly-refugee-crisis-a7025356.html">refugee who is shamed for owning a smartphone</a>.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/03/2005475117.short">new study in <em>PNAS </em></a>provides some clues as to the origins of this bias. Across a series of 11 studies involving more than 4,000 participants, Serena Hagerty and Kate Barasz from Harvard Business School find that we tend to believe lower-income people <em>need </em>less than those on higher incomes, and that this in turn restricts our perceptions about what is acceptable for this group to buy.</p>
<p><span id="more-39782"></span>In the first couple of studies, participants read about Joe, who was described as having either a low- or high-paying job. They learned that Joe had won a $200 gift card which he spent on a flat screen TV. They then rated five statements which measured how “permissible” they thought his purchase was (e.g. “He made a responsible purchasing decision” and “He deserves to buy what he did”). Those who read that Joe had a low income rated his purchase as less permissible than those who read that he had a high income, or who were given no information about his income.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, participants read about a woman looking for a child’s car seat who ultimately chooses to buy the more expensive of two options. Again, those who read she had a low income thought her decision was less permissible than those who read she had a high income. In fact, the team observed the same pattern for a range of products: participants who rated the permissibility of 20 different goods and services, from household appliances to pet products, indicated that almost all of these were less acceptable for a lower-income person to buy.</p>
<p>So people clearly think that purchasing the very same product is often less acceptable for a low-income than high-income individual — but why is that the case? The researchers thought it could come down to people’s perceptions of the <em>needs</em> of others. So, in the next few studies, they looked at which purchases participants deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The team repeated the car seat scenario, for instance, finding that those who read that the mother was on a low income believed that the purchase was less <em>necessary</em> than those who read she was on a high income. Similarly, in another study, participants read about a low- or high-income family looking for a new house, and were asked to rate how necessary it was that the house had 20 different features, such as a garage or storage space. Of these 20 features, 17 were rated as more necessary for the high-income family. Disturbingly, these even included basic requirements like “close to hospitals” or “a neighbourhood that is safe/secure”.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that people believe low-income individuals need particular items less than high-income individuals — and further studies showed that purchases that were considered less necessary were, in turn, considered less permissible.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers demonstrated that these perceptions actually influence people’s behaviour. In one study, participants could help a hypothetical family decide what to buy. Participants who read that the family was on a low income were much less likely to allocate money to “low permissibility” products like a television than those in the high-income condition. And when deciding whether to gift a low-income individual either a $100 grocery voucher or a $200 electronics voucher, only a quarter of participants went for the latter, even though it was worth twice as much. More than half said they would give a high-income individual the electronics voucher, however. “Paradoxically, the result was that participants effectively allocated more money to higher-income people than lower-income people,” the authors note.</p>
<p>These last findings have worrying implications when it comes to thinking about charitable donations or how resources are distributed to the less fortunate, write the authors. If people hold such a narrow view of the needs of those on lower incomes, then it’s easy to see how resources could be allocated disproportionately to the most basic necessities — food and housing, say — while ignoring higher-level needs that are seen as less “permissible” — access to the internet or to recreation facilities, for instance.</p>
<p>The research could also help explain why it is so common to hear politicians and opinion writers moralising about what poorer people should and should not spend their money on, or why state provisions for those on lower incomes often barely meet the most basic standard. “In essence,” the researchers conclude, “people seem to conceptualize necessity differently for lower-income versus higher-income others, such that the “wants” of the poor evolve into the “needs” of the wealthier.”</p>

<p>Lockdowns haven’t just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-lockdowns-may-have-averted-infections">curbed coronavirus transmission</a> — they’ve also helped people get more sleep (<em>SN: 6/9/20</em>).</p>



<p>Two studies, both published June 10 in <em>Current Biology</em>, report that people began sleeping more and more regularly every night after countries imposed stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But that sleep may not have been of the best quality, one of those studies finds.</p>



<p>In one study, researchers compared <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30838-1">sleeping patterns of 139 students</a> from the University of Colorado Boulder before and after stay-at-home orders moved classes online. Students’ sleep schedules became more regular and better aligned with their body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, the team found.</p>

<p>Those students also got more sleep overall. Before lockdowns, 84 percent of students reported getting seven hours a night or more during the week — the minimum amount that the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends for adults to maintain health. After the lockdowns were in place, that number went up to 92 percent.</p>



<p>A separate study of 435 people in Austria, Switzerland and Germany found that people there <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30837-X">also reported sleeping more regularly</a> and for longer periods. That sleep, however, may have been of lower quality and included problems such as falling or staying asleep. Participants reported a reduction in their mental and physical health during COVID-19 lockdowns, which was associated with lower-quality sleep.</p>



<p>Worse sleep, despite spending more time in bed, may have outweighed any benefits from a regular sleep schedule, the authors of this study say. But getting outside in natural sunlight and exercising could help improve sleep quality.</p>

A mixed-methods study</a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11942 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Cancer-treatment-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Trial participation has not been found to provide better outcomes for cancer patients than standard care. With nearly <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer">one in six deaths estimated to be due to cancer</a>, interest in innovative cancer research and treatment breakthroughs is high. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12937">previous study</a> showed that the information given to cancer trial participants and their physicians can be misleading, with information heavily focused on positive outcomes, with little information on the possible adverse effects or disadvantages of taking part. This can blur the boundaries between treatment and research, resulting in the belief that the best treatment for cancer provided within the context of a clinical trial. Through interviews and a systematic review of the literature, Nielsen <em>et al</em>. explored how physicians and nurses perceived the benefits of clinical trial participation and whether clinical trial participation provided better outcomes for cancer patients. Interviews revealed that there is a widespread belief amongst nurses and physicians that treatment for cancer, in the context of a clinical trial, is better than standard care. Many believed that recruiting patients to trials is a way to give them access to cutting-edge treatment. A search of the literature found no support for the belief that treatment in clinical trials is superior to standard care, despite rapid developments in cancer treatment in recent years. Lack of trial reporting transparency was also said to contribute to the belief that participating in trials is associated with better outcomes. Patient information sheets for cancer clinical trials should be designed to be free of suggestions that trial participation is the best treatment option for cancer patients. The focus should be shifted to encourage trial participation to further knowledge, to the potential benefit of future patients.</p>

<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11945 alignright" height="194" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Renewable-Energy-300x194.jpg" width="300" />
<p>High renewable power system scenarios coupled with low levels of negative emissions technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, could deliver a net-negative European power system by 2050. Decarbonizing electricity generation is key to achieving the <a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf">Paris Climate Agreement</a> for limiting average global temperature rise to ‘well below 2°C’ above pre-industrial levels. Gaffney <em>et al.</em> modeled emissions reduction, technical operation, and system costs for the year 2050. The analysis was designed to also include short time windows, to gain insights into the impact of high levels of variable renewable energy sources. It was demonstrated that high renewable power systems, coupled with negative emissions technologies, such as biomass carbon capture and storage, can deliver a net-negative European power system at lower costs, without breaching published sustainable biomass and geological storage potentials in Europe, with the opportunity to contribute to power system inertia. This study offers a first step in the comparison of future decarbonization scenarios and highlights concerns with system operation, economics, and emissions reduction, at a European scale.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11946 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Nurse-Triage-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Nurses, using computerized decision support systems, performed better on a large number of health-related items than GPs, in telephone triage. Out-of-hours primary care services are increasing in a number of regions around the globe. Telephone triage is instrumental in the management of patient flow and workload. However, ensuring triage services are safe and efficient remains a challenge. Some countries, such as Denmark, use GPs to primarily perform triage services. However, this is hotly debated since many countries report increasing shortages of GPs, and GPs have self-reported high stress and burn-out symptoms. Graverson <em>et al.</em> studied a random sample of audio-recorded telephone triage calls from Danish out-of-hours primary care services triaged by GPs, nurses using computerized decision support systems, or physicians with different medical specialties. Nurses using computerized decision support systems performed better than GPs in telephone triage on a large number of health-related items, had lower levels of undertriage but were perceived less efficient. Nurse-led triage offers a solution for high GP workload seems feasible, but further research is needed since fewer GPs may be required for telephone triage services, but more GPs may be needed to meet out-of-hours service demand.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11943 alignright" height="202" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Grass-Yellow-Butterfly-300x202.jpg" width="300" />A multiplex PCR method has been found to accurately and reliably distinguish between closely related species of butterflies. In insects, closely related species are often difficult or impossible to distinguish solely by morphological traits alone. Existing techniques, such as using mitochondrial DNA markers, are not always available for species with complex genomic histories. Miyata <em>et al.</em> developed a multiplex PCR method to amplify and distinguish the sequences of  the triose phosphate isomerase (<em>Tpi</em>) gene of two species of Japanese grass yellow butterflies (<em>Eurema mandarina</em> and <em>Eurema hecabe</em>). The method designed was found to easily, reliably, and cost-effectively distinguish between two species of butterfly. The <em>Tpi</em> gene sequences were found to be sufficiently variable to differentiate different species but invariable enough to allow designing primers within species. The <em>Tpi</em> gene offers a potential target for marker development of multiplex PCR to distinguish other closely related butterfly species when other approaches are unavailable.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11944 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Post-operative-veterinary-care-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Route of administration has been found to influence the analgesic efficiency of buprenorphine in dogs. Buprenorphine is used for postoperative pain management in cats and dogs, for example, in routine spays, known clinically as ovariohysterectomies. Previous studies have described the pharmacokinetics of the drug, however, the pharmacodynamics effect of this drug has not been consistently reported in these studies, which is important for understanding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the drug in companion animals. Steagall <em>et al.</em> randomized dogs in a masked clinical trial to either receive buprenorphine intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously before ovariohysterectomy and pain was scored with the Glasgow composite pain scale for dogs. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out on the dog’s blood samples. Subcutaneous administration of buprenorphine failed to provide sufficient analgesia due to erratic drug absorption. Dogs in this group received the highest amount of rescue pain relief compared to dogs that received buprenorphine intravenously or intramuscularly. At the doses administered, intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration are preferred for postoperative buprenorphine analgesia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/barn-owlets-share-food-younger-siblings-exchange-grooming">Barn owlets share food with their younger siblings in exchange for grooming</a></h4>

<p>If ever there were a competition to rank
sibling relationships in the animal kingdom, barn owls would be close to the
top. That’s because elder barn owlets will sometimes give away their meal to
their younger siblings. Such cooperative behavior
has been reported in adult <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chimps-lend-hand">nonhuman primates</a> and birds, but rarely
among young (<em>SN: 2/6/12</em>). </p>



<p>“I don’t know any other species where you can find it,” says Pauline Ducouret, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. But scientists weren’t sure what prompted the food sharing. Now, observations of nests show that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/709106">elder barn owlets offer their food to their younger siblings</a> in exchange for grooming, Ducouret and her colleagues report in the July issue of the <em>American Naturalist</em>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/old-barn-owls-arent-hard-hearing">Barn owls</a> (<em>Tyto alba</em>) raise six chicks at once, on average, and sometimes as many as nine (<em>SN: 9/19/17</em>). But not all chicks hatch at the same time, which means that elder chicks are usually healthier and larger than their younger brothers and sisters.</p>



<p>That’s because all chicks
are entirely dependent on the parents for food, and food, in this case, is
usually a small rodent, like a vole or a shrew, that can’t be easily split. So
at any given visit, mom or dad can feed only one chick at a time. In many bird
species, the eldest siblings would simply outcompete the rest, but not barn
owls.</p>





<p>To
understand the seeming generosity of the elder birds, Ducouret and her team
observed 27 broods of barn owls across the Switzerland countryside. The
scientists videotaped each brood for two consecutive days and nights to
understand how the owlets interacted and attached a tiny microphone backpack to
each chick to help identify individual calls.</p>



<p>The team found that older
chicks preferentially shared food with the younger siblings that extensively
groomed them. And younger owlets, in general, groomed elder siblings more often
than the older ones groomed the youngsters, “perhaps to maximize the
probability of being fed in return,” the researchers write. In some cases, an
elder chick would also offer food to the neediest sibling, which called out
incessantly, irrespective of whether it groomed or not.</p>



<p>But food sharing occurred
only when the researchers provided extra food to the owlets. So it wasn’t a
case of the older chicks risking their survival to feed the youngsters. But
when there was enough food to go around, the elder siblings chose to share
instead of hoard.</p>



<p>“[It’s an] interesting
study with a large sample size and technically nice observation techniques,”
says Ronald Noë, a retired behavioral ecologist from the Netherlands who was
not part of the research. “One usually reads about competition among siblings
and even siblicide,” he says.</p>



<p>Ducouret says that this food-sharing behavior could have evolved because the elder siblings enjoy both indirect and direct benefits. Being groomed offers such immediate boons as protection against parasites like lice or fleas. Grooming could also reduce conflict and social stress among the owlets. And, by helping their genetically related younger kin survive, the elder siblings ensure that more of their genes stay in the gene pool, thus indirectly benefitting themselves in the long, evolutionary run. </p>

They are in season and make for a delicious, healthy snack. The deep red color and the aroma of the sliced berries are striking. That’s pelargonidin 3-glucoside (<strong>1</strong>) and methoxyfuraneol (<strong>2</strong>) captivating the senses. There’s gamma-decalactone (<strong>3</strong>) in those berries too. In fact, there are <a href="https://edu.rsc.org/feature/what39s-in-your-strawberries/2020275.article">hundreds of other biochemical compounds</a> naturally present in this fruit. The situation is no different for other foods like turmeric, ginger, garlic, romaine lettuce, chocolate, coffee, and even wine.</p>

<p>Some compounds found in strawberries include pelargonidin 3-glucoside (1, PubChem ID <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/443648">443648</a>), methoxyfuraneol (2, <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/53929577">53929577</a>) and gamma-decalactone (3, <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12813">12813</a>).</p>
<p>But what health effects can these compounds produce? The answers are many, of course, because the catalog of compounds in any one food is long and diverse, and testing every compound experimentally is prohibitive. However, some answers can arise from putting rigorous computational methods to the task of exploring nutrition’s “dark matter.”</p>
<p><strong>The dark matter in nutrition</strong></p>
<p>In metabolomics, this “dark matter” is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/41/12549.long">the massive amount</a> of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00179">spectral data</a> that cannot be assigned easily to known molecules. As relating to nutrition, this notion of dark matter recently has been explored in two ways. First, there are <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/usda-nutrient-data-laboratory">efforts</a> to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/bax044/3867710">expand</a> the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/">catalogs</a> of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-019-0005-1">compounds</a> present in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814619314001">raw</a>, fermented, processed, stored, and metabolized food. With this foundation, the second exploratory step is naturally to identify the biological functions of each compound. To make progress in step two, we elected to use the well-characterized universe of pharmaceutical compounds as an anchor to predictions about food compounds. Specifically, we asked the question: “Can we predict biological function of a compound by identifying structurally similar pharmacological agents?” And so, the design and coding of PhyteByte began.</p>
<p><strong>What PhyteByte does</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>PhyteByte is software built to predict biological effects of food compounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>PhyteByte is software built to predict biological effects of food compounds. The implementation is simple: the end-user inputs a protein target, and PhyteByte identifies food compounds with a relatively high likelihood of interacting with the target, thus predicting biological effects. PhyteByte leverages a random forest classifier to perform much of the heavy lifting. This model is trained to identify pharmaceutical compounds from databases like <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">ChEMBL</a>. Compounds are <a href="http://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Features/Fingerprints.html">encoded</a> as “fingerprints” – simple bit vectors that store complex cheminformatics sub-structure information. Our model learns the sub-structures that it is looking for – for a given target – and generalizes this to identify novel food compounds in our test dataset.</p>
<p>Importantly, PhyteByte is a prediction tool. Its output is a list of molecules and their source foods that are very likely to have specific biological effects, but it is not a tool to devise a meal plan or provide for dietary recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>The road ahead for computational nutrition</strong></p>
<p>PhyteByte is just one of numerous examples of new computational methods – like complex systems theory and machine learning – being layered atop genomics, metabolomics, and genetics data in nutrition research. In fact, one can make the point that computational nutrition is merely the natural offspring of the nutrition-omics marriage.</p>
<p>Computational nutrition likely will develop in several ways. One, given a phenotype or protein of interest, foods are proposed that may affect that phenotype or protein, and done in a targeted, macronutrient-free manner. Two, more detailed epidemiological and food frequency questionnaire data can support tests for connections between certain foods and health outcomes. Here, the foods under study contain compounds that potentially offer narrowly defined health benefits based on similarity to known drugs. Three, such computationally derived pharmacological-food compound links can inform drug development. For example, drug efficacy studies could instruct volunteers to avoid specific foods that contain compounds potentially exhibiting physiological effects like the drug.</p>
<p>Importantly, while some of the above scientific endeavors have been woven into nutrition research for some time, all of what is described here requires that efforts be put forth at a much grander scale. And, for such approaches to be most effective, there must occur a concerted, broad effort to identify and accurately quantify the roughly 2000 different compounds in each food, a theme central to the emerging foodomics field.</p>

I especially am investing my time in different ways and am working mostly at home. Working from home would have been severely prohibitive for me just a few weeks ago, due to lack of access to adequate internet connectivity in the rural area where I live. However, our local electric cooperative now provides fiber optic internet that my family and I are using to our full advantage, as we engage in professional &amp; school work—and the business of family life—simultaneously.</p>

<p>Research aspects of my work suddenly became secondary to teaching responsibilities. All of my teaching switched abruptly from quality in-person experiences honed over years, to hastily contrived online substitutes cobbled together in a panic. The biggest challenge was delivery of emergency substitutes for field and laboratory coursework. Thus, I have been creating, documenting and demonstrating activities from home. This has meant <em>Drosophila</em> breeding experiments on the dining room table, seedlings in a window sill, and turning a corner of the garage into a video production set to capture animal behavior. During my unpaid summer, I will be investing significant time and effort in professional development opportunities that I hope will help me do a better job of continued, emergency, remote instruction that will be necessary in the coming academic year. In some instances, redundant planning for in-person, remote and hybrid instructional modes must be done.</p>
<p>Due to recent departures of employees and hiring freezes, I do not have the assistance of a laboratory technician or collections manager, who normally would support my teaching and research, which means I am doing that work myself, on top of usual and additional responsibilities.</p>
<p>My access to campus facilities is limited to once per week, and this is a special privilege so that I may care for the physical laboratory resources. Almost all research work on my campus has been discontinued or put on hold. The vast majority of students are prohibited from entering campus buildings, and their research in my lab has stopped.</p>
<figure><img class="alignleft" src="https://bmcserieseditors.biomedcentral.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=45/https://images.zapnito.com/uploads/9a4dfe9fafe44c3d29b43d7006b83255/48a2b8a3-f141-48f9-b8b0-45edb3e362c1.jpeg" /></figure>
<p>My research activity normally involves field work and use of specimens from institutional collections. These collections are closed, and I cannot visit them. Specimens borrowed from collections are not being used, and they have been boxed up and fill the lab benches normally occupied by students (see figure).</p>
<p>Due to certain travel restrictions, my field work has been delayed, and I was fortunate to obtain one-year extensions from grant agencies for time-sensitive aspects of these studies. However, an ongoing project at a local wildlife refuge will have at least a one-year gap.</p>
<p>My research collaborators around the globe are facing similar, if not more extreme, restrictions and challenges, not the least of which is lack of internet access. The majority of my collaborations are on hold or progressing extremely slowly. Professional meetings have been canceled or indefinitely postponed.</p>
<p>Graduate students have had to halt or delay projects. My undergraduate research students have had a variety of on-the-fly substitute projects to complete from home. In some cases, depth and breadth of study have been sacrificed so students could complete alternatives to fulfill degree requirements on time. Looking ahead, I am concerned about multiple cohorts of developing researchers worldwide who will have critical gaps in their experience and knowledge bases, due to the limitations we face.</p>
<p>Sabbatical leaves for research, including my own, have been delayed or are in question. Faculty promotion clocks have been altered and complicated. Submission of my own dossier likely will be delayed by at least one year. Our campus anticipates increased faculty teaching loads to help off-set financial impacts. We are not alone, and in fact, we may be among the fortunate.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not alone, and in fact, we may be among the fortunate.</p></blockquote>
<p>On a positive note, I’ve been able to make more rapid and substantial progress than expected on biodiversity data transcription, editing and management. Public access to important data from historical collections and literature will be available in greater quantity and sooner than expected. I may also be able to complete and submit some manuscripts that had been delayed due to now moot priorities. As an editor, I am beginning to see others have had the same opportunities. Clearly, Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on research progress and prospects for years to come, in ways we recognize and in ways we have yet to anticipate.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-canceled-emergency-use-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-coronavirus">The FDA has canceled emergency use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine no longer have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s blessing for use against coronavirus infections when given outside of a clinical trial.</p>



<p>In March, the agency authorized using the malaria drugs for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who couldn’t participate in clinical trials. But the legal criteria for issuing an emergency use authorization <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-revokes-emergency-use-authorization-chloroquine-and">are no longer met</a>, the agency said in a statement June 15.</p>





<p>The drugs are “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/138945/download">unlikely to produce an antiviral effect</a>,” Denise Hinton, the agency’s chief scientist noted in a June 15 letter of revocation.  Studies have shown that the drugs are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-hydroxychloroquine-prevention-exposure">no better than a placebo for preventing COVID-19</a> in people exposed to the coronavirus and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-evidence-hydroxychloroquine-does-not-help-treat-covid-19">don’t speed recovery</a> for those with serious illness (<em>SN: 6/4/20; SN: 4/21/20</em>). “The totality of scientific evidence currently available indicate a lack of benefit,” the agency statement said.</p>





<p>After reviewing evidence, it’s “no longer reasonable to believe that [hydroxychloroquine] and [chloroquine] may be effective in treating COVID-19,” Hinton wrote. The drugs’ risks, which can include disruptions of heart rhythms, don’t outweigh the benefits of using them, she wrote.</p>

<p>The ruling came at the request of Gary Disbrow, acting director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The agency, within the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, is tasked with evaluating vaccines, drugs and therapies to combat threats to national security and public health.</p>



<p>In addition, the FDA warned June 15 that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-warns-newly-discovered-potential-drug-interaction-may-reduce">shouldn’t be given in combination with remdesivir</a>, an antiviral drug that has been shown to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">shorten recovery</a> time from COVID-19 (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>). The malaria drugs reduced remdesivir’s antiviral activity in laboratory experiments, the agency said in a statement.</p>



<p>Hydroxychloroquine may continue to be sold in the United States for already FDA-approved purposes, such as for treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The version of chloroquine that previously was authorized for emergency use was not distributed and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/138946/download">isn’t available for use</a>. People who are hospitalized and already being treated with the drugs may continue to receive them under their doctors’ orders, and clinical trials may still go forward. Doctors also can continue to prescribe the drugs for “off label” use.</p>

<p>Australia’s
most recent wildfire season was so severe that smoke from the fires reached new
heights in the atmosphere — and showed some very weird behavior while it was up
there. </p>



<p>A
particularly intense series of bushfires in southeastern Australia from
December 29 to January 4 spurred the formation of huge <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smoke-distant-fire">pyrocumulonimbus, or pyroCb, clouds</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/10</em>). Those
fire-fueled thunderstorms launched between 300,000 and 900,000 metric tons of
smoke into the stratosphere, which was more than any seen from a previous inferno.
One especially large, long-lasting smoke plume <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088101?af=R">rose to a record altitude while spinning
and wrapping itself in rotating winds</a>.
Those winds have never been observed around similar plumes, researchers report
online May 30 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. </p>



<p>This vast
puff of smoke, which still hasn’t fully dissipated, spanned roughly 1,000
kilometers — about the width of Montana. That made it one of the largest, if
not the largest, wildfire smoke plume that satellites have ever seen in the
stratosphere, says atmospheric scientist Jessica Smith of Harvard University,
who was not involved in the study. “Any perturbation to the stratosphere has
implications for … stratospheric ozone,” which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-arctic-ozone-hole-ever-measured-hovering-over-north-pole">shields Earth from the sun’s
harmful ultraviolet radiation</a>
(<em>SN: 4/7/20</em>). </p>



<p>It
remains to be seen whether a blob of pyroCb smoke like this could leave a
chemical scar on the stratosphere. But observing the plume’s behavior may give
insight into what could happen if much more smoke — say, from a nuclear war —
were pumped into the atmosphere.</p>



<p>Mike
Fromm, a meteorologist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,
D.C., and colleagues kept tabs on the unusual pyroCb smoke plume with
satellites and weather balloons. One of the most striking things about the
plume is how high it rose, says coauthor George “Pat” Kablick III, an
atmospheric scientist also at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. In less than
two months, it was buoyed up from the lower stratosphere, about 15 kilometers
off the ground, to over 31 kilometers high.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Australia brushfire plume" class="wp-image-3088749" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/060520_mt_firecloud_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088749">A massive smoke plume was injected into the stratosphere by wildfire-driven thunderclouds in Australia around New Year 2020. Over several weeks, the plume rose to a record altitude of 31 kilometers. In a satellite image taken on January 6, the smoke (brownish-gray, center) is seen north of New Zealand (bottom left).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088749">Space Science and Engineering Center at the Univ. of Wisconsin pyroCb blog</span></figure>



<p>Dark
particles in the smoke absorbed sunlight and heated up the plume to make it
rise, Kablick explains. Atmospheric scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worst-wildfires-can-send-smoke-high-enough-affect-ozone-layer">first observed such self-lofting
behavior</a> in pyroCb
smoke from Pacific Northwest wildfires in 2017, but that smaller mass of smoke
ascended only from an initial altitude of about 13 to about 23 kilometers above
the ground (<em>SN: 8/8/19</em>). </p>



<p>The
smoke from the Australian plume largely resisted mixing with surrounding air for
months after its formation, perhaps shielded by 15-meter-per-second winds seen
whirling around the plume as it rotated, the researchers say. The team is still
trying to figure out what whipped up this newly discovered wind phenomenon. </p>





<p>As the
plume rose through the stratosphere, it lifted up unprecedented amounts of
water and carbon monoxide. The concentrations of those gases in the plume were
several hundred percent higher than normal stratospheric air and displaced the
ozone-rich air that typically makes up gas at these altitudes. </p>



<p>Lots of
sun-warmed smoke rising through the atmosphere has the potential to damage the
ozone layer not only by displacing the stratosphere’s normal, ozone-rich gas,
but also by triggering chemical reactions that destroy ozone. Future satellite
or weather balloon observations could reveal whether this plume has had any noticeable
impact on stratospheric chemistry, says Pengfei Yu, a climate scientist at
Jinan University in Guangzhou,
China who studied the 2017 plume but was not involved in the new work.  </p>



<p>Even if
this one wildfire-driven plume doesn’t leave a lasting mark on the stratosphere,
the smoke does offer clues about the fate of much larger quantities of smoke
that would result from a nuclear war, says Alan Robock, a climate scientist at
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who was part of the team that
analyzed the 2017 plume. </p>



<p>The
smoke released by Pacific Northwest wildfires in 2017 helped validate nuclear
warfare simulations, which predict that smoke from burning cities would heat up
in the stratosphere and ascend to extremely high altitudes — where it could last
for years and damage the ozone layer.</p>



<p>“We
called that [2017 event] ‘the mother of all pyrocumulonimbus,’” because it injected
so much smoke into the stratosphere, Robock says. The fact that the larger
Australian smoke plume reached even greater heights now gives the researchers
“much more confidence” that their computer simulations are accurate, he says. </p>

<p>Underwater laser scans have revealed new
details of how sea creatures called giant larvaceans feed themselves by
flapping a filmy tail inside a cloud of snot.</p>



<p>But what a cloud it is. A giant larvacean
produces an elaborate mucus home for itself that bioengineer Kakani Katija of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California on occasion calls a
“snot palace.” The mucus marvels rise out of the heads of four species of spineless,
roughly tadpole-shaped giant larvaceans living in the twilight depths of the
bay. </p>



<p>To study such fragile architecture, Katija
and colleagues have been working on a robotic laser imaging system called
DeepPIV. It detects water flows inside the mucus clouds and lets researchers
figure out the palace’s inner 3-D structure. The newest reconstructions of flow
suggest how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2345-2">inner ducts, chambers and valves</a>, all made of mucus, help harvest bacteria and other suitable
food particles from the normally weak soup of seawater, Katija and colleagues
report June 3 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="DeepPIV imaging system illustration" class="wp-image-3088682" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/060220_sm_larvaceans_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088682">In this illustration of a DeepPIV imaging system, a camera can dangle in front of larvacean mucus structures in the wild to track the complex water flow through chutes and valves too fragile to pull to the sea surface intact.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088682">Kim Fulton-Bennett © 2017 MBARI</span></figure>



<p>Frail, filmy animals like these “don’t
lend themselves to traditional study methods,” says ecologist Kelly Sutherland,
at the University of Oregon in Eugene, who was not involved in the research. Her
lab also focuses on jellylike animals that “tend to fall apart as soon as you
try to collect them.” Even some matters of basic biology in such creatures
remain open questions. So devising ways to study a filmy species alive in its
watery home is the way to move the science forward.</p>



<p>In building those homes, larvaceans
remind Katija a bit of spiders. Plenty of animals build homes and traps, but
larvaceans and spiders are among the few that don’t collect building material or
dig and sculpt soil. Instead, they secrete all their architecture.</p>





<p>And much like a spider weaving a web
anew each day, larvaceans are thought to make and remake their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-creatures-sticky-mucus-houses-catch-ocean-carbon-really-fast">mucus houses</a>
(<em>SN: 5/4/17</em>). A millimeter-sized gob of mucus beads up on a
larvacean’s head. Then the blob can inflate into a finished house in 45 minutes.
</p>



<p>When fully inflated, a plump, curved, inner
mucus house cradles the larvacean as the animal’s swishing tail pumps seawater
through the structure. Encasing
all of this plumbing and the animal cuddled against it lies the big floaty envelope
of the outer house. A larvacean creates the whole palace, even ribbed walls and
intricate chutes, without arms or legs or even a snout that pokes the mucus
into shape or nudges parts together. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="Laser scan of larvacean mucus house" class="wp-image-3088683" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/060220_sm_larvaceans_inline2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088683">Underwater laser scans have revealed the complex plumbing channels that make up the inner part of a larvacean’s mucus house. That plumbing helps filter and concentrate edible particles from seawater.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088683">© 2002 MBARI</span></figure></div>



<p>Researchers had previously proposed that
the outer house, which can stretch a meter across in larger giants, filters out
bigger debris chunks that might clog the inner works. Now Katija and her
colleagues propose other uses.</p>



<p>The outer house might protect the larvacean
inside it from stinging animals that waft through the open water. That
engulfing mucus might also work as an invisibility cloak. Inside, the larvacean’s
tail sends seawater surging through the channels in the inner house. In the
twilight dimness where larvaceans live, however, water motions can tip off a hungry
fish to the possibility of a nearby larvacean lunch. Yet by the time that expelled
water finds its way past the outer mucus house, the motion has slowed by three
orders of magnitude. A predator might not bother to investigate. </p>



<p>To study the paths of water through the
outer and inner houses, researchers lowered the laser imaging system to scan a
series of cross-sectional views of living larvaceans floating free in Monterey
Bay. Analyzing the velocities of particles whooshing this way and that in spots
on the cross-sectional scans let the scientists figure out the elaborate
structure. </p>



<p>As seawater throbs through this plumbing,
the stream of food particles grows more concentrated as it approaches the
animal’s mouth. As Katija, a bioengineer interested in taking design
inspiration from nature, points out, these animals have evolved an inflatable
filtration system.</p>



<p>The new insights about internal
structure are welcome news to Russell Hopcroft, a zooplankton ecologist at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks. He used a somewhat similar imaging tool last
summer in the Gulf of Alaska and can think of plenty of fragile, filmy
creatures that he would love to scan. The Monterey Bay larvaceans, however,
have a special resonance: “We did a lot of head-scratching when I was a postdoc
… over 20 years ago trying to understand this 3-D structure.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/feature2-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><em>“Listening to my baby heart sound was very helpful to me. I felt that my right was respected as I took in my baby monitoring. Thanks for this program. I am happy.”</em></p>
<p>These are the words of a young Liberian mother who, as part of an innovation to improve neonatal and maternal health, was listening to the heart beat of her own fetus at the end of every contraction during her labor, using a simple handheld sonicaid ultrasound device.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this approach needed?</strong></h3>
<p>In a low-resource country such as Liberia, where there are few midwives — according to the WHO and World Bank, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.NUMW.P3">only 1 midwife or nurse per 10,000 population</a>, the second lowest number in the world after Somalia — midwives are often too overworked and overstretched to monitor the fetal heart rate regularly in every woman in labor, even though doing this essential task is necessary to detect fetal distress that could lead to negative outcomes. As a result, changes in the fetal heart rate that could indicate problems are often missed, leading to <a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/newborn-care/">high rates of birth asphyxia</a> in newborn infants in such settings.</p>
<p>Training more midwives is a long-term but absolutely crucial strategy. As shown in the recently published <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/nursing-report-2020">State of the World’s Nursing Report 2020</a>, investment in nurses and midwives is vital to delivering Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an immediate option is to train mothers in labor to listen to their fetal heart rate at the end of every contraction and notify the attending midwife if they detect any changes. If confirmed, suggesting fetal distress, the midwife would then notify a senior clinician who would undertake an immediate clinical intervention to protect the fetus from harm.</p>
<h3><strong>A feasibility study</strong></h3>
<h3><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11905 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/Picture1-226x300.png" style="font-size: 16px;" width="226" /></h3>
<p>The first step of such a bold and unusual potential approach is to find out if mothers are willing to monitor their own fetus during labor, and if so, if they are able to detect any changes. Our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02921-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> emphatically shows that it is not only feasible for Liberian mothers, many of whom cannot read or write, to monitor their own fetus during labor and accurately detect changes, but that the majority found the experience positive and beneficial for their own wellbeing and that of their babies.</p>
<h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3>
<p>The comments from participating mothers are poignant and moving and, if you have time, the authors encourage you to read the full set of comments in the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02921-z#Sec28">additional files</a> linked to our paper<strong>.</strong> The vast majority of participating mothers (387 out of the 400 mothers who provided comments) found the experience positive. Many commented on how much they enjoyed listening to their baby’s heart beat or hearing their baby “breathing” inside them, and that it gave them hope that their baby was alive. Several commented that hearing their baby’s heart beat gave them strength and courage to carry on while they were experiencing labor pain.</p>
<p>Many women commented on the negative effects of the severe pain of labor and as a result, MCAI and the Ministry of Health have recently started an initiative to administer IV paracetamol, an analgesic which is appropriate to the Liberian setting, to mothers who are requesting pain relief during labor.</p>
<p>Another encouraging finding was that of the 26 of 461 participating mothers for whom changes in the fetal heart rate were identified, the mothers detected these changes in 24 of these cases. Identification of these changes led to swift clinical intervention and ultimately resulted in all 26 babies, some of whom had needed further management in the neonatal unit, surviving and being discharged home healthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Expanding the task-sharing program to include mothers in the monitoring of their own unborn babies seems to be a welcome extension, while also providing benefits to the mothers themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This finding also showed that maternal monitoring in itself is not enough as there also needed to be appropriate clinical interventions to manage any detected changes in the fetal heart rate. So in addition to maternal fetal monitoring, there also need to be in place robust clinical protocols, a skilled workforce, and appropriately equipped and supplied facilities to be able to appropriately manage any changes in fetal heart rate and deliver the Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care required to save lives and improve the quality of care.</p>
<p>Maternal fetal monitoring has continued in the two public hospitals that were involved in the feasibility study and, as a result of these positive findings and experiences, the Liberian Ministry of Health has agreed to expand maternal fetal monitoring to three more hospitals.</p>
<h3><strong>Expansion of task sharing</strong></h3>
<p>Innovative solutions to help overcome human-resource scarcities in low-income settings are not new. For example, because of the severe lack of doctors, the <a href="https://12dec1c3-e3f4-e784-7f3a-6e7903610962.filesusr.com/ugd/dd2ba4_40c5e3dabfc44420af2dc6de29201de2.pdf">established Liberian task-sharing program</a> involves training midwives in advanced obstetric care and training nurses in advanced neonatal care in order to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths and improve the quality of care. Expanding the task-sharing program to include mothers in the monitoring of their own unborn babies seems to be a welcome extension, while also providing benefits to the mothers themselves. As a young mother recently commented during the continuation of the maternal fetal monitoring program:</p>
<p><em>“I tell the midwife thanks for the care that was given to me. It empower me to listen to my own baby heart beat and I hope that other women will do the same.”</em></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/real-life-scientists-inspire-comic-book-superheroes-science-literacy">Real-life scientists inspire these comic book superheroes</a></h4>

<p>Jaye Gardiner loves comic books, and she loves
science. So sensing an opportunity, she decided to combine the two.</p>



<p>In 2015, Gardiner and two other
friends, Khoa Tran and Kelly Montgomery, founded an online publishing company
called <a href="https://www.jkxcomics.com/">JKX
Comics</a>. At the time, the three were
pursuing Ph.D.s in different fields at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. And they knew how tough it can be to explain
research or engage students in the nuances of science.</p>



<p>So they decided to use the easy-to-digest cartoon
format and light humor to boost scientific literacy. The trio spent weekends at
a campus bar writing the script and drawing panels for their first comic book,
published in 2016. The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ab7c15e4fcb5c602a09465/t/5a08e052e2c483d6cb8cf769/1510531187492/JKXComics_EBV+and+the+Replication+Dance.pdf">comic</a>, <em>EBV and the Replication Dance</em>, describes
how the common Epstein-Barr virus replicates
by telling a story about the virus going clubbing with friends inside a human
cell. </p>



<p>“You have the visual components” to help convey
complex systems, “and then you also have that story element,” says Tran, now an
epigeneticist at the University of Pennsylvania. “Having comics as a way of
opening that door into what science is could hopefully inspire the next
generation to pursue STEM [science, technology, engineering and math].” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="JKX Comics team" class="wp-image-3088668" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/052820_KP_sci-life-comics_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088668">Khoa Tran (left), Jaye Gardiner (middle) and Kelly Montgomery (right) founded JKX Comics in 2015 while pursuing their Ph.D.s at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088668">JKX Comics</span></figure>



<p>The three were not alone in seeing a place for science
in the comic universe. Many studies have suggested that comics can <a href="https://jcom.sissa.it/archive/17/01/JCOM_1701_2018_Y01">engage a wide and diverse audience with science
subjects</a>, according to a 2018
meta-analysis in the <em>Journal of Science Communication</em>. And comics can
make information <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875019328062">more accessible</a>
by presenting it through both text and illustrations. </p>



<p>In 2018, seven more scientists at UW–Madison joined the JKX Comics crew, bringing fields such
as psychology, astronomy and microbiology to the table. Local artists were
drafted to help illustrate the scientists’ research.</p>





<p>For the volunteer crew, the comics —
11 are now offered online for free —
have also given scientists a friendlier face.
“We can show who the scientists are … that they are also just people,” says Gardiner,
a cancer biologist at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. “We’re not
all geniuses with Einstein-like hair that are antisocial and just have Eureka
moments all the time. And using comics is a nice way to tell their story.” </p>



<p>Their latest, <a href="https://www.jkxcomics.com/gilbertswitchglitch"><em>Gilbert’s Glitch Switch</em></a>,
released March 2, sees a biochemist get sucked into a video game where he has
to test amino acid combinations to get proteins to communicate effectively. The
panels are drawn in the style of the classic video game <em>Super Mario Bros</em>.,
and the storyline explains fundamental concepts in biochemistry, says its
author, Montgomery, now a chemical biologist at the University of California,
San Francisco. </p>





<p>By understanding how proteins communicate, “you can
modify a protein to be able to communicate to its neighbor better,” she explains.
“This can help us with [stopping] diseases related to proteins communicating in
the wrong way,” such as Alzheimer’s and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which
causes nerve damage in the arms and legs.</p>



<p>It’s not always easy to translate a complex science
topic into a comic. The creators have to balance accuracy and an engaging story.
“It’s something that we grapple with, and it’s never going to be perfect,” Tran
says. “But we really want to instill that curiosity in people to then learn
more and further investigate the topic.”</p>



<p>Though the comics are geared toward middle school
students, the team hopes people of all ages can enjoy them and learn something.
The three are now creating a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding to print their
comics for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MadisonReadingProject/">Madison Reading Project</a>’s distribution to underserved children in the region.
They’re also working on a new comic series about women in STEM fields, and
another on investigating diseased organs, an homage to <em>CSI</em>, the
television show on criminal forensics.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of misinformation in our communities,”
Montgomery says. “And it scares people away from science. If we could limit
some of those misunderstandings when they’re kids or when their parents are
reading with them, I think that would be a really positive impact.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img alt="April 25, 2020 cover" class="wp-image-3087087" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042520_ant-cover_lg-144x186.jpg" /></figure></div>



<h4>Milky Way matters</h4>



<p><em>Computer simulations and observations of nearby galaxies helped astrophysicists determine that the Milky Way stretches nearly 2 million light-years across, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Ken Croswell</em></strong></em></strong><em> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-found-edge-milky-way-size">Astronomers find Milky Way’s edge</a>” (</em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 8<em>). </em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>John Montany </strong>thought that the Milky Way must be more massive than previously thought. “I have read other articles that have reported discoveries of previously unknown mass in the universe,” <strong>Montany</strong> wrote. “Taken collectively, are these discoveries changing theories of dark matter as an explanation for gravitational observations?”  </p>





<p>No, <strong>Croswell</strong> says, the new work does not suggest the Milky Way has more mass and doesn’t change estimates for how much dark matter the universe has. “Most astronomers believe that dark matter explains such observations as the high velocities of stars in dwarf galaxies and the high velocities of galaxies in galaxy clusters,” he says. “Without the gravitational force exerted by this dark matter, stars in typical dwarf galaxies would escape their galactic homes, and galaxies in galaxy clusters would escape their abodes as well.”</p>



<h4>Rainforest reservations</h4>



<p><em>A sediment core analysis revealed that a rainforest flourished near the South Pole around 92 million years ago, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Carolyn Gramling</em></strong></em></strong><em> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rainforest-antarctica-south-pole-roughly-90-million-years-ago">A rainforest once grew in Antarctica</a>” (</em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 14<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Dennis McHenry</strong> wondered if the researchers accounted for continental drift. “Ninety million years ago, the Antarctic wasn’t quite where it is now,” he wrote. <strong>McHenry</strong> also wondered if Earth’s axial tilt 90 million years ago would have kept Antarctica in darkness for months at a time. “It isn’t only the cold that prevents forests, but also the lack of light for many months of the year,” he wrote.</p>



<p>The latitude where this forest once existed, 82° S, is a paleolatitude, <strong>Gramling</strong> says. R­esearchers determined this ancient location based on calculations of where and how quickly tectonic plates have moved over the last 90 million years. “The drill site is a bit closer to the South Pole, but the ancient site was within about 1,000 kilometers of the pole, even when accounting for the movements of the plates,” she says.</p>



<p>As for axial tilt, the angle of the tilt changes on a 41,000-year cycle, between a minimum of 22.1 degrees and a maximum of 24.5 degrees. “Although that cycle can impact climate, a site at 82° S would still have been plunged into darkness for months each winter,” <strong>Gramling</strong> says. “That makes it even more remarkable that temperatures remained warm enough for the forest to thrive, and it’s why the researchers determined that such high carbon dioxide levels as well as a basically ice-free continent were both necessary conditions.”</p>



<h4>COVID-19 Q&amp;A</h4>



<p>Science News<em> reporters </em><strong><em><strong><em>Tina Hesman Saey</em></strong></em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Aimee Cunningham</em></strong></em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Jonathan Lambert</em></strong></em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em><strong><em>Erin Garcia de Jesus</em></strong></em></strong><em> are following the latest research to keep you up to date on the coronavirus pandemic. The team is answering reader questions about COVID-19.</em><em></em></p>



<p>“Is there something different about coronaviruses whereby we do not have long-lasting immunity once infected?” reader <strong>Bob Schalhoub</strong> asked.</p>



<p>That’s a million-dollar question. When a virus infects a person, the body typically mounts an immune response to fight off the infection. Once the virus is gone, certain cells help the immune system recognize the virus if it attacks again. But that memory tends to fade over time for some viruses, like coronaviruses, and not for others, like measles virus. Scientists don’t fully understand why there’s a difference.</p>



<p>Because of this short memory, people can be repeatedly infected by cold-causing coronaviruses, studies have shown. It’s unclear whether that’s the case for coronaviruses that have caused outbreaks, including the new corona­virus. The SARS outbreak was contained before that question could be explored. And MERS doesn’t offer helpful insights because it infects so few people a year.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/history-reveals-how-societies-survive-plagues">History reveals how societies survive plagues</a></h4>

<p>This isn’t the first time in history that societies have been racked by social unrest while in the grip of a pandemic.</p>



<p>That may be scant comfort, but as Bruce Bower explains in this issue (Page 24), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-ancient-plagues-pandemics-lessons-society">impacts of a pandemic often reach beyond the toll of illness and death</a>. In the mid-200s, the Plague of Cyprian may have helped to irreversibly weaken the Roman Empire. In the 19th century, soldiers sent to Haiti by Napoleon Bonaparte to quash rebellion succumbed to yellow fever, leading to Haitian independence and Napoleon’s sale of the territory of Louisiana to the United States.</p>



<p>Yellow fever’s grip on Louisiana perpetuated racial inequity, Bower reports. White people who survived gained special privileges once they were immune to the mosquito-borne disease. Enslaved people, however, did not; surviving yellow fever just made them more valuable as workers.</p>



<p>The coronavirus pandemic has tracked long-standing racial fault lines in the United States, with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">African Americans more apt to become seriously ill or die from COVID-19</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/10/20</em>). Black people often work in jobs where they are more likely to be exposed, more often have other health conditions that put them at greater risk, and have less access to care.</p>





<p>As protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police swept the nation, physicians’ groups including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics called for the country to address the violence and inequities of racism as a public health crisis. “Racism is detrimental to health in all its forms,” the AMA statement read.</p>



<p>Scientists warned for decades of the risk of a pandemic, but societies worldwide failed to prepare. The economic, social and human costs of racism have been clear for even longer, yet remain a heavy burden.</p>



<p>But those failures don’t have to be our future. History offers many examples of societies adapting and evolving in response to the assaults of pandemics, Bower writes. In these awful times, we also have opportunities to change history for the good. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/627428622/0/oupblogpsychology/">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a></h4>

<p>A growing body of evidence supports my clinical experience that younger people, high schoolers especially, are having more psychological problems during the pandemic than adults. There are many reasons for this. Adolescents are in the developmental stage of forming a new social world away from their parents. Social needs tend to dominate their lives and yet currently this growth has come to a bit of a standstill. In addition, teenagers are not fully cognitively developed; their moods still dominate compared to the planning and attention that are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, which doesn’t fully develop until about age 25. We all need to create a new and different worldview, but adults have more history and neurological development to take the long view.</p><p>We can help support our teens in many ways. Here are some recommendations for how to communicate and foster mental health during this difficult time; many of them will benefit the entire family.</p><p>Listen.<strong> </strong> Remember that no matter how much teens might protest, they are still dependent on their parents; the family is still the go-to support system. We need to show our teens that they can still count on us; that are we are emotionally there for them. I don’t mean a rose-colored glasses approach, but a realistic and strong view. Listen rather than trying to solve problems and try to check in often. It may be painful to hear teens’ worries because in the current situation, we are all struggling with a variety of anxieties. Communicate that although this is an extremely challenging situation, we can get through it together.</p><p>Communicate what you know as well as uncertainty. We’re are all under enormous stress. Our children can see it in us. Rather than try to avoid the sadness, it is better to communicate what you can. For example, if you know that if you get sick a relative or family friend is ready to step in, that will reassure your teens. On the other hand, if your teen wants to know when they will be able to go out in groups, you can reply that you don’t know but are monitoring the guidelines. Clarify that all this hardship is about keeping us as safe as possible.</p><p>Remember coping skills and resilience. Although teens are still developing psychologically, they may be aware of their strengths and weaknesses. Under this enormous stress, however, they may overlook how they have coped during hard times in the past. You can remind them how, for example, when there was illness in the family, they read certain types of books, baked, or wrote in a journal. Many of us, in the hopes of protecting our children from pain, do not help them learn distress tolerance. Even though we are in the midst of a worldwide trauma, building on a teen’s existing strengths can help increase distress tolerance.</p><p>Pay attention.<strong>  </strong>Most of us are struggling with some level of anxiety or sadness. This is a natural response to a surreal situation. Clinical anxiety or depression is something different. If you observe panic attacks, extreme worry, or avoidance, those are some symptoms of an anxiety disorder.  Similarly, some symptoms of a major depressive episode include feeling sad or empty, feeling hopeless, experiencing changes in appetite or sleep, expressing guilt, and having suicidal thoughts. Remember, too, that in adolescents, irritability may be a more prominent symptom than sadness. Even now, you can contact your pediatrician for a referral to a mental health professional.<strong> </strong>Getting in touch with a previous psychotherapist or psychiatrist can be in enormously helpful, even if just for a “check in.” Most psychotherapists are now comfortable using teleconferencing or telephone sessions.</p><p>Don’t forget to take care of yourself. It is an axiom in mental health that if a parent is feeling psychologically healthy, so will a child.  This is an upsetting time and parenting is one of life’s most challenging (also rewarding) experiences. Try to include some time for yourself for restoration, fun or a conversation with a close friend. Reach out to family, friends, or close co-workers for specific assistance. Some of the tips suggested may not be easy or even possible for you given your economic or social situation. You may be a single parent. You may be a member of a minority group or frontline healthcare professional. If so family, religious groups, neighborhood networks, or community agencies can also provide the support that you need. Please don’t hesitate to get help; we can get through this if we all work together.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-consoling-her-sad-daughter_2826738.htm#page=1&amp;query=family%20help&amp;position=12">Image</a> by rawpixel.com via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-emotional-toll-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-teenagers/">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/627428622/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/627428622/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/" rel="nofollow">Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/seven-ways-to-talk-to-terminal-patients/" rel="nofollow">Seven ways to talk to terminal patients</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/six-ways-to-reduce-your-environmental-impact/" rel="nofollow">Six ways to reduce your environmental impact</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deforestation-trees-indonesia-cash-poor-families-programs">How giving cash to poor families may also save trees in Indonesia</a></h4>

<p>Last year marked the third
year in a row of when Indonesia’s bleak rate of deforestation has slowed in
pace. One reason for the turnaround may be the country’s antipoverty
program. That initiative is associated with <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/24/eaaz1298">a 30 percent reduction in tree cover loss in villages</a>, researchers report June 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>.
</p>



<p>In 2007, Indonesia started phasing
in a program that gives money to its poorest residents under certain conditions,
such as requiring people to keep kids in school or get regular medical care. Called
conditional cash transfers or CCTs, these social assistance programs are designed
to reduce inequality and break the cycle of poverty. They’re already used in dozens
of countries worldwide. In Indonesia, the program has provided enough food and
medicine to substantially reduce severe growth problems among children. </p>



<p>But CCT programs don’t
generally consider effects on the environment. In fact, poverty alleviation and
environmental protection are often viewed as conflicting goals, says Paul
Ferraro, an economist and behavioral scientist at Johns Hopkins University. </p>



<p>That’s because economic
growth can be correlated with environmental degradation, while protecting the
environment is sometimes correlated with greater poverty. However, those
correlations don’t prove cause and effect. The only <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v95y2013i2p417-435.html">previous study</a>
analyzing causality, based on an area in Mexico that had instituted CCTs, supported
the traditional view. There, as people got more money, some of them may have
more cleared land for cattle to raise for meat, Ferraro says. </p>



<p>Such programs do not have to
negatively affect the environment, though. Ferraro and Rhita Simorangkir, an
applied microeconomist at the National University of Singapore, wanted to see
if Indonesia’s poverty-alleviation program was affecting deforestation. Indonesia
has the third-largest area of tropical forest in the world and one of the
highest deforestation rates, especially of primary forests — undisturbed,
mature tropical forests that are important for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nose-horned-dragon-lizard-lost-science-found">biodiversity</a>
and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-could-buy-more-time-fight-climate-change-thought">carbon storage</a>,
among other benefits (<em>SN: 6/9/20; SN:
7/17/19</em>).  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Kalimantan" class="wp-image-3088830" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/061120_ms_deforestation_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3088830">One of the biggest drivers of deforestation in Kalimantan (shown) on the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo is clearing land for palm oil plantations. But deforestation in Kalimantan has been slowing in recent years.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3088830">Mahastra Wibisono</span></figure>



<p>Ferraro and Simorangkir analyzed
satellite data showing annual forest loss from 2008 to 2012 — including during Indonesia’s
phase-in of the antipoverty program — in 7,468 forested villages across 15
provinces and multiple islands. The duo separated the effects of the CCT program
on forest loss from other factors, like weather and macroeconomic changes, which
were also affecting forest loss. With that, “we see that the program is
associated with a 30 percent reduction in deforestation,” Ferraro says. “And
half or more [of that reduction] is coming from primary forests.”      </p>



<p>If improving a family’s or a
village’s lot in life also means protecting the environment, it would be a
“great win-win — you can solve two problems at once,” says Jonah Busch, an
environmental economist at the Earth Innovation Institute in San Francisco, who
was not involved in the new study. Ferraro and Simorangkir present “good
evidence” that, at least in rural villages in Indonesia, giving people a
helping hand helps them cut down fewer trees, Busch says.</p>





<p>That’s likely because the
rural poor are using the money as makeshift insurance policies against
inclement weather, Ferraro says. Typically, if rains are delayed, people may
clear land to plant more rice to supplement their harvests, he says. With the
CCTs, individuals instead can use the money to supplement their harvests
instead.    </p>



<p>Whether this research
translates elsewhere is anybody’s guess. “This is much closer to the first word
than the last word on the topic,” Busch says. “I hope we’ll see more of this
type of research.” Unlike the Mexico study that found increased deforestation
with wealth, this one shows less, he says, and “it’s totally possible that’s
the case in both places.” Unfortunately, neither suggests what might happen in
the Congo or elsewhere, he says, because there are just too many local factors.</p>



<p>Ferraro and Simorangkir
suggest their results may transfer to other parts of Asia, due to commonalities
such as the importance of growing rice and market access. And regardless of
transferability, the study shows that what’s good for people may also be good
for the environment, Ferraro says. Even if this program didn’t reduce poverty,
he says, “the value of the avoided deforestation just for carbon dioxide
emissions alone is more than the program costs.” </p>



<p>People often think of
environmental protection as a moral objective, rather than an economic
objective, Ferraro says. “But just on economics, this intervention would make
sense.” </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clues-earliest-known-bow-arrow-hunting-outside-africa-found">Clues to the earliest known bow-and-arrow hunting outside Africa have been found</a></h4>

<p>People hunted with bows and arrows in a rainforest on a
South Asian island starting around 48,000 years ago, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Small bone artifacts with sharpened tips unearthed in a Sri
Lankan cave represent <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/24/eaba3831">the earliest
evidence of bow-and-arrow use outside Africa</a>, says a team led by
archaeologist Michelle Langley of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.</p>



<p>Microscopic analyses of 130 of those bone points revealed surface
cracks and other damage caused by high-speed impacts, likely because these
artifacts were used as arrowheads, Langley and her colleagues conclude June 12
in <em>Science Advances</em>. Notches and wear
at the bottom of the bone points indicate that they were attached to thin
shafts. But the finds, from sediment in Fa-Hien Lena cave dating to between
48,000 and 34,000 years ago, are too short and heavy to have served as tips of
blowgun darts, the investigators contend. Bow-and-arrow hunting at the Sri
Lankan site likely focused on monkeys and smaller animals, such as squirrels,
Langley says. Remains of these creatures were found in the same sediment as the
bone points.</p>



<p>Evidence increasingly points to hunting with bows and arrows
in Africa more than 60,000 years ago, says Marlize Lombard, an archaeologist at
the University of Johannesburg who wasn’t involved in the study. “I would not
be surprised to see [bow-and-arrow] hunting associated with any <em>Homo sapiens</em> group after about 65,000
years ago, regardless of location,” Lombard says. </p>

Langley</span></figure></div>



<p>Lombard, however, reserves judgment on the Sri Lankan bone
points until high-resolution CT scans are used to probe for damage from
high-speed impacts inside the artifacts. That technique helped to determine
that a more than 60,000-year-old bone point previously unearthed in South
Africa <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379120302572">was probably
an arrowhead</a>, a team including Lombard reported in the May 15 <em>Quaternary Science Reviews</em>.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Ryan Rabett of Queen’s University Belfast in
Northern Ireland calls the new study of Sri Lankan bone points “suggestive but
not definitive” evidence of bow-and-arrow hunting. It’s possible, he says, that
bone points were attached to multi-pronged spears that were thrown or thrust at
fish. Remains of fish were also found in ancient Fa-Hien Lena sediment.</p>





<p>Losing arrows while hunting in dense Sri Lankan forests
would have presented a major challenge to ancient people, Rabett adds.</p>



<p>Other finds in Fa-Hien Lena cave, including bone implements
possibly used to make clothes and nets as well as shell beads, indicate that a
distinctive set of complex behaviors emerged deep in the Stone Age as people
reached densely forested parts of South Asia, Langley and her colleagues say. A
couple of pointed bones display no signs of having been attached to a shaft and
possibly held bait while fishing or functioned as barbs in netted animal traps,
Langley says. Another 29 bone artifacts appear to have been used to make
clothes or nets out of animal skins or plant fibers.</p>



<p>Evidence of symbolic behavior at the site comes from three
beads made from seashells and another three beads fashioned out of pieces of a
red pigment called ochre. Single-holed ochre pieces might have been strung
together as way to store them for future use rather than as ornaments, Langley
says. Excavated chunks of red, yellow and silver pigment were likely used to
decorate bodies or objects, she adds.</p>



<p>The artifacts support the idea, based mainly on
archaeological finds in Africa, that complex behavior equivalent to that of
people today emerged early in <em>Homo
sapiens</em> evolution, 100,000 years ago or more, and involved finding ways to
thrive in novel environments, Langley argues. What human evolution researchers
often refer to as “modern” behavior “is all about flexibility and adaptability
to a wide range of situations,” she says. </p>



<p>Until hominid fossils are found at Fa-Hien Lena, it’s hard to say who occupied the site, says New York University archaeologist Justin Pargeter. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir"><em>H. sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>) inhabited parts of Asia and some Pacific islands, and periodically interbred, when bone points were being made at Fa-Hien Lena. “It may be too soon to conclude that this story is all about ‘modern’ humans,” Pargeter says.</p>

<p>The tracks were found in the
fossil-rich Jinju Formation, home to the remains of a wide variety of animals
including dinosaurs. It’s tough to identify a species from footprints, says
paleontologist Martin Lockley of the University of Colorado Denver. “Short of
finding the animal dead in its tracks, there’s always a little bit of
uncertainty.” But the beautifully preserved prints made it possible to attribute
them to <em>Batrachopus, </em>a genus of fossil tracks known to be made by
crocodylomorphs. </p>



<p>Perhaps the most surprising
feature of the tracks is the utter absence of any manus, or hand, prints —
strong evidence that the creature walked on only its hind legs, Lockley says. “We
have dozens of these things, and not one sign of a front footprint, so we’re
pretty convinced.”</p>

<p>A bipedal crocodylomorph
might have also been responsible for an enigmatic set of tracks found in the
nearby, similarly aged Haman Foundation. In 2012, the same team of researchers <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10420940.2011.625779">speculated in <em>Ichnos</em></a> that the bipedal Haman tracks might have been made by
pterosaurs, winged reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs. However, most researchers
— including Lockley and colleagues — are now convinced that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-pterosaurs-took-flight">pterosaurs were quadrupedal</a> (<em>SN: 10/19/08</em>).
</p>



<p>The new tracks aren’t the
first hint that some crocodile ancestors walked on two legs. About 231 million
years ago, <em>Carnufex carolinensis</em> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fearsome-croc-called-carolina-butcher-once-ruled-north">nicknamed the Carolina Butcher</a> — may have prowled North Carolina on its hind legs (<em>SN:
3/19/15</em>). </p>



<p>But that suggestion was based on skeletal reconstructions of the creature, not actual footprints, Lockley says. “The real punchline of our story is we have proof of large bipedal crocs.”</p>

<p><strong>Researchers already knew that mental health problems like depression and anxiety are linked to a greater risk of developing dementia.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Keeping to goals or new habits is not easy — so much so that there’s a cottage industry of life coaches, motivational speakers and stationery companies offering you tricks, hints, motivational journals and other products apparently designed to keep you on the straight and narrow.</p>
<p>But there might be an easier — and considerably cheaper — way of doing things. Rather than trying to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/14/study-identifies-the-most-effective-mental-strategies-that-people-use-to-get-through-aversive-challenges/">motivate ourselves</a> alone, Katie S. Mehr and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania argue in the <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/708880">J</a><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/708880"><em>ournal of the Association for Consumer Research</em></a>, copying the strategies that our friends use may provide us with some much needed drive.</p>
<p><span id="more-39766"></span></p>
<p>The team asked 1,028 participants, all of whom said they wanted to exercise more, how many hours they’d spent exercising in the previous week, before randomly assigning them to one of three conditions.</p>
<p>Participants in the “copy-paste” condition were asked to pay attention to how people they knew motivated themselves to work out, and were told they could ask them directly for strategies and tips. Those in the “quasi-yoked” control condition were told that the research team would “help [them] learn about an effective hack or strategy that motivates people to exercise” — no mention of friends. In another, simple control condition, there was no message.</p>
<p>Two days later, participants completed a second survey, describing what strategies they planned to use in the next week to exercise more. More specifically, those in the copy-paste condition were asked to summarise the strategy they’d copied from a friend, while those in the quasi-yoked condition were provided with one of 358 exercise strategies another participant had copy-pasted in a pilot study.</p>
<p>Finally, a week after the second survey, participants in all conditions were asked how many hours they had spent exercising in the last week and how motivated they had felt to exercise on a scale of one to five.</p>
<p>Those in the copy-paste condition — that is, those who had copied their friends’ fitness strategies — spent significantly more time exercising than those in the simple control (55.8 more minutes on average) and quasi-yoked control condition (32.5 more minutes). They were also more <em>motivated</em> to exercise.</p>
<p>What made copy-paste prompts so effective? To figure this out, the team also asked participants nine questions about the strategies they used, such as how useful, new or appealing the strategies were, and how committed they felt to them. The team found that, compared to the quasi-yoked condition, those in the copy-paste condition found the strategies more useful, were more committed to them, and had more social interactions with others who exercise — and these differences could explain why these participants in turn spent more time exercising.</p>
<p>This makes sense: general advice about exercise or habit-forming may not particularly resonate with someone, while finding appealing strategies from one’s own social circle could be more personally relevant. Further research could look at the <em>nature</em> of the strategies participants “copied and pasted” from their friends: is the motivation of seeking and applying strategies from friends enough to keep somebody interested in their new habit, or do particular types of strategy work better or worse?</p>
<p>Whether copy-paste strategies would work in the long-term is also not yet clear — it’s easy to start a new lifestyle with good intentions and high levels of motivation, but not so easy to keep it up. If you’re looking to change a habit, however, you could do a lot worse than looking to a friend for advice.</p>

<h4>A call to celebrate with reflection in the absence of convocation.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fK-Q38qYGjFLA9jd4yWJdA.jpeg" /></figure><p>I just graduated with a degree in Neuroscience without a plan to go to med school or grad school.</p><p>“Then what do you want to do with that?” People would always ask.</p><p>“Learn about the brain.”</p><p>That was my answer every time. To me, a degree was always a gem of knowledge before it was a stepping stone. I hope my fellow graduating class of 2020 feel that way about their degrees too — we need to, now more than ever.</p><p>With jobs and internships blasted to smithereens, convocations cancelled, and glamorous grad trips put on hold, graduation must take on a new meaning. It must be a reflection on the gems of knowledge we gained from our degrees: the lessons learned that will forever change the way we look at, live in, and leave the world. Here are 5 lessons I learned from my Neuroscience degree.</p><h4>Lesson 1 — Let Your Parents Take Pictures: Episodic Memory is the First to Go</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*r1DUFAbUtjw2XJVU" /></figure><p>I used to get annoyed when my mom wanted to take a selfie with us. I don’t any more.</p><p>“Why now?” we’d all ask as she whipped out her phone.</p><p>“To remember this!” she’d say.</p><p>As I studied aging and memory, I began to realize how good of a reason that really was.</p><p>Generally, most of us can achieve “healthy aging” by learning new skills, being creative, and thinking and working in different ways. We can sail into the sunset of life with relative sharpness of mind, and even memory. For example, we won’t forget how to drive a car or brush our teeth because our procedural, or “muscle”, memory remains in good shape. Semantic memory — memory for facts — doesn’t suffer much either, and can even get better as we age (think about your last game of trivia with mom and dad). One type of memory, however, is <em>not</em> immune to aging: episodic memory.</p><p>Episodic memory, or memory for personal experiences, is shown to decline in accuracy as we get older. So, while my mom may be able to mince garlic, drive to Costco, and name the singer of <em>Suspicious Minds</em> with ease, she may <em>not</em> always remember what she ordered on the second time we went to that Ramen place in Palo Alto, and who was there. But a cue, like a picture, can be the magic wand for recalling the night a few siblings and I slurped away with her just down the street from Stanford.</p><p><strong>Lesson 1. </strong>Be patient with your parents when they can’t remember the little things, and support their requested selfies so they can.</p><h4>Lesson 2 — Play Cards With Everyone : Remembering What Makes Us, Us</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HdBCRkRupUHybzqH" /></figure><p>If you were observing the beginning of a card game, you wouldn’t judge the players by their starting hands.</p><p>We’ve all been dealt a hand of cards. This hand isn’t chosen and doesn’t change. This hand is unique to us and has certain strengths and weaknesses. This hand is our genes.</p><p>Understanding the relationship between genes and behavior has changed the way I interact with others. Looking back at the times I discriminated against people because of their behavior, I could very well have been doing so because of their genes. I have been guilty of judging card players by their starting hands.</p><p>“Why is she overreacting?” I’d ask. “I wish he wasn’t so impulsive,” I’d think. I later learned in <em>Behavioral Neuroscience</em> that slow stress recovery and impulsivity are sometimes results of specific gene variants — a specific card in one’s hand. I learned that one fourth of the population holds the slow-acting variant of COMT, which is an enzyme that aids in stress recovery. It turned out all the “over-reactors” I was so quick to label were just working with a unique card in their hand. Then I learned that a certain variant of the DRD4 gene, held by around 20% of the population, is implicated in addiction, impulsivity, higher risk-taking and even schizophrenia. Come to think about it, all those people I thought were “impulsive adrenaline junkies” had been dealt a joker at the beginning of the game.</p><p>Other behaviors can hardly be traced back to a single gene, but follow the “common variant” model. Autism follows this model, wherein a certain “recipe” of common gene variants may be the culprit. Individuals with autism might have a 5 of diamonds, an 8 of spades, and a jack of hearts — common cards all of us hold. But that specific combination may be just the one to produce the set of behaviors we’ve come to define as “autism.”</p><p>While I never dared call an autistic person weird, I was no stranger to passing that judgment on “normal” people I found socially clumsy. Understanding the neurobiology of autism (or lack thereof) called for a shift in paradigm: “autism” is a set of traits, just like any other set of traits produced by any given hand of common cards. If every single person could have their genotype mapped and behavior closely observed, we would find more correlations between certain behavior sets and gene variant combinations. Then everyone would have a “disorder.” So if today I run into someone I’m tempted to call weird, annoying, or anything else, I can remember that these traits are the results of unique card combinations, a lot like the ones in my own hand.</p><p>Now, you’d might as well rescind my degree if I were claiming we were all puppets of our DNA. If there is any certainty in neuroscience, it’s that our brains are plastic: we can change the way experiences and genes have programmed us to think and behave (more on that in Lesson #4). A DRD4 holder can learn to tame his impulsivity. Someone with the slower COMT variant can work to reframe her stressors. And those who behave a little differently in social situations can find confidence and connection in society. Nevertheless, everyone has to start — and end — with the genes they’ve been dealt, and only time, experience, and patience can help us fulfill the potential therein.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2. </strong>Never judge a player by their starting hand and play fairly with everyone — we’re all learning to play our cards right.</p><h4>Lesson 3 — The Best Way to Do Dishes : Letting Dish Soap Do Its Job.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-45BSqN1OpsgRB0_" />Photo by Odua Images</figure><p>Imagine you had to learn how to wash dishes all over again, but this time only through observation. You’d soon find there are different styles.</p><p>You may enjoy the efficiency of the filler-uppers, who turn their sink into a soapy swimming hole for the evening. The brute-forcers might excite you as they pour soap straight onto the dish and scrub frantically under a running faucet. But understanding the chemistry may call you down a different path.</p><p>Soap cleans dishes — I didn’t need a chemistry class to tell me that. What I <em>did </em>need it to tell me was <em>how</em>. Water — a polar molecule — and grease — a nonpolar molecule — don’t mix. This is where dish soap comes in. Soap is an amphipathic molecule: it’s both polar and nonpolar. It can grab the grease and hold on with its nonpolar tail as its polar head follows water down the drain. Understanding this, we can see how soap can’t possibly do its thing when violently swished around in a pool or under a waterfall. It needs to do its job in steps: 1) bind to the grease, 2) get washed down the drain.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3: </strong>The best way to wash dishes is a quick rinse to remove the leftover food scraps followed by a soapy scrub sans water, and <em>then</em> a thorough rinse under the faucet. “Wash, rinse, repeat,” simple. But for me, it’s now a simplicity that isn’t blind. For me, the magic of dish soap is, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, a “simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity.”</p><h4>Lesson 4 — Why “It’s Not Good For Man to Be Alone”: On Potentiation and Proximity.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MRxZRyxVChxx8JTN" />Photo by ZoomSpectrum</figure><p><em>“Marketing degrees are useless.”</em></p><p><em>“He’s just following the crowd.”</em></p><p><em>“She’s just doing that because…”</em></p><p><em>“Musical Dance Theatre majors are wasting their time.”</em></p><p>Left alone, I would think thoughts like these. Left alone for longer, I would start to believe them. This is the dark side of potentiation, or how thoughts become “ingrained” in our brains. Understanding potentiation helped me break unhealthy trains of thought, and build healthier ones. To understand potentiation, however, you’ll need a crash course in neuroanatomy.</p><p>A rake is a great model for a neuron. The teeth of the rake represent the dendrites, the receiving end of a neuron. These dendrite “teeth” converge onto the head of the rake, which represents the cell body, a control center that processes input from the dendrites. From the head protrudes the long rake handle representing the axon, or “giving” end of the neuron. If the cell body “decides” to send a message to the next cell, it shoots an electrical impulse — an action potential — down the axon. The axon then communicates to the dendrite of the next cell. If you string a bunch of rakes together end-to-end, with the handle of one rake feeding into one of the teeth of the next, you have a neural pathway.</p><p>The first time I thought, “marketing degrees are useless,” an entire neural pathway fired. Zooming into the connections, or synapses, between neurons in the pathway, we can begin to understand how our thoughts become potentiated.</p><p>Take the first neuron in the pathway: when an action potential shot down its axon and reached the end, it released chemicals — neurotransmitters — that travelled across the synapse toward the dendrite of the second neuron. When the dendrite received the neurotransmitter, it sent input to its cell body, much like one of the skinny teeth of a rake feeds into the head. As I kept thinking, “marketing degrees are useless,” the cell body continued to receive input from this dendrite and charge began to build up. When the amount of charge reached a threshold, the cell body shot an action potential down its axon to communicate to the next cell, but this had repercussions. An action potential did not only shoot <em>forward</em>, down the axon rake handle, but also <em>backwards</em>, throughout the dendrite teeth in the form of a <em>backpropagating </em>action potential<em>.</em> So long as I kept thinking “marketing degrees are useless” without interruption, one of these teeth was still busy receiving input from the first neuron.</p><p>When the action potential of the first neuron met the <em>backpropagating</em> action potential of the second at their synapse, potentiation ensued: the connection between the first and second neuron was strengthened. The first now released neurotransmitter with every thought, the second neuron was more sensitive to that neurotransmitter, and as a result, it became a lot easier for me to think that marketing degrees were useless.</p><p>Until of course, I talked to a marketing student, and learned a new idea that would prove valuable at work.</p><p>I thought my neighbor was just following the crowd until I talked to him on the way to church and learned his genuine motivations.</p><p>I was sure why my friend was acting irritated until she told me otherwise.</p><p>I was so convinced that Musical Dance Theatre majors were wasting their time until I interviewed one.</p><p>It turns out, Musical Dance Theatre majors spend multiple days understanding the inner world of character they dance, sing, and act on behalf of. They do what I hadn’t done: get <em>proximate</em> to those who so desperately need their understanding.</p><p>Students of the Bible agree that when the Creator stated, “It’s not good for man to be alone,” he was hinting at a partner. But there’s another reason it’s not good for man to be alone: Partners and everyone else were meant to be loved, and when we are left alone to think about them, our thinking is flawed. When we are left alone for longer, we begin to believe ourselves.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> It’s not good for man to be alone because thoughts potentiate, so get proximate to others. Proximity will shatter your belief about someone and give you a chance to build something beautiful in its place.</p><h4>Lesson 5 — Mercy Softens, Trust Ennobles.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kIJcLvJTv0cgXpaH" /></figure><p>A few weeks into my last semester, I made a realization. In response to it, I wrote the following email to my professor and meant it:</p><blockquote>Hi Dr. ______,</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I made a mistake: </strong>I did not check the exam availability days. I assumed it ran for 4 days and thought I could still take it today. May I still take the exam, not for credit, but just as a benchmark for myself? I know you don’t allow exams to be taken home, so I can take it during a TA office hour or one of yours? Let me know what you advise.</blockquote><blockquote>thank you,</blockquote><blockquote>Isaac Wu</blockquote><p>He said yes.</p><p>The morning of the exam, I was upset. My roommates had done something I couldn’t let go of. As I walked with my professor of <em>Advanced Neuroscience</em> to the empty computer lab, my mind hardened with grudges. As we neared the entrance, he spoke up and told me the test I was about to take was actually going to be for credit and that there were no penalties.</p><p>Every thought was silenced — something had changed inside.</p><p>I felt the muscles in my face relax.</p><p>I let go of the roommate thing.</p><p>I was softened.</p><p>He was letting me off the hook when he had every reason not to, and it stopped me cold. At that point, the points were immaterial: My accumulated GPA was high and essentially set in stone and I’d already had a job lined up. Nevertheless, his mercy had softened me.</p><p>I was getting my things settled when he spoke up again, saying that he needed to go teach another class, and I should slide my test under his door when I was finished. He then said, “I know there are so many ways you can cheat, and I know you won’t use them. Do great.” He slipped out the door and I was alone in the large computer lab. I completed my midterm in silence, with a pencil and nothing else. I did my absolute best — his trust had ennobled me.</p><p>I grabbed my phone and took the above picture. I wanted to remember this moment forever.</p><p>I didn’t need the picture. I would continue to put forth incredible effort in that class to learn everything I possibly could, to perform as well as I could, and to do it all with the utmost honesty. A few months later, I only needed a fifteen out of one hundred on my quarantined, un-proctored final to pass the class. With the COVID-converted grading system, anything above a C would be a “Pass” that wouldn’t affect my GPA. Still, I studied as if every future neurosurgery patient or grad school application depended on it, though I knew I’d never have either of the two.</p><p>He didn’t have to let me take the test for credit but he did.</p><p>He could’ve gotten someone to proctor but he didn’t.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: </strong>Mercy softens, trust ennobles.</p><h4>Congrats, Grad.</h4><p>These gems won’t lose their shine.</p><p>Because there are more selfies to be taken</p><p>…more card games to be played,</p><p>…more house chores to be enriched by a scientific lens,</p><p>…proximities to be enjoyed,</p><p>…mercy and trust to be given.</p><p><strong>We are all graduating with something:</strong> a Neuroscience Degree at BYU, a marketing degree somewhere else (and a useful one at that!), more time at home with family.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/iStock-613687218-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>‘Choice’ has increasingly become a fundamental aspect of Western public health policy and practice since the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. For maternity care, it is a buzzword that has generated a growing body of research around how to best support decision-making and achieve informed choice among women. However, promoting more service user autonomy and care experiences that are aligned with personal values can lead to complex trade-offs, as choices are <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-143-4-200508160-00010">based</a> on more sophisticated, expanding services with less reliance on a clinician’s intuitive judgment. While sometimes maternity care professionals believe they are offering choice, in reality, women still have a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/324/7338/639">limited role</a> in decision-making and do not feel their care is presented as a choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Is choice really so complex?</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear about the ‘burden’ of choice, and how difficult it can be to make one in complex situations or when there are many options before us. Long-standing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10350446/">understandings</a> of decision-making and choice often assume that the decider uses a rational process to weigh up and decide between all available options. This idea of a ‘rational’ decision-making process is connected to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1955-01791-001">classical decision theory</a>, a concept developed during the 1950s. However, in reality, humans rarely make choices according to the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-10203-004">standards</a> of classical decision theory, even though the quality of their decision-making is judged based on the prescripts of this long-standing theory, despite its inadequacies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Women’s decision-making and choice about pregnancy and birth care is a dynamic process.</p></blockquote>
<p>‘<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-012-2077-6">Shared decision-making</a>’ is a collaborative approach where clinicians support service users to reach a decision about their care. While shared-decision-making principles have been well-established, there are <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/ktt23/chapter/Evidence-context">barriers</a> to implementing them in practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding decision-making and choice through research</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding decision-making and choice assumptions is important because there is growing evidence of the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7400">benefits</a> of <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early">different options</a> for maternity care in Western settings, as well as the notion of reproductive choice as a human right. As research studies increasingly collate evidence concerning the clinical outcomes of different care options, it should follow that we also bring together the findings about women’s experiences of choosing these options.</p>
<p>Reviewing a breadth of research all together can be helpful for elucidating complex phenomena, especially those that carry assumptions about what is optimal and what is not. Reviews also help researchers evaluate the quality of studies conducted on a specific area and determine whether there are any gaps in the literature.  The aim of <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03023-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our review</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a><em>, </em>was to describe and interpret qualitative research on women’s experiences of decision-making and choice about their pregnancy and birth care. Given the prominence of choice in health policy, we wanted to shed light on how this has been addressed in research to date and what the findings indicate.</p>
<h3><strong>Findings and conceptual model</strong></h3>
<p>We reviewed 37 original studies and conducted a meta-synthesis of these studies’ findings. A <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-8-45">meta-synthesis</a> involves bringing all of the qualitative data from a review together and re-analyzing it, in order to discover essential features across the body of literature. Because decision-making and choice are complex phenomena, we developed a conceptual model based on our analysis to bring all of these features together into one, presented in Figure 1:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11938" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11938" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/figure-300x169.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1, from Yuill, et al. 2020</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The model takes into account the three essential themes that emerged from the meta-synthesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‘Uncertainty’</em> encompasses several different experiences that are related to mothers’ concerns about the unknown and the course of pregnancy, childbirth and maternity care, all of which shape women’s decision-making and the options they ultimately pursue.</li>
<li>Women frequently discuss their maternity experiences in terms of control, whether it be losing it, maintaining it or reclaiming it. We chose to shift the perspective to <em>‘Bodily autonomy and integrity’</em> because ‘control’ is not always explicitly stated by participants, and experiences often refer back to the body.</li>
<li><em>‘Performing good motherhood’</em> is related to responsibility and risk, which are often <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698575.2013.859231">ascribed</a> to mothers to manage, as well as the gendered cultural norm that ‘good’ motherhood and birth takes place in a hospital with a team of medical professionals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model also recognizes that decision-making is an active process, so these themes are connected through three inter-linking actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‘Information gathering’</em> illustrates the multiplicity of information-seeking and what women specifically gain from different sources.</li>
<li><em>‘Balancing aspects of a choice’</em> is concerned with looking at how women consider the different options available to them and, essentially, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of those they encounter.</li>
<li>In terms of decision-making, an important part of the process is <em>‘Aligning with a birth philosophy’</em>, or perspectives that inform the ways in which people understand the world and life in it, further shaping the information women access, the care opinions they ultimately choose and the ways they justify their choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important finding from our review is that decision-making and choice are temporal, or related to time. For pregnancy and birth, they are made within a defined period, and often invoke both the past, whether this is personal, familial, social or historical, and the future. Finally, our discussion highlighted the importance of embodiment in maternal health experiences and how this is connected to experiences of decision-making and choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>Our findings indicate that women’s decision-making and choice about pregnancy and birth care is a dynamic process that is not always straightforward. This means that the use of prescriptive and rigid theoretical frameworks, like classical decision theory, for decision-making and choice need to be rethought. Policymakers and practitioners alike should examine critically current choice frameworks to ascertain whether they truly allow for flexibility in decision-making. Health systems should embrace more fluid, personalized models of care, such as <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early">midwife-led continuity models of care</a>, to augment service users’ decision-making agency.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28019026/">therapeutic trials</a> of “classical” psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin (from magic mushrooms) or LSD, have reported benefits to wellbeing, depression and anxiety. These effects seem to be linked to a sense of “ego dissolution” — a dissolving of the subjective boundaries between the self and the wider world. However, the neurochemistry behind this effect has been unclear. Now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0718-8">new paper</a>, published in <em>Neuropsychopharmacology</em>, suggests that changes in brain levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate are key to understanding reports of ego dissolution — and perhaps the therapeutic effects of psychedelics.</p>
<p><span id="more-39761"></span></p>
<p>Natasha Mason at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, and colleagues recruited 60 participants for their study. All had taken a psychedelic drug before, but not in the three months prior to the study. Half received a placebo and the other half were given a low to moderate dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg of body weight).</p>
<p>The team then used a technique called proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to look at concentrations of glutamate (as well as other neurochemicals) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus — two regions that have been implicated as key to the psychedelic drug experience. The team also looked at patterns of “functional connectivity” within networks of brain regions, a measure of how closely correlated brain activity is across those regions. Six hours after taking the drug or placebo, the participants reported on their subjective experiences using two surveys: The 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness and the Ego Dissolution Inventory.</p>
<p>As the researchers expected (based on the findings of earlier research), those given the drug reported increased  feelings of ego dissolution, as well as altered states of consciousness. They also showed disruptions in the connectivity of particular networks, including the default mode network, which has also been implicated in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/17/4853">past work</a> on the effects of psychedelic drugs..</p>
<p>But, for the first time in humans, the team also observed higher levels of glutamate in the mPFC and lower levels in the hippocampus after taking psilocybin — and they linked these changes to different aspects of ego dissolution. Increases in the mPFC were most strongly linked to unpleasant aspects, such as a loss of control over thoughts and decision-making, and also anxiety. Decreases in the hippocampus, meanwhile, were most strongly linked to more positive aspects, such as feelings of unity with the wider world, and of having undergone a spiritual-type experience.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is our most important memory structure. Based on earlier work on the impacts of psychedelic drugs on patterns of brain connectivity, it’s been suggested that a temporary reduction or loss of access to memories about our own lives might contribute to a weakening of the “self”. The new work suggests that changes in glutamate levels in the hippocampus might be key to this process.</p>
<p>But if glutamate rises in the mPFC are linked to <em>unpleasant</em> aspects of ego dissolution, and also to anxiety, how does this fit in with trial results finding that psychedelic drugs can treat anxiety disorders?</p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear. Psychedelics are known to bind with one particular type of serotonin receptor, called 5-HT2A receptors. This then causes the immediate changes in the glutamate system, which could be responsible for producing short-term feelings of anxiety. But it might be that longer-term <em>reduction</em> in anxiety levels is <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70474-6_10">related more to 5-HT2A receptor activation itself</a>, rather than glutamate, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>It’s also been suggested that activation of glutamate networks (via the 5-HT2A receptor) increases levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, which promotes the health and growth of new brain cells. Animal work provides evidence that <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30755-1">psychedelic drugs indeed promote plasticity in the brain</a>. And people with <a href="http://jpn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/44-3-147.pdf">major depression</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1301574">stress</a> disorders have been found to have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198406">reduced plasticity</a>. The new data provides indirect evidence that psychedelics might increase neuroplasticity in the human cortex by increasing glutamate, the researchers write. If correct, this could help with understanding how psychedelic drugs can treat depression.</p>
<p>More work is clearly needed to fully understand all these processes. But there’s a lot of interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelic drugs right now, and the new study does help to clarify the underlying neurobiology of the psychedelic state. As the researchers write, the findings “provide a neurochemical basis for how these substances affect individuals’ sense of self, and may be giving rise to therapeutic effects witnessed in ongoing clinical trials.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/06/10/black-lives-matter/">Black lives matter</a></h4>

<p>Today, June 10th 2020, black academic scientists are holding <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a strike in solidarity with Black Lives Matter protests</a>. I strike with them and for them. This is why:</p>
<p>I began to understand the enormity of racism against blacks thirty five years ago when I was 12 years old. A single event, in which I witnessed a black man pleading for his life, opened my eyes. I don’t remember his face but I do remember looking at his dilapidated brown pants and noticing his hands shaking around the outside of his pockets while he plead for mercy:</p>
<p>“Please baas, please baas, … ”</p>
<p>The year was 1985, and I was visiting my friend Tamir Orbach at his house in <del>Pretoria</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Tshwane_Metropolitan_Municipality" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tshwane</a>, South Africa, located in Muckleneuk hill. We were playing in the courtyard next to Tamir’s garage, which was adjacent to a retaining wall and a wide gate. Google Satellite now enables virtual visits to anywhere in the world, and it took me seconds to find the house. The courtyard and retaining wall look the same. The gate we were playing in front of has changed color from white to black:</p>

<p>The house was located at the bottom of a short cul de sac on the slope of a hill. It’s difficult to see from the aerial photo, but in the street view, looking down, the steep driveway is visible. The driveway stones are the same as they were the last time I was at the house in the 1980s:</p>

<p>We heard some commotion at the top of the driveway. I don’t remember what we were doing at that moment, but I do remember seeing a man sprinting down the hill towards us. I remember being afraid of him. I was afraid of black men. A police officer was chasing him, gun in hand, shouting at the top of his lungs. The man ran into the neighboring property, scaled a wall to leap onto a roof, only to realize he may be trapped. He jumped back onto the driveway, dodged the cop, and and ran back up the hill. I remember thinking that I had never seen a man run so fast. The policeman, by now out of breath but still behind the man, chased close behind with his gun swinging around wildly.</p>
<p>There was a second police officer, who was now visible standing at the top of the driveway, feet apart, and pointing a gun down at the man. We were in the line of fire, albeit quite far away behind the gate. The sprint ended abruptly when the man realized he had, in fact, been trapped. Tamir and I had been standing, frozen in place, watching the events unfold in front of us. Meanwhile the screaming had drawn one of our parents out of the house, concerned about the commotion and asking us what was going on. We walked, together, up the driveway to the street.</p>
<p>The man was being arrested next to a yellow police pickup truck, a staple of South African police at the time and an emblem of police brutality. The police pickup trucks had what was essentially a small jail cell mounted on the flat bed, and they were literal pick up trucks; their purpose was to pick up blacks off the streets.</p>

<p>Dogs were barking loudly in the back of the pickup truck and the man was sobbing.</p>
<p>“Please baas, not the dogs. Not the dogs. Please baas. Please baas…”</p>
<p>The police were yelling at the man.</p>
<p>“Your passbook no good!! No pass!! Your passbook!! You’re going in with the dogs and coming with us!”</p>
<p>“Please… please… ” the man begged. I remember him crying. He was terrified of the dogs. They had started barking so loudly and aggressively that the vehicle was shaking. The man kept repeating “Please… not with the dogs… please… they will kill me. Please… help me. Please… the dogs will kill me.”</p>
<p>He was pleading for his life.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Law</strong></p>
<p>The passbook the police were yelling about was a sort of domestic or internal passport all black people over the age of 16 were required to carry at all times in white areas. South Africa, in 1985, was a country that was racially divided. Some cities were for whites only. Some only for blacks. “Coloureds”, who were defined as individuals of mixed ancestry, were restricted to cities of their own. In his book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood-ebook/dp/B01DHWACVY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Born a Crime</a>“, Trevor Noah describes how these anti-miscegenation laws resulted in it being impossible for him to legally live with his mother when he was a child. Note that Mississippi removed anti-miscegenation laws from its state constitution only in 1987 and Alabama in 2000.</p>
<p>The South African passbook requirement stemmed from a law passed in 1952, with origins dating back to British policies from the 18th century. The law had the following stipulation:</p>
<blockquote><p>No black person could stay in a white urban area for more than 72 hours unless explicit permission was granted by an employer (required to be white).</p></blockquote>
<p>The passbook contained behavioral evaluations from employers. Permission to enter an area could be revoked by any government employee for any reason.</p>
<p>All the live-in maids (as they were called) in Pretoria had passbooks permitting them to live (usually in an outhouse) on the property of their “employer”. I put “employer” in quotes because at best they would earn $250 a month (in todays $ adjusted for inflation) would sleep in a small shack outside of a large home, and receive a small budget for food which would barely cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mielie-meal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">millie pap</a>. In many cases they lived in outhouses without running water, were abused, beaten and raped. Live-in-maids spent months at a time apart from their children and families- they couldn’t leave their jobs for fear of being fired and/or losing their pass permission. Their families couldn’t visit them as they did not have permission, by pass laws, to enter the white areas in which the live-in-maids worked.</p>
<p>Most males had passbooks allowing them only day trips into the city from the black townships in which they lived. Many lived in Mamelodi, a township 15 miles east of Tswhane, and would travel hours to and from work because they were not allowed on white public transport. I lived in Pretoria for 13 years and I never saw Mamelodi.</p>
<p>I may have heard about passbooks before the incident at Tamir’s house, but I didn’t know what they were or how they worked. Learning about pass laws was not part of our social studies or history curriculum. At my high school, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria_Boys_High_School" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pretoria Boys High School</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Milner,_1st_Viscount_Milner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Milner school</a> which counts among its alumni individuals such as dilettante <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> and murderer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorius</a>, we learned about the history of South Africa’s white architects, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Must_Fall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cecil Rhodes</a> (may his name and his memory be erased). There was one black boy in the school when I was there (out of about 1,200 students). He was allowed to attend because he was the son of an ambassador, as if somehow that mitigated his blackness.</p>
<p>South Africa started abandoning its pass laws in 1986, just a few months after the incident I described above. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Suzman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Helen Suzman</a> described it at the time as possibly one of the most eminent government reforms ever enacted. Still, although this was a small step towards dismantling apartheid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela</a> was still in jail, in Pollsmoor Prison at that time, and he remained imprisoned for 3 more years until he was released from captivity after 27 years in 1990.</p>

<p><strong>Order</strong></p>
<p>We did not stand by idly while the man was being arrested. We asked the police to let him go, or at least to not throw him in with the dogs, but the cops ignored us and dragged the man towards the back of the van. The phrase “kicking and screaming” is bantered about a lot; there is even a sports comedy with that title. That day I saw a man literally kicking and screaming for his life. The back doors of the van were opened and the dogs, tugging against their leash, appeared to be ready to devour him whole. He was tossed inside like a piece of meat.</p>
<p>The ferocity of the police dogs I saw that day was not a coincidence or accident, it was by design. South Africa, at one time, developed a breeding program at Roodeplaat Breeding Enterprises led by German geneticist Peter Geertshen to create a wolf-dog hybrid. Dogs were bred for their aggression and strength. The South African <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerboel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Boerboel</a> is today one of the most powerful dog breeds in the world, and regularly kills in the United States, where it is imported from South Africa.</p>

<p>After encounters with numerous Boerboels, Dobermans, Rottweilers and Pitbull dogs as a child in South Africa I am scared of dogs to this day. I know it’s not rational, and some of my best friends and family have dogs that I adore and love, but the fear lingers. Sometimes I come across a K-9 unit and the terror surfaces. Police dogs are potent police weapons here, today, just as they were in South Africa in the 1980s. There is a long history of this here. Dogs were used to terrorize blacks in the Civil Rights era, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/01/trump-vicious-dogs-protesters-civil-rights-slavery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent invocation of “vicious dogs” by the president of the United States conjures up centuries of racial terror</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Academia</strong></p>
<p>I immigrated to America in August 1988, and imagined that here I would find a land free of the suffocating racism of South Africa. In my South African high school racism was open, accepted and embraced. Nigg*r balls were sold in the campus cafeteria (black licorice balls), and students would tell idiotic “jokes”  in which dead blacks were frequently the punchline. Some of the teachers were radically racist. My German teacher, Frau Webber, once told me and Tamir that she would swallow her pride and agree to teach us despite the fact that we were Jews. But much more pernicious was the systemic, underlying, racism. When I grew up the idea that someday I would go to university and study alongside a black person just seemed preposterous. My friends and I would talk about girls. The idea that any of us would ever date, let alone marry an African girl, was just completely and totally out of the realm of possibility. While my school, teachers and friends were what one would consider “liberal” in South Africa, e.g. many supported the ANC, their support of blacks was largely restricted to the right to vote.</p>
<p>Sadly, America was not the utopia I imagined. In 1989, a year after I immigrated here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yusef_Hawkins" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yusef Hawkins was murdered</a> in a hate crime by white youths who thought he was dating a white woman. That was also the year of the “<a href="https://time.com/5597843/central-park-five-trump-history/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Central Park Five</a>“, in which Trump played a central, disgraceful and racist role. I finished high school in Palo Alto, across a highway from East Palo Alto, and the difference between the cities seemed almost as stark as between the white and black neighborhoods in South Africa. I learned later that this was the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining" rel="noopener" target="_blank">redlining</a>. My classmates and teachers in Palo Alto were obsessed, in 1989, with the injustices in South Africa. but never once discussed East Palo Alto with me or with each other. I was practicing for the SAT exams at the time and remember thinking Palo Alto : East Palo Alto = Pretoria : Mamelodi.</p>
<p>Three years after that, when I was an undergraduate student studying at Caltech in Los Angeles, the Rodney King beating happened. I saw a black man severely beaten on television in what looked like a clip borrowed from South Africa. My classmates at the time thought it would be exciting to drive to South Central Los Angeles to see the “rioters” up close. They had never visited those areas before,  nor did they return afterwards. I was reminded at the time of the poverty tourism my friends in South Africa would partake in: a tour to Soweto accompanied by guides with guns to see for oneself how blacks lived. Then right back home for a braai (BBQ). My classmates came back from their Rodney King tour excitedly telling stories of violence and dystopia. Then they partied into the night.</p>
<p>I thought about my only classmate, one out of 200,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/edray-goins-black-mathematicians.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> who was actually from South Los Angeles</a> and about the dissonance that was his life and my classmates’ partying.</p>
<p>Now I am a professor, and I am frequently present in discussions on issues such as undergraduate and graduate admissions, and hiring. Faculty talk a lot, sometimes seemingly endlessly, about diversity, representation, gender balance, and so forth and so on. But I’ve been in academia for 20+ years and it was only three years ago, after moving to Caltech, that I attended a faculty meeting with a black person for the first time. Sometimes I look around during faculty meetings and wonder if I am in <a href="https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people?cat_one=Faculty&amp;cat_two=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">America</a> or <a href="http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/academic%20staff" rel="noopener" target="_blank">South Africa</a>? How can I tell?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Racism</strong></p>
<p>Today is an opportunity for academics to reflect on the murder of George Floyd, and to ask difficult questions of themselves. It’s not for me to say what all the questions are or ought to be. I will say this: at a time when everything is <em>unprecedented </em>(Trump’s tweets, the climate, the stock market, the pandemic, etc. etc.) the murder of George Floyd was completely <em>precedented.</em> His words. The mode of murder. The aftermath. It has happened many times before, including recently. And so it is in academia. The fundamental racism, the idea that black students, staff, and faculty, are not truly as capable as whites, it’s simply a day-to-day reality in academia, despite all the talk and rhetoric to the contrary. Did any academics, upon hearing of the murder of George Floyd, worry immediately that it was one of their colleagues, George Floyd, Ph.D., working at the University of Minnesota who was killed?</p>
<p>I will take the time today to read. I will pick up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316323543/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Long Walk to Freedom</a>, and I will also read #BlackintheIvory. I may read some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Paton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alan Paton</a>. I will pause to think about how my university can work to improve the recruitment, mentoring, and experience of black students, staff and faculty. Just some ideas.</p>
<p>All these years since leaving South Africa I’ve had a recurring dream. I fly around Pretoria. The sun has just set and the Union Buildings are lit up, glowing a beautiful orange in the distance. The city is empty. My friends are not there. The man I saw pleading for his life in 1985 is gone. I wonder what the police did to him when he arrived at the police station. I wonder whether he died there, like many blacks at the time did. I fly nervously, trying to remember whether I have my passbook on me. I remember I’m classified white and I don’t need a passbook. I hear dogs barking and wonder where they are, because the city is empty. I wonder what it will feel like when they eat me, and then I remember I’m white and I’m not their target. I hope that I don’t encounter them anyway, and I realize what a privilege it is to be able to fly where they can’t reach me.

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ritesh Kumar will talk about impedance spectroscopy and its use in the design of electronic tongue and nose systems. Specifically, he will refer to the paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al. along with some of his previous works.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Impedance spectroscopy is a powerful technique which has been applied to the design of instruments for characterising liquids and solids. The ‘impedance fingerprints’  obtained at various frequencies can be used to classify, define sensitivity, selectivity, linearity of systems. It uses a sweep of sinusoidal frequencies as perturbation signal at low voltage so as to remain in the linear and causal domain. In this talk, I will be presenting about impedance spectroscopy and its use in the design of electronic tongue and nose systems in general and specifically the paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al. along with some of our previous works in the design of Electronic Tongue systems. The paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al.  shows that the run-of-the mill metal oxide gas sensors can act as high performance sensors using the impedance measurements. They show exemplary performance in terms of linearity, limit of detection, cross-sensitivity etc. This can pave way for the design of low cost and efficient electronic nose systems.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Authoritarianism, as a trait, tends to be thought of as an enduring part of a person’s personality. But can this deference to authority be changed? According to new work in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16383-6"><em>Nature Communications</em></a><em>,</em> it can — at least in the short term.</p>
<p>In studies conducted with textile workers in China and administrative staff at a university in the United States, researchers found that encouraging workers to attend weekly democratic meetings led to a significant change in the way they felt about authority, justice and participation.</p>
<p><span id="more-39752"></span>The first part of the study looked at the workers in the Chinese factory. These workers are organised by management into various groups in which they play separate but related roles — one might sew the sleeves of a hoodie, for example, while the other works on the hood. Before the start of the day, groups have a twenty minute meeting with their supervisor, who summarises work performance and decides on strategy, and gives workers individual goals.</p>
<p>The researchers — UCLA’s Sherry Jueyu Wu and Princeton’s Elizabeth Levy Paluck — recruited 65 such work groups for the study, and asked half of them to attend a weekly “participatory” meeting. Unlike the standard meetings, workers in these groups were able to participate in the discussion themselves, and were encouraged to discuss their experience at work, strategies for improving their output, and how best to cooperate. At the end of the meetings, in which supervisors were not allowed to contribute, workers announced their own goals for the week.</p>
<p>The remaining work groups were assigned to the status quo condition, in which they continued to attend meetings run by supervisors, with no participation for workers at all.</p>
<p>Four weeks after the experiment had ended, surveys were sent to participants. These measured workers’ attitudes towards authority (e.g. “obedience and respect for authority are the most important virtues children should learn”); the extent of their belief in a just world (e.g. “by and large, people deserve what they get” ); their perceptions of how much different social groups come into conflict (e.g. “in your mind, to what extent do the rich and the ordinary have conflict with each other?”); and their participation in various activities outside of work (e.g. “how often do you follow news about politics?”).</p>
<p>Although overall workers tended to slightly agree with statements asserting obedience to authority, those who had been allowed to participate in discussions had a significantly less positive attitude towards authority than those in the status quo condition. Workers in the participatory condition were also less likely to believe in a just world, and reported more conflict between managers and workers in Chinese society as a whole. Finally, these participants also said they were more likely to participate in both politics and family life than those in the status quo condition.</p>
<p>The second study repeated the experiment — only this time, workers were academic administration staff in the United States. In this case, workers on average slightly <em>disagreed</em> with statements asserting deference to authority — but as in the first study, workers in the participatory groups had even lower respect for authority than those in the control condition. They also had significantly lower belief in a just world. (Time constraints meant that the researchers did not ask the questions about participatory behaviours.)</p>
<p>Results from both studies suggest that it may not be accurate to consider deference to authority a deep-seated, stable personality trait, and that even small scale experiences with participatory democracy can shift people’s attitudes. It’s particularly notable that workers who had participated in meetings still had lower respect for authority four weeks later, suggesting that changes in attitudes may be enduring. The fact that the meetings also increased participation in other political and family activities suggests that engaging in participatory democracy could have significant, real world implications at work, in the family or elsewhere.</p>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge that many workplace or family issues are systemic — workers don’t choose to be exploited by their bosses, for example, and to argue that a change in attitude would erase that dynamic would be misleading and unfair. But for those striving to develop more participatory workplaces or even societies, knowing that authoritarianism may not be an immutable trait can only be a good thing.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/homeless-5210796_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Worldwide, as many as 150 million people or roughly 2% of the global population are classified as homeless, and as many as 1.6 billion people (20% of the world population) lack adequate housing.</p>
<p>Homeless people are more likely than the general population to have mental disorders. Evidence suggests that the vast majority of homelesss people suffer from mental, neurological, and substance disorders including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder (BD), substance use, and personality disorders.</p>
<p>Specifically to BD, numerous studies have reported that the prevalence estimates of BD might be substantially high among homeless people when compared to the general population. The reported prevalence estimates of BD among the homeless people range from 2.41% to 42.42% depending on the study. Several factors contribute to this wide range of prevalence rates, including: (1) the use of different instruments to assess BD; (2) the presence of comorbidities and other mental, substance use and physical health problems; and (3) the difference in sociodemographics and other characteristics of the participants.</p>
<p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the presence of BD among the homeless increases the likelihood that the person stays homeless for longer and increases the risks of mortality from suicide, drug use, and general medical conditions. It is also associated with an elevated risk of the vulnerability of the homeless person, such as criminality and violent victimizations.</p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this study?</strong></p>
<p>Although homeless people have been disproportionately affected by BD, the global prevalence estimate of BD among homeless people is unknown.  We therefore systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the existing epidemiological data on the prevalence of BD worldwide. The findings of the study may assist the concerned bodies in the planning and implementation of better screening and management strategies to address the burden and impacts of BD among homeless people.</p>
<p>We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus to identify pertinent studies that reported the prevalence of BD among homeless people in March 2019.  A meta-analysis using a random effect model was conducted to pool the prevalence estimated from individual studies.</p>
<p><strong>What did we find?</strong></p>
<p>Of 3236 studies identified, 10 studies with 4300 homeless individuals were included in the final analysis. The estimated global prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4%. This result is remarkably higher (11.35-fold higher) than the reported prevalence of BD among the general population. The prevalence of BD among the homeless was 10.0% in Europe and it was 13.2% in other countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The estimated global prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4% which is remarkably higher than the reported prevalence of BD among the general population.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What do our findings imply? </strong></p>
<p>In this study, we found that the prevalence of BD among homeless people was considerably high as compared to the reported prevalence in the general population. This result implies that greater attention and action are required to identify and treat BD among homeless people. In addition, the findings suggest the need for further studies evaluating the possible contributing factors for this remarkably high prevalence estimate of the disorder as well as better prevention and treatment strategies for this population group.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5JAZfOdbjp8/">Published Peer Review: 1 Year Across PLOS</a></h4>

<p>Last May, PLOS announced a new option for authors to publish their peer review history, and the support from our communities has been loud and clear. Since our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/12/celebrating-6-months-of-published-peer-review-at-plos/">update 6 months ago</a>, we’ve jumped from 800 to over 3,500 articles with published peer review history!</p>



<h4><strong>Why Publish Peer Review</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening access to the reviewer comments benefits readers who wish to dive deeper into a specific study. Comments from experts who reviewed the article that would traditionally remain unseen helps contextualize the research. Upcoming researchers can get a glimpse behind the curtains and see what sort of requests authors in their field were asked to address during revisions. If an author chooses to publish both a preprint and their peer review history, the process from first draft to final article can be learned from. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those involved in the peer review process also benefit, as the potential for reviews to be made public further fosters an environment where authors, editors, and reviewers respectfully collaborate to deliver the best possible manuscript for their community.</span></p>



<h4><strong><b>Our First Year Publishing Peer Review</b></strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By leaving the decision to opt-in for published peer review history with authors, we’ve seen a steady 39% opt-in rate among eligible manuscripts across all of PLOS. Of those 3,500 publications that agreed to participate in the last year, 60% have at least one signed review! </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this increased number of publications with peer review history under our belt, we’ve continued to see the highest opt-in rates in our journals publishing work in health or life-sciences. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within PLOS ONE, Oral Health (57%), Clinical Trials (51%), and Women’s Health (51% and 67 opt-ins) lead the pack in terms of opt-in percentage for subjects with over 20 opt-ins. We’re ecstatic to see so many articles dealing with public health providing access to expert reviewer opinions to further validate the studies.</span></p>



<h4><strong>Choosing to Collaborate</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe authors and reviewers should be in control of how their work is portrayed. Reviewers are given the choice to sign their comments, and authors choose to opt-in when they’ve received and had an opportunity to respond to all reviewer feedback, and their paper has been accepted. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this system, both roles work in tandem to drive a transition to more diverse, transparent peer review options. A reviewer who signs their name and provides substantial comments backed by evidence may entice an author to opt-in and have the reviewer’s comments published. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, an author may entice a reviewer to sign their name if their paper is already participating in other aspects of open science, such as publishing a preprint or sharing data and code in a repository. Regardless of your role on a specific paper, you have the choice with PLOS to enact transparency in peer review.</span></p>



<h4><b>The Transforming Landscape of Open Review</b></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different forms of Open Review are taking hold and changing the evaluation process. </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/reimagining-review-in-a-world-of-preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprint commenting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other opportunities are being realized due to the </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/peer-review/summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shift in research attitudes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The greater research community is more accepting than ever to Open Review concepts such as portable peer review (reviews that can be transferred across journals) or </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/convening-the-review-commons-community"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform providing independent peer review prior to journal submission. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing the essential role of peer review, reviewers have more opportunities to claim credit for their difficult and constructive work. These changes are all opportunities for researchers to cultivate transparency in peer review and, across all sectors of science, improve context and trust. </span></p>

<p>The arXiv staff is deeply saddened and angered by the recent killings of George Floyd, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others. We recognize that Black people live with the injustices of systemic racism every day — and have for centuries — in North America and around the world.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that in research, as in life, people often perpetuate bias and systemic racism, both consciously and unconsciously. Members of arXiv’s own physics community asked us to pause business-as-usual this week and join scientists participating in the <a href="https://www.particlesforjustice.org/">#strike4blacklives</a>. Our US-based staff agreed.</p>
<p>arXiv is an essential, daily tool for most physicists, and Black physicists are faced with the simultaneous tasks of writing and reading papers, while also fighting for their rights.</p>
<p>“The strike is an idea that grew out of discussions among Black physicists and astronomers, and importantly one thing that it offers us is a day of rest,” says <a href="http://www.cprescodweinstein.com/">Dr. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein</a>, professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire and co-organizer of the #strike4blacklives. “I want a day where I don’t have to worry that I’ve missed an important paper on the arXiv because I am stressed out while my non-Black colleagues happily keep going. The strike is not just about gathering people together to begin to take action, but it is also about a day of rest for the people most affected by this heated moment.”</p>
<p>arXiv will not mail a daily announcement on the evening of Tuesday, June 9, 2020. Submissions received at or after 14:00 ET Monday, June 8 and before 14:00 ET Wednesday, June, 10 will be announced at 20:00 ET Wednesday, June 10.  We also encourage authors to pause their submissions on Wednesday, June 10 to participate in the #strike4blacklives.</p>
<p>We encourage arXiv readers to use the time they would normally spend reading the daily announcement or submitting an article to instead <a href="https://www.particlesforjustice.org/resources">read about and discuss racism</a> and <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/action">how they will work in their own local and professional communities to address it</a>. If you choose to participate, please consider tagging <a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv">@arXiv on Twitter</a> to let us know what you are doing.</p>
<p>arXiv was founded as an open and freely available service to disseminate scientific research, and, as such, is an equalizer and democratizer. The arXiv staff is proud of this heritage and at the same time we recognize there is still much work to be done. The staff is participating in the #strike4blacklives and #shutdownSTEM at the request of our community, and we encourage members of minority groups around the world who are underrepresented in science to <a href="https://bit.ly/arXivStrikeInput">reach out to arXiv</a> to help us understand how to serve you better.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>When witnessing harmful behaviour, most of us hope for intervention of some kind: if we see someone receiving abuse on public transport, for example, it’s likely we want to see some action taken.</p>
<p><em>Who</em> we want to intervene in such acts, however, is more divisive. Some believe social norms should be enforced by authorities, whilst others stress that responsibility should be shared amongst us all. An interesting example of this is the discussion around policing, with abolitionists arguing that much of the work done by the police would be better led by communities themselves.</p>
<p>Our politics may inform our stance — and according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720300342">new study</a> in <em>Cognition</em> from Julia Marshall and colleagues at Yale University, so might our age. The team finds that older children and adults tend to see norm enforcement as the responsibility of authorities, while younger children see that duty as universal.</p>
<p><span id="more-39742"></span>In the first study, a group of 84 four-to-seven-year-olds and 36 adults were presented with a scenario in which an authority figure — a parent or teacher — and an ordinary person witnessed teasing. In one story, someone was teased in a park in front of two witnesses: the transgressor’s mother and someone walking in the park. In the other, set in a school, the teasing was seen by a teacher and by another student in the class. All characters were adults or teenagers.</p>
<p>After seeing the scenarios, both groups were asked questions about how obligated each witness was to do something about the teasing. First, they were asked <em>expectation</em> questions: how likely they felt the authority and peer figures were to intervene. Next were <em>obligation questions, </em>measuring whether the participant felt each figure had a duty to take action.  Finally, <em>forced obligation questions</em> asked which of the two figures was more obligated to act.</p>
<p>Results suggested that adults considered the authority figure more obligated to intervene (in fact, they tended to believe that the other bystander did <em>not</em> have a duty to intervene). Older children showed a similar response. And while younger participants also believed authority figures had the greatest obligation, they felt that peers had more of a duty to intervene than did older children or adults — that is, they seemed to believe obligation was more of a universal duty. Children of all ages also <em>expected</em> authorities to intervene, but as they got older became less sure that peers would do so too.</p>
<p>A second study introduced the idea of punishment. A total of 148 children and 40 adults were shown two sets of stories, which depicted someone being teased in a park or at a school. In one version of the stories, the perpetrator’s parent or a teacher was the only witness; in the other, the witness was a peer. The participants answered the same expectation, obligation and forced obligation questions, this time focused on the duty of the witness to <em>punish</em> the perpetrator (e.g. “Do you think this person … has to get Jessica in trouble for saying something mean?”).</p>
<p>As in the first study, adult participants believed the authority figure was more obligated to punish than the peer. This was also the case for older children — but while four-year-olds also felt authority figures were obligated to help, they again felt that peers also had a duty to step in.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that young children have broader beliefs about who is obligated to intervene in unpleasant situations. But this isn’t because they don’t understand the difference in power between authority figures and average onlookers, the team argues. Instead, the authors suggest that expecting or valuing community or peer intervention is universal, but that certain cultures — like that of the United States where this study took place — end up replacing these “default” beliefs with deference to authority.</p>
<p>Future work which looks at the same factors across cultures could clarify how universal these changes are during child development — and what cultural and interpersonal factors lead to such changes.</p>

<p><em>The following joint press release was issued on June 8, 2020.</em></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a two-year open access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to funds.</p>



<p>“The evidence is undeniable — open access research enables the convergence of disciplines that drives scientific innovations,” said Keith Webster, dean of Libraries and director of Emerging and Integrative Media Initiatives for Carnegie Mellon University. “This agreement with PLOS gives our researchers more avenues to provide their work to the public, and, in doing so, increases readership and opportunities for societal impact.”</p>



<p>Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Carnegie Mellon will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the two-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. CMU researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these two years and will not be charged any APC. This pilot will further PLOS’ mission of making open access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages and geographies.  </p>



<p>“The agreement with Carnegie Mellon University is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in open access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreements with the University of California and Iowa State University,” said Sara Rouhi, director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Though COVID-19 is front and centre right now, most people would agree that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/20/how-to-be-an-effective-climate-activist-according-to-psychology/">As we explored earlier this year,</a> how to engage people to combat that change is a thornier subject. Now a major <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691620903019">new meta-analysis</a>, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, has revealed that particular personality traits are associated with more — or fewer — pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours.</p>
<p>The work has potentially important practical implications. Reframing pro-environmental campaigns to resonate with people who would otherwise be more resistant to them could effect real change. As the researchers write, “personality factors may play a significant and systematic role in such reframing.”</p>
<p><span id="more-39724"></span>Alistair Raymond Bryce Soutter at the University of Edinburgh and colleagues analysed the data from 38 papers, comprising 44,993 participants from 19 countries across four continents. All of these papers used either a Big Five (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness) personality test or a test based on the HEXACO model (which includes those five domains, plus a measure of honesty-humility). The studies used a range of scales to measure pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours, from one-item scales asking, for example, ‘Is climate change real?’ to assessments of a suite of behaviours, such as donations to environmental charities and recycling behaviour. This isn’t a problem, but an advantage, the researchers argue: “The breadth of measurement allows the results of the meta-analysis to be generalised across a variety of attitudes and behaviours.”</p>
<p>The team found that the personality trait of openness to experience had the strongest association with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviour. This makes sense, the researchers note. More open people tend to be smarter and better-informed, and so may have greater knowledge about the consequences of human actions on the environment, which in turn motivates their environmentalism. People high in openness are also more willing to adopt new ideas — so they may be more likely to buy an electric car, say, or install solar panels.</p>
<p>One other personality trait was just as strongly associated with environmentalism: honesty-humility. This was more of a surprise to the team. But they suggest that as honesty-humility is defined by a tendency to cooperate and not to exploit others, these people may similarly be unwilling to exploit the environment.</p>
<p>Agreeableness and conscientiousness were also associated with environmentalism, though to a lesser extent. Agreeable people tend to show more empathy and compassion, and empathy for future generations or other animals may come into play here. Conscientious people, meanwhile, might be expected to more closely follow socially appropriate norms such as recycling. However, people who are driven to follow social norms may in some cases be discouraged from pro-environmental behaviours: “For example, an often desirable social goal is being able to travel or own a large house. However, both of these behaviours are often not environmentally friendly.”</p>
<p>These findings might in theory be used to design more impactful interventions. Since more open and honest/humble people are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly practices, perhaps those at the <em>other</em> end of these scales should be targeted. To reach people who are less open to new experiences, it might be helpful to highlight environmentally friendly practices which are already established, rather than new, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>Arguing that there’s a moral imperative to engage in pro-environmental behaviour could also fail to engage those people who are low in honesty-humility and agreeableness, who may be mistrustful of moral-based arguments. Instead, messages could be framed to emphasise personal gains — the cost savings of using electricity rather than petrol as a car fuel, for example.</p>
<p>Of course, other factors also come into play. Age, social norms, childhood experiences with nature, political ideology — all these things and more are linked to variations in environmental attitudes and behaviours. This new study confirms that personality factors can be important, too. And the team would like to see studies that take a more encompassing approach: “The use of multiple frameworks of psychology in a study, such as including all the above factors, could provide a more holistic understanding of why people act or do not act in pro-environmental ways.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/AdobeStock_52342066-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I am a nurse scientist and health services researcher. I was born and raised in a series of small towns in rural Washington State in the U.S. In September 2009, I returned to the Pacific Northwest to pursue a PhD. It was the height of the Great Recession (2008-2009) and I quickly became concerned that the recession was making it harder for people to access care in the kinds of resource-poor areas similar to where I grew up. I decided to focus my dissertation work on this area and started by carrying out interviews with public health stakeholders around Washington State. Interviews yielded widespread concern about the effects of the recession — particularly among maternal and child health (MCH) populations. Disparities in MCH outcomes like timing of entry to prenatal care (PNC), birth weight (BW), and infant mortality are long-standing and have been <a href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/maternal-infant-and-child-health">documented</a> by race/ethnicity, geography and other social characteristics groupings like education and insurance status.</p>
<h3><strong>My research</strong></h3>
<p>To explore the effects of the recession, I obtained de-identified birth certificate data from Washington State and Florida. Birth certificate data was a good fit because it allowed me to link to county level data including unemployment rate, local health department expenditures, and other community characteristics that were likely to change during the recession. Over the course of three related papers, published in <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/12552"><em>Race and Social Problems</em></a> and <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a><em>, </em>my co-authors and I analyzed relationships between MCH outcomes and disparities before, during, and after the Great Recession.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we find?</strong></h3>
<h4>Increases in disparities – worse outcomes</h4>
<p>In our <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12552-019-09272-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">first paper</a>, we used <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446274">Healthy People protocols</a> to assess the degree of disparities and the extent to which changes occurred during and after the Great Recession for seven MCH outcomes. As expected, we found that disparities increased for some groups during the recession. However, we surprised to find that there were more total increases in disparities in Washington than in Florida and more disparity increases after the Great Recession than during.</p>
<blockquote><p>WIC appears to have been beneficial for decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight.</p></blockquote>
<p>The majority of increases only occurred during one recession period (i.e. during or after but not both), but disparities for some groups and some outcomes increased during both recession periods. For example, among non-Hispanic Black mothers who entered prenatal care late or not at all (late/no PNC) disparities increased (outcomes worsened) during both recession periods. Disparity increases also appeared to predominantly cluster by race/ethnicity and individual social characteristics rather than by geography. Based on these findings, we focused further research on factors contributing to increasingly disparate outcomes in timing of PNC initiation.</p>
<h4><em>Predictors of late/no prenatal care</em></h4>
<p>In our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2486-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">second paper,</a> we used regression modeling to estimate relative contributions of individual, community, and local health department (LHD) variables on the probability of late/no PNC in Washington and Florida. Here, we found consistent contributions over time of individual-level maternal predictors for late/no PNC, the largest of which were young age and low education. However, we did identify changes in associations before compared to during the recession for some community and LHD-level predictors (e.g., % voting Republican, LHD expenditures) in non-beneficial directions.</p>
<p>In contrast, women enrolled in the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic">WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program</a> had a lower probability of late/no PNC than those without WIC. These findings suggest that policy makers and providers should consider targeted outreach to pregnant women with high individual-level disadvantage characteristics—particularly those of young age or with low education.</p>
<h4><em>WIC and improved outcomes</em></h4>
<p>In the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02937-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">third paper</a>, we studied interactions between enrollment in the WIC Program and individual characteristics in relation to birth weight. We focused on a high-need subset of the study population — those with Medicaid or no insurance. We found that WIC interactions were associated with higher birth weights for infants of mothers who were very young (age &lt;14), received late/no PNC, and among non-Hispanic Black infants. These effects are illustrated in the figure below for birth weight in grams among Black compared to White infants and infants of very young mothers compared to mothers age 30-34, with and without WIC, both before and during the recession. While disparities persisted during both periods, with or without WIC, the gap narrowed for infants of mothers who received WIC during their pregnancy.</p>

<h3><strong>What can we learn from this?</strong></h3>
<p>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated unfolding economic and social crises bear similarities to the Great Recession and there are many lessons to be learned from it and applied to the current situation. Three key takeaways from our studies are summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequality in the U.S. continues to be multi-generational, with disparities in access to care and outcomes apparent before and at birth.</li>
<li>During the Great Recession, disparities increased and widened in both Washington and Florida, despite differences in state-level economic circumstances and demographics, highlighting the need for dedicated public health funding and programs to support timely, ongoing data collection and analysis to identify and address disparities in care and outcomes at local, state, and federal levels.</li>
<li>WIC appears to have been beneficial for decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight among the very young, Black, and late/no prenatal care enrollees. However, these benefits did not appear to extend to all groups. Thus, targeted outreach and/or program modifications may be needed to expand benefits to additional groups.</li>

<p><em>On June 2, 2020, arXiv’s executive director, Dr. Eleonora Presani, presented at the <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas236">American Astronomical Society’s 236th meeting</a>, held virtually.

<h4><b>AAS Publishing Exclusive: A Discussion with the arXiv Executive Director</b></h4>
<p>by Alex Pizzuto</p>
<p>Day 2 of the meeting started strong, featuring a discussion with arXiv Executive Director <b>Eleonora Presani</b>, who detailed the current status and future outlook of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/">open access archive service</a> many of us know and love. Not only is Presani new to the role of executive director, but the role itself is only two months old, marking a step towards engaging with the scientific community more efficiently and productively. As someone equipped with both a PhD in astroparticle physics and more than 6 years of experience from a career in scientific publishing, Presani is extremely qualified to help execute the vision of arXiv.</p>
<p>Presani began her presentation with her own mantra on the dissemination of scientific research: “knowledge only exists if it is accessible.” As an organization, Presani believes that arXiv functions as the “enablers” for the sharing of this knowledge, and seeks to make accessible environments like arXiv; those which are for researchers, by researchers. To get a sense of the sheer volume of knowledge that passes through the arXiv servers, Presani quizzed her audience, revealing some dumbfounding statistics about the quantity of preprints that have been submitted:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.08.22-PM.png"><img alt="Tweets from Astrobites" class="wp-image-635 size-medium aligncenter" height="231" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.08.22-PM-300x231.png" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>The fact that about half of the funding for arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/donate">is from the community</a> is a testament to the fact that arXiv exists to serve the community.</p>
<p>Although many organizations have been slowed to a halt by the tragic global pandemic, Presani assures us that arXiv is still working hard. Over the last few months, arXiv has rolled out user-driven classification, which alerts authors when they assign their papers to a category that disagrees with arXiv’s classification algorithm. They have also been executing operational stability drills and developing a COVID-19 moderation plan, to make sure that no matter what is going on in the world, scientists can stay connected through their research.</p>
<p>Looking more to the future, we were then told about arXiv’s 3-year strategic plan (picture below). This plan is broken down into three distinct user categories (readers, authors, moderators) and discusses how each of these users can benefit in three different areas (control, impact, and collaboration). In order to successfully execute this plan, however, arXiv requires our help and wants to hear from scientific communities like the AAS, in order to learn what researchers believe are the highest impact deliverables.</p>
<p>There are also some specific tasks that the arXiv team is focusing on over the next 18 months. These include distributing some of their classification data to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a>, allowing users to contribute to classification algorithms. Additionally, arXiv will be rolling out an update to TeXLive2020 and is actively working on improving their user disambiguation techniques.</p>
<p>Focusing arXiv’s resources to decide which of these goals is completed first is no simple task. Presani highlighted how challenging it is to balance all of the lofty goals of arXiv with their limited resources and discussed how no changes should be rolled out until they are up to arXiv’s high standards, noting that “arXiv was launched in 1991, and when it launched, it was an extremely cutting-edge product and it stayed the same for 30 years. It’s important to find the right balance between being quick and keeping the high quality of the work.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>It’s an oft-repeated supposition that you can tell whether someone fancies you by their body language: if they mirror how you’re standing or moving, the theory goes, they might just like you back. But romantic partners don’t just have <em>behavioural</em> synchrony <em>—</em> in some cases, they have brain-to-brain synchrony too.</p>
<p>A pattern that has also been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/">observed</a> in musicians and their audiences, brain-to-brain synchrony is a mirroring of neural activity between individuals or groups. And according to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63596-2">study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, such synchrony in spouses could affect how they respond to their children.</p>
<p><span id="more-39715"></span></p>
<p>Atiqah Azhari from Nanyang University and colleagues first asked 24 Singaporean husband-and-wife pairs how many children they had, and the age of their youngest child. All pairs had at least one child under the age of four. Both parents also provided a “parenting response ratio”, which measured how often either the mother or father took the lead (0:5, 1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1 and 5:0).</p>
<p>The couples were then split into two conditions: half stayed in the same room, whilst the others were separated in different rooms. In both conditions, participants were played a variety of different sounds such as static noise and adult vocalisations, as well as negative and positive sounds of infants crying and laughing respectively. After hearing the sounds, participants rated how distressing they were on a scale of 1 to 5. The team also repeated the same process with control pairs of participants, who had no prior relationship.</p>
<p>Throughout the experiment, parents wore a cap measuring blood flow in the prefrontal cortex of the brain using a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy (a higher concentration of oxygenated blood is related to greater activation in that particular area). To measure synchrony between partners, the researchers looked at how similar their patterns of blood flow were over time.</p>
<p>As anticipated, couples who were sat together showed greater brain synchrony than those who were separated; this synchrony was located specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral anterior prefrontal gyrus. This was only the case for real partners: the control pairs didn’t show any greater synchrony when together than when apart, suggesting that the presence of an intimate partner, rather than simply any other person, was key to enhancing synchrony.</p>
<p>The <em>kind</em> of sound mattered too: perhaps surprisingly, the sound of infants crying did not increase synchrony between partners who were physically together, while infant laughter, adult laughter and the static sound did.</p>
<p>Given that the brain areas that showed increased synchrony are involved in attention and cognitive control, these patterns could relate to changes in attention and how people parent. This could be beneficial in positive situations, helping parents respond to their children together.</p>
<p>But if there’s a higher level of synchrony when a child is crying, then parents may “catch” or be affected by their partner’s stress, leading to less effective caregiving behaviour. This could also explain why there was no increase in synchrony in the “together” condition during the negative sounds.</p>
<p>This goes some way to explain why younger couples and couples with only one child had higher levels of synchrony compared to older couples. Older couples or those with multiple children were more experienced with parenting, and so their lower synchrony may “reflect a diminished need to respond similarly to each other as they experience greater security in their own roles as parents”, the authors write.</p>
<p>There were several limitations, however. Firstly, parents were played recordings of unknown children and adults: responses to their <em>own</em> child crying or laughing, therefore, may have been very different indeed. The study was also a one-off: looking at synchrony and its relationship to co-parenting over the course of several months or even years may give a better insight into how this mirroring works.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to tell a white lie at work: why you took a slightly too-long lunch break or how much you’ve <em>really</em> done on that big project. Often, white lies are socially useful — telling someone that you like what they’re wearing is probably a kinder option than admitting that you hate it, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance reviews, however, white lies are less beneficial. The whole point of such a review is to help improve how someone is working and identify and mitigate potential problems, so lying defeats the object. And according to a new study from Cornell University’s Lily Jampol and Vivian Zayas, published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220916622"><em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a>, it’s women who most often bear the brunt of untruthful performance reviews.</p>
<p><span id="more-39708"></span>To build on previous research suggesting that women and men receive different kinds of performance evaluations, the team recruited 182 participants who read a hypothetical scenario in which a manager was giving feedback to an underperforming employee.  They learnt that the manager had six feedback options to choose from, ranging from the most truthful and harshest statement (which most closely matched the manager’s actual evaluation of the employee’s poor performance), to the nicest but least truthful statement. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six conditions in which they saw a check mark next to the feedback that was actually given.</p>
<p>Participants then guessed whether the employee was male or female, and were asked to indicate what the manager’s perceptions were of the worker’s warmth, sincerity, confidence and competence. They also rated how likely the manager would be to assign an important task to the employee in the future.</p>
<p>As expected, participants tended to assume that employees shown less accurate but kinder feedback were women: two-thirds of participants believed that an employee given the least truthful but nicest evaluation was a woman, for instance, while just 7% thought that an employee given the most truthful and harshest feedback was female. Results also suggested some stereotyping around gender and traits: those who believed the employee was a woman also believed that the manager perceived her to be less confident, and as feedback got kinder and less accurate were more likely to assume the manager perceived her as warm.</p>
<p>A second study looked at whether people would actually be more likely to tell white lies to under-performing women than under-performing men. First, 66 participants read and rated two mediocre essays they were told had just been written by a pair of students participating remotely (in actual fact, there were no real writers taking part). Initially, participants evaluated these essays from 0 to 100% on dimensions like “focus” and “logic”, providing feedback only to the researchers.</p>
<p>At this point, the first names of each writer were revealed: Sarah and Andrew. Participants were then asked to provide ratings directly to each writer, and give some feedback, which independent coders rated on positivity and constructiveness. Participants also rated the writers on warmth, competence and future ability, and indicated what percentage of the truth they believed they had told Sarah or Andrew.</p>
<p>Mirroring results from the first study, participants were more likely to tell white lies to the writer they believed was a woman, with participants giving Sarah more favourable evaluations during the second phase of the experiment than during the first. Participants rating Andrew showed no difference in evaluation. Feedback for Sarah was also more positive than feedback for Andrew. Interestingly, the majority of participants (65%) were aware of having told white lies, but also reported that they gave equally truthful feedback to Sarah and Andrew, suggesting a lack of awareness of the gendered dimension.</p>
<p>Given the biases many women still face in the workplace, the results seem counterintuitive – surely women are rated less kindly than male colleagues? The team argues that gender stereotypes are at play here. Women are often perceived as less confident than their male counterparts, as this study showed. A manager may therefore decide to lie because they believe they will be boosting a female employee’s low confidence. Another suggestion is that women are still seen as a low-powered group: criticism, therefore, may be perceived as needless denigration.</p>
<p>Either way, such “benevolent sexism” is not helpful. Though on the surface a kinder performance evaluation may seem positive, it may be holding women back, failing to explain how they could improve at work. It can also feed into ideas that women are inferior or subordinate to men and therefore need protecting.</p>
<p>Whereas other parts of HR or management processes have used techniques such as blind hiring to remove bias, it’s harder to see what kinds of adaptations could be made to tackle these tendencies – you can’t give blind performance evaluations, after all. Understanding more about how women experience benevolent and non-benevolent sexism is a start, but there’s much more work to be done to eradicate many obstacles in their way.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about the paper "A Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck framework for modeling large scale extracellular electrodiffusion surrounding morphologically detailed neurons".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is cur- rently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracel- lular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneu- trality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentra- tions and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.</p>

Deprivation. Xenophobia. Contamination. These are some of the fears related to COVID-19. Scores of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vRmgzqnAyky3wO--t4pBDc2iw9rbMmKHjPw205p6wjQ/" target="_blank" title="Google Docs - not all are included here">COVID questionnaires</a> have popped up recently to assess fear, anxiety, stress, and depression related to the novel coronavirus and its massive disruption to daily life. Most are freely available for use as research tools, but few have been validated and peer reviewed.<br /><br />The COVID Stress Scales (CSS) developed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300463" target="_blank">Taylor and colleagues (2020)</a> were recently published in the <i>Journal of Anxiety Disorders</i>. The authors propose a new COVID Stress Syndrome, and present evidence that the CSS subscales are intercorrelated (which is suggestive of a “coherent” condition).<br /><br />To develop the CSS, representative samples of people in Canada (n=3,479) and the US (n=3,375) completed a 58-item survey on <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/" target="_blank" title="an online survey platform">Qualtrics</a>. Factor analysis identified five subscales... <br /><ol><li>COVID danger and contamination fears</li><li>COVID fears about economic consequences </li><li>COVID xenophobia</li><li>COVID compulsive checking and reassurance seeking</li><li>COVID traumatic stress symptoms</li></ol><br />...and limited the questionnaire to 36 items. I'll note that “fears about economic consequences” were restricted to a lack of supplies at grocery stores and pharmacies, rather than fears of crushing debt, eviction, hunger, and homelessness because of unemployment.<br /><br />One can view this new syndrome as a context-related extension of OCD contamination fears, compulsive checking, and <a href="https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/health-anxiety-what-it-and-how-beat-it" target="_blank">health anxiety</a> (preoccupation with the possibility of serious illness). Indeed, convergent validity was confirmed by showing correlations with established measures of those conditions. Unique aspects of COVID Stress Syndrome <span class="st">—</span> not seen in other diagnoses <span class="st">—</span> include fears that grocery stores would run out of toilet paper,<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span> and especially a fear of foreigners (xenophobia). Xenophobia is promulgated by <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239685852093169664" target="_blank">politicians</a> and amplified by bad actors on social media and <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/21/21221007/anti-asian-racism-coronavirus" target="_blank" title="How the coronavirus is surfacing America’s deep-seated anti-Asian biases">IRL</a>. I don't think xenophobia (specifically, anti-Asian sentiment) is on the list of symptoms for any DSM diagnosis. <br /><br />Basically, it seems that a coherent condition called COVID Stress Syndrome would require racist beliefs and a fear of people who are Chinese, Chinese-American, or Chinese-Canadian.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span>The prevalence of COVID Stress Syndrome in their Canadian and American  samples was not specified, nor was the cut-off point for such a diagnosis. Plenty of Americans are xenophobic, but they don't have bad dreams about coronavirus. <br /><br />In an editorial, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300451" target="_blank">Taylor and Asmundson (2020)</a> said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">It appears that people who develop COVID Stress Syndrome have pre-existing psychopathology, particularly pre-existing high levels of health anxiety and obsessive-compulsive checking and contamination symptoms. <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>It remains to be seen whether the COVID Stress Syndrome is simply an adjustment disorder, abating once the pandemic is over, or whether it will become chronic for some individuals.</b></span></blockquote><br />So much about COVID-19 “remains to be seen”, and this level of uncertainly is a major source of anxiety on its own.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span>The toilet paper question just missed the cut...included were worries about water, cleaning supplies, medications, etc. The original version also included “worry about looting &amp; rioting.”<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b><span style="color: black;"> One could really say </span></span><span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: black;">East Asian people more broadly.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/625592634/0/oupblogpsychology/">Moving beyond toxic masculinity: a Q&amp;A with Ronald Levant</a></h4>

<p>In 2018, the American Psychological Association released its first ever Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men. At the time of the release, these guidelines were met with criticism by some who viewed them as pathologizing masculinity, but since the guidelines were released the discussion of “toxic masculinity” has spread to all areas of our society and culture. Ronald F. Levant has served as president of American Psychological Association as well as president of the association’s Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinities. Levant has been a leader in the research on the psychology of men. We spoke with him about how traditional masculinity ideology is conceptualized by psychologists, how it plays out in our society, and why it’s important from a psychological standpoint to move beyond the concept of toxic masculinity.</p><p><strong>Sarah Butcher: </strong>You observe that the feminist movement opened up more options for girls and women to express their identity but that there was no corresponding movement for men. Why do you think that is?</p><p><strong>Ronald Levant:</strong> In the 1960’s amid the civil rights and LGBTQ movements, women decided once again (think of the suffrage movement) to address their oppression.  The result is what is called second wave feminism. Over the 70s to the 90s many men felt defensive in the face of women’s newfound assertiveness, resulting in what was then called a masculinity crisis (think <em>Bridges over Madison County</em>). This led to several different types of movements. One that gained prominence was the mythopoetic movement (remember Robert Bly and <em>Iron John</em>?), which did help some men become more comfortable with their emotions but was also was suffused with misogyny. Others like the Promise Keepers and the Men’s Rights Organization were even more blatantly misogynistic. What we advocate is a movement that is inspired by the ideals of gender equality, one that would help men ditch the burdens of dominance, and teach men that they can be men without the trappings of masculinity.</p><p><strong>SB: </strong>You coined the term Traditional Masculinity Ideology—how do you define it, and how do you see it playing out in the lives of men?</p><p><strong>RL: </strong>The most current definition is the holistic set of beliefs about how boys and men should, and should not, think, feel and behave. As far as current research is concerned, we’re typically looking at seven sets of prescriptive and proscriptive norms–avoidance of femininity; negativity toward sexual minorities; self-reliance through mechanical skills, toughness, dominance, importance of sex, and restrictive emotionality.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: Do you see any biological component to masculinity, or is it entirely socially constructed?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: There may be a biological basis to masculinity, but I am not aware of any solid support for this proposition. More importantly, we are psychologists not biologists, and we study masculinity as a social and psychological phenomenon.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: In recent decades, men have begun shouldering more of the burden of domestic labor and childrearing (although far from an equal share). Why does that pose a challenge to traditional masculinity ideology?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Good questions. It poses a challenge to traditional masculinity ideology because it violates the avoid all things feminine norm, because childcare (and nurturance in general) is considered feminine.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: Research has shown that men have a harder time expressing (and even naming) their emotions. Why is that and what are the consequences for themselves and others?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Decades ago, I noticed this in my work in the Boston University Fatherhood Project, and curiosity drove me to study the emotion socialization research literature in developmental psychology. Boys start out life more emotionally expressive than girls as neonates and retain this advantage over the first year of life, but from ages two to six—due to the childhood socialization of emotions, in which boys are made to feel ashamed of themselves for expressing vulnerable and caring emotions—many lose this expressive ability. This study formed the base for my normative male alexithymia hypothesis. “Alexithymia” means no words for emotions. My hypothesis is that socialization guided by traditional masculinity ideology, and in particular the norm of restrictive emotionality, produces a mild form of alexithymia in men, who cannot give a good account of their inner lives. This has enormous implications for relationships, stress management, and mental health. I later developed a treatment for such men called Alexithymia Reduction Treatment.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: As you argue, most violence is committed by men, yet most men aren’t violent. What is it that leads a minority of men to engage in violent behavior, and what role does traditional masculinity ideology play?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: This is a good question. The short answer is that we don’t know why some men are violent and others are not. Various theories have been proposed, with social-situational factors having more weight than personality factors. What we do know is:</p><ul type="disc"><li>The vast majority of boys and men are not violent.</li><li>The vast majority of adult men do not endorse traditional masculinity ideology.</li><li>There are literally 40 + years of research showing correlations between all of the masculinity scales and harmful outcomes, and many of these are related to violence.</li><li>We <em>think</em> that the correlation is due to the boys and men who score at the very high end of these scales. Thus, high endorsement of or conformity to the norms of traditional masculinity is associated with rape myth acceptance, disdain for racial and sexual minorities, or aggression, for example.</li></ul><p><strong>SB</strong>: What role does traditional masculinity ideology play in sexual violence, ranging from sexual harassment to rape?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Based on the avoid femininity norm, boys prefer playing with other boys rather than girls, and thus rarely get to know girls as persons. In puberty boys become very interested in girls, but as sex objects. Objectifying women is at the very foundation of sexual violence.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: You also examine different versions of masculinity ideology such as African American masculinity and Latinx masculinity. How can the theory of intersectionality help us understand these different masculinities?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: The theory of intersectionality says that our overall identity and sense of self is a composite of a number of specific identities that may relate to our race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age cohort, etc. So, for example, African American men have to fulfil the requirements of the male role (e.g., providing for one’s family) impeded by racism, which has reduced educational and employment opportunities for black men.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: What is the role of traditional masculinity in mental and physical health?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Traditional masculinity ideology emphasizes toughness, self-reliance and never revealing vulnerability. In the areas of physical and mental health this translates into taking health risks, not seeking professional help when needed, and relying on alcohol for stress reduction.</p><p><strong>SB: </strong>Based on your clinical experience, what are some of the most effective techniques for men who want to escape the prison of traditional masculinity ideology?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: The most effective techniques I have found is helping men who are unable to verbalize their emotions to learn how to do that, to open up their hearts to their families. This often involves first dealing with their fears that this will somehow emasculate them, strip them of their ‘man card,’ and along the way dealing with their sense of shame resulting from violating the male code.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: What role do fathers play in the propagation of traditional masculinity ideology, and what are some tips for fathers wishing to model a more gender-neutral approach?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: The “essential father hypothesis” posits that the father’s essential role is to model masculinity and heterosexuality for his sons. Although this idea has been largely discredited in academia it is still very prominent among the public. A better alternative is the involved father role, in which dads share parenting duties equally with their female partners.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@healing_photographer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Aarón Blanco Tejedor</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/men?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/moving-beyond-toxic-masculinity-a-qa-with-ronald-levant/">Moving beyond toxic masculinity: a Q&amp;A with Ronald Levant</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/625592634/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/625592634/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/" rel="nofollow">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-emotional-toll-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-teenagers/" rel="nofollow">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/why-politics-is-so-polarized/" rel="nofollow">Why politics is so polarized, even though Americans agree on most key issues</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em>Dan Carney</p>
<p>A key feature of interviews is open-ended questioning inviting the recall of past experiences and memories — what psychologists call “autobiographical” memory. Having to provide this information accurately and coherently, combined with the stress of the situation, can often make being interviewed a demanding and uncomfortable experience.</p>
<p>That is especially true of autistic people, who may have difficulties with <em>both</em> autobiographical memory <em>and</em> open-ended questioning. Many autistic people report job interviews as a major barrier to employment, and it’s possible that interview difficulties may also be compounding, or partially causing, problems in legal and healthcare contexts where open-ended interviews requiring autobiographical recall are a common feature. Autistic people are more likely to be involved in criminal investigations, for instance, and to experience physical and mental health difficulties.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361320909174">paper published in <em>Autism</em></a>, a team led by Jade Norris from the University of Bath has examined techniques that may help autistic people in these situations. <span id="more-39687"></span>Thirty autistic and thirty typically developing (TD) adults were given eighteen questions asking them to recall specific life events relating to common scenarios across three contexts: criminal justice (e.g. “tell me about a specific instance when… you went to the bank”), healthcare (e.g. “…you vomited”), and employment (e.g. “…you’ve met a deadline”).</p>
<p>Sometimes participants were also given support in the form of prompts. For some questions, they were asked for general autobiographical information before the question (<em>semantic prompting; </em>e.g. “do you enjoy going to the cinema?”). For others, they received verbal prompting for the specific information required, alongside a pie chart displaying these prompts, after the question (<em>visual-verbal prompting</em> (V-VP); e.g. setting, people present, actions performed). Responses were graded for specificity, with each unit of information also categorized for type (episodic vs. semantic) and relevance (relevant vs. irrelevant).</p>
<p>Overall, the autistic group’s responses were less specific, and contained a higher proportion of irrelevant semantic information, than those of the TD group. The key finding was that V-VP was most beneficial support technique, associated with greater overall specificity, and a higher overall proportion of relevant episodic information, in both groups.</p>
<p>This suggests that verbal prompting may be most useful when combined with visual aids, and that this may apply to a range of interview situations. The researchers speculate that V-VP may aid the interrelated recall of information (e.g. who did what to whom, where, and when) — something autistic people can have a problem with. It may also reduce the cognitive demands of open-ended interviews, such as working out unaided exactly what — and how much — information to provide.</p>
<p>Semantic prompting was not as broadly helpful, but did benefit both groups, in the same ways, on the employment-based questions. The authors argue that this shows the importance of context: semantic prompting may be most useful in employment interviews, where it’s important to convey favourable personal characteristics, and give examples that show these.</p>
<p>The fact that the benefits of V-VP and semantic prompting were observed in both groups implies that techniques that benefit autistic people are also more generally useful. However, the finding that autistic people’s responses were less specific and semantically relevant overall suggests that — for them — any improvements may be more meaningful, enabling them in some instances to provide sufficiently detailed and relevant information where they might not otherwise have been able to do so.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>The authors also consider ways in which subsequent work could extend on this study. Firstly, they suggest that groups be matched on gender (which wasn’t done here), given that gender differences have been observed in the kind of details reported in autobiographical memories. Secondly, the authors point out that autistic and TD people may have different levels of familiarity with the situations used in the questions. A survey conducted ahead of the study found that TD individuals reported more frequent engagement with the scenarios used for the criminal justice (e.g. going to the supermarket, cinema) and employment questions (e.g. working in a team, being organized) than autistic people, with the latter group reporting more experience of the healthcare-related contexts. Norris and her colleagues suggest that future work should attempt to address how these disparities may affect recall.</p>
<p>Overall, however, this is a well-designed study that offers a glimpse into how interviews may be made more manageable for both autistic and TD individuals. The findings suggest that these prompting techniques may — by reducing cognitive demand — help people provide more detailed and relevant information.</p>

<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infectious agent and is increasingly common in young people. HPV is linked to several cancers – especially cervical cancer – and genital warts (GW).</p>
<p><strong><em>How high is the burden of HPV related diseases?</em></strong></p>
<p>Every year, a large number of women and men are affected by the anal, cervical, oropharyngeal, penile, and vaginal cancers linked to HPV. Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common malignancy among women worldwide, <a href="https://www.hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/XWX.pdf?t=1589902406273">with more than 300,000 deaths in 2018 alone.</a></p>
<p>Besides cervical cancers, GWs are also common manifestations of genital HPV infection. Although usually not regarded as a serious condition, GWs cause physical symptoms such as pruritus and pain, and have a negative impact on sexual life resulting in significant loss of quality of life for those with the sexually transmitted infection.</p>
<p><strong><em>How can I get protection against cancers and/or genital warts?</em></strong></p>
<p>The next generation of children and young adults may not face HPV related cancer and/or GWs thanks to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The vaccine helps protect against certain types of HPV that can lead to cancer or GWs. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine targets virus types 16 and 18 – the two types that cause 80% of cervical cancer cases – and also HPV types 6 and 11, associated with 85–95% of GW cases.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is the quadrivalent HPV vaccine effective?</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08753-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our study published today in <em>BMC Public Health</em></a> summarizes the available data assessing the real-world impact of publicly funded quadrivalent HPV vaccination from the beginnings up to the 13th of January 2020. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether quadrivalent HPV vaccine has any effects in the prevention of GWs.</p>
<p>Eight randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were included where HPV vaccines (3 doses) or placebos were administered to females or males (in one study) and then the number of GW cases was compared between the vaccinated and placebo group. Eight time trend studies were also included to assess the population-level effect of the quadrivalent HPV vaccination by comparing the prevalence of GWs between the pre- and post-vaccination periods.</p>
<blockquote><p>The quadrivalent HPV vaccine significantly reduced the risk of GWs</p></blockquote>
<p>The quadrivalent HPV vaccine significantly reduced the risk of GWs. In the post-vaccination period, the number of GW events in women was considerably lower. Although young men were not vaccinated, the number of GW cases was also reduced among them, to be attributed most likely to the indirect protection provided by the vaccination of women. Subgroup analysis showed that GWs were reduced more substantially in those under 21 years of age than in older persons.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25744474/">The findings are consistent with previous reviews and meta-analyses</a>, where it was also found that the prevalence of GWs decreased significantly in vaccinated girls and the quadrivalent prophylactic vaccination could prevent HPV infection both in men and women.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where has the quadrivalent HPV vaccine been introduced?</em></strong></p>
<p>Gardasil® has been the vaccine of choice worldwide. It has been chosen by health authorities in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden for regional or national vaccination programs. In Australia, cases of GW have nearly disappeared since 2007 – this was the year when the national vaccination program against cervical cancer using the quadrivalent vaccine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21970896/">was introduced as a school based program for 12- and 13-year-old girls</a>. By October 2019, 98 countries introduced HPV vaccines through national immunization programs.</p>
<p>Our meta-analysis gives strong evidence for the effectiveness of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Such knowledge can help governments with making decisions about the implementation of the vaccination in their countries for young females and also males, preferably through school-based programs.</p>

<p>In April 2014 the UK government launched the ‘NHS Visitor and Migrant Cost Recovery Programme Implementation Plan’ which set out a series of policy changes to recoup costs from ‘chargeable’ (largely non-UK born) patients. In England alone roughly 75% of all diagnoses of Tuberculosis (TB) will be made in people born abroad. Because of this, the authors of this manuscript set out to assess the impact of the Cost Recovery Programme (CRP) on the quality of healthcare received by those not eligible for free NHS healthcare. Utilizing a dataset of 2237 diagnosed TB cases the authors found that median time-to-treatment after the introduction of the CRP increased by 20 days from 69 to 89 days for non-UK patients. They also found a significant change in the number of years migrant patients had been living in the UK before diagnosis. Rising from 10 years pre-CRP to 14.8 years post CRP. With delays in the diagnosis of TB increasing morbidity and mortality it is imperative that diagnosis is made as early as possible. With direct significant relationships between the introduction of the CRP and an increase in time-to-treatment the authors argue that restricting healthcare access for non-UK populations undermines national efforts to eliminate TB and conclude that governments have a “moral and legal obligation” to uphold the right to the highest attainable standard of health for all people, no matter their immigration status.</p>

<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 should be characterized as a pandemic. Since then we have witnessed the devastating and unpredictable spread of COVID-19 globally resulting in unprecedented lockdowns on a global scale. Aside from the increased burden on healthcare systems and the devastating humanitarian loss, researchers are now facing significant challenges in appropriately conducting statistical analyses of COVID-19 data to meet the WHO goal of evaluating “as fast as possible the effect of adjunctive and supportive therapies”. With appropriate statistical models playing a major role in “fighting panic with information” to reduce or eliminate the risk of bias across clinical and epidemiological studies the Guest Editors of this collection describe the most striking challenges experienced by statisticians and data analysts alike.</p>

<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a continuing global health problem and can lead to serious maternal and neonatal/foetal complications. More recently the introduction of information and communication technology in healthcare has resulted in new technical support for the treatment of GDM. In this study the authors conduct a meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of telemedicine (health services and medical activities provided by healthcare professionals through remote communication technologies) for the management of women with GDM. Identifying a total of 32 Randomized control trials and a total of 5108 patients the authors found that the use of telemedicine had significant improvements in GDM measures as compared to the standard care group. They also identified that the use of telemedicine lowered indices of cesarean section, neonatal hypoglycemia, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth and neonatal asphyxia, amongst others. The authors conclude that use of communication technology and telemedicine had significant positive effects on the control of GDM and also significantly reduce the risk of maternal and neonatal/fetal complications.</p>

<p><em>Octopus vulgaris</em> is one of the most iconic species of neurobiology research. This is mainly attributed to its reputation as one of the most intelligent studied invertebrates, possessing both long and short term memory capability and a striking ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. However, given the high level of parental care required for successful spawning of offspring, laboratory research and experimental populations have been notoriously difficult to maintain. In this study the authors present a novel option for a parameter-controlled artificial seawater standalone egg incubation system that has the ability to replace the significant level of maternal care required, allowing the successful embryonic development of small-egged octopus species under laboratory conditions.</p>

<p>With more than half of all adults reporting having experienced neck and shoulder pain it has become the second most common musculoskeletal disorder. Unsurprisingly it is most common amongst office workers who perform low intensity, but continuous movements as part of their role. Previous research has identified a relationship between resistance training and pain relief, but none have come to a consensus on the best resistance training frequency. Thus, the authors here set out to test which dose of resistance training achieved the greatest reduction in pain. Using a cohort of 27 individuals the authors imposed two interventional routines. One cohort completed one 10 minute session daily, 5 days per week and the other completed two 10 minutes sessions daily, 5 days per week. The authors found no difference between the two interventions, finding instead that any bout of high intensity resistance training significantly reduced levels of workplace related pain and improved the quality of life of office workers.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>In 2011, a US-based study <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/802291">published in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em></a> found that people with hearing loss were more likely to develop dementia. This alarming result prompted a number of follow-up studies, which have <a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.11.004">substantiated the link</a> and further <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/5/3/ENEURO.0263-17.2018">explored the risk</a>. But the mechanism of <em>how</em> hearing loss raises this risk has not been clear.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhaa061/5810460">new study</a>, by a team at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, offers an explanation. The researchers found that gradual hearing loss (the sort commonly experienced into older age) “profoundly” alters normal processes in the brain’s cortex and hippocampus, and that this impairs memory. This work was conducted on mice, not humans. But it provides useful new insights into what might happen in people.</p>
<p><span id="more-39675"></span>Sudden sensory loss is known to trigger widespread reorganisation of key brain areas. This “cortical plasticity” is an adaptive way of dealing with a challenge. If someone suddenly loses their vision, for example, areas of the cortex that were dedicated to vision can switch to processing touch and hearing data, enhancing these senses.</p>
<p>Information from our senses plays a big part in the formation of our memories, so we have strong links between the sensory cortices and the hippocampus, our most important memory structure. The sudden loss of a sense can therefore also produce disruptive changes in the hippocampus — and memory impairments. Eventually, though, this settles, limiting the disruption to memory.</p>
<p>A gradual deterioration is different, though. Typical age-related hearing loss starts with impairments in hearing higher frequencies, then mid-range frequencies, then low frequencies. “During cumulative hearing loss, a steady state in terms of sensory input is not achieved,” comments senior author Denise Manahan-Vaughan. “Rather the brain has to constantly adapt to an ever-changing sensory input.”</p>
<p>For the study, led by Daniela Beckmann, the team used a strain of mice that serve as a model for typical <a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Content%2520Images/presbycusis.pdf">gradual hearing loss in older people</a>. To look at how this hearing loss might reorganise the brain, the researchers examined changes in the animals’ neurotransmitter receptors, a key part of the chemical messaging system that allows for healthy communication between brain cells.</p>
<p>The team found that progressive hearing loss caused a reorganisation of brain areas, with neurotransmitter receptor changes taking place in both sensory-processing regions in the cortex and the hippocampus. This process also impaired cellular processes related to memory that take place in the hippocampus, and the mice developed clear deficits in spatial memory (their memory for where they’ve been and the layout of their environment).</p>
<p>This constant change in the mice’s neurotransmitter receptor expression during cumulative hearing loss uses up tremendous resources, says Manahan-Vaughan. Not only do memory structures receive less sensory information — because hearing is becoming impaired — but also the information that these structures receive from the cortex constantly changes (with the progression from high-frequency through to low-frequency loss). “This is very likely why memory becomes impaired,” she says.</p>
<p>If this process is mirrored in the human brain, hearing loss may, then, amplify or accelerate deficits in cognition caused by the degeneration of brain cells with older age. As the researchers write, “our results suggest that age-related hearing loss may be a contributor to loss of function in the hippocampus that occurs with age.”</p>
<p>This process does not itself <em>cause</em> Alzheimer’s disease (or vascular dementia, which is also relatively common). But in acting as such a drain on the brain’s resources, and interfering with memory, hearing loss could make it much harder for the brain to cope with another challenge — such as the protein plaques and tangles that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease. And this has practical implications, the researchers argue.</p>
<p>“I think my study shows that it is extremely important to start wearing a hearing aid when hearing loss becomes apparent,” says Manahan-Vaughan. “I wouldn’t go so far as to say this will prevent dementia — this is another physiological process entirely — but wearing a hearing aid is likely to slow down the progress of memory impairments that occur in healthy ageing, simply because one reduces the demands on the brain to adapt to the progressive loss of a sensory modality.”</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about the paper "On Robot Compliance: A Cerebellar Control Approach".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed. Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators mimicking human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant movements.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/iphone-313845_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Children today seem like they were born with an iPad in hand. Toddlers might not be potty trained yet, but they know how to switch from one app to the other, Facetime their grandparents and even change WiFi networks. Researchers are still unsure as to what effects this precocious use of technology, particularly increased use of the internet, will have on children.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11908 alignleft" height="112" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/HBN_logo_4color-300x112.jpg" width="300" />In an attempt to address this important question, we analyzed data from the openly shared Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network. Children ages 7-15—and their parents—answered questions about their internet use, how well they sleep, how much exercise they get, and problems they might be having in school, at home, or with other social relationships. Each child also underwent comprehensive psychiatric assessments, which allowed us to examine how internet use might be associated with a range of different clinical syndromes including depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because many youth have more than one of these conditions, we also examined how comorbidity across these conditions may also be associated with problematic patterns of internet use.</p>
<p>We found that children who show problematic levels of internet use also have higher rates of depression, ASD and ADHD. We could not discriminate whether those with one or more of these disorders go on to have higher rates of problematic internet use, or if increased internet use was related to the development of psychiatric disorders and functional impairment. Nonetheless, these findings add to a growing literature suggesting associations between mental health disorders and problematic internet usage. We must proceed with caution: how can we discover what constitutes healthy patterns of internet use and make sure our children are taking advantage of all the benefits the internet has to offer while also protecting them from potential consequences?</p>
<p>Our study focuses on behaviors associated with internet use, rather than quantities of use. This is an important distinction, as it is more reminiscent of measures of addiction, which are primarily defined by behavioral patterns rather than subjective reports that someone “drinks too much”. Before we can discriminate between problematic and non problematic internet use that may be defined differently for different children in different contexts, it will be important to identify behavioral markers of harmful internet use. Examples of such behaviors include displays of aggression when internet time is limited or in response to inquiries about online activities, loss of sleep, negative effects on schoolwork and/or relationships, or a tendency to turn to the internet to avoid unpleasant or difficult activities. Perhaps this shift in focus is more important now than ever, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic increases in internet use that it has necessitated for connecting, socializing and learning. For many, particularly those in the most affected areas under lockdown, these increases will undoubtedly make conventional wisdom about what constitutes “too much” or “too little” internet seem out of touch at least in the near future.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most worrisome learning point from our work is that problematic internet usage in children is associated with global functional impairment – beyond the presence of any formal psychiatric disorder. This suggests that a child with ADHD who exhibits problematic internet usage patterns may be more likely to have difficulty in daily life functioning than a child with ADHD and less problematic usage. An important caveat: our findings are based on a one-time snapshot. We can’t draw conclusions regarding internet use as a cause or consequence of childhood disorders. Also, the findings only apply to problematic internet use, not to regular use. In fact, internet use that is not excessive or problematic could actually have beneficial influences on child functioning. We plan to follow up these youth to gain more insight into the nature of the relationships between functional impairment, psychiatric disorders and problematic internet use.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/house-2683861_640-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Loneliness is not a twenty first century creation. Nor is it the result of the physical distancing, self-isolation and distant and remote social relationships we are experiencing as a result of COVID-19. Like joy or sorrow, loneliness can be seen as part of being human. It has been described and experienced by people of different ages, across different cultures and in different historical periods.</p>
<p><strong>What is loneliness?</strong></p>
<p>Loneliness is the feeling or response we have when our social relationships fail to match our expectations or desires. This could be because the quality of the relations is superficial or lacking in the depth and meaning we would like. It can also be because the number of our relationships is lower than we would like. Loneliness may also result when how we experience our relationships, in person, on-line or by telephone, does not match our expectations. This is especially relevant during the distant and remote socializing we are experiencing during COVID-19. On-line or telephone conversations may combat loneliness by enabling us to keep in touch with our family and friends. Alternatively, these types of contact may make us feel lonelier by reminding us how much we miss personal contact. Loneliness is not the same as living alone, spending time alone or being socially isolated.</p>
<p><strong>Why does loneliness matter?</strong></p>
<p>Loneliness was once seen as a problem that was only experienced by older people. Indeed it was often seen as part of the normal ageing process. Now it is clear that loneliness effects people of all ages.  This is important because being lonely is now seen as so serious that is seen as a public health problem. We now have a Minister for Loneliness and national strategies to combat loneliness. Much of the drive to tackle loneliness is because research has associated it with a range of health problems. These include death, chronic physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, depression and mental health as well as health behaviors such as decreased physical activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Loneliness is increasingly being defined as a medical or health care problem rather than one of wellbeing and quality of life</p></blockquote>
<p>Loneliness is increasingly being defined as a medical or health care problem rather than one of wellbeing and quality of life. We know that those people who experience loneliness reported lower levels of wellbeing, quality of life and life satisfaction. In the flurry of activity focused on the health problems associated with loneliness the links with wellbeing are overlooked. However these are very important and are why I would argue that loneliness really matters. All of us, regardless of age, evaluate our wellbeing and quality of life and this can be reduced by loneliness. For this reason alone, we need to understand loneliness and what factors can make people vulnerable to experiencing loneliness. This is especially important for older adults where national and international policies focus on living well in later life and of having a ‘good old age’. These policy goals mean that we need to understand the drivers of loneliness in later life if we are going to  develop robust ways of addressing loneliness and support a meaningful and good quality of life for our older citizens.</p>
<p><strong> What types of factors are related to loneliness?</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-large wp-image-11912" height="380" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/loneliness-1024x608.png" width="640" />There are three different types of factors that may make older people vulnerable to loneliness. First there are individual characteristics such as widowhood or bereavement, low income or poor health. Secondly there are community and neighborhood factors such as the availability of parks or availability of facilities such as libraries. Thirdly there can be national or societal level factors such as policies and attitudes to older people. We know very little about how community or neighborhood factors are linked to loneliness. In our study we looked at two area characteristics – the index of multiple deprivation and area type (urban or rural). We studied their relationship with two measures of loneliness for 4,663 adults aged 50 and over who took part in the 2014 wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).</p>
<p><strong>Identifying lonely places</strong></p>
<p>Overall, 18% of participants reported that they experienced loneliness and 25% that they often felt lonely in the area where they lived. It is important to remember that just over two thirds of participants, 68%, did not report either form of loneliness. We found no difference  for either measure of loneliness between participants living in urban and rural areas. There was no relationship between individual loneliness and the deprivation score for the community where participants resided.  There a significant statistical relationship between the level of deprivation of an area and levels of area based loneliness. Those living in the most deprived communities were 53% more likely to report experiencing loneliness in the area than those living in the least deprived areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>Those living in the most deprived communities were 53% more likely to report experiencing loneliness in the area than those living in the least deprived areas.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Integrating area and place of residence in loneliness research</strong></p>
<p>Existing evidence investigating the factors that make older people, and other age groups, vulnerable to loneliness have focused upon individual characteristics such as marital status or household size. We also have evidence linking loneliness to transitions or changes in circumstances such as retirement, bereavement, becoming a carer or the onset of chronic illness. We have extended our understanding  of loneliness by demonstrating a link with deprivation and now need to identify the components of deprivation-housing stock, lack of community facilities, transport, availability of blue-green spaces or lack of community cohesion and trust that are creating lonely places.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>The spread of bad news — fake or otherwise — is likely to be on everybody’s minds at the moment. Whether it’s legitimate updates on the spread or symptoms of coronavirus, or sensationalism more to do with page clicks than scientific fact, it can be hard to tune out of the news cycle — and to know what information you should be passing on to friends and family.</p>
<p>Past research has found that alarming information is likely to spread further than positive information; we’re also more likely to share news that confirms our own beliefs and biases. But what impact does the experience of stress have on the sharing of negative or alarming news? A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62399-9">new study</a> published in <em>Scientific Reports </em>suggests a complex relationship between the two.</p>
<p><span id="more-39666"></span>To examine the relationship between stress and the spread of alarming information, Nathalie Popovic at the University of Konstanz and colleagues recruited 141 participants, who were split into two groups. Half completed a control task, writing notes for a hypothetical job interview that only they would see. The other half prepared the same notes — but, in this condition, were then asked to explain to two interviewers why they were a good fit for the job and perform a mental arithmetic task in order to raise their levels of stress.</p>
<p>Both groups then read six articles about Triclosan, a controversial chemical substance sometimes used in toothpaste, detergents, soaps, and other consumer goods. Each article took a different position on the substance, containing  a variety of positive, negative and neutral statements about it (despite widespread use, some research suggests it may not be safe). Before and after reading the information, they were asked whether they had heard of Triclosan, whether they were likely to have been exposed to it, and how they perceived the risk of chemical substances in general and Triclosan specifically. They were also given 17 minutes to write a message to another participant about Triclosan.</p>
<p>Throughout the experiment — at twelve to fifteen minute intervals<span> —</span><span> subjective stress levels were measured using a scale of one to ten and cortisol was measured using saliva samples.</span></p>
<p>All participants reported an increase in concern after reading articles about Triclosan. But participants in the stress group — who had higher levels of cortisol — were <em>less</em> influenced by the articles, showing a smaller increase in concern than those in the control group. They were also less likely to share alarming information in their messages to other participants. The bigger the increase in cortisol, the smaller the increase in concern. But those who reported <em>subjective</em> feelings of stress — even if unrelated to the task at hand — were both more concerned and more likely to share alarming information.</p>
<p>Why the contrast? In a <a href="https://socialsciences.nature.com/channels/1745-behind-the-paper/posts/acute-stress-reduces-the-social-amplification-of-risk-perception">supporting article</a>, co-author Wolfgang Gaissmaier suggests that acute physiological stress reactions may result in adaptive processes intended to calm us down. For instance, we may naturally downplay negative information when stressed, reducing the perception of risk and leaving us better able to respond to the situation in front of us. <em>Feeling</em> stressed, on the other hand, may make us feel more alarmed about risky situations, even when they’re not directly related to the source of our anxiety — and may make us more likely to share that stress with others via alarming information.</p>
<p>Both reactions have downsides. The endocrine stress reaction may make us <em>under</em>estimate risk, potentially blinding us to genuinely dangerous situations. <em>Over</em>estimating risk, as was seen in subjectively stressed participants, might also get us into trouble: the team uses the example of anti-vaxxers, who erroneously judge vaccines as dangerous and therefore put themselves at risk of serious illness.</p>
<p>There have been ongoing discussions about the spread of alarming views — including those of anti-vaxxers — for the last few years; never have they been more relevant than at the moment, when much of the world is wracked with anxiety and faced with a seemingly endless stream of bad news. Understanding the circumstances in which negative information is more or less likely to spread may help us tackle it before it does too much damage.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/624857730/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why anti-vaxxers are rising again</a></h4>

<p>In the midst of a health crisis when our only hope is a new vaccine, many have begun to wonder how those with anti-vaccination sentiments might respond to the current COVID-19 crisis. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/health/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-intl/index.html">Many have guessed</a> that the only natural, rational response would be for anti-vaxxers to change their minds and wholeheartedly embrace the prospect of a new vaccine. After all, there is a prevailing theory that anti-vaccine sentiment arises at least in part from a collective amnesia about the true scourge of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccines, so the argument goes, are a victim of their own success, resulting in a situation in which people do not remember why they are getting vaccinated because the diseases that the vaccines prevent against have been absent for so long. If this theory is true, then in a situation in which we are face-to-face with the ill effects of an infectious pathogen, we should all readily embrace a new vaccine.</p><p>It turns out that the anti-vaxxer response to COVID-19 and the prospect of a new vaccine, much like science denialism more generally, is much more complex than that. The response also seems to suggest that the idea that amnesia about diseases that have been largely conquered by vaccines is probably not the primary reason for anti-vaccine sentiments. So how have people with anti-vaccine tendencies responded to COVID-19? While it’s still too soon to have a complete picture of this, especially since no new vaccine has been rolled out yet, several interesting patterns have emerged.</p><p>Staunch anti-vaxxers still oppose vaccines, including potential new coronavirus vaccines, and are active at spreading misinformation. Those who have not made up their minds about whether vaccines are safe <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/anti-vaccination-community-divided-how-respond-to-coronavirus-pandemic">are now wavering more</a> than they were previously. Whereas before they may have been slightly more inclined in the anti-vaccine direction, now they are questioning those viewpoints more. They do seem to remain amenable to being persuaded.</p><p>Public figures, such as politicians and musicians, who are staunch anti-vaxxers <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://theconversation.com/what-impact-will-the-coronavirus-pandemic-have-on-anti-vaxxers-135153">are facing more opposition now</a>. Crisis situations have the tendency to bring certain background issues into high relief. People who may have found anti-vaxxers to be somewhat irritating but not a direct threat are now viewing them differently and thus more social pressure is being placed on anti-vaxxers to abandon their views and change their behaviors.</p><p>Still, anti-vaxxers are very active and very vocal, both about potentially refusing a new vaccine for coronavirus but also<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/a-fake-pandemic-antivaxxers-are-spreading-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories/"> increasingly voicing conspiracy theories</a> about coronavirus itself. These conspiracy theory claims run the gamut, from claiming the virus is not as bad as public officials note to warning people that public officials and government bodies like the CDC are not to be trusted.</p><p>Another very disturbing development is the migration of objections to a putative coronavirus vaccine away from a scientific and health basis and toward a more general political basis. Anti-vaxxers are now linking stay-at-home orders and the hoped-for vaccines as assaults on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html">liberty and freedom</a>. Although anti-vaxxers have always made personal liberty a part of their message, by incorporating objections to a coronavirus vaccine into the broader context of freedom, they have taken this link to an extreme.</p><p>Heidi Munoz Gelisner, a leader in anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protests, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html">told a reporter</a> at the <em>New York Times</em>, “we have always been about freedom.” This adds a new dimension to our efforts to ensure that there is swift uptake of a coronavirus vaccine as soon as it becomes available. Targeting the pro-vaccine message on issues of vaccine safety and efficacy may not address this broader issue. Of course, the notion that vaccines involve a personal liberty aspect is faulty: it is long recognized that no one has the right to jeopardize the health of others, especially children, and therefore that democracies can legitimately enforce vaccine requirements. Nevertheless, Americans are perhaps more insistent about a broad range of personal liberties than citizens of any other country and therefore we will have to consider ways to address this aspect of anti-vaccination sentiment as well.</p><p>More than <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01221-y">90 vaccines</a> against the virus that causes COVID-19 are now in various stages of development and the most optimistic predictions would give us a viable one in a year to 18 months. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.axios.com/what-experts-say-works-for-combating-coronavirus-misinformation-146084b8-1312-403d-b948-3e190f16b7f3.html">Research</a> by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, indicates that we can no longer rely on debunking myths about vaccines after they have been promulgated throughout the media. Rather, her work calls for “proactive messaging,” in which groups of experts begin to thwart anti-vaccination messages before a crisis promoted by misinformation begins. Thus, we need to start immediately to use evidence-based communication methods to preempt the different varieties of misinformation about a vaccine for COVID-19.

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/05/20/remembering-the-caregivers/">Remembering the Caregivers</a></h4>

<img alt="pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-1-1-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With a rapidly aging population of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) starting dialysis, the demands on caregivers have increased.  The need for help with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing), mobility, transportation, social support and food preparation are often not anticipated.  The burden of these additional roles and lack of support can have a major negative impact on the caregivers physical, social and emotional health.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a> publication, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01830-9">Shah et al.</a> compared the health related quality of life and the care related quality of life among caregivers of older individuals (&gt;75 years of age) receiving dialysis or conservative care (medical management only).  Caregivers completed surveys that assessed their health related quality of life and experience as caregivers  These surveys addressed areas that healthcare teams often forget such as activities outside care-giving, social support, institutional support, control over caring and relationship with t<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11898 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-300x200.png" width="300" />he care recipient. Utilizing this survey highlights the changes in the caregiver’s life that are often not considered in counseling about end stage kidney disease management with patients and the families. While there was no difference in the HRQoL, the caregivers of dialysis patients reported a worse carer experience, where the survey results of this group reflected the perception of providing an ‘intense’ level of care to recipients in bad health and for more than 20 hours/weeks. This is especially striking considering 70% of the caregivers surveyed had been providing this level of care for &gt;2 years.  These findings highlight the need to expand the dialysis preparations and the support provided to caregivers.</p>
<p>Currently, protocols focus on education about dialysis modality options, early referrals for dialysis access planning/creation and information for the patient about the dialysis procedure.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/15/suppl_3/8/1849543">Most of the data</a> that has helped shape the current approaches have been based on outcomes such as the number of hospitalizations, morbidity, mortality, nutritional status, or infection rates in patients starting dialysis with little or no preparation. While these are important issues to address, this approach does not consider the overall impact of dialysis on the life of the patient or the effects on the caregiver, including changes to their lifestyle, employment and family responsibilities.  As such, many caregivers struggle with how to accommodate the needs of their family member without the skills and resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the increasing number of older individuals needing dialysis support, there is a higher likelihood that they will have comorbidities and thus a potentially greater need for help with care. As a result, caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation. This impact on caregivers was noted in <a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(02)44553-2/abstract">another study</a> of 100 hemodialysis patients and their primary caregivers utilizing the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).  After more than 4 months of dialysis, caregivers were reported to have higher subjective burden scores.  Current practices do not encompass follow-up with the caregivers to see how they are adjusting to the initiation of dialysis and how they are dealing with the transition.  A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/23/12/3960/1888462">systematic review</a> of studies with interventions for informal caregivers demonstrated only three studies with interventions for caregivers and these involved education material to enhance caregiver knowledge.</p>
<p>Our approach to dialysis preparation falls short if providers are not first acknowledging with patients and their caregivers the impact of end-stage kidney disease on their lives and providing the resources and support they need during this transition period.  Understanding what is important to them and what they do on a day-to-day basis in terms of work, family, and social obligations needs to be part of routine discussions.  Discussions about the impact on the family and caregivers also needs to be part of the routine dialysis preparations.</p>

<p>The correct categorization of scholarly works is vitally important. It helps readers find the information they seek — and assures authors that their research will be found by the right audience. Recently, arXiv released a new user-driven classification tool to help authors choose the correct category for their papers during the submission process.</p>
<p>“I think this is a great addition, and I am already seeing positive effects,” said Frank Simon, Max-Planck-Institute for Physics, Munich, Germany and arXiv moderator. “Since the feature has been in operation, submitters tend to classify things for my category (physics.ins-det) correctly more often.”</p>
<p>When submitting to arXiv, authors select a category for their paper, such as computational geometry or quantum physics. Now, in real time, the automated classifier double checks that selection by comparing the paper to those already hosted on arXiv.org. If the author’s selection doesn’t match the classifier’s recommendation, an alternate category is proposed. The author can review the suggestion, accept or decline it, and continue the submission process, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/05/classifier-screenshot.jpg"><img alt="This is a screen shot of arXiv's classifier recommendation tool." class="alignnone wp-image-624 size-full" height="378" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/05/classifier-screenshot.jpg" width="1000" /></a></p>
<p>In the past, only moderators had access to the automated classifier recommendations, after submission. Moderators reviewed the recommendations, and, if necessary, reclassified papers. This added time to the process and often led to delays.</p>
<p>Integrating the classifier recommendations into the submission process empowers authors and increases transparency when reclassification is necessary. Additionally, this feature is expected to reduce the workload for moderators and lower the number of papers put on hold due to misclassification. Improved category selection during the submission process will provide more accurate classification at the outset and therefore reduce delays in announcing papers.</p>
<p>“In my category, the most common issue is the case where instrumentation papers that should have physics.ins-det as primary category are instead submitted to hep-ex, nucl-ex, physics.optics or the like, and subsequently need to be reclassified,” Simon said. “Alerting the submitters that their instrumentation paper should be submitted to the instrumentation category rather than one of the others will reduce moderation workload and speed up the release of the articles, so it is a win-win situation for both submitters and moderators.”</p>
<p>Other moderators have also expressed enthusiasm about the new feature, calling it important, worthwhile, a fantastic idea, and a big step forward, “even if there will be hiccups” in the beginning. In the first four days after release, 17.4% papers received category recommendations and 67.5% of authors accepted the suggested category.</p>
<p>arXiv continues to welcome feedback on this feature, which was first tested by volunteer moderators. Authors who receive a category recommendation will have the opportunity to complete a survey about their experience. Moderators are sharing their observations and experiences with arXiv staff, and staff members are monitoring server log statistics.</p>
<p>Moving forward, arXiv is developing a new version of this machine learning classifier tool that will be trained by feedback from users and moderators in order to provide better category recommendations in the future.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Memory complaints are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02982590">fairly common among elderly people</a>. Together with low participation in cognitively demanding activities, such as reading or doing crosswords, they can predict future declines — including the risk of developing dementia.</p>
<p>It might seem likely, then, that people with poorer cognitive functioning may report more problems, and may be less able to engage in (and so benefit from) reading or other stimulating activities. However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-15673-001">new paper</a>, published in <em>Psychology and Aging</em>, suggests that another factor is more important in predicting both these complaints and engagement in stimulating activities: personality.<span id="more-39638"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, led by Patrick Hill at Washington University in St Louis, analysed data from 136 Swiss older adults, with an average age of about 70. (The data came from a bigger study into how the everyday behaviour of older people is linked to maintaining or improving wellbeing and health). The participants first completed a series of lab-based cognitive tasks, including memory tests, and self-report questionnaires, which included an assessment of the “Big Five” personality traits. Then, at the end of each of the next ten days, they used smartphones to report on any cognitive complaints during that day (e.g. “I misplaced or lost an object such as keys or glasses”), and also instances of cognitive engagement (e.g. “I enjoyed thinking about a complicated problem”).</p>
<p>Taking into account each participant’s age, education level and subjective health, the team then looked at how initial cognitive task results and personality trait scores might relate to the subsequent smartphone data.</p>
<p>They found that the number of daily cognitive complaints was significantly correlated with scores on all of the personality traits, but just one of the measures of  cognitive performance (processing speed). Strikingly, scores on the two initial specific memory tests did not correlate with daily cognitive complaints. (This somewhat surprising observation is in fact <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714573">supported by recent work</a> that suggests our cognitive self-perceptions are relatively distinct from our actual performance).</p>
<p>When all of these variables were put into a model, however, only one factor emerged as being key. This was openness to experience, a personality trait that entails a liking for intellectual and artistic pursuits, and a willingness to try new things.  Participants who initially scored higher for openness went on to report, on average, fewer cognitive complaints each day, and also more, and more varied, cognitive engagement.</p>
<p>There may be two reasons for this, the researchers suggest. Firstly, measures of openness tap into a person’s self-perceptions of their intellectual ability and creativity. People with a stronger belief in their intellectual capacities may perceive fewer cognitive issues in daily life. Secondly, people who are more open are of course more willing to engage in varied novel experiences. Because they enjoy intellectual activities, they may be driven to think more, and in more different ways — and this could protect against cognitive decline. In fact, there are other recent findings that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13607863.2019.1655705">diversity in cognitive activity</a>, rather than total time spent in these kinds of tasks, may be more beneficial for cognitive performance in older age.</p>
<p>The work also suggests that in understanding why some interventions work better for some older people than others, personality traits should be taken into account. Also, interventions that encourage openness may potentially be more effective.</p>
<p>However, as the researchers themselves add, all of the personality traits, demographic variables and initial cognitive performance measures only account for a small amount of the differences in the level of cognitive complaints and engagement between people. The team would like to see more work to drill into potential links with personality in finer detail. But other factors that are yet to be well-characterised — levels of stress, perhaps — may well turn out to be far more important.</p>

<p><em>This post was written by Beth Baker, PLOS’ Senior Media Relations Manager.</em></p>



<p><em>#PowerToThePreprint</em></p>



<p><em>PLOS actively encourages the posting of preprints – please see </em><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/"><em>https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/</em></a><em> for all the ways authors can engage. Posting of preprints and discussion of preprints will never </em><em>affect editorial decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal</em><em>.</em></p>



<p>From today, articles accepted at PLOS journals that were previously posted as a preprint will be under a press embargo which lifts upon publication. This alters our prior practice of not applying an embargo to articles that were previously posted as a preprint and means that we will be applying a consistent press embargo to all articles published at PLOS. We have made this decision after conducting research revealing the positive impact of press embargoes for PLOS papers. The change will optimize authors’ opportunities to disseminate their work to the public via the press and will ensure that authors who have posted preprints are not disadvantaged by this choice, nor are authors disincentivized to post preprints.</p>



<p><strong>Open communication of research, and the value of embargoes</strong></p>



<p>PLOS’ press embargo policy is designed to positively impact researchers and to aid the communication of their work. We work to facilitate open communication of research wherever possible. PLOS encourages the discussion of research between scientists at all stages in the publication process. Researchers are free to present and discuss their work for scientific purposes prior to publication. This includes talking about research at conferences and on preprint servers.</p>



<p>While we know that preprints play a crucial role in the efficiency of scientific communication, establishing priority sooner, increasing attention, and opening up the review process to all, we also believe that public attention at scale via the media should focus on the most reliable science: published, peer-reviewed research. Press embargoes continue to be the best tool to facilitate that. </p>



<p>Embargoes enable authors to achieve accurate, high-quality media coverage which disseminates their peer-reviewed research to non-expert readers. Since our articles are accessible to everyone, everywhere upon publication, our embargoes also ensure that peer-reviewed published articles are accessible to the public when first reported in the media.</p>



<p>Embargoes provide fair and equal access for journalists to allow them time to research their stories and to speak with experts. They give press officers adequate time to coordinate coverage with scientists at their institutions, and give researchers the opportunity to provide comments.</p>



<p>Discussion of research prior to publication, whether in the scientific community or in the media, will never affect editorial decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal. Prior coverage in the media may simply affect if and how PLOS promotes that research at the time of publication.</p>



<p><strong>Background to our research</strong></p>



<p>PLOS partnered with preprint server bioRxiv in May 2018 to help authors opt in to preprints. Soon after, we decided not to embargo for media purposes any published papers which had previously been posted as preprints, believing that embargoes might not be meaningful, necessary, or practical for these papers. Instead, we distributed press releases for such research without embargo at the time of publication, and encouraged institutions to do likewise.</p>



<p>Following implementation of this embargo exception for preprinted papers, we heard concerns from journalists, press officers and the UK Science Media Centre about this policy. Some parties felt that releasing preprinted research without embargo could result in less media coverage, or in lower quality, less accurate coverage, as journalists would race to report on research immediately or decide not to cover it at all. Concerns were also raised that not embargoing preprinted research meant forfeiting a valuable tool to help journalists focus on covering peer-reviewed published research rather than non-peer-reviewed preprints.</p>



<p>PLOS’ media team therefore investigated the claim that non-embargoed preprinted papers received less media coverage.</p>



<p><strong>What we researched and what we found</strong></p>



<p>We took all the preprinted papers we’d press released without embargo between October 1, 2018 (when we introduced the policy) and September 11, 2019 and paired each with a paper we’d press released under embargo that published at around the same time. Each paired paper was from the same journal as the preprinted paper, and for our multidisciplinary journal PLOS ONE, we also ensured the paired paper was in the same broad scientific area.</p>



<p>We examined the amount of media coverage each paper had received by measuring the number of mentions of the paper in the media, using media intelligence software Meltwater. We used paired t tests to assess if differences found were statistically significant. </p>



<p>We found that the preprinted papers press released without embargo received significantly less media coverage than the paired papers press released under embargo. This was true both in terms of total media mentions (74.60 more media mentions (19.27 vs 93.87); 95% CI: 14.07 – 135.13) and in terms of media mentions in the highest profile outlets (1.47 fewer high profile mentions (0.07 vs 1.53); 95% CI: 0.55 – 2.39). We note that our sample size was small, comprising 30 preprinted papers press released without embargo and 30 paired papers, and we only examined two broad measures of media attention. However, these results support the anecdotes we had previously heard.</p>



<p><strong>How we are reacting</strong></p>



<p>Our research indicates that embargoed papers receive more media coverage, including in the most high-profile news outlets, than papers which are not embargoed. A practice of not embargoing papers previously posted as preprints therefore risked disadvantaging authors who posted preprints, and/or disincentivizing the posting of preprints, which PLOS actively encourages. We have decided to change our practice to treat all our authors equally, and to maximize authors’ opportunities to work with the press to disseminate their work to the public.</p>



<p>From today, all PLOS publications promoted to the press will be <a href="https://www.plos.org/embargo-policy">embargoed until the time of publication</a>. We believe that this change will enable all our authors to reap the benefits of the embargo system – whether or not they have previously posted preprints – and will facilitate continued high-quality science communication to the public.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/624410018/0/oupblogpsychology/">Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</a></h4>

<p>It’s May and many of us have fond memories of springtime when we were in high school. There was some stress from exams and final papers to be sure, but also more outdoor activities, sports, banquets or awards assemblies, proms, and most of all, looking forward to the summer. High school students today, however, have lost all of that. Seemingly in an instant, they are confined at home, with little access to friends, no organized sports, arts, music, journalism, or other activities. Education via teleconferencing is of variable quality and is no substitute for the interactive learning with other students and a skilled educator. Most of all, our students face an uncertain future. It is especially difficult for teens to foresee or plan for a future with the current disruption. Adolescents may well not be able to deal with these multiple concerns, so it’s predictable and understandable that many high school students are struggling with anxiety and depressed mood. Even before the pandemic adolescents had high rates of clinical anxiety and depression. We are facing an enormous mental health crisis.</p><p>As parents there’s a lot we can do to help support our teens. Here are some practical tips to alleviate anxiety and promote stability during this uncertain time.</p><p>Create a schedule.<strong> </strong>Maintaining a regular schedule can provide a sense of stability for the whole family. Teens still have school; many parents are working and those form the basic skeleton of the day. Online learning can be draining so I suggest periodic breaks, at least 15 minutes of stretching, running in place, or going outside (if possible) every two hours or so. Teens with attentional issue may need more frequent breaks.  Add structured time for meditation, pleasant events, and physical activity. Many schools, online programs, and apps can support a meditation practice.  At the minimum we can teach our children to take just a few minutes to breathe deeply as a break from the stresses of the day. I am partial to Dr. Andrew Weil’s simple 4-7-8 approach, breathing in for four seconds, holding the breath for seven seconds, and then exhaling very slowly for eight seconds.  I can feel a sense of relaxation at about number five during the exhale. This small exercise is helpful to everyone and can quell anxiety. Evenings might be a time to reclaim long-forgotten family activities from when the teens were younger: baking, doing puzzles, working on family history projects, or even watching television together can foster connection and emphasize the family as foundational.</p><p>Limit access to the news. Normally I think that high schoolers learn about government and global issues and develop a critical eye from reading or watching the news. Right now, however, it can be overwhelming to see the stories, not only of death and pain but also unemployment and the plight of our most vulnerable citizens. You can share with your teen why watching too much coronavirus or political news can be demoralizing. Everyone is different, but 30 minutes is plenty of time to catch up on the news and you can add some time for discussion. You can also help yourself and your teen by being a good role model of having boundaries about watching the news.</p><p>Help them stay connected. Teens can continue to find ways to relate to their friends even during this time of social distancing and sheltering in place. In the past I viewed too much time on social media as destructive, especially to young women. However, in the current situation, social media can, if used responsibly, provide a sense of connection, shared goals, and distraction. I recommend being more flexible about screen time.  Email, texts, and even writing letters will help (and older relatives will appreciate the letters). In addition to connections to their friends, we can encourage teens to form connections to the larger community. We’ve seen that teens can be creative and generous by volunteering, whether making masks, raising money for charity online or contributing art work.</p><p>Foster self-efficacy. In isolation, it is can be difficult for teenagers to feel any sense of competence other than academics. Teens with learning differences may be having an especially difficult time adjusting to virtual learning. Assign tasks at home, including daily chores and longer-term ones like organizing family photos, building a table, creating new menus, and so on.  Older teens can help their siblings or cousins with schoolwork. Ask your high schoolers how they think they can help out; their creativity may surprise you. All these activities help the family and teens still appreciate your acknowledgment of a job well done. Learning a new skill or completing a project also elicits the “I’ve got this” feeling, that leads to improved mood and can foster independence.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by Anastasia Gepp via<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/girl-teen-caf%C3%A9-smartphone-sorrow-1848477"> Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/">Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/624410018/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/624410018/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/624410018/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-emotional-toll-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-teenagers/" rel="nofollow">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/eat-your-oats/" rel="nofollow">Eat your oats</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/why-politics-is-so-polarized/" rel="nofollow">Why politics is so polarized, even though Americans agree on most key issues</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>We all know that too little sleep is bad for us. Matthew Walker, a UC Berkeley sleep scientist and author of the best-selling <em>Why We Sleep</em>, has gone so far <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p061pxj4">as to declare</a>: “The shorter you sleep, the shorter your life.” However, some researchers fear that our concerns about not getting enough sleep are becoming overblown — and that, ironically, they could be making the problem worse. In this feature, we take a look at evidence that “too little” sleep isn’t always the disaster that it’s held up to be.<span id="more-39623"></span></p>
<p><strong>It’s not always about a lack of sleep</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be familiar with the chronotype concepts of larks (early to bed and early to rise) and owls (late to bed, and late to rise). Most kids start out as larks, but during adolescence, many shift to becoming owls. Waking up late is fine for teenagers at the weekends, but not during the school week. Unsurprisingly, then, various studies have found that delaying the time school starts improves academic results for this age-group, and many sleep scientists and paediatricians <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439884.2014.942666">support such a policy</a>. It’s been assumed that this is because it allows teens to get a decent night’s sleep. But there’s some evidence that this may not be the reason. A recent study of Dutch secondary school pupils, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, found that owls did get poorer exam grades, but this effect <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/17/its-not-just-lack-of-sleep-why-pupils-with-an-owl-chronotype-get-lower-grades/">was largely independent of sleep duration</a>.</p>
<p>This suggests that even when owls get “enough” sleep, they don’t do as well as larks on exams. And this, it seems, is because exams are often administered in the mornings, when owls aren’t at their cognitive peak. When owls took exams in the afternoon, closer to that peak, they achieved similar grades as larks. This was especially true for science subjects. Of course, if the school day starts later, then exams start later — and this could be a better fit for many teens’ chronotype. What this all means, though, is that, in many cases, trying to get teens to go to bed earlier, to sleep for longer, may not make as much of a difference to their performance at school as has been claimed.</p>
<p><strong>Cause or effect?</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety, OCD, ADHD, schizophrenia, PTSD… all kinds of mental health problems are associated with sleep problems, too. It’s now recognised that the relationship is circular, with mental illness and insomnia exacerbating each other. It’s not as simple, then, as a lack of sleep causing symptoms. And certainly, there’s evidence that stress early in life can set you up for insomnia much later. One study found that children who grew up in families with high levels of conflict <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-8/too-stressed-sleep">went on to be more likely to have insomnia as adults</a>. This held even when any sleep problems or depression during childhood were controlled for in the analysis — so it wasn’t a case of participants who’d had trouble sleeping as kids still having these difficulties as adults. And when it comes to depression, the links between sleep and symptoms can be surprising…</p>
<p><b>A surprising therapy</b></p>
<p>Depriving depressed people of sleep works as an effective <em>treatment</em>. This was shown in series of studies starting <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/468269">almost 50 years ago</a>. But it has become a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549913">standard therapy</a> only recently. Healthy people deprived of sleep will generally find that their mood worsens. But for people with depression, staying awake for at least a night can do the opposite (temporarily, anyway). The impacts are rapid, and work on most patients, as a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=printable&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067264">study in Denmark</a>, for example, has found. Exactly how the treatment works is still debated, but it’s thought to shock a sluggish biological clock.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep doesn’t <em>always</em> improve memory</strong></p>
<p>The evidence that sleep is important for memory is pretty overwhelming. But, recently, at least one study has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/22/getting-some-sleep-doesnt-make-eyewitnesses-any-better-at-identifying-suspects/">challenged the idea</a> that sleep always brings memory benefits. Given the experimental record, the researchers had expected to find that eye-witnesses who were given the chance to sleep would be better at identifying suspects the following day. But they weren’t…</p>
<p>This was a big study: 2000 participants watched a brief video of a man stealing a laptop from an office. Twelve hours later, they were asked to identify him from a line-up. Half had slept during this time, but, contrary to expectations, they were no more accurate than the others at picking out the perpetrator. More work is needed to try to clarify why not.</p>
<p><strong>Effects can be indirect</strong></p>
<p>No doubt you’ve heard that a lack of sleep isn’t just bad for your mental but your physical health. Women who get less sleep are indeed more likely to develop obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, for example. But the major reason for these effects seems to be indirect: women who sleep poorly <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014587">tend to make poorer food choices</a>, going for higher-calorie, energy-dense foods. These choices are certainly related to a lack of quality sleep, but they aren’t an inevitable result of it. The same team behind this finding suspect, meanwhile, that a poor diet can cause poor sleep: “It’s also possible that poor diet has a negative impact on women’s sleep quality”, notes lead author Faris Zuraikat, at Columbia University. “Eating more could also cause gastrointestinal discomfort, for instance, making it harder to fall asleep or remain asleep.”</p>
<p><strong>Some poor sleepers don’t suffer at all</strong></p>
<p>Just how bad is insomnia anyway…? There are a lot of people out there who technically do suffer from insomnia, but who don’t believe, or realise, that they do, and these people experience no distress or anxiety, and are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/26/insomnia-identity-misbelieving-youve-got-sleep-problems-can-be-more-harmful-than-actual-lack-of-sleep/">no more impaired in terms of daily fatigue than those who get good sleep</a>. What’s more, a massive increase in hypertension (high blood pressure) was observed among those who regarded themselves as having insomnia, but not among the “non-complaining poor sleepers”. The same review found that 37% of people who think they have insomnia actually sleep normally, and having an “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796717301638?via=ihub">insomnia identity</a>” was more predictive of daytime impairment than poor sleep. Other research has found, meanwhile, that worrying about not getting enough sleep can itself lead to prolonged insomnia.</p>
<p><span>Headlines that make people worry that they’re not getting enough sleep could themselves, then, cause some of the problems they’re describing. Which brings me back to the start of this feature…. There’s plenty of evidence that a good quantity of regular quality sleep is important. But how we think about the way we sleep is important, too.</span></p>

<p>The Great Recession of 2008 was characterized by an economic and financial crisis with a decline in gross domestic product (GDP), high levels of unemployment, and a great impact on European countries and worldwide. Austerity measures taken by governments as a response to this crisis were characterized by reducing social spending and increasing taxation, although they were neither homogeneous nor similarly implemented at European level; some countries protected public sector programs and systems while others instituted large budget cuts in education, healthcare, and other public services. There was general agreement that some countries such as Greece, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom applied higher levels of austerity. These measures taken by governments would have an impact on the most vulnerable groups, mainly children and youth from disadvantaged families.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08732-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">We conducte<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11883 alignleft" height="212" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/financial-crisis-544944_640-300x212.jpg" width="300" />d a systematic literature review</a> to assess the impact of austerity measures taken by European governments on social determinants of child health, and child health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Our results</strong></p>
<p>The countries that applied high austerity levels showed an increase in material deprivation, child poverty rates, and low birth weight, compared to the pre-austerity period. Higher levels of social protection spending in the period 2008–2013 were associated with lower levels of child poverty. High austerity was reported also to be related to poorer access to and quality of services provided, mainly to disabled children. Reduction of public health expenditure was associated with a reduction of specific vaccination coverage in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>Austerity and COVID-19</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>It is likely that the indirect effects of the pandemic will have profound impacts for child health in the long run</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time when we carried out the review, we had not predicted the current COVID-19 pandemic. Early data suggests, unsurprisingly, that the pandemic is impacting the poor and vulnerable most, with stark socio-economic and ethnic inequalities in outcomes.  Although there are still many uncertainties regarding the pandemic, it seems that children are less prone to severe consequences of infection compared to adults. However, it is likely that the indirect effects of the pandemic will have profound impacts for child health, particularly poor children, in the long run.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11884" height="216" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/children-63175_640-300x216.jpg" width="300" />In the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis, key components of preventive child health services have been negatively affected, e.g. immunization. The unintended consequences of lockdown measures and social distancing are disproportionately affecting poor children, increasing hunger, mental health problems and the risk of abuse, neglect and non-accidental injury. Especially, closure of schools and (day)care facilities may have contributed to lower ‘visibility’ of neglect and domestic violence. In the long run, sustained austerity measures to be expected after the acute phase will damage the capacity of social welfare and health systems to respond.</p>
<blockquote><p>We recommend governments at European and country level to apply policies that prevent the negative consequences of austerity measures</p></blockquote>
<p>On the basis of our review, we hypothesize that those areas and countries that applied less austerity measures are in a better condition to respond to the healthcare and social needs of both children and the general population. Moreover, we recommend governments at European and country level to apply policies that prevent such negative consequences of austerity measures. In the near future important research challenges will be to see if the countries with fewer cuts in expenditure on public healthcare and social services are better able to protect health and well-being of children and families, especially in disadvantaged populations, from the consequences of the pandemic.</p>

<br /><p>After the recent release of the <a class="reference external" href="https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/comp-neuro">Computational Neuroscience installable OS
image</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> team
is looking to work on to the next set of deliverables. For this, we need to
expand the team.</p>
<p><em>I want to note that we are not only looking for people that may already have
the necessary skills. We are looking for anyone interested in working in these
areas that would perhaps like to acquire the required skills. We will teach the
skills that we can, and where we cannot, we will involve experienced members of
the Free/Open Source software community to help us. All one really needs is a
few hours a week of free time.</em></p>
<p>We are looking for people interested in:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scientific communication, marketing, outreach, and community engagement:<ul>
<li>To spread information on the staggering amount of Free/Open Source Software
that is available for Neuroscience to researchers and the community in
general,</li>
<li>To disseminate the progress that the <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> team makes regularly to
the community.</li>
<li>To just generally monitor our various communication channels to answer
queries and participate in discussions with the team and users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software development:<ul>
<li>There are still about <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues">200 tools</a> to include in
<a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>, so still lots of work to do here. Some tools related to
computational neuroscience remain, so we are working on those. However, we
want to start making some headway on the next deliverable that will be
focussed on neuroimaging and data analysis. Not only do we need to build
these tools from source, we also need to test them regularly, and push new
versions to our users when developers make new releases.</li>
<li>We also want to provide easy to use containers for all the tools that we
are including in <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neuro-imaging and data analysis in Neuroscience:<ul>
<li>A lot of tools on our list are related to Neuro-imaging and data analysis.
To effectively integrate these with the rest of <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a>, we need more
people with domain knowledge. If you work these areas or want to work in
them and would like to learn more about these tools, <a class="reference external" href="https://neuro.fedoraproject.org">NeuroFedora</a> is a
great informal environment to start in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common knowledge that joining Free/Open source communities is an excellent

<p>I also have first hand experience of how busy a PhD candidate can get, but in
my experience I also found it possible to free up a few hours a week to work on
developing general skills that one may not necessarily be able to learn from
daily research work. So, I also strongly encourage undergraduate/postgraduate
research students and Ph.D. candidates to do the same.</p>

Choosing the ‘right’ minimum legal age for legalized non-medical cannabis</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/cannabis-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>An increasing number of jurisdictions including Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Luxembourg and several US states are looking to legalize non-medical cannabis. The decision to legalize cannabis however comes with a contentious question for policymakers: What should be the minimum legal age (MLA) for cannabis consumption? While a low MLA can discourage the underground cannabis market, cannabis consumption before age 25 is said to negatively impact brain development. Policymakers, thus, face a difficult tradeoff between curtailing illegal economic activity and safeguarding adolescents’ well-being.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08639-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> shows that there is merit in choosing 19 as the MLA for non-medical cannabis use. We reached this conclusion by looking at how Canadians, who started using cannabis at different young ages, differ in several important outcomes (educational attainment, cigarette smoking, self-reported general and mental health) later in life.</p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this study?</strong></p>
<p>Canada was the second country in the world to legalize non-medical cannabis in October 2018. Ahead of the legalizatio<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11887 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/marijuana-300x200.jpg" width="300" />n, the federal government recommended a MLA of 18 years. However, after public consultations and for harmonization with the existing minimum legal ages for alcohol and tobacco use, most Canadian provinces set 19 as the minimum legal age; the two exceptions were Quebec and Alberta which opted for 18. Two years into legalization, the policy on MLA for cannabis use in Canada is still evolving. In particular, Quebec revised its MLA to 21 in October 2019 and there have also been calls to raise minimum legal age to 21 in Ontario. Notably, evidence that could shed light on the merits of different proposed MLAs was lacking.</p>
<p><strong>What do our findings imply?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Individuals starting cannabis at age 19 have later life outcomes that are better than those starting it ate age 18</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that most later life outcomes are better for individuals starting cannabis at age 19 than those starting it at age 18 but not worse than those starting cannabis between age 20 and 25. These results imply that age 19 is the optimal MLA for cannabis use.</p>
<p>This finding of MLA of 19 is different from the Canadian federal government’s recommendation of 18 and stands in contrast with medical community’s support for age 21 or 25. Yet, it appears to be plausible: age 19 is high enough to address concerns over potential adverse outcomes associated with using cannabis at young age while low enough to discourage the illegal market for the underage.</p>
<p>Our findings will be useful for policymakers in jurisdictions planning to legalize non-medical cannabis. Meanwhile, in Canada, as the post-cannabis legalization era evolves, it will be important to watch trends in youth’s and young adults’ use and monitor harms over time while ensuring that the legal market is tightly regulated and that cannabis companies do not stray from restrictions on marketing, sales, and packaging that might make products more appealing and accessible to children.</p>

<p>This summer, the arXiv development team will begin work on the next major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which will be based on the official <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> update. TeX is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.</p>
<p>This year’s update will provide enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team will also use this opportunity to address outstanding bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.</p>
<p>arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.</p>
<p>arXiv’s new TeX Live release is expected to become available Fall 2020.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology/">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a></h4>

<p>“You never write…you never call….” The guilt-tripping mother is common stereotype in movies and TV. But how many adult children harbor feelings of guilt toward their aging parents? Who experiences this guilt, and why?</p><p>About one in five adult children experience feelings of guilt toward their ageing mothers, based on data from a nationally representative survey of 2,450 Dutch adults in 2015 who have a mother aged 55 or older. Feelings of guilt in the family have rarely been measured in a systematic fashion but researchers have long argued that guilt is not only something moral, but also a fundamental social emotion. Guilt refers to negative feelings that arise from having done something that is – or is perceived to be – wrong. Guilt is not the same as shame; guilt is the awareness that one has done something wrong, shame is the translation of that feeling to one’s self-image: the feeling of not being a good person. Guilt and shame are emotions that have been linked to depression and low self-esteem.</p><p>People who have negative feelings about their relationships with their mothers more often report feelings of guilt. Surprisingly, people who have both negative and positive feelings about their mothers have more guilt. This may be because children who have negative feelings about their mothers are afraid that this will hurt their mothers’ feelings. This fear of hurting a person is more difficult if one also cares about that other person. Most people have positive feelings about their mothers. However, cultural expectations about positive and warm relationships with mothers leave little room for irritation, anger, and embarrassment, and it is exactly when such feelings arise in a warm relationship that people may feel guilty.</p><p>Adult children are an important source of support for their ageing parents. However, even at older ages, parents continue to support their adult children. The flow of support does not necessarily shift from downward (from parents to children) to upward (from children to parents) with age and for that reason, some children with older parents may feel that they are not doing enough to help. Feelings of guilt are associated with a lack of reciprocity in the support relationship. The less support people give to their mother, in comparison to how much support they receive, the stronger the feelings of guilt. With an increasing number of ageing parents in most high-income societies, demand for social and practical support from children increases and this may create more occasion for guilt to develop. It also seems that children who have strong norms about what people should do for their parents feel guilty more often. People set high standards for themselves, which in turn may lead to a feeling of not having done enough.</p><p>It was expected that infrequent contact would be associated with guilt but while people who had only monthly contact with their mothers feel guiltier, people with less than monthly contact did not report significantly more guilt than those with weekly contact. That primarily the monthly-contact group feels more guilt fits with a pattern of a good relationship that carries a cultural expectation of more frequent contact than can be achieved.</p><p>In psychological theory, guilt is often seen as a negative emotion that motivates positive behavioral change. This theory can also be applied to the mother-child bond. For example, guilt that arises from not visiting enough may motivate children to visit more, hence, reducing guilt. But guilt may also be reduced when parents exercise moderation in their downward support, letting the stream of support turn more quickly in the expected upward direction, from children to parents. Guilt is not always productive. When guilt arises from negative emotions such as anger and irritation, both of which are measured in this study, it is less clear which productive changes a person could make. Guilt that stems from ambivalence may therefore be perceived as more awkward. Adult children may visit their parents more often or offer more support when they feel guilty, but changing the way they feel about their parents is a different matter. This would require a change of expectations and a change in norms. Such mental and cultural changes are more difficult to achieve.</p><p><em>Featured image by congerdesign via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/users/congerdesign-509903/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/understanding-guilt-in-mother-child-relationships/">Understanding guilt in mother-child relationships</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/623518132/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/623518132/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/623518132/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/moving-beyond-toxic-masculinity-a-qa-with-ronald-levant/" rel="nofollow">Moving beyond toxic masculinity: a Q&amp;A with Ronald Levant</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-emotional-toll-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-teenagers/" rel="nofollow">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/seven-ways-to-talk-to-terminal-patients/" rel="nofollow">Seven ways to talk to terminal patients</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/news-2094394_640-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is likely no surprise that misinformation and disinformation permeate the communication space around public health events. The COVID-19 pandemic has been <a href="https://www.poynter.org/ifcn-covid-19-misinformation/">no exception</a>, and in fact, has highlighted how misinformation and disinformation can damage public health response efforts.  In particular, damage to trust, heightened confusion, and intensified discord can widen the gap between effective public health interventions and public willingness to support them.</p>
<p>Misinformation about disease outbreaks spreads rapidly in information voids, when there is little true information to ground viewers in the reality of the current situation. While we are learning more every day, there are many unknowns about COVID-19. As a result, the continued lack of definitive information on the virus and its spread has created an opportunity for misinformation and disinformation to take root.</p>
<blockquote><p>The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recent research published by our team takes a close look at misinformation during October 2014, when cases of Ebola were identified in the US. We sought to understand misinformation in the context of an emerging, fear-inducing disease in order to draw lessons for future outbreaks or epidemics that might similarly frighten the public. Little did we know that we would be publishing this research in the midst of one of the largest and most severe pandemics in recent history.  The lessons we learned from our analysis of Ebola misinformation have direct application to the COVID-19 pandemic today.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11863 alignleft" height="183" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/question-3385451_640-300x183.jpg" width="300" />First, we learned that misinformation can come in many forms, making it harder for people to determine what information is correct. While about 5% of the tweets we reviewed were false, another 5% were partially true or subtle misinterpretations of true information. While it may seem simple to label information as either true or false, we found making this distinction to be incredibly nuanced. In the process of hand coding thousands of tweets, even trained coders with public health expertise sometimes found that distinguishing between true and misleading information was challenging and required the combined judgement of several people.  Many people may not be able to take the time to carefully and objectively verify nuanced half-truths, instead making judgements based on their own knowledge, experiences, and worldview.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found a strong tie between misinformation and political content</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, we found a strong tie between misinformation and political content. We had initially, and perhaps naively, thought that misinformation during a health event like an Ebola outbreak would primarily be framed in a health context. Instead, we observed great overlap in misinformation, political tweets, and tweets that seemed designed to induce societal <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567">discord.</a> Additionally, both the 2014 Ebola outbreak and COVID-19 have occurred during contentious US election years, and there are indications that COVID-19 misinformation has been <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2020/03/18/knowledge-and-perception-surrounding-covid-19/">politicized.</a> An important lesson emerging from this is that public health events, response activities, and communication efforts, while often apolitical in their inception, can be vehicles for messages that serve goals beyond ensuring the health of the public.</p>
<p>Finally, we found a several different misinformation types or tropes. Government conspiracies, false rumors of concerning viral characteristics (eg airborne transmission of the Ebola virus), and fake cures were the most frequent types. Today, we see these same <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/what-can-coronavirus-tell-us-about-conspiracy-theories/610894/">rumor tropes</a> appearing during the COVID-19 epidemic. In our sample of Ebola-related tweets, some rumors were refuted, but many were not, casting some doubt on the ability of social media to self-correct effectively. More research must be done to determine the best ways to protect the public from these specific types of rumors and misinformation.</p>
<p>Developing solutions to reduce the spread of misinformation and disinformation from div<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11862" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/social-300x200.jpg" width="300" />erse sources, including public figures, will not be easy. Further research is needed to understand how best to reach populations resistant to traditional public health messaging and health authorities. While essential efforts must be taken by social media platforms to control the spread of misinformation, the suggestion that technology companies should simply act to stop the dissemination of often nuanced and subtle misinformation overlooks the role of many other important stakeholders – and our own need to take a hard look in the mirror and improve the ways that we, as members of both the public and scientific community, consume and provide information to others.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/AACS-2-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Cardiovascular mortality in end-stage kidney disease is much higher than the general population.  The non-traditional risk factor of mineral bone disorders in this population plays an important role in the higher incidence of vascular calcification associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality in this population.  Several studies in hemodialysis patients have shown the advantage of using plain radiography to determine abdominal aortic calcification and cardiovascular disease.  <a href="https://www-dustri-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/nc/article-response-page.html?artId=186173&amp;doi=">Cho <em>et al.</em></a> recently showed that abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS) is an independent risk factor for severe coronary artery calcification score on CT and predictor for cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients. <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/doi/full/10.1111/nep.13644">Zhu <em>et al.</em></a> showed that abdominal aortic calcification is prevalent in hemodialysis patients and has the potential to predict cardiovascular mortality with use of plain radiography.  There have not been similar studies in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.</p>
<p>A study by <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01822-9">Ma <em>et al.,</em></a> published this week in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a>, sought to examine the predicative role of the AACS for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and mortality in PD patients.  This study was a single-center, prospective, cohort study utilizing lateral lumbar radiography to determine the AACS for 292 PD patients.  The patient population had a median PD duration of 28.4 months.  One-fourth of patients had a history diabetes and one-third had a history of cardiovascular disease.  The average AACS was 2.0.  The patients enrolled were categorized into tertiles of low (meaning AACS = 0), medium (meaning AACS = 1-4) and high (meaning AACS &gt; 4). The duration of follow-up averaged 43.6 months and there were 65 MACCE and 84 deaths.  It was noted that the AACS was associated with age, PD duration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.  Ma <em>et al.</em> observed that there was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of MACCE and all-cause mortality in the upper AACS tertile.</p>
<blockquote><p>Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?</p></blockquote>
<p>Should we routinely be getting plain radiographs for AACS in our end-stage kidney disease patients, especially our PD patients, based on this study and others?  I might strongly consider starting.  An x-ray is a low cost, noninvasive test that could potentially help with risk stratification.  Those patients with a high AACS should have immediate referrals to cardiology for cardiovascular disease prevention and evaluation.  The frequency of testing and the initiation of testing would need to be clarified. Additionally, there is a potential use in kidney transplantation evaluations.  Many transplant centers utilize a non-contrast CT as part of the transplant work-up addressing the site of anastomosis.  Findings often prompt further cardiovascular disease testing.  These CT results could help triage those who needed more extensive testing.  Those with a high AACS might need to go directly to cardiac catheterization for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Whereas those with a low AACS might go directly to a stress test or coronary CT.  This stratification could eliminate unnecessary testing, prevent complications, and save money.</p>
<p>The more passive approach would be using the information when abdominal aortic calcification is incidentally found.  Then patients could proceed to a cardiology referral or further testing.  However, in this population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and mortality, I would tend to take a more active role in prevention.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="89" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/feature-e1588625110426.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Financial challenges are increasingly common for older adults. About <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html">30 percent</a> of older adults in the U.S. live on incomes that are near the poverty threshold and about <a href="https://paa2012.princeton.edu/papers/121818">one third</a> of older adults in the U.S. report financial strain, meaning they have difficulty making ends meet. Importantly, financial challenges are modifiable social determinants of health that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Older adults facing financial challenges may find it difficult to meet basic needs. They may run out of food or medications near the end of the month when funds run low. They may not be able to afford housing that is properly heated or that meets their needs to safely age in place in their own homes. In addition to lacking basic necessities, individuals face greater day-to-day stress managing household finances. There is good evidence that older adults facing financial challenges are more likely to become disabled and die earlier than their wealthier peers.</p>

We compared four different measures of socioeconomic status (income, financial strain, education, and professional occupation) to see which of these predicted new cases of dementia.</p>
<p>In our study, older adults who experienced either low income or financial strain were more likely to develop dementia than those who didn’t. Education, which has already been linked to dementia in other studies, predicted dementia in our study as well. In fact, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31363-6/fulltext"><em>The Lancet</em> Commission on Dementia</a> identifies low education as a key dementia risk factor. However, when we compared education to income and financial strain we found similar results for all three socioeconomic measures. This suggests that low income and financial strain may be just as important as low education with regard to risk of dementia.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11868 aligncenter" height="211" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/figure-300x124.png" width="510" />
<p>These results are important because financial challenges may actually be more modifiable for older adults than education. Most adults complete their educational training early in life, but financial challenges could be addressed at any point in the life course.</p>
<p>Many programs and policies are already in place that are intended to support older adults facing financial challenges. Public benefits, entitlement programs, and tax credits may alleviate financial challenges. However, these programs are often under-utilized. For example, the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides money to buy food but only about <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/charts/snap-participation-rates/">40 percent</a> of eligible older adults use the program.</p>
<p>Results from this study complement results of <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1340-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">another study</a> our team published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a> last year, which highlighted the importance of housing quality for financially strained older adults. In that study, we used the same national sample of U.S. older adults to track changes over time in both financial strain and markers of home disorder such as tripping hazards, pests, or broken furniture and flooring. We also tracked mobility over the same time period.</p>
<blockquote><p>Efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults.</p></blockquote>
<p>In that study, financial strain and home disorder interacted with each other over time – financial strain predicted more home disorder and home disorder predicted greater financial strain. Importantly, both financial strain and home disorder predicted mobility limitations among older adults, suggesting that both play a role in functional decline. These results suggest that older adults with financial strain may slip into a downward spiral of worsening home conditions and worsening financial strain that leads eventually towards disability.</p>
<p>These results highlight the importance of early intervention to alleviate financial strain in order to prevent disability for healthy older adults. Also, these results suggest that interventions should include improving home conditions for financially strained older adults, which may break the link between financial strain and disability.</p>
<p>Together, these two studies add to a growing body of evidence linking financial challenges, including low income and financial strain, with poor health outcomes for older adults. As populations age around the world, we should pay greater attention to supporting older adults facing modifiable financial challenges. Our research suggests that efforts to provide basic necessities, including food, medications, and safe and accessible housing may help prevent disability and dementia for financially strained older adults. Existing resources for food, housing, and health care supports should be strengthened to meet the growing needs of populations aging with financial challenges.</p>
