This is true, they say, of both humans and experimental animals such as rodents, e.g. with their 'whisking' movements of the whiskers.

A particular concern is that many movements

According to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/life-sciences/digital-transformation-biopharma.html?id=us:2el:3pr:4di4797:5awa:6di:MMDDYY:&amp;pkid=1005656">recent Deloitte survey,</a> only 20% of biopharma companies are maturing digitally. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One path toward digital transformation involves the use of online R&amp;D marketplaces such as Science Exchange, to improve R&amp;D productivity and organizational efficiency.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lillie, who has experience using Science Exchange at both a large R&amp;D organization and his current smaller company, compared the benefits of applying ecommerce to outsourcing in each case. Science Exchange “delivers two answers to two questions,” said Lillie. “At a large biopharma, Science Exchange turns a 6-month process [of contracting with a provider] into immediate access. At a smaller company, you don’t always </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to expertise within your budget.” Science Exchange enabled that access.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lillie observed that the common problem facing all organizations has been provider identification. It was in the context of a project requiring a labeled antibody that Science Exchange connected OvaScience to LI-COR’s team, and “they did a great job,” said Lillie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lillie’s observations underline that the path to increased R&amp;D productivity is based on increasing connections within the scientific community. Based on the positive feedback we’ve received from attendees, connections made at October TechFest complement digital interactions on the Science Exchange platform to create a stronger local community overall.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you’re invited to the next Science Exchange social! </span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just enter your email address at the bottom of our </span><a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home page.</span></a></p></div>

<p>It’s a question that’s reverberated through the ages – are we humans, though imperfect, essentially kind, sensible, good-natured creatures? Or deep down are we wired to be bad, blinkered, idle, vain, vengeful and selfish? There are no easy answers and there’s clearly a lot of variation between individuals, but this feature post aims to shine some evidence-based light on the matter. Here in the first part of a two-part feature – and deliberately side-stepping the obviously relevant but controversial and already much-discussed <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=milgram">Milgram</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=zimbardo">Zimbardo</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=asch">Asch</a> studies – we digest 10 dispiriting findings that reveal the darker and less impressive aspects of human nature:</p>
<p><span id="more-34925"></span></p>
<p><strong>We view minorities and the vulnerable as less than human</strong><br />
Through history humans have demonstrated a sickening willingness to inflict cruelty on one another. Part of the explanation may be that we have an unfortunate tendency to see certain groups – especially outsiders and vulnerable people perceived as low status – as being less than fully human. One striking example of this “blatant dehumanisation” came from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/11/10/seeing-others-as-less-than-human/">a small brain-scan study</a> that found students exhibited less neural activity associated with thinking about people when they looked at pictures of the homeless or of drug addicts, as compared with higher-status individuals. Many more studies have since demonstrated subtle forms of dehumanisation (in which we attribute fewer mental states to outsiders and minorities) and there have been further demonstrations of blatant dehumanisation – for instance, people who are opposed to Arab immigration or in favour of tougher counter-terrorism policy against Muslim extremists tended to rate Arabs and Muslims as literally <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/24/psychologists-reveal-our-blatant-dehumanisation-of-minority-groups/">less evolved</a> than average. Among other examples, there’s also evidence that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08227-001">young people dehumanise older people</a>; and that men and women alike <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0958-9">dehumanise drunk women</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.12539">the inclination to dehumanise starts early</a> – children as young as five view out-group faces (those belonging to people who live in a different city or who are of a different gender than the child) as less human than in-group faces.</p>
<p><strong>We already experience schadenfreude at the age of four</strong><br />
That last finding is particularly dispiriting since we often look to young children to give us hope for humankind – they are seen as the sweet and innocent ones who have yet to be corrupted by the grievances of adulthood. And yet many other studies show that very small kids are capable of some less-than-appealing adult-like emotions. For instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/06/03/kids-experience-schadenfreude-by-age-four-maybe-earlier/">a study from 2013</a> found that even four-year-olds seem to experience modest amounts of Schadenfreude – pleasure at another person’s distress, especially if they perceived the person deserved it (because they’d engaged in a bad deed). A more <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0264-5">recent study</a> found that by age six children will pay to watch an antisocial puppet being hit, rather than spending the money on stickers. Oh, and maybe you should forget the idea of children offering you unconditional kindness – by age three, they are already keeping track of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/12/by-age-3-kids-know-when-you-owe-them-one/">whether you are indebted to them</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We believe in Karma – assuming that the downtrodden of the world must deserve their fate</strong><br />
On a related note, so strong is our inherent need to believe in a just world, we seem to have an inbuilt tendency to perceive the vulnerable and suffering as to some extent deserving their fate (an unfortunate flip-side to the Karmic idea, propagated by most religions, that the cosmos rewards those who do good – a belief that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/11/children-as-young-as-four-believe-in-karma-good-things-happen-to-those-who-do-good/">emerges in children aged just four</a>). The unfortunate consequences of our just-world beliefs were first demonstrated in now <a href="http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf">classic research</a> by Melvin Lerner and Carolyn Simmons. In a version of the Milgram set-up, in which a female learner was punished with electric shocks for wrong answers, women participants subsequently rated her as less likeable and admirable when they heard that they would be seeing her suffer again, and especially if they felt powerless to minimise this suffering. Presumably derogating the woman made them feel less bad about her dismal fate. Since then, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_12">research</a> has shown our willingness to blame the poor, rape victims, AIDS patients and others for their fate, so as to preserve our belief in a just world. By extension, the same or similar processes are likely responsible for <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/09/30/they-deny-it-but-the-middle-classes-have-a-subconscious-positive-bias-toward-the-rich/">our subconscious rose-tinted view of rich people</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We are blinkered and dogmatic</strong><br />
It’s not just that we are malicious and unforgiving, we humans are worryingly close-minded too. If people were rational and open-minded, then the straightforward way to correct someone’s false beliefs would be to present them with some relevant facts. However <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-05421-001">a modern classic published in 1967</a> showed the futility of this approach – participants who believed strongly for or against the death penalty completely ignored facts that undermined their position, actually doubling-down on their initial view. This seems to occur in part because we see opposing facts as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-persuade-people-with-facts/">undermining our sense of identity</a>. It doesn’t help that many of us are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/05/most-of-us-are-overconfident-about-how-much-we-understand-things-this-simple-intervention-can-help/">overconfident about how much we understand things</a>, and that when we believe our opinions are superior to others, this <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/31/people-who-think-their-opinions-are-superior-to-others-are-most-prone-to-overestimating-their-relevant-knowledge-and-ignoring-chances-to-learn-more/">deters us from seeking out further relevant knowledge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We would rather electrocute ourselves than spend time in our own thoughts</strong><br />
Maybe if we spent a little more time in contemplation we would not be so blinkered. Sadly, for many of us, it seems the prospect of spending time in our own thoughts is so anathema we’d actually rather electrocute ourselves. This was demonstrated dramatically in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/03/is-it-the-darkness-within-some-people-would-rather-shock-themselves-with-electricity-than-spend-time-with-their-own-thoughts/">a 2014 study</a> in which 67 per cent of male participants and 25 per cent of female participants opted to give themselves unpleasant electric shocks rather than spend 15 minutes in peaceful contemplation. Although others <a href="http://datacolada.org/25">questioned</a> the interpretation of the results, at least <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178116301524">one other study</a> has shown people’s preference for electrocuting themselves over monotony, and another found <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-35570-001">cross-cultural evidence</a> for people’s greater enjoyment of doing some activity alone rather than merely thinking (also replicated <a href="https://osf.io/qwked/">here</a>). The gist of these findings would seem to back up the verdict of the French philosopher Blaise Pascal who stated that “All of man’s troubles come from his inability to sit quietly in a room by himself”.</p>
<p><strong>We are vain and overconfident</strong><br />
Our irrationality and dogmatism might not be so bad were they married with some humility and self-insight, but actually most of us walk about with inflated views of our abilities and qualities, such as our driving skills, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/">intelligence</a> and attractiveness – a phenomenon that’s been dubbed the Lake Wobegon Effect after the fictional town where “all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average”. Ironically, the least skilled among us are the most prone to over-confidence (the so-called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367%20">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>). This vain self-enhancement seems to be most extreme and irrational in the case of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">our morality</a>, such as in how principled and fair we think we are. In fact, even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/02/10/jailed-criminals-think-they-are-kinder-more-trustworthy-and-honest-than-the-average-member-of-the-public/">jailed criminals think they are kinder, more trustworthy and honest than the average member of the public</a>. Our vanity manifests in other ways too: for instance, researchers believe that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-09227-005">our preference for donating to charities that share our initials</a> is a form of “implicit egotism”.</p>
<p><strong>We are moral hypocrites</strong><br />
Not only do we tend to overestimate our own virtuousness, we are also inclined to moral hypocrisy. Findings in this area suggest it may pay to be wary of those who are the quickest and loudest in condemning the moral failings of others – the chances are the moral preacher is as guilty themselves, but of course they happen to take a far lighter view of their own transgressions. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108000553">one study</a> to show this––suitably titled “The duality of virtue: Deconstructing the moral hypocrite”––researchers found that people rated the exact same selfish behaviour (giving oneself the quicker and easier of two experimental tasks on offer) as far less fair when perpetuated by others, than by themselves. Similarly, there is a long-studied phenomenon known as actor-observer asymmetry, which in part describes <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217711918">our tendency</a> to attribute other people’s bad deeds, such as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2017.1350578">our partner’s infidelities</a>, to their characters, while attributing the same deeds performed by ourselves as due to situational influences. These self-serving double-standards could even explain the common feeling that incivility is on the increase – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/08/your-sense-that-rudeness-is-on-the-increase-is-probably-just-another-self-serving-bias/">recent research</a> showed how we view the same acts of rudeness far more harshly when they are committed by strangers than by our friends or ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>We are all potential trolls</strong><br />
Unfortunately, as anyone who has found themselves in a spat on Twitter will attest, social media may be magnifying some of the worst aspects of human nature, no doubt in part due to the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295">online disinhibition effect</a>, and the fact that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395662">anonymity</a> (easy to achieve online) is known to increase our inclinations for immorality. While research has suggested that people who are prone to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/26/a-laboratory-study-of-everyday-sadism/">everyday sadism</a> (which is a worryingly high proportion of us) are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12393">especially inclined</a> to online trolling, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791909/">a study published last year</a> revealed how being in a bad mood, and being exposed to trolling by others, together double the likelihood of a person engaging in trolling – in fact, these situational factors were a stronger predictor of a person’s trolling behaviour than their individual traits, leading the researchers at Stanford and Cornell to conclude “that ordinary users will also troll when mood and discussion context prompt such behavior”. Of course this implies that initial trolling by a few can cause a snowball of increasing negativity, which is exactly what the researchers found when they studied reader discussion on CNN.com, with the “proportion of flagged posts and proportion of users with flagged posts … rising over time”.</p>
<p><strong>We favour ineffective leaders with psychopathic traits</strong><br />
One way for us to mitigate against our human failings would be if we were inclined to choose leaders with rare virtuousness and skill. Sadly, we seem to have the opposite knack. Consider for a moment President Donald Trump. In seeking to explain his voter appeal, Dan McAdams, a professor of personality psychology, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/09/can-evolutionary-psychology-and-personality-theory-explain-trumps-popular-appeal/">recently concluded</a> that Trump’s overt aggression and insults have a “primal appeal”, and that his “incendiary tweets” are like the “charging displays” of an alpha male chimp, “designed to intimidate”. Trump’s supporters will disagree, but if McAdams’ assessment is true it would fit into a wider pattern – the finding that psychopathic traits are more common than average among leaders. Take <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14999013.2014.951103?journalCode=ufmh20">a survey</a> of financial leaders in New York that found they scored highly on psychopathic traits but lower than average in emotional intelligence. In fairness, there have been some null and contradictory findings on this topic too, but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327039686_Shall_We_Serve_the_Dark_Lords_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Psychopathy_and_Leadership">a meta-analysis</a> (an overview of prior evidence) published this summer concluded there is indeed a modest but significant link between trait psychopathy and leadership emergence, and that this has practical implications – especially since psychopathy also correlates with poorer leadership performance.</p>
<p><strong>We are sexually attracted to people with dark personality traits </strong><br />
To worsen the situation, not only do we elect people with psychopathic traits to become our leaders, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167213483580">evidence</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/29/how-do-people-with-dark-triad-personality-traits-fare-at-speed-dating/">suggests</a> that men and women are sexually attracted, at least in the short-term, to people displaying the so-called “dark triad” of traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – thus risking further propagating these traits. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913012245">study</a> found women’s physical attraction to a man was increased when he was described as having dark traits (as self-interested, manipulative and insensitive) compared with being described in the same way (in terms of his interests and so on), but with reference to the dark traits removed. One theory is that the dark traits successfully communicate “mate quality” in terms of confidence and the willingness to take risks. Does this matter for the future of our species? Perhaps it does – <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816300010">another paper</a>, from 2016, found that those women who were more strongly attracted to narcissistic men’s faces tended to have more children.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Are we doomed?</strong> One comforting caveat – most of the dating research relevant to that last item was based on European American samples and may not generalise to other cultures (in fact <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518790103">a study out this year</a> found that among Asian Americans, it was those men and women with more pro-social traits who were more successful at speed dating). But then again, there is a lot more depressing research that I could not fit into this article, such as the studies showing we’re <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/03/28/envy-is-a-stronger-motivator-than-admiration/">more motivated by envy than admiration</a>, the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/25/how-do-lying-skill-and-frequency-change-through-life-from-childhood-to-old-age/">shocking prevalence of lying</a> (a habit we start at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/02/21/lying-is-common-at-age-two-becomes-the-norm-by-three/">age two</a>), and the manipulativeness of babies – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/15/systematic-evidence-of-fake-crying-by-a-baby/">they fake cry you know</a>!</p>
<p>Don’t get too down – these findings say nothing of the success some of our heroes, heroines and saints have had in overcoming their baser instincts. In fact, it is arguably by acknowledging and understanding our shortcomings that we can more successfully overcome them and so cultivate the better angels of our nature. On which note, remember to hang tight for the sequel to this post that will detail 10 findings showcasing the brighter, more uplifting aspects of humankind.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/multimedia-140x110.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As a result of smartphones, tablets, and other devices being entrenched in our lives, our attention is in high demand as we switch between multiple devices, a behavior known as <em>media multitasking</em>. Indeed, we may find ourselves mindlessly scrolling through our Twitter feed on our phone and then suddenly checking our email on our tablet. Because this behavior is new for our species, the impact of media multitasking on how we perceive and interact with the world and those around us is not well known.</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that frequent media multitasking is linked to altered cognitive processing, whereby irrelevant stimuli exert a disproportionately strong “pull” and negatively impact performance on various cognitive tasks. This led us to wonder whether regular media multitaskers might also incorporate irrelevant stimuli when thinking about other people, specifically when making impressions and judgments about another person whom they never had met before.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10583 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/breakfast-brunch-cell-phone-693269-300x200.jpg" width="300" />We hypothesized that in general, participants would use relevant information during impression formation, but that those who reported more frequent media multitasking would also, unwittingly, use irrelevant and extraneous stimuli in the environment that would affect their impressions of the other person.</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we randomly assigned participants to watch one of two versions of a video in which a previously unknown person – allegedly a peer but actually a confederate – talked informally about their day while sitting in their (presumed) dorm room.</p>
<p>In one version of the video, the room was clean and organized, with various items neatly arranged and the floor clear of clutter. In another version of the video the room was generally messy and in disarray, with clothes and other personal effects strewn about the bed and floor. These neat/messy cues in the video served as potentially relevant information when forming an impression of the person (e.g., the person is tidy, or messy/disorganized).</p>
<p>Next, we randomly assigned participants to complete the experiment in a testing room that was <em>actually</em> neat or messy. We reasoned that the neat/messy cues in the testing room would be incidental and irrelevant, thus having no bearing on participants’ impressions of the person they saw in the video. In addition to experimentally manipulating both relevant and irrelevant cues, we measured participants’ tendencies to engage in media multitasking behaviors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10582" style="width: 553px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10582" height="293" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/media-multitasker-300x162.png" width="543" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The two video conditions and the two testing room conditions that participants experienced</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Replicating previous work by <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-823379.pdf">Samuel Gosling and others</a>, we found that participants did incorporate relevant cues from the video when forming their impressions of the unknown person; those participants assigned to view the messy version of the video gave lower ratings of the person’s conscientiousness compared to participants who viewed the clean version of the video.</p>
<blockquote><p>…media multitasking may in fact be associated with altered person perception in unexpected and unintended ways, with frequent media multitaskers unknowingly taking in otherwise irrelevant information from their environment when they perceive other people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, consistent with our hypothesis, we observed a significant interaction between the testing room condition (featuring irrelevant cues) and media multitasking, such that frequent media multitaskers assigned to complete the experiment in the messy testing room gave <em>lower</em> conscientiousness ratings, relative to ratings given in the neat testing room. There was no such pattern observed for participants who reported average or infrequent levels of media multitasking.</p>
<p>From these results, we concluded that media multitasking may in fact be associated with altered person perception in unexpected and unintended ways, with frequent media multitaskers unknowingly taking in otherwise irrelevant information from their environment when they perceive other people. If this is true, then perhaps this process is also at play in other domains, such as encountering environmental cues that elicit eating behaviors or various emotions.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats that are worth mentioning that we hope will inform future research. First, the generalizability of these findings is only limited to the college-aged population. It is not clear whether these effects would also be observed in other age groups. Additionally, we did not manipulate participants’ media multitasking behaviors directly, so a strong causal link between media multitasking and person perception cannot be made. However, future work may be able to identify preceding factors that put people at higher or lower risk of becoming frequent media multitaskers in the first place.</p>

<p><br />
<em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.davidrobson.me/">David Robson</a></p>
<p>Towards the end of the Disney film <em>Aladdin</em>, our hero’s love rival, the evil Jafar, discovers Aladdin’s secret identity and steals his magic lamp. Jafar’s wish to become the world’s most powerful sorcerer is soon granted and he then uses his powers to banish Aladdin to the ends of the Earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What follows next is a lingering, close-up of Jafar’s body. He leans forward, fists clenched, with an almost constipated look on his face. He then explodes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrbKkCp43Ek">in uncontrollable cackles</a> that echo across the landscape. For many millennials growing up in the 1990s, it is an archetypical evil laugh.</p>
<p>Such overt displays of delight at others’ misfortune are found universally in kids’ films, and many adult thriller and horror films too. Just think of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnfDXznMf0E">rapturous guffaws of the alien in the first Predator</a> film as it is about to self-detonate, taking Arnold Schwarzenegger with it. Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMxHBfPQgtE">Jack Nicholson’s chilling snicker in The Shining</a>. Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5lXmds468Q">Wario’s manic crowing</a> whenever Mario was defeated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jpcu.12728">recent essay</a> by Jens Kjeldgaard-Christiansen in the <i>Journal of Popular Culture</i> asks what the psychology behind this might be. Kjeldgaard-Christiansen is well placed to provide an answer having previously used evolutionary psychology to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/12/02/can-evolutionary-psychology-explain-why-we-love-to-hate-evil-villains/">explain</a> the behaviours of heroes and villains in fiction more generally.</p>
<p><span id="more-34900"></span></p>
<p>In that work, he argued that one of the core traits a villain should show is a low “welfare trade-off” ratio: they are free-riders who cheat and steal, taking from their community while contributing nothing. Such behaviour is undesirable for societies today, but it would have been even more of a disaster in prehistory when the group’s very survival depended on everyone pulling their weight. As a result, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen argues we are wired to be particularly disgusted by cheating free-riders – to the point that we may even feel justified in removing them from the group, or even killing them.</p>
<p>However, there are degrees of villainy and the most dangerous and despised people are those who are not only free riders and cheats, but psychopathic sadists, who perform callous acts for sheer pleasure. Sure enough, previous <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277282">studies</a> have shown that it is people matching this description whom we consider to be truly evil (since there is no other way to excuse or explain their immorality) and therefore deserving of the harshest punishments. Crucially, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen argues that a wicked laugh offers one of the clearest signs that a villain harbours such evil, gaining “open and candid enjoyment” from others’ suffering – moreover, fiction writers know this intuitively, time and again using the malevolent cackle to identify their darkest characters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Part of the power of the evil laugh comes from its salience, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen says: it is both highly visual and vocal (as the close up of Jafar beautifully demonstrates) and the staccato rhythm can be particularly piercing. What’s more, laughs are hard to fake: a genuine, involuntary laugh relies on the rapid oscillation of the “intrinsic laryngeal muscles”, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109051381400035X">movements that appear to be difficult to produce by our own volition without sounding artificial</a>. As a result, it’s generally a reliable social signal of someone’s reaction to an event, meaning that we fully trust what we are hearing. Unlike dialog – even the kind found in a children’s film – a sadistic or malevolent laugh leaves little room for ambiguity, so there can be little doubt about the villain’s true motives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Such laughs are also particularly chilling because they run counter to the usual pro-social function of laughter – the way it arises spontaneously during friendly chats, for example, serving to cement social bonds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are practical reasons too for the ubiquity of the evil laugh in children’s animations and early video games, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen explains. The crude graphics of the first Super Mario or Kung Fu games for Nintendo, say, meant it was very hard to evoke an emotional response in the player – but equipping the villain with an evil laugh helped to create some kind of moral conflict between good and evil that motivated the player to don their cape and beat the bad guys. “This is the only communicative gesture afforded to these vaguely anthropomorphic, pixelated opponents, and it does the job,” he notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are limits to the utility of the evil laugh in story-telling, though. Kjeldgaard-Christiansen admits that its crude power would be destructive in more complex story-telling, since the display of pleasure at others’ expense would prevent viewers from looking for more subtle motivations or the role of context and circumstance in a character’s behaviour. But for stories dealing with black and white morality, such as those aimed at younger viewers who have not yet developed a nuanced understanding of the world, its potential to thrill is second to none.</p>
<p>Kjeldgaard-Christiansen’s article is certainly one of the most entertaining papers I have read in a long time [get open access <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jpcu.12728?author_access_token=-Q9Xpc2ySNfbe7EcTn4-Nota6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC65QVwe4VU8zu_SAT2vofYF2N2AKSf5i3dD0x8maYjswLfFq_8d5GVijCpBh2MulhWLBavm0wTmezrPrjVadLHLc">here</a>], and his psychological theories continue to be thought provoking. It would be fun to see more experimental research on this subject – comparing the acoustic properties of laughs, for instance, to find out which sounds the most evil. But in my mind, it will always be Jafar’s.</p>

If successful, however, Plan S could have a dramatic impact on both publishers and researchers. For instance, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">reported</a></span> <i>Nature</i>, as written the 10 principles could see European researchers barred from publishing in 85% of journals, including influential titles such as <i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The ‘S’ in Plan S can stand for ‘science, speed, solution, shock’, Smits <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">told</a></span> <i>Nature</i>. Shock would certainly seem to be an appropriate word, and shock was surely what publishers felt when Plan S was announced. After all, they have successfully managed to delay and subvert open access for some 25 years now. They perhaps assumed they could continue doing so. But if successful, Plan S could bring this dilly-dallying to a dramatic end. Alternatively, Plan S could fail to achieve its objectives. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>That publishers do not like Plan S is, of course, no surprise. That was doubtless what the architects of the initiative anticipated. What they perhaps did not anticipate was that they would face pushback from researchers. Yet just a week after the announcement nine researchers published a critical article entitled, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><i><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2018/09/11/response-to-plan-s-from-academic-researchers-unethical-too-risky/">A Response to Plan-S from Academic Researchers: Unethical, Too Risky!</a></i></span> This appears to have shocked the Plan S architects as thoroughly as their plan must have shocked publishers. Smits immediately summoned two of the authors to Brussels, and Schiltz took to Twitter to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://twitter.com/marcschiltz1/status/1041806272042098689">suggest</a></span> that the article was “slanderous”.

While publishers (and at least some researchers) are appalled by Plan S, open access advocates, as could be expected, have welcomed the initiative.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Disappointed</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The problem right now, however, is that there is too little information on how Plan S would work in practice. This means it is nigh impossible for informed commentary to take place, and we are seeing frequent calls for clarification. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>On 12<sup>th</sup> September, therefore, I invited Smits to do an interview with me, in the hope that he could provide that clarification. I suggested we do this either by telephone or email. Smits agreed and said he would prefer to do it by email. So, I emailed him a list of questions and waited for his replies. These arrived on Monday this week.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I have to confess to being disappointed on reading them. From my perspective, they do not provide the clarification I was hoping they would. I accept that my questions are long and somewhat sceptical (some might say tendentious) but, as I saw it, they offered Smits a chance to dispel some of the confusion around Plan S and to demonstrate that my scepticism is misplaced. I didn’t feel he did either.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>When I shared my disappointment with Smits he expressed surprise and replied, “I looked once more to the replies I sent to your questions and remain of the opinion that they address the issues you put forward.” He added that he is getting over 300 emails a day and tries to reply to each one – signalling that time is in short supply for him.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I am, of course, entirely sympathetic to the challenge Smits faces with Plan S, and the huge demand it must be making on his time. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of confusion out there, and on reading his replies I could not help but feel he had missed an opportunity to clarify matters. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This seemed the more striking given his assurance to me that, “my door is open to anyone who wants to drop by to discuss Open Access and Plan S”. He added that he prefers a ‘face to face’ approach to using email. Perhaps it might have helped, I thought, if he had taken up my offer of a telephone interview – or even a face to face on Skype.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Meat in the sandwich</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But maybe I was missing the point. What we learn from what Smits says below perhaps is something that had not occurred to me, and perhaps has not occurred to the many commentators on social media calling for clarification. In two of his answers, Smits indicates that the ball is now in the publishers’ court. As he puts it the first time he says it, “We expect publishers to come forward with offerings which comply with the principles outlined in Plan S”. Later he says, “It is for publishers to provide Plan S-compliant routes to publication in their journals so that researchers can choose where to publish when accepting funding from those who sign Plan S.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This would seem to imply that Smits and the members of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/">cOAlition S</a></span> (the group of funders who have signed up to Plan S) are not currently especially concerned about the details of how the 10 principles will be implemented, just that they will be implemented. In other words, cOAlition S is saying to publishers: “These are the conditions that we plan to insist on when funding research in Europe from 2020. So long as you can meet these conditions the details of how you do so are not of great interest to us right now. It is for you publishers to tell us how <i>you</i> plan to implement the principles.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Presumably, it is only after publishers have done this that cOAlition S expects to publish the implementation plan that Smits talks about below. And while he says he is happy to discuss Plan S with “all interested groups”, Smits insists that cOAlition S will “stand by the principles set out in Plan S”. We might wonder what benefit there is in discussions if cOAlition S is immoveable on the 10 principles. And in the meantime, of course, researchers can expect to face a great deal of uncertainty.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>That said, at first blush, this might seem like a good approach. In fact, I have myself on a number of occasions argued that publishers should not be treated as stakeholders, but as service providers. As such, the research community should be telling them what services it would like them to provide, and then inviting them to quote for providing them. Only if the conditions and the price are acceptable should the research community then proceed to contract any particular publisher to provide the service tendered for. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The problem with the way in which Plan S seems intent on doing this, however, is two-fold. First, regardless of the talk of (unspecified) APC caps, it is not clear how these can be effectively applied – particularly if the rest of the world does not follow Europe’s example. As a result, the research community may find it has to shell out even more money for publishers’ services, regardless of any caps. And what happens if publishers decide not to engage with Plan S in any meaningful way? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Second (and more importantly), it could be argued that European funders are not part of the research community. They are its paymasters. And in the neoliberal environment in which universities now have to operate, researchers’ interests are not fully aligned with those of research funders. This means that in its battle with publishers, cOAlition S may end up punishing European researchers as, or more, brutally than it punishes the real target – publishers. Researchers will be the meat in the sandwich of Plan S, collateral damage in a war that the vast majority of them never signed up to, or wanted to see take place. There are also very real concerns that Plan S will wreak havoc on learned societies. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is for these reasons, I believe, that in opposing Plan S researchers often do so in terms of a threat to academic freedom.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>That OA advocates tend to ridicule and deride those who fret over academic freedom suggests to me that they have become so focused on the <i>ends</i> of OA that they are blind to the damage that the <i>means </i>might inflict on their peers, and on many societies.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Highly unlikely</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Finally, I want to answer one of the questions that Smits puts back to me below. He asks, “Why do you keep on saying that Plan S is about Gold Open Access? Do read the 10 principles again and you will notice that the plan does not use Gold or Green terminology. The plan welcomes self-archiving and repositories.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>My answer is this: It doesn’t matter whether the terms Green or Gold are used. Principle 1 of Plan S states, “Authors [must] retain copyright of their publication with no restrictions. All publications must be published under an open license, preferably the Creative Commons Attribution Licence CC BY.” And cOAlition S insists that this applies to both gold and green OA, and in all cases OA must be immediate.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It seems highly unlikely to me that for-profit legacy publishers will offer green OA on those terms. Instead, they will focus on gold OA and seek to extract as much money as possible from the research community, caps or no caps, even as many non-profit learned societies face an existential financial threat.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Importantly, as Peter Suber has <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/iGEFpdYY9dr">pointed out</a></span>, there is no acknowledgement in Plan S that repositories can provide OA. This suggests they are seen as archival tools alone.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The good news is that when I expressed my disappointment with his answers Smits said he would be happy to meet with me when he is in London next month. If that meeting takes place perhaps I will be able to get a clearer view of how Smits sees Plan S achieving its objectives, and why he routinely pooh-poohs any talk of academic freedom in relation to his initiative.<b></b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: As I understand it, the background to Plan S is that during the Dutch Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2016 the EU issued the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Call_for_Action_on_Open_Science">Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science</a></span>. (At the time you were Director-General for Research and Innovation at the EU). This called for “immediate” open access to all scientific papers by 2020. But by the end of 2017 it was clear that this goal was not going to be achieved unless more drastic action was taken, not least because the Amsterdam Call offered no specific strategy for achieving OA by 2020. Earlier this year, therefore, you were appointed Special Adviser on Open Access and Innovation and charged with making sure it happened. Plan S is your solution and it consists of 10 principles, the key one being that “After 1 January 2020 scientific publications on the results from research funded by public grants provided by national and European research councils and funding bodies, must be published in compliant Open Access Journals or on compliant Open Access Platforms.” In fact, Plan S is a list of principles, not a detailed action plan. That is, it is not a mandate but what OA advocate Peter Suber <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/iGEFpdYY9dr">describes as</a></span> “a plan for a mandate”. I realise that some transition arrangements are envisaged, but how realistic is it to expect that in 15 months’ time all European research will be made immediately available on an OA basis, particularly if legacy publishers prove reluctant to co-operate in a meaningful way?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>R-J S</span></b><span>: The 2016 Amsterdam Call set the 2020 target and, since little progress is being made, Plan S provides the specific strategy which you mention to achieve that target. However, Plan S cannot and will not override contracts which are in place before 1/1/20 and of course, we are willing to respect short-term transitional arrangements and on-going discussions on such arrangements.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: I wonder if it might be more accurate to say that Plan S is intended to frighten legacy publishers into moving more quickly towards OA, with the end game (presumably) of having them flip all their subscription journals to open access (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://openaccess.mpg.de/2121558/MPDL_Open_Access_White_Paper">as some have propo</a>sed</span>), and reducing their prices in the process? Either way, do you expect legacy publishers to accept all the principles outlined in Plan S (and incorporated into <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/">cOAlition S</a></span> under the aegis of Science Europe?). As things stand, it would seem that the International Association of STM Publishers does not accept the proposal that hybrid OA be outlawed. And I do not think it expects publishers to reduce their prices. As STM <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/2018_09_04_STM_Statement_on_PlanS.pdf">puts it</a></span>, “in the absence of adequate funding a transition to Open Access as envisaged by cOAlition S is unlikely to happen in practice.”</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>R-J S</span></b><span>: We expect publishers to come forward with offerings which comply with the principles outlined in Plan S.

Either way, we are seeing pushback. Last week, for instance, one of the leading open access advocates Stevan Harnad <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1205-Open-Access-Plan-S-Needs-to-Drop-Option-B.html">called</a></span> for Plan S (and all OA policies) to drop any requirement for gold OA publishing and focus exclusively on mandating green OA (self-archiving). This would seem to envisage Plan S being reversed since it is currently almost exclusively focused on gold OA. Three days earlier, eight researchers published <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2018/09/11/response-to-plan-s-from-academic-researchers-unethical-too-risky/">a highly-critical article</a></span> about Plan S, denouncing it as unethical and too risky. I assume such criticism is of concern as I am told you called the lead author of the article <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://kamerlinlab.com/groupleader/">Lynn Kamerlin</a></span> and invited her to Brussels to discuss Plan S. How confident are you that you can address her and other researchers’ concerns? They clearly feel they are becoming the meat in the sandwich in the struggle between research funders and legacy publishers. And might we see resistance amongst researchers grow as the implications of Plan S are more widely publicised and become clearer? Combined with publisher resistance might this necessitate significantly watering down or even abandoning key Plan S principles?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>R-J S</span></b><span>: You probably have seen the many positive reactions from researchers and representatives of the science community to Plan S.

This is one of the concerns expressed by de facto leader of the OA movement Peter Suber, who <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/iGEFpdYY9dr">has written</a></span> of Plan S, “There's no acknowledgement of their [repositories and green OA] importance for OA itself! This is the same mistake made by the Finch Group in 2012, which was inexcusable even at the time, and should never be repeated by informed, high-level policy-makers.” I assume, however, that the reality is that green OA inevitably conflicts with the principles of Plan S, which calls, amongst other things, for papers to be made OA “immediately” and with a CC BY licence attached. I cannot envisage many legacy publishers agreeing to this. So I guess the point is that if green OA cannot conform to the principles of Plan S then it cannot be viewed as providing open access, and that is presumably why Plan S does not view it as such. Would that be right? If not, how can this circle be squared?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><span>R-J S</span></b><span>: Plan S does not talk about Gold, Green, Diamond or Platinum Open Access.

I.e., he says, “platforms running on open-source software, under open standards, with open APIs for interoperability, preferably owned or hosted by non-profit organizations.” As such, Suber says, Plan S, will not prevent open infrastructure being appropriated by legacy publishers in the way that SSRN and bepress were acquired.

<p>Yi Sun's journal club session, where she will present the paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741300835X">Asynchronism-based principal component analysis for time series data mining (Hailin Li, 2014)</a>".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is often applied to dimensionality reduction for time series data mining. However, the principle of PCA is based on the synchronous covariance, which is not very effective in some cases. In this paper, an asynchronism-based principal component analysis (APCA) is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of univariate time series. In the process of APCA, an asynchronous method based on dynamic time warping (DTW) is developed to obtain the interpolated time series which derive from the original ones. The correlation coefficient or covariance between the interpolated time series represents the correlation between the original ones. In this way, a novel and valid principal component analysis based on the asynchronous covariance is achieved to reduce the dimensionality. The results of several experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach APCA outperforms PCA for dimensionality reduction in the field of time series data mining.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/AdobeStock_6311416-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It has been well documented that more and more young people are not drinking alcohol. In our study based on 9,699 adults aged 16 to 24 years, within the nationally representative <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/public-health/health-survey-for-england-health-social-care-and-lifestyles">Health Survey for England</a>, we found the proportion of non-drinkers increased from 18% in 2005 to 29% in 2015. This was driven by a larger proportion of young people not taking up drinking alcohol at all, which has almost doubled over the same period (9% to 17%).</p>
<p>Because the underlying factors driving this change are unknown we sought to examine whether the increasing trend in non-drinking applied to specific social, demographic and health groups, and whether these trends reflected established norms around non-drinking, or whether they suggested a cultural shift.</p>
<h3><strong>An increase in non-drinking across groups</strong></h3>
<p>Non-drinking has traditionally been found to be higher among people with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.03878.x">lower incomes, lower education, poorer mental and physical heath, and ethnic minorities</a>. The social gradient in non-drinking remains unexplained, but may reflect that for many cultures drinking alcohol is the norm, being a regular feature in celebrations or social gatherings, and that those who are not drinking may not be like ‘the average’. Indeed previous research suggests that non-drinking students have been met with challenges, suggesting stigma surrounding non-drinking.</p>
<p>However, our study found that non-drinking was not increasing among these groups but rather across a wide spectrum including, among the white population, north and south regions, students, those in employment and across higher and lower social classes. No such increases in non-drinking were found among ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>When we assessed health factors, we found that over the same period non-drinking increased among non-smokers, those with good mental health, and across all BMI categories, (but not among those with poor mental health, and smokers). The increase in non-drinking found across broad groups suggests that this behavior is becoming more mainstream among young people, and the underlying drivers may be multi-factorial or cultural.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is non-drinking on the rise?</strong></h3>
<p>Recent cultural developments among young people that place abstinence at their core, including <a href="https://joinclubsoda.co.uk/">Club Soda-the mindful drinking movement</a> and <a href="http://morninggloryville.com/">morning raves without the alcohol</a>, support these claims. There has also been prolific health campaigns which promote periods of abstinence that have grown in popularity such as <em>Sober for October</em> and <em>Dry January</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found  the number of 16-24 year olds engaging in periodic abstinence increased … There has also been a reduction in the numbers drinking above recommended limits and binge drinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>The research evidence on alcohol is also growing; in recent years, we have learnt more about the link between <a href="http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4453639">alcohol and cancer</a>, and the possibility that any benefit of moderate consumption is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext">cancelled out when considering these harms</a> or are <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4164">non-existent</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor is that younger people may be more health conscious. This would coincide with the decline in other risky behaviors such as reduced <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/44880278">teenage pregnancies, drug use and smoking. </a></p>
<p>Along with an increase in non-drinking, we found  the number of 16-24 year olds engaging in periodic abstinence increased from one in three not drinking in the past week in 2005, to one in two in 2015. There has also been a reduction in the numbers drinking above recommended limits and binge drinking; over one in four had binge drank in the past week in 2005 compared with fewer than one in five in 2015.</p>
<p>This would be consistent with Skog’s theory on drinking behavior <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1360-0443.1985.tb05294.x"><em>‘The Collectivity of Drinking Cultures’</em></a> which suggests that population drinking patterns appears to move in tandem with one another; and it is actually reducing mean consumption that is effective in reducing problematic drinking overall.</p>
<p>The increase in non-drinking should be welcomed from a public health standpoint, especially given <a href="http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/en/">the recent report by the World Health Organization</a> which attributes more than 5% of all worldwide deaths to alcohol consumption. The trend for abstinence and benefits to public health could be capitalized on going forward. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-england-and-drinkaware-launch-drink-free-days">The recent campaigns such as Public Health England’s ‘adopt alcohol-free days’</a> specifically targeted at older consumers who tend to drink lighter but more frequently, but have not have not experienced a similar increase in non-drinking, is an example of this.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Shame feels so awful it’s hard to see how it could have an upside, especially when you consider specific triggers of the emotion – such as body-shaming, which involves criticising someone for how their body looks. But is shame always an ugly emotion that we should try to do away with? Or can it be helpful?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The answer, according to a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/39/9702">new study</a> published in <i>PNAS</i> of 899 people from all over the world is that, as an emotion, shame can not only be useful but is fundamental to our ability to survive and thrive in a group. The essential job of shame, it seems, is to stop us from being <i>too</i> selfish for our own good.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34945"></span></p>
<p>Daniel Sznycer at the University of Montreal, Canada, and his colleagues interviewed people living in 15 very different small-scale societies, including in the Andes in Ecuador, a remote region of Siberia, and the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers asked one group from each society for their thoughts on 12 hypothetical situations involving a person of the same sex as them, including how much shame this person should feel if he or she was ugly, or lazy, or stole from someone in the community, for example. Participants were also asked to indicate, using a four-point scale, how negatively they would view this person as a result (thus providing an indication of how much that person would be “devalued” by others). The researchers also asked members of a fresh group of participants in each society to indicate, again on a four-point scale, how much shame they would themselves feel in the various hypothetical situations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, the researchers found very close agreement between the degree of felt shame that participants estimated being associated with a given act or state and how much they indicated a person would be de-valued as a result of committing that act/ being in that state. This was particularly true within a society, but it also held across societies. “The fact that the same pattern is encountered in such mutually remote communities suggests that shame’s match to audience devaluation is a design feature crafted by [natural] selection, and not a product of cultural contact or convergent cultural evolution,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Our ancestors lived in small, close-knit bands, and they depended on each other for survival. In bad times, especially, they had to rely on each other to pull through. Always being selfless wouldn’t have been wise, as the individual would likely have been exploited. But for someone always to act contrary to the group’s ideas of what mattered, and what was important (that all members should contribute to the tasks important for survival, for example), would have been a bad move, too, as they could have found themselves shunned or even exiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To thrive, the researchers argue, a person would have had to accurately weigh the payoff of an act (taking food without telling others, or pretending to be sick instead of foraging or hunting, for instance) against the cost if they were found out. The results of the study suggest that shame evolved to help us to make the right decision – to act in our own long-term interests by not seriously jeopardising our place in our social group. Shame, then, functions like pain – as a warning not to repeat a behaviour that threatens our own wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This doesn’t mean, of course, that shame is always good. If your group has badly skewed ideas about what really matters – if it places a high value on what clothes you wear, or what your body looks like, for example – then shame is skewed too, into something that isn’t helpful, but harmful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The newspaper l'Express  reported that Academie de Sciences commissioned an investigative report about the papers of former CNRS interim president Anne Peyroche, and that CNRS and the French Ministry of Research tried to suppress it. Peyroche herself could not be heard, because she is hospitalised since the affair started. So her co-authors took that as opportunity to blame Peyroche for every fake figure. Meanwhile, duplicated data was found even in Research Minister's Frederique Vidal's paper.

<p>In what feels like an increasingly polarised world, trying to convince the “other side” to see things differently often feels <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-persuade-people-with-facts/">futile</a>. Psychology has done a great job outlining some of the reasons why, including showing that, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/25/new-studies-suggest-liberals-are-as-blinkered-and-biased-as-conservatives/">regardless of political leanings</a>, most people are highly motivated to protect their existing views.</p>
<p>However a problem with some of this research is that it is very difficult to concoct opposing real-life arguments of equal validity, so as to make a fair comparison of people’s treatment of arguments they agree and disagree with.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, an elegant <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2018.1518961">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Cognitive Psychology</em> has tested people’s ability to assess the logic of formal arguments (syllogisms) structured in the exact same way, but that featured wording that either confirmed or contradicted their existing views on abortion. The results provide a striking demonstration of how our powers of reasoning are corrupted by our prior attitudes.</p>
<p><span id="more-34890"></span></p>
<p>Vladimíra Čavojová at the Slovak Academy of Sciences and her colleagues recruited 387 participants in Slovakia and Poland, mostly university students. The researchers first assessed the students’ views on abortion (a highly topical and contentious issue in both countries), then they presented them with 36 syllogisms – these are formal logical arguments that come in the form of three statements (see examples, below).</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 2018-10-09 09.31.06.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34932" data-attachment-id="34932" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2018-10-09 09.31.06" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/screenshot-2018-10-09-09-31-06.png?w=845?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/screenshot-2018-10-09-09-31-06.png?w=845?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/screenshot-2018-10-09-09-31-06.png?w=845" data-orig-size="3196,1140" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/09/my-side-bias-makes-it-difficult-for-us-to-see-the-logic-in-arguments-we-disagree-with/screenshot-2018-10-09-09-31-06/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/screenshot-2018-10-09-09-31-06.png?w=845" /></p>
<p>The participants’ challenge was to determine whether the third statement of each syllogism followed logically from the first two, always assuming that those initial two premises were true. This was a test of pure logical reasoning – to succeed at the task, one only needs to assess the logic, putting aside one’s prior knowledge or beliefs (to reinforce that this was a test of logic, the participants were instructed to always treat the first two premises of each syllogism as true).</p>
<p>Crucially, while some of the syllogisms were neutral, others featured a final statement germane to the abortion debate, either on the side of pro-life or pro-choice (but remember this was irrelevant to the logical consistency of the syllogisms).</p>
<p>Čavojová and her team found that the participants’ existing attitudes to abortion interfered with their powers of logical reasoning – the size of this effect was modest but statistically significant.</p>
<p>Mainly the participants had trouble accepting as logical those valid syllogisms that contradicted their existing beliefs, and similarly they found it difficult to reject as illogical those invalid syllogisms that conformed with their beliefs. This seemed to be particularly the case for participants with more pro-life attitudes. What’s more, this “my-side bias” was actually greater among participants with prior experience or training in logic (the researchers aren’t sure why, but perhaps prior training in logic gave participants even greater confidence to accept syllogisms that supported their current views – whatever the reason, it shows again what a challenge it is for people to think objectively).</p>
<p>“Our results show why debates about controversial issues often seem so futile,” the researchers said. “Our values can blind us to acknowledging the same logic in our opponent’s arguments if the values underlying these arguments offend our own.”</p>
<p>This is just the latest study that illustrates the difficulty we have in assessing evidence and arguments objectively. Related research that we’ve covered recently has also shown that: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/20/our-brains-rapidly-and-automatically-process-opinions-we-agree-with-as-if-they-are-facts/">our brains treat opinions we agree with as facts</a>; that many of us <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/31/people-who-think-their-opinions-are-superior-to-others-are-most-prone-to-overestimating-their-relevant-knowledge-and-ignoring-chances-to-learn-more/">over-estimate our knowledge</a>; how we’re biased <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/01/psychologists-uncover-a-new-self-serving-bias-if-its-my-theory-it-must-be-true/">to see our own theories as accurate</a>; and that when the facts appear to contradict our beliefs, well then <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/01/20/when-our-beliefs-are-threatened-by-facts-we-turn-to-unfalsifiable-justifications/">we turn to unfalsifiable arguments</a>. These findings and others show that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/20/5-reasons-its-so-hard-to-think-like-a-scientist/">thinking objectively does not come easily to most people</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: Join us Monday, October 15 at the Cambridge <a href="https://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/">Festival of Ideas</a> for a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/failures-key-to-success-in-science-cambridge-festival-of-ideas-2018-tickets-46802067243">free</a> interactive discussion with panelists from CamAWISE, University of Cambridge, the Sanger Institute, and Cambridge University Press to talk about how we can shift perceptions on failure and success in scientific careers.</em></p>
<p>Most scientists are fortunate to have a job that they love and feel passionate about, but a ‘successful’ career in research can be among the hardest career paths to pursue – dragons hide in almost every corner. In spite of many hours of effort and meticulous protocols, experiments fail and careful measurements yield unexpected results that one’s hypotheses cannot explain. There is also the risk that the same or related results are suddenly published by another group. These events are often regarded as failures in a research environment, but are they really failures? Could they actually hold the key to success in science?</p>
<p>There is scope to redefine what failure and success mean in science, and there are signs that the recipe for having a successful research career is changing. Being ‘scooped’ by a ‘competitor’ actually provides confirmation for your results, so shouldn’t that be viewed as support for the validity of your findings? Disseminating results fast in all of their forms, positive or negative – for example, as preprints – can also contribute significantly to the advancement of science; sharing all scholarly outputs allows others to build on the findings and prevents duplication of efforts.</p>
<p>Researchers are often constrained by a metric-based evaluation system that doesn’t reflect all the nuances, interactions and efforts that contribute to research endeavours. But some institutions and funders have started looking at their assessment framework afresh with a view to encouraging a more responsible use of metrics in the context of researcher assessment. At the same time, studies have consistently shown that there’s a lack of diversity in many scientific disciplines. In today’s landscape, where we have more options to travel and share information than ever before, we should move towards a place where diversity and collaboration are both sought and rewarded.</p>
<p>We will tackle all these questions and many more in the Cambridge <a href="https://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/">Festival of Ideas</a> event, “<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/failures-key-to-success-in-science-cambridge-festival-of-ideas-2018-tickets-46802067243">Failures: Key to success in science</a>”. We’ll host an interactive discussion to engage the public and bring forward recommendations for the research communities on how we can better celebrate efforts and discoveries that do not currently fit the mould of a ‘successful’ research career. Our five panellists will help us explore the topic from their different perspectives:</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Eglen</strong>, a reader in Computational Neuroscience (University of Cambridge)</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Hutton</strong>, a publisher (Open access journals, <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/index.php">Cambridge University Press</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Tapoka Mkandawire</strong>, a PhD candidate (<a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute, Cambridge</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Smith</strong>, Acting Joint Deputy Head of <a href="https://osc.cam.ac.uk/">Scholarly Communication</a> (University of Cambridge)</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="http://t.co/fIUHvVY1Sr">Mo Costandi</a><i></i></p>
<p>“How do you feel?” is a simple and commonly asked question that belies the complex nature of our conscious experiences. The feelings and emotions we experience daily consist of bodily sensations, often accompanied by some kind of thought process, yet we still know very little about exactly how these different aspects relate to one another, or about how such experiences are organised in the brain. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://t.co/wVfEOCmFU1">reporting their results in <em>PNAS</em></a>, a team of researchers in Finland, led by neuroscientist <a href="http://emotion.utu.fi/media/">Lauri Nummenmaa</a> of the University of Turku, has produced detailed maps of what they call the “human feeling space”, showing how each of dozens of these subjective feelings is associated with a unique set of bodily sensations.</p>
<p><span id="more-34895"></span></p>
<p>In 2014, Nummenmaa and his colleagues published <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646">bodily maps of emotions</a> showing the distinct bodily sensations associated with six basic emotions, such as anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and seven complex emotional states, such as anxiety, love, pride, and shame.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on this earlier work, for their new research they recruited 1,026 participants and asked them to complete an online survey designed to assess how they perceive 100 “core” subjective feelings, compiled from the American Psychological Association’s <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/">Dictionary of Psychology</a>, ranging from homeostatic states such as hunger and thirst, to emotional states such as anger and pleasure, and cognitive functions such as imagining and remembering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants were shown a list of the 100 core feelings on the computer screen, and asked to drag and drop each one into a box, placing similar feelings close to each other (<a href="http://emotion.nbe.aalto.fi/feelings_sim/">try it for yourself</a>). They also had to rate each feeling according to how much it is experienced in the body, how much of it is psychological, how pleasant it feels, and how much control they think they have over it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Their descriptions of the core feelings clustered into five distinct groups, based on similarity: Positive emotions, such as happiness and togetherness; negative emotions, such as fear and shame; thought processes, such as hearing and memorising; homeostatic sensations, such as hunger and thirst; and sensations associated with illness, such as coughing and sneezing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In another online experiment, Nummenmaa and his colleagues asked the participants to indicate exactly where in the body they felt each state, by colouring in a blank body shape, allowing them to map the bodily sensations associated with the each of the 100 core feelings.</p>
<p>The researchers then pooled these data to create “bodily sensation maps” for each of the core feelings (see image, above). For example, the participants localised the feeling of anger to the head, chest, and hands; feelings of hunger and thirst to the stomach and throat, respectively; and the feelings of ‘being conscious’, imagining, and remembering entirely to the head.</p>
<p>The maps showed that, despite the similarities, each core feeling was associated with a unique set of bodily sensations. For example, participants reported perceiving anger mostly in the head and hands, anxiety mostly in the chest; and sadness in the chest and head. Although similar feelings produced similar body maps, the intensity and precise distribution of bodily sensations associated with each was unique.</p>
<p>That both anger and fear were associated with intense bodily sensations in the head and chest adds to past work showing that both these emotions involve remarkably similar physiological changes to the body, and further explains why we usually have to depend on context to help us interpret the emotional meaning of our sensations.</p>
<p>The new results provide yet more evidence for the emerging idea that the body plays a crucial role in cognitive and emotional processes – something which has, until very recently, been overlooked. “In other words,” <a href="https://twitter.com/eglerean/status/1034499583588610048">says</a> study co-author Riita Hari, “the human mind is strongly embodied.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Brain surgery is not usually something that people actively seek out. However, there may be an exception: the idea of the removal of the amygdala seems to hold a fascination for many people.

Questions about the desirability of an amygdala-free life can be found in many places online. On Quora, there have been many queries about what amygdala removal would entail, and at least one brave user outright asked Can I have my amygdala removed? I came across the question on two other sites within the

<p>I've recently resurrected the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora SIG</a>. Many thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ignatenkobrain">Igor</a> and the others who had
worked on it in the past and have given us a firm base to build on.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-goal">
<h2>The goal</h2>
<p>The (current) goal of the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora SIG</a> is to make Fedora an easy to use
platform for neuroscientists. We aim to do this by making commonly used
Neuroscience software easily installable on a <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> system.</p>
<p>Neuroscience is an extremely multidisciplinary field. It brings together
mathematicians, chemists, biologists, physicists, psychologists, engineers
(electrical and others), computer scientists and more. A lot of software is used
nowadays in Neuroscience for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>data collection, analysis, and sharing</li>
<li>lots of image processing (a lot of ML is used here, think Data Science)</li>
<li>simulation of brain networks (<a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.org">Nest</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose">Moose</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN">PyNN</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://briansimulator.org/">Brian</a>)</li>
<li>dissemination of scientific results (peer reviewed and otherwise, think
<a class="reference external" href="http://tug.org/">LaTeX</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that a large proportion of neuroscientists are not trained in
computer science, a lot of time and effort is spent setting up systems,
installing software (often building whole <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency chains</a> from source). This can be
hard for people not well-versed in build systems and so on.</p>
<p>So, at <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a>, we will provide a ready to use <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> based system for
neuroscientists to work with, so they can quickly get their environment set up
and work on the science.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-fedora">
<h2>Why Fedora?</h2>
<p>For one, I have been a <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ankursinha">contributor</a> for a while and know the
<a class="reference external" href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/">community and the infrastructure</a> quite
well. That applies to me and others from the <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> community that may work on
this and not the research community in general.</p>
<p>Technically, there are many advantages of using <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> as a base.
Fedora is closely linked to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>
eco system---which <a class="reference external" href="https://www.centos.org/">Cent OS</a> is a part of and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/about/">Scientific Linux is</a> is based on
too (Recently, <a class="reference external" href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS also joined the Red Hat family</a>). RPM based systems are commonly deployed in
supercomputers and clusters. So, making this software available on <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> also
makes it simpler to make it available on these systems.  Additionally, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> community is promoting <a class="reference external" href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpaks</a>, and working to permit multiple
versions of software via the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/">modularity</a> system. <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> also supports <a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
very <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docker">well</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="join-us">
<h2>Join us!</h2>
<p>Packaging software is only <em>one</em> way in which one can contribute.  Writing docs
and answering questions about the software in <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a> are other ways too,
for example.  If you are interested in neuroscience and in promoting <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open
Science</a>, please consider
joining the SIG. You can get in touch with us via one of our many
<a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora#Communication_and_getting_help">communication channels</a>.</p>
<p>This invitation extends to all--undergraduates, post-graduates, trainee
researchers (PhD candidates like me), professional researchers, hobbyists, and
everyone else.  If you work in the field already, it is a great way of
supporting the research community. For others, it is a great place to
learn about neuroscience, and  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/user-liberation-watch-and-share-our-new-video">Free Software</a>
and the various technical skills that go into developing software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-status">
<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>We track the software we are working on <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora/PackageSet">here</a>. A lot of
software is now ready to use in Fedora. This includes various Python libraries
and simulators such as <a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.org">Nest</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose">Moose</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">Neuron</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://briansimulator.org/">Brian</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN">PyNN</a> are all in
the pipeline. All of <a class="reference external" href="http://tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> is also available in
<a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a>. If there is other Free/Open source software that you use which isn't
on our list, please let us know.  If you can help maintain it with us, that'll
be even better.</p>

<div class="section" id="fedora-free-software-and-science">
<h2>Fedora/Free software and Science</h2>
<p>Open science shares the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">philosophy of FOSS</a>. The data, the tools, the results, should
be accessible to all to understand, use, learn from, and develop. More and more
researchers are making it a point to keep Science as open as possible whether
it is to do with the <a class="reference external" href="http://opensourceforneuroscience.org/">tools</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">dissemination</a> of their

The chief scientific officer of a cannabis product company whose stock price has been hotter than a flaming joint (sorry) was known more than 18 months ago to have committed research misconduct while at the U.S. National Institutes of Health — casting a cloud of suspicion over the firm’s operations. Marketwatch reported yesterday that the … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/10/05/chief-scientific-officer-of-a-high-flying-cannabis-product-company-faked-data-at-the-nih/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Chief scientific officer of a high-flying cannabis product company faked data at the NIH</span></a>

<p style="font-size: 15px;">
                              The study of the brain is probably the most important research topic of our times. An evidence of this claim is the concomitant worldwide creation of brain initiatives, including the BRAIN Initiative (USA, 2013), Human Brain Project (Europe, 2013), Brain/MINDS (Japan, 2014) and China Brain (China, 2016). FAPESP’s decision in 2013 to create the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics (RIDC NeuroMat) spearheaded this direction of study.

<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10564" style="width: 262px;"><img alt="Image women's health" class="wp-image-10564" height="168" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/womans-health-300x200.jpg" width="252" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Women who are subjected to domestic violence and abuse (DVA) are at a higher risk of unintended pregnancies and abortions, especially those women submitted to reproductive coercion by their male partners. The WHO and NICE guidelines for professional health care providers recommend that women who present clinical associations of DVA are asked about safety in their relationship and at home. This systematic review by Lewis <em>et al. </em>published in <em>BMC Women’s Health</em> evaluates the association between exposure to DVA and emergency conception.</p>
<p>The systematic review includes 6 studies that involved 15,297 women in total. Four of these studies provided evidence of an association between use of emergency contraception and DVA. Especially younger women from high- and middle- income countries exposed to DVA are more likely to use emergency contraception compared to other women.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that a request for emergency contraception can be an indicator of DVA. They recommend that each emergency contraception consultation should be used to inquire about safety in relationships and at home, and that primary providers of emergency contraception should provide a display of information on DVA and local DVA services.</p>

<p>RNA-sequencing is a popular technology for genome-wide transcriptional profiling. However, RNA-sequencing data is typically deposited in text and/or table-based files that are difficult to analyse and visualize for researchers who lack extensive computational expertise. The <a href="https://expression.latrobe.edu.au/agriseqdb">ArgiSeqDB tool</a> developed by Robinson<em> et al.,</em> presents user-friendly public portal that allows access, analysis, and visualization of tissue- and cell-specific transcriptome data-sets from multiple agricultural crops.</p>
<p>In <em>BMC Plant Biology</em> AgriSeqDB is described as an important data-reuse tool for plant biologists, as it allows the user to visualize and compare transcript expression across different samples. The database currently contains RNA-sequencing results from different tissues and cell-types, and future developments will include transcriptome data from single-cell RNA-Seq. All source code is freely available for reuse by advanced users.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10558" style="width: 168px;"><img alt="Image of cell biology" class="wp-image-10558" height="237" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/biotechnology-200x300.jpg" width="158" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Clinical studies have demonstrated that regenerative therapy of weakened heart muscle using skeletal myoblast sheets can be an effective therapy for people suffering from ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, the application of this therapy has been limited due to the requirement of in-hospital cell processing centers and the time-consuming process of preparing cell constructs. In a study published by <em>BMC Biotechnology</em>, Ohkawara <em>et al</em>., describe the development of a method that allows preservation of the myoblast cell sheets, to allow wide application and industrialization of the implementation therapy.</p>
<p>The researchers have found that vitrification, a process in which cells are exposed to a high concentration of cryoprotectant followed by extremely fast cooling in liquid nitrogen, is an effective method for the preservation of the myoblast cell sheets for up to 3 months. Although the cell viability was lower in the vitrification group compared to the fresh group, the improvement in cardiac function and angiogenesis was highly similar in both groups, suggesting that cell sheets maintain angiogenic function after vitrification.</p>

<p>Brain stimulation techniques have contributed to our current understanding of neural and neurological function, and they have offered non-pharmacological options for the treatment of neurological disorders and neuropsychiatry. One of these brain stimulation techniques, trans-cranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), is a non-invasive technique for the focal delivery of mechanical pressure waves. These pressure waves can reach deep brain areas as well as cortical areas with high spatial selectivity.</p>
<p>In a paper recently published in <em>BMC Neuroscience</em>, Lee <em>et al</em>., describe a tool that allows tFUS to be applied to un-anesthetized, freely moving small animals, using wearable tFUS headgear. The ability to apply tFUS to un-anesthetized animals provides opportunities for investigations into neurological activities that cannot be investigated in anesthetized animals, such as socio-behavioral activities and epilepsy.</p>

<p>When counting separate dialects, more than 7000 languages exist worldwide. Although factors that contribute to the spatial segregation of the speaker populations have been suggested, the relative contribution of each factor to language diversion has not been quantified. In a study recently published by <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em>, Honkola<em> et al</em>., describe the early stages of dialect divergence, with a special focus on ecological settings.</p>
<p>Although geographical distances separating speaker populations contribute to the divergence of dialects, the current study indicates that mere differences in environmental conditions and related   adaptive processes have a larger role in divergence of dialect groups than geographical distance even within area of modest environmental variation.</p>

<p>Community health worker (CHW) programs play an important role in the HIV service delivery in middle- and low-income countries. However, poor remuneration, lack of career opportunities and concerns of exploitation of CHWs are a growing concern. In addition, little attention has been devoted to the effects of the withdrawal or exits of CHWs from clients and families following the end of a fixed-term intervention, or the end of a research study. In a study recently published in <em>BMC Health Services Research</em>, Busza<em> et al</em>., examine the experiences of CHWs following withdrawal from clients and families.</p>
<p>The study shows that CHW can develop close personal relationships with the households they visit. Following the withdrawal of a household, some CHW chose to continue the relationships with the families in their own time, and at their own expense. These CHWs sustain the emotional labor but now lack the support previously provided by the research programs they were involved with. The authors point out that CHWs build trust with community members, and make interventions more acceptable by the local community. They stress that regular exits or withdrawals from families with whom they have established close bonds may lead to demoralization, may affect the feasibility of long-term programs.</p>

<p>Metabolic research has been accelerated by advances in mass spectrometry techniques. Although there are data repositories for a wide variety of metabolic databases, currently no data repositories are available for exometabolomic studies. A recent paper published in BMC Microbiology describes the <a href="http://webofmicrobes.org">Web of Microbes</a> (WoM) database, developed by Kosina <em>et al.</em> This web-based data visualization tool and data repository for mass spectrometry based exometabolomics studies enables the linking of microbes, metabolites and environments.</p>
<p>The web interface displays information from a three-dimensional data-set, where exometabolomic observations are defined by unique combinations of metabolite, environment, and organism data. WoM is hosted at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), which should allow the tool to growth both in volume and features. The application uses JavaScript and runs on all modern web browsers.</p>

<p>A lot of us use what we consider normal behaviour – based on how we think most other people like us behave – to guide our own judgments and decisions. When these perceptions are wide of the mark (known as “pluralistic ignorance”), this can affect our behaviour in detrimental ways. The most famous example concerns students’ widespread overestimation of how much their peers drink alcohol, which influences them to drink more themselves.</p>
<p>Now a team led by Steven Buzinksi at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has investigated whether students’ pluralistic ignorance about how much time their peers spend studying for exams could be having a harmful influence on how much time they devote to study themselves. Reporting their findings <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0098628318796919">in <em>Teaching in Psychology</em></a>, the team did indeed find evidence of pluralistic ignorance about study behaviour, but it seemed to have some effects directly opposite to what they expected.</p>
<p><span id="more-34833"></span></p>
<p>Across four studies with hundreds of social psych undergrads, the researchers found that, overall, students tended to underestimate how much time their peers spent studying for an upcoming exam (but there was a spread of perceptions, with some students overestimating the average). Moreover, students’ perceptions of the social norm for studying were correlated with their own study time, suggesting – though not proving – that their decisions about how much to study were influenced by what they felt was normal.</p>
<p>However, when Buzinksi and his colleagues looked to see whether the students’ misconceptions about their peers’ study time were associated with their subsequent exam performance, they found the opposite pattern to what they expected.</p>
<p>The researchers had thought that underestimating typical study time would be associated with choosing to study less, and in turn that this would be associated with poorer exam performance. Instead, they found that it was those students who <em>overestimated</em> their peers’ study time who performed <em>worse</em> in the subsequent exam, and this seemed to be fully explained by their feeling unprepared for the exam (the researchers speculated that such feelings could increase anxiety and self-doubt, thus harming exam performance).</p>
<p>In a final study, one week before an exam, the researchers corrected students’ misconceptions about the average exam study time and this had the hoped-for effect of correcting pluralistic ignorance about normal study behaviour; it also removed any links between beliefs about typical study time and feelings of unpreparedness.</p>
<p>Most promisingly, average exam performance was superior after this intervention, as compared with performance in a similar exam earlier in the semester, suggesting that correcting misconceptions about others’ study behaviour is beneficial (perhaps learning the truth about how much their peers studied gave the students a chance to adjust their own study behaviour, and this may have boosted the confidence of those who would otherwise have overestimated average study time. However this wasn’t tested in the study so remains speculative).</p>
<p>Of course another explanation for the improved performance could just have been due to practice effects through the semester, but it’s notable that such an improvement in the late-semester exam was not observed in earlier years when the study-time-beliefs intervention was not applied.</p>
<p>Future research will be needed to confirm the robustness of these findings, including in more diverse student groups, and to test the casual role of beliefs about study time and feelings of preparedness, for example by directly observing how correcting misconceptions affects students’ study behaviour and their confidence.</p>
<p>For now, Buzinksi and his colleagues recommend it could be beneficial to use class discussions “…to correct potentially detrimental misperceptions”. They added: “Unless we as educators actively intervene, our students will approach their coursework from an understanding based upon flawed perceptions of the classroom norm, and those most at risk may suffer the most from their shared ignorance.”</p>

In the United States, falls are the leading cause of injury—both fatal and non-fatal—in older adults. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html">Centers for Disease Control</a> estimates that over one quarter of adults over 65 fall each year and around one-fifth of falls leads to serious injuries like head injuries, hip fractures, and broken bones.</p>
<p>While increased age is a key risk factor for falls, other factors contribute as well, including chronic disease, vision loss, and sarcopenia (muscle loss). Falls Prevention Awareness Week occurs each year not only to educate people at risk of falling to reduce their risk, but also to remind the general society that falls can be avoided during aging.</p>

In a <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0779-2">study</a> published in April, Nan-Ping Yang and colleagues at National Yang-Ming University measured the hand grip strength and leg muscle mass of 1,067 older adults and surveyed their exercise habits.</p>
<p>Fifteen and one percent of the participants surveyed experienced a fall within the previous year. They had lower average grip strength and exercised less than those who had not fallen. Interestingly, a significant difference in leg muscle mass between the fall group and the non-fall group was not observed, a result in contrast to previous studies associating sarcopenia with increased fall risk.</p>
<blockquote><p>…men with greater comorbidity, higher levels of pain, and poor balance were at higher risk for falls, while incontinence, more depressive symptoms, and never having married were associated with higher risk for women.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0806-3">study</a> looking at fall risk factors, Catharine R. Gale and colleagues at the University of Southampton identified how risk factors differ between men and women. They used data from 3,298 participants (1,515 men and 1,783 women) enrolled in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, which assessed participants’ physical function every 4 years. Seventeen physical and cognitive risk factors predicted falls, but the only risk factor associated with falls in both men and women was older age.</p>
<p>Upon sex-specific analysis men with greater comorbidity, higher levels of pain, and poor balance were at higher risk for falls, while incontinence, more depressive symptoms, and never having married were associated with higher risk for women. Interestingly, women were more likely than men to report feeling higher levels of pain, but pain was only linked to increased falls risk in men. This finding may be because women with pain are more likely to use mobility aids than men.</p>
<p>These studies identifying specific falls risk factors are important for devising effective evidence-based falls prevention programs. It’s also important to understand how well these programs are implemented. A <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0725-3">study</a> published earlier this year explored the types of barriers encountered by community service providers when implementing falls prevention programs.</p>
<p>Catherine S. Dykeman and colleagues conducted interviews and focus groups within three <a href="http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/">Public Health Units</a> in Ontario, Canada, speaking with community members who have regular contact with older adults such as health care providers, recreation/fitness leaders, and social services.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well, you know, this person’s old. Of course they’re going to fall.”</p></blockquote>
<p>One type of barrier identified were “Restrictive Organizational Mandates &amp; Policies”, which were related to policies regarding funding and schedules of available services. At one site, transportation funding was restricted for people interested in attending strength and balance training sessions.</p>
<p>Researchers asked participants to discuss strategies to overcome the barriers they faced. The overarching theme of these strategies was collaboration between community stakeholders. They felt that inter-agency partnerships would facilitate the exchange of information about falls prevention activities, hopefully leading to improved promotion and accessibility.</p>
<p>Another major type of barrier the authors found were the “Beliefs about aging and falls” held by some participants. Some viewed falls as inevitable. One participant stated “when they’re frail and elderly, it’s kind of late…” and another said, “Well, you know, this person’s old. Of course they’re going to fall.”</p>
<p>Falls Prevention Awareness Week exists in part to combat this attitude and to change how we think of falls by highlighting <a href="https://www.acl.gov/news-and-events/acl-blog/taking-steps-prevent-falls-we-age">effective</a> <a href="https://www.ncoa.org/healthy-aging/falls-prevention/">ways</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/CDCInjury/status/1044659017300287488">lowering the risk </a>of falls for older adults. Although falls are common, further research on falls, their risk factors, and strategies for prevention will help to create and improve prevention programs to reduce the number of falls that occur each year.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/recovery-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Our research team wanted to find which factors influence early withdrawal from a drug and alcohol treatment program. The question arose partially from <a href="https://substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13011-018-0170-5">another recent study</a> we conducted that was published in <a href="https://substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com/">Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy</a>. This study found that residents that were satisfied with their relationships, when entering a rehabilitation program, were less likely to complete the program.</p>
<p><img alt="Nappy" class="size-medium wp-image-10544 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Interview-300x200.jpeg" width="300" />We presumed this reflected distress in response to separation from loved ones but felt that qualitative research was warranted to understand this better. We interviewed ex-residents from a long-term therapeutic community program at a community-based rehab organisation in regional Australia. In addition, we attempted to elucidate what successful recovery actually means to ex-residents and how employment influences early withdrawal and successful recovery.</p>
<p>Perceived successful recovery extends far beyond obtaining and remaining abstinent. Ex-residents believed that reduced substance use and continued treatment had a positive influence on recovery. Understanding that recovery is a journey is important when measuring success.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important for society, and not just those suffering from addiction, to recognize that shorter lapse periods and early trigger recognition are signs of success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ex-residents said that the residential rehab program helped them to be more aware of the early signs of addiction and halt the progression of the lapse before losing total control. Overall, ex-residents experienced shorter lapses and relapses by utilizing the skills they learned at the residential rehab program. It is important for society, and not just those suffering from addiction, to recognize that shorter lapse periods and early trigger recognition are signs of success.</p>
<h3><strong>Influence of Employment</strong></h3>
<p>Our study showed that employment influenced peoples’ drug addiction before, during and after their rehabilitation stay.</p>
<p>Prior to entering the program, many residents had difficulties finding or maintaining a job. For others, their work led them to using drugs for a variety of reasons including feeling lonely when working in remote areas, working in a high paced environment such as pubs and clubs, or having high-paying jobs thereby making substances affordable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I was extremely good at what I did and when I lost that trade, I lost myself pretty much. I put so much emphasis on my job. Once I lost it that was it.”</em></p>
<p>Some people left the program early because they felt they had to get back to work and were ready to leave. Our study found that being able to work, study or volunteer was a very important factor for a successful recovery as it increased self-worth and instilled feelings that ex-residents were contributing to society in a positive way. Similar results were found in a<a href="https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/TC-06-2014-0022"> study from the UK  </a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I really feel they’ve got a better employee back do you know what I mean? They may have lost me for 6 months but they’ve actually got a better employee.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Influence of Relationships</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>“…the ability to be able to listen and be honest with myself … and be able to share other people’s stories and listen to them to be a support.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Like employment, relationships were strong factors for both successful recovery and early departure from the program. For example, some could not cope with the intensity of the program while others missed their family and friends.  Improved relationships with family, friends, co-workers and society in general were indicators of successful recovery. Relationship successes after leaving the program enabled ex-residents to form close relationships with new people, rebuild existing ones and help others in their recovery journey.</p>
<p>Success could also be measured when ex-residents were leading much healthier lives leading to improved psychological and physical wellbeing. Many would continue to practice skills such as yoga, meditation and physical exercise, which they learned during the program.</p>
<img alt="Slack" class="size-medium wp-image-10546 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/People-talking-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>From a policy and treatment point of view this study shows the value of supporting residents to not only focus on abstinence but also identify how they can actively contribute to the community by studying, volunteering or finding employment.</p>
<p>Some people have returned to volunteer at rehabilitation programs, which can be a powerful message to those in the program that they can be successful in their recovery too. It is important that residents receive support and a safe environment to achieve a success recovery.</p>

<p>If you wanted to ensure your mind was in top gear, which do you think would provide the better preparation – 15 minutes of calm relaxation, or a 15 minute jog?</p>
<p>A study involving 101 undergrad students suggests you’d be better off plumping for the latter.</p>
<p>Evidence had <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899312004003">already</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262612001224">accumulated</a> showing that relatively brief, moderate aerobic exercise – like going for a brisk walk or a jog – has immediate benefits for mental functioning, especially speed and attentional control. A parallel literature has also documented how brief, aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on your mood, including making you feel more energetic, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/21/walking-lifts-your-mood-even-when-you-dont-expect-it-to/">even when you don’t expect it to</a>. In their new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691817301336?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">paper</a> in <em>Acta Psychologica</em>, Fabian Legrand and his colleagues bridged these findings by looking to see if the emotional effects of exercise might be at least partly responsible for the cognitive benefits.</p>
<p>They asked their participants to rate how energetic and vigorous they were feeling and then to complete two cognitive tests (versions of the Trail Making Test, which involves drawing lines between numbers and letters as fast and as accurately as possible).</p>
<p>Next, they allocated half their student participants to go for a 15 minute group jog around the campus and the others to spend the same time following group relaxation exercises. Finally, two minutes after the jog/relaxation session, the students answered the same questions as before about their feelings of energy, and then they repeated the cognitive tests.</p>
<p>The students who went for a jog, but not the relaxation students, subsequently showed significant improvement on the version of the Trail Making Test that measures mental speed and attentional control (but not the other that taps memory and cognitive switching). Moreover, this improvement in cognition was fully mediated by their increased feelings of energy and vigour, implying – although not proving conclusively – that the jog boosted cognition through its effects on their subjective sense of having more energy (in contrast, the relaxation group actually felt dramatically less energetic).</p>
<p>Among the study limitations was the fact the relaxation session took place inside, while the jog was outside. Notwithstanding this issue and some others, and while recognising the need for more research, Legrand and his team said that their findings “add weight to recent suggestions that increased feelings of energy may mediate the relationship between aerobic exercise and some aspects of cognitive functioning.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/preprint-moon-landing_4-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Note: This post was written in collaboration with the PREreview team (Monica Granados, Samantha Hindle, Daniela Saderi)</em></p>
<p>We are teaming up with <u><a href="http://www.prereview.org">PREreview</a></u> during <u><a href="http://openaccessweek.org/">Open Access week</a></u> to bring together scientists from around the world to discuss and review an actual preprint…live-streamed!</p>
<p>PREreview helps scientists receive acknowledgement for their time spent reviewing others’ work. We are proud to collaborate with them to shine a spotlight on our shared goals: to encourage more scientists to post feedback on preprints, and to provide credit for their contributions to peer review. PREreview’s aim is to promote the discussion of preprints at journal clubs by providing resources and a platform where these discussions can be shared, and to ensure reviews are citable by assigning a digital object identifier (DOI) for each preprint review.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Open Access week, together we decided to leverage today’s technology to make these journal clubs more accessible to a diverse group of scientists by running them entirely online!</p>
<p>Want to participate? Read on for more details.</p>
<p><strong>What is a preprint and how can it enhance your research?</strong></p>
<p>Preprints are open access scientific manuscripts that have not yet been through editorial peer review. Because they are shared freely online while undergoing more formal peer review in a journal, they accelerate the communication of knowledge, thereby increasing the impact and reach of scientific discovery. Backed by many <a href="http://asapbio.org/funder-policies"><u>funders</u></a>, <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/journal-policies">journals</a></u>, and <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/university-policies">institutions</a></u>, preprints have become a legitimate part of research dissemination. To learn more about how preprints can help you and your science move forward, visit <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><u>PLOS’ preprint resource page</u> </a>and <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq#qe-faq-637">ASAPbio.org</a></u>.</p>
<p>One of the many advantages of preprinting is the potential for authors to receive immediate feedback from the rest of the scientific community and improve their article before formal publication in a journal. In a sense, it’s similar to the feedback one might receive after a talk or a poster presentation at a scientific meeting, except that it makes the process easier and more inclusive because anyone with internet connection around the world could comment on your work.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan – Join us and become part of the discussion!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT</strong></p>
<p>We will facilitate three interactive preprint journal club events that will be live-streamed via videoconference in which anyone can participate remotely. The focus will be on neuroscience, bioinformatics and ecology. Each online journal club will be hosted by two facilitators with experience in mediating video calls, as well as subject matter experts. They will guide participants through a constructive discussion of the preprint and collate feedback into a review report. These PREreviews will receive a DOI and will be shared online with the community as citable and discoverable objects. For more information about the format of PREreview online preprint journal clubs, check out <u><a href="https://www.prereview.org/users/153686/articles/325778-open-access-week-preprint-journal-club-information">PREreview’s information doc</a></u> or email contact@prereview.org.</p>
<p><strong>WHO</strong></p>
<p>You! We encourage all interested researchers to be part of the discussion and offer their expertise. Of course, anyone who wants to see the power of preprints in action is also welcome. All you need is an internet connection or phone-in capabilities to join.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>Your ability to accurately understand your own thoughts and behaviour in a given moment can have rather profound consequences. If you don’t realise you’re growing loud and domineering during a heated company meeting, that could affect your standing at work. If you react in an oversensitive manner to a fair and measured criticism levelled at you by your romantic partner, it could spark a fight.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder, then, that psychology researchers are interested in the question of how well people understand how they are acting and feeling in a given moment, a concept known as <i>state self-knowledge </i>(not to be confused with its better-studied cousin <i>trait self-knowledge</i>, or individuals’ ability to accurately gauge their own personality characteristics that are relatively stable over time).</p>
<p>In a new study <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/sg5aw/">available as a preprint on PsyArXiv</a>, Jessie Sun and Simine Vazire of the University of California, Davis adopted a novel, data-heavy approach to gauging individuals’ levels of personality state self-knowledge (i.e. their personality as it manifested in the moment), and it revealed some interesting findings about the ways in which people are – and aren’t – able to accurately understand their own fleeting psychological states.</p>
<p><span id="more-34856"></span></p>
<p>The study, provisionally titled “Do People Know What They’re Like in the Moment?” had two main components. First, 434 Washington University of St. Louis students were texted four times a day for 15 days and asked to rate themselves on four of the Big Five personality characteristics based on how they had felt and behaved during the previous hour: Extraversion, Agreeableness (only “if they reported that they were around others during the target hour”), Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism. Of these 434 participants, 311 also wore a recording device paired with an iPod touch that recorded for 30 seconds every nine and a half minutes from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day, generating a huge amount of audio data. (Before researchers had full access to the recordings, students were allowed to listen to them and erase anything they didn’t want the researchers to hear, but only 99 files were deleted from a cache that became “152,592 usable recordings from 304 participants.”)</p>
<p>Second, a veritable small army of research assistants – more than a hundred – listened to the recordings and rated the speakers on the same four personality states they had previously rated themselves on. For a subset of the study participants, then, researchers had three useful pieces of information: recordings of them going about their lives, participants’ rating of their own personality states during those periods, and outside observers’ rating of those same states. This allowed the researchers to measure the extent to which self-ratings correlated with other-ratings – that is, did Tom’s view that he was quite extroverted during a given hour match up with how others who heard him on audio interpreted his behaviour during snippets of that period?</p>
<p>And measure they did, generating a pretty cool series of graphs (see above). The more acute the positive, upward slope, the more there was agreement between self- and other-ratings. So as you can see, Extraversion was, by a significant margin, the personality characteristic for which people seemed to have the most accurate self-knowledge. This shouldn’t necessarily be a surprise. For one thing, while intuition isn’t always an accurate guide on such matters, common sense would suggest that people are well aware of the extent to which they are actively and enthusiastically engaging in social activity, and that we’re all pretty good at judging <i>others’ </i>level of extraversion as well. Second, the authors note that this finding is “consistent with a large body of literature demonstrating high self-observer agreement on trait extraversion across a wide range of conditions.” The state with second-highest subject-observer agreement, as the graph shows, was Conscientiousness (again, perhaps because in-the-moment conscientious behaviour is pretty easy for both the self and others to discern).</p>
<p>What about the two other personality states, where there was significantly less subject-observer agreement? The tricky part about interpreting these findings, as the authors point out, is that there are two possible explanations: the first is that the subject really does lack insight into their temporary psychological states and that the external observers’ observations accurately captured this; and the second is that the <i>observer </i>was wrong because they only had access to a limited slice of audio that simply might not be enough to accurately gauge the subject’s state at that moment (remember, the raters had no visual information to go on – no body language, facial expressions, or anything else).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So when it comes to Agreeableness and that rather flat line – meaning little agreement between subjects and observers – the authors argue that “it is plausible that people have less self-insight into their momentary agreeableness,” because Agreeableness has so much more to do with external, observable behaviours, and with other people’s perceptions of your warmth, than with internal “thoughts and feelings” (meaning that other people might naturally be better judges of this personality state). Neuroticism, on the other hand, is different – it’s a state much more characterised by internal feelings than by outward behaviour. So in that case, Sun and Vazire argue that their findings alone shouldn’t be seen as supporting the idea that people are bad at self-rating their present level of Neuroticism – rather, it’s more likely the audio just didn’t give the observers enough to go on.</p>
<p>As is probably clear, this is a complicated topic, and it seems likely that people are much better at understanding their present personality states in some ways than others. Sun and Vazire’s study was quite ambitious, and it offers a useful path forward for researchers hoping to learn more about an important issue. In the meantime, their general takeaway? “Our findings show that we can probably trust what people say about their momentary levels of extraversion, conscientiousness, and likely neuroticism. However, our findings also call into question people’s awareness of when they are being considerate versus rude.” Useful information – and probably not a surprise to anyone who has dealt with a bullying coworker who doesn’t seem to understand the impression he’s making on his colleagues.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/data2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>As chair of the TERMIS European chapter, what can you tell us about the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society? </strong></p>
<p>With more than 4000 active members worldwide, TERMIS is the most prominent society in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. It values the idea of interdisciplinary collaboration – it is not focused on only biomaterials or cells or surgical procedures, but has a profound translational character. This helps to achieve its main directive: bringing research into clinics so patients can benefit from it.</p>
<p><strong>How are you implementing this translational character in your research projects?</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://trauma.lbg.ac.at/en">LBI Trauma</a>, we are part of a broad spectrum of projects in the field of regenerative medicine. Among the 90 people working at the institute there are chemists, biochemists, physicians, veterinarians, physicists, biomedical and electrical engineers – it allows us to get a full view on any research question and its possible solutions. As central trauma research organization of the Austrian Workers’ Compensation Board <a href="https://www.auva.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.670957&amp;portal=auvaportal&amp;viewmode=content">AUVA</a> there is a close collaboration with the Austrian trauma clinics. Projects are aimed at current clinical needs – we even look for new research questions by open science approaches –  and new findings find their way into the clinics as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What are your current research highlights?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment we have many novel approaches for scaffold materials. Silk for example, is treated with a new method to deplete its immunoreactive sericin layer but leave the exceptional stability of its fibroin core intake. We use it to form conduits to bridge peripheral nerve defects or as anterior crucial ligament replacement, with excellent results. On the cartilage sector we found a way to make decellularized articular cartilage accessible to cells via laser engraving. The institute also has a strong intensive care research section which is a major player in sepsis research worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us about the Springer Reference book series “Tissue Engineering and Regeneration”?</strong></p>

<p>It takes time and effort to write high quality scientific books, and by the time you have them lying on your desk they are practically outdated. This is why I am happy about Springer now offering updateable reference book series that can be accessed online or printed on demand. It fits the fast pace of scientific progress as well as the way we work and look up information in a digital age.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.springer.com/series/13441"><em>Tissue Engineering and Regeneration</em></a> Reference Series is designed to be the premier scientific and updatable information source in the field. The books cover the biological basis of tissue regeneration as well as the current state-of-the-art in tissue engineering of specific tissues and organs. Our advisory board contains the Who’s Who of tissue regeneration research and we are always open for new input and collaborations.</p>
<blockquote><p>I always like to quote ‘Art is I, Science is We’</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What role did TERMIS play in creating the books?</strong></p>
<p>It is important for me to highlight that this is a joint project of TERMIS and Springer. The TERMIS community made this project possible by giving valuable scientific contributions and input. Springer kindly agreed to my proposal of making the books freely accessible for TERMIS members, as I felt like we cannot charge them for accessing what is in fact the work of all of us. I always like to quote “Art is I, Science is We”.</p>

Two sets of events for Women in STEM: the theoretical physicist Alessandro Strumia, soon likely ex-CERN affiliated, decried feminist conspiracies and the discrimination against males like himself, in a workshop talk on gender. Right after, the Nobel Prize for physics was finally after 55 years given to a woman. Thing is: one of the other recipients, Gerard Mourou, made it clear in a 2013 video what the roles of males and females in physics are.

The neuroblogging community was quite small then. Neurofuture started in January 2006 <span class="ILfuVd">—</span> a blog about Brain Science and Neurofuturism that was ahead of its time (so to speak): <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://neurofuture.blogspot.com/2006/01/welcome.html" target="_blank">The future is now</a>, in many ways.

They have applications in a broad range of fields, and I'll be aggregating diverse information. Expect a lot of interesting links. I invite your comments.</blockquote><br />In June 2006, she started a video blog, <a href="http://channeln.blogspot.com/" title="Channel N for Neuro - each post spotlights one educational video webcast">Channel N</a>, that shared interesting content related to neuroscience, psychology, and mental health. <a href="https://blogs.psychcentral.com/channeln" title="Psych Central version">Channel N</a> eventually moved to <a href="https://psychcentral.com/">Psych Central</a>, a trusted mega-site for mental health, depression, bipolar, ADHD &amp; psychology information. Sandra also wrote posts for <a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/author/sandra/">World of Psychology</a>, the main PsychCentral blog, including many <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22top+10%22+sandra+site%3Apsychcentral.com%2Fblog%2F&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Top 10 lists</a>, which were always popular. <br /><br />Along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061216132144/scienceblogs.com/omnibrain">Steve Higgins</a>, she blogged for <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/omnibrain/tag/sandra_kiume/">Omni Brain</a> (from <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/omnibrain/tag/sandra_kiume/">December 2006 – January 2008</a>), which was “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070125084417/http:/scienceblogs.com:80/omnibrain/about.php">an exploration of the serious, fun, ridiculous</a> / past, present, future of the brain and the science that loves it” – as part of the long-defunct Science Blogs network. <br /><br /><br />But Sandra’s real love was writing fiction (mostly under the pseudonym S. Kay). She wrote an unpublished novel (or two), flash fiction, and a novella that was published by <a href="https://maudlinhouse.net/">Maudlin House</a> (ironically titled <i><a href="https://maudlinhouse.net/product/joy/">Joy</a></i>). <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ_VmwwpT0M/W7GrW_F9WoI/AAAAAAAAMoQ/7Sni9vXwZi8Oxzvu6WfgPjIwA04nguc8gCLcBGAs/s1600/Joy%2Bcover.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="681" data-original-width="453" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ_VmwwpT0M/W7GrW_F9WoI/AAAAAAAAMoQ/7Sni9vXwZi8Oxzvu6WfgPjIwA04nguc8gCLcBGAs/s320/Joy%2Bcover.png" width="212" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />The advent of Twitter really changed her writing. She started writing microfiction, ultra-short stories in the form of Tweets (140 characters or less). Sometime they were standalone zaps that told an entire tiny tale.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Epic trance and video mashups, with beer.

<p> The concept of “finding your happy place” just got a big boost thanks to a Max Planck Florida neuroscientist and the NIH Common Fund. Dr. Hyungbae Kwon, Scientific Group Leader at The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience has been awarded a 2018 NIH Director’s Pioneer Award for developing a new light-based technique that allows scientists to visualize and map out how emotions affect neurons. While much focus has been placed on studying neuronal connections within the brain, questions about internal brain state remain unanswered. Neurons convey information like pain or hunger, but how we respond to that information is a function of neuromodulators – a separate entity from neurotransmitters, but a critical part when it comes to facilitating fast information transfer in neuronal network. Dr. Kwon’s lab has created a new light-inducible system, named iTango2, that allows gene expression by both light and neurotransmitters. When applied together, neurons that are activated by neuromodulators can only be labeled when light is illuminated, making it easier for scientists to target neurons that are relevant to selective behaviors. Furthermore, the technology’s ability to activate neurons makes it theoretically possible to control feelings like happiness by shining special lighting on select portions of the brain. This research will add higher degree of understanding in brain functions whose abnormalities are implicated with various types of brain disorders such as ADHD, depression, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Kwon is one of just ten scientists to receive the Pioneer Award in 2018. He will receive $6.8 million over five years for his project entitled ‘Cracking the Neuromodulation Code at Single Cell Resolution.’ The grant is the largest in the eight-year history of Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, and marks the second time a MPFI researcher has been awarded a Pioneer Award.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am honored to receive this recognition and support for this exciting research. For the past decades, remarkable efforts have been made to understand biophysical properties of neurons and wiring diagram of neural circuits in the brain. However, very little is known how internal brain state is regulated and how it affects our sensation, perception and cognition. With this Pioneer Award, I can now begin to dissect fine scale neuromodulation actions in a quantitative manner.” said Dr. Kwon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NIH Director’s Awards are prestigious awards that are given to exceptionally creative scientists proposing high-risk, high-impact research at all career stages. The awards were created to support unconventional approaches to major challenges in biomedical and behavioral research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hyungbae Kwon has been a Research Group Leader for MPFI since July 2012 and heads the research group of Cellular Basis of Neural Circuit Plasticity. Since joining MPFI, Kwon has produced 11 publications, including papers in Science, PNAS, Nature Methods, and Nature Biotechnology in which he is senior author. He has been invited to present his science at numerous international meetings and institutions, and he has established productive collaborations with a number of excellent laboratories, attesting to the high level of interest and respect for his accomplishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Kwon received his Ph.D. in Dr. Pablo Castillo’s lab at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and postdoctoral training with Dr. Bernardo Sabatini at Harvard Medical School. During his postdoctoral period, he used cutting-edge laser-based optics to understand mechanisms of excitatory synapse formation at single synapse resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2012, he began his independent laboratory at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, where he continued to study mechanisms of synapse formation during early brain development and created novel optogenetic approaches that enable to dissect animal sensation, cognition, behaviors at higher precision. Using these newly developed techniques together with other approaches, current research in the Kwon laboratory focuses on understanding principles underlying various forms of cognitive brain actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hyungbae Kwon is an outstanding young investigator whose creativity and productivity leave little doubt that he is at the start of a highly successful independent research career. He is highly deserving of this award and I am extremely proud of his achievements,” said Dr. David Fitzpatrick, MPFI’s CEO and Scientific Director.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Have young people never had it so good, or do they face more challenges than any generation? Our current era in the West is one of high wealth and relatively free of deprivation, meaning minors enjoy material benefits and legal protections that would be the envy of those living in the past. But there is an increasing suspicion that all is not well for our youth, and one of the most popular explanations, among some experts and the popular media, is that excessive “screen time” is to blame (all the attention young people devote to their phones, tablets and laptops). However, this is a contentious theory and such claims have been <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/march-2018/seeing-screen-time-differently">treated sceptically</a> by some scholars based on their reading of the relevant data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-02758-001">study</a> in the journal <i>Emotion</i> has provided another contribution to the debate, uncovering strong evidence that adolescent wellbeing in the USA really is experiencing a decline, and arguing that the most likely culprit is the electronic riches we have given them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34854"></span></p>
<p>The background to this is that from the 1960s into the early 2000s, measures of average wellbeing went up in the US, and this was especially true for younger people. This reflected the fact that these decades saw a climb in general standards of living and avoidance of mass societal traumas like full-scale war or economic deprivation. However, the “screen time” hypothesis, advanced by researchers such as San Diego State University’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">Jean Twenge</a>, is that electronic devices and excessive time spent online may have reversed these trends in recent years, causing problems for young people’s psychological health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To investigate, Twenge and her colleagues Gabrielle Martin and Keith Campbell dived into the “<a href="http://www.monitoringthefuture.org">Monitoring The Future</a>” dataset based on annual surveys of American school students from grades 8 (age 13-14), 10, and 12 that started in 1991. In total, 1.1 million young people answered various questions related to their wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Twenge’s team’s analysis of the answers confirmed the earlier, well-established wellbeing climb, with scores rising across the nineties, and into the later 2000s. This was found across measures like self-esteem, life satisfaction, happiness and satisfaction with individual domains like job, neighbourhood, or friends. But around 2012 these measures started to decline, year on year, up to 2016, the most recent year available. The average effects size of -.14 is typically considered small, but it’s quite something for this to happen over just four years; this is twice as large as the rate of change normally observed between birth cohorts.</p>
<p>Twenge and her colleagues wanted to understand why this change in average wellbeing has occurred, but it’s very hard to demonstrate causes in non-experimental data such as this. In fact, when Twenge previously used the Monitoring the Future data to suggest a screen time effect, sceptical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/nov/14/when-it-comes-to-claims-about-screen-time-we-need-more-sense-and-less-hype">commentators</a> were quick to raise this problem: they argued that her causal-sounding claims rested on correlational data, and that she had not adequately accounted for other potential causal factors (Twenge’s critics also describe her repeated analysis of the same data as a “<a href="https://twitter.com/ShuhBillSkee/status/1047069145731350530">salami slicing</a>” strategy). This time around, Twenge and her team make a point of saying that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that they are not trying to establish causes as such, but that they are assessing the plausibility of potential causes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>First, they explain that if a given variable is playing a causal role in affecting wellbeing, then we should expect any change in that variable to correlate with the observed changes in wellbeing – if not, it isn’t plausible that the variable is a causal factor. So the researchers looked at time spent in a number of activities that could plausibly be driving the wellbeing decline. Less sport, and fewer meetings with peers correlated with lower wellbeing, as did less time reading print media (newspapers) and, surprisingly, less time doing homework (this last finding would appear to scotch another popular hypothesis that it is our harrying of students with assignments that is causing all the problems). Additionally, more TV watching and more electronic communication both correlated with lower wellbeing. All these effects held true for measures of happiness, life satisfaction and self-esteem, with the effects stronger in the 8<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>-graders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, Twenge’s team dug a little deeper into the data on screen-time. They found that adolescents who spent a very small amount of time on digital devices – a couple of hours – had the highest wellbeing, even more than those who never used them. However, higher doses of screen-time were clearly associated with lower happiness – those spending 10-19 hours per week on their devices were 41 per cent more likely to be unhappy than lower-frequency users, and those who used them 40 hours a week or more (one in ten of teenagers) were twice as likely to be unhappy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data was slightly complicated by the fact that there was a tendency for kids who were social in the real world to also use more online communication, but by bracketing out different cases it became clear that the real-world sociality component correlated with greater wellbeing, whereas greater time on screens or online only correlated with poorer wellbeing.</p>
<p>So far, so plausible. But the next question is, are the drops in average wellbeing happening in tandem with trends toward increased electronic device usage? Superficially, it looks like it – after all, 2012 was the tipping point when more than half of Americans began owning smartphones. Twenge and her colleagues dug deeper and also found that across the key years of 2013-16, wellbeing was indeed lowest in years where adolescents spent more time online, on social media, and reading news online, and when more youth in the US had smartphones. And in a second analysis, they found that where technology went, dips in wellbeing followed: for instance, years with a larger increase in online usage were followed by years with lower wellbeing, rather than vice versa. This doesn’t prove causality, but is consistent with it. Meanwhile, TV use didn’t show this tracking – TV might make you less happy, but this isn’t what seems to be driving the recent declines in young people’s average happiness.</p>
<p>A similar but reversed pattern was found for the activities positively associated with wellbeing – for example, years where people spent more time with friends were better years for wellbeing (and followed by better years). Sadly, the data also showed face-to-face socialising and sports activity had declined over the period covered by the survey.</p>
<p>There is another explanation waiting in the wings that Twenge and her colleagues wanted to address: the impact of the great recession of 2007-2009, which hit a great number of American families and could potentially be affecting adolescents through instability for the family. The dataset didn’t include economic data, so instead the researchers looked at whether the 2013-16 wellbeing slump was tracking economic indicators. They found some evidence that some crude measures, like income inequality, correlated with changes in wellbeing, but economic measures with a more direct impact, like median family income and unemployment rates (which put families into difficulties), had no relationship with wellbeing. The researchers also note that the recession hit some years before we see the beginning of the wellbeing drop, and before the steepest wellbeing decline, which occurred in 2013.</p>
<p>The researchers conclude that “electronic communication was the only adolescent activity negatively correlated with psychological wellbeing that increased at the same time psychological well-being declined.” This isn’t bullet-proof evidence to be sure, and I suspect that sceptical figures in the field will be keen to address alternative explanations – such as unassessed variables playing a role. But the new work does go further than before and suggests that screen time should still be considered a potential impediment to young people’s flourishing.</p>

<h4>No, it’s not a metaphor</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M1rq931Ga7LIoGLyUTQyHQ.jpeg" />One of three silly brain as computer images to come</figure><p>Neuroscience is a funny discipline which can demand a level of interdisciplinary knowledge that is hard to achieve. At its heart, neuroscience is concerned with understanding the organ that is responsible for generating our behaviour, and thus, it is a branch of physiology and psychology. At the same time, most neuroscientists will have heard, or even used, the words “calculate”, “algorithm”, and “computation” many times in their professional lives. I think there’s a good reason for this: <strong>the brain is a computer</strong>, and neuroscience is also branch of computer science, in my opinion. However, many neuroscientists do not see it that way.</p><p>In online discussions I have often read the phrase “<a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/1999/00000006/f0020011/994">The Brain as a Computer Metaphor</a>”. The implication of this phrase is clear: the brain is <strong>not</strong> a computer, and at best, we can use computers as a metaphor to understand the brain. (At worst,<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer"> the “metaphor” does not hold and should be abandoned</a>.) Similarly, I have heard neuroscientists say things like, “<a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/">neural circuits don’t truly run algorithms</a>”. Again, the conclusion is clear: the brain doesn’t run any algorithms in reality, so our constant use of the words “algorithm” and “computer” when talking about the brain is misguided.</p><p>Unfortunately, what these discussions demonstrate is that many researchers do not, as a rule, actually understand the formal definitions of “computer” or “algorithm” as provided by computer science. (Or alternatively, if they do understand them, they don’t accept them for some reason.) If you understand the formal definitions of computer and algorithm as given by computer science, then you know that the brain is very clearly a computer running algorithms, almost trivially so.</p><p>My goal in this article is to provide a brief, intuitive explanation for those formal definitions of “computer” and “algorithm”, one pitched at neuroscientists. My hope is that this will help neuroscientists to move away from these confused, misleading discussions about whether or not a computer (the brain) is actually a computer, because as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/opinion/sunday/face-it-your-brain-is-a-computer.html">others have noted</a>, it most certainly is.</p><p>I want to make clear that my goal here is <em>not</em> to engage with the much larger, more complicated discussions in cognitive science and philosophy of mind as to whether we can <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/">understand mentation using computational frameworks</a>. I consider that to be a separate question regarding the nature of the mind, and there, the discussions get much more complicated. I personally think that computer science has a lot to contribute to neuroscience (indeed, as I said above, I consider neuroscience to be a branch of computer science), and I happen to think computational frameworks can explain mental activity, but that’s not my target here. Here, I seek only to articulate why, if we ignore questions regarding the nature of the mind, then according to first principles and formal definitions, the brain necessarily is a computer, and there really is no discussion to be had once you understand and accept the definitions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6X5Jik3k_Zj7gfkJIHY9yg.jpeg" />A high-school student implementing an algorithm</figure><h4>Defining an <em>algorithm</em></h4><p>Okay, what is an “algorithm” and what is a “computer”? The formal definitions for these words originate in the work of mathematicians in the early half of the 20th century. Back then, many mathematicians were concerned with some questions that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> had put forward in a very famous lecture he delivered in 1900 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">23 Mathematical Problems to be Solved in the Next Century</a>.</p><p>One of those problems, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem">10th problem</a>”, was concerned with determining whether a polynomial (e.g. 6x³yz⁴ + 4y²z + z - 9) had roots made up solely of integers (e.g. x = 5, y = -3, z = 0, etc.). Hilbert wanted mathematicians to develop an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method">effective method</a>, a “recipe”, for deciding whether this was the case for any arbitrary polynomial. Such a recipe is, colloquially, what we call an “algorithm”. <em>That’s the intuitive definition of algorithm</em>: an algorithm is a finite set of instructions that can be followed mechanically, with no insight required, in order to give some specific output (e.g. an answer to yes/no integer roots) for a specific input (e.g. a specific polynomial like 6x³yz⁴ + 4y²z + z — 9). To put this into context, what was desired at this point in history was a way to specify how any human being could sit down at a desk with a paper and pencil and work out the answer to something without having to actually generate any novel insight. So, for example, long division provides an algorithm for calculating the result of dividing one number by another — you can just sit there with a paper and pencil and follow the finite set of instructions like an automaton, and you will arrive at the correct result. Hilbert assumed there must be an algorithm for the particular task of polynomial integral roots, and the job for mathematicians was simply to find it.</p><p>As luck would have it, Hilbert had stumbled onto a very deep problem. Mathematicians took on his challenge, but they had a hard time coming up with a recipe. More and more, various mathematicians began to ask whether some problems in mathematics, including Hilbert’s “10th problem” were, in fact, <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/sampler.pdf">not <em>decidable</em></a>, meaning there was no algorithm for solving them. Of course, mathematicians being mathematicians, they desired proofs that an algorithm didn’t exist for these problems. The issue was that with only an informal, intuitive definition of the word “algorithm”, proving that <strong><em>no</em></strong> algorithm existed for a given problem was basically impossible.</p><p>Given this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> set about to develop a formal definition for algorithms. The two researchers worked independently, and came to different solutions, but their solutions turned out to be mathematically equivalent. Church invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, and defined an algorithm as anything that could be done with lambda calculus. Turing invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>, and defined an algorithm as anything that could be done with Turing machines. I will leave it to the reader to learn more about the specific definitions of <a href="https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf">lambda calculus</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc463h/notes/turing.pdf">Turing machines</a>, but it is important to understand that both are simply a <em>mathematical tool</em>. This is fairly obvious with lambda calculus, but often people get confused about Turing machines because of the word “machine” — confusingly, <em>Turing machines are not machines</em>. Indeed, the definition assumes some very unrealistic components (like an infinite tape). It is important to think of Turing machines as just a mathematical tool. I draw attention to this because I will return to it when we discuss the relationship between Turing machines and brains.</p><p>As mentioned, it turned out that Church and Turing’s definitions were equivalent, meaning that anything which you could do with lambda calculus you could do with a Turing machine. As time has gone on, empirical experience has suggested that any attempt to formalize the intuitive definition of algorithm will settle on something that is equivalent to Turing machines. Therefore, most computer scientists today accept something known as the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/">Church-Turing thesis</a>:</p><blockquote><strong>The Church-Turing thesis:</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Any algorithm can be implemented by a Turing machine.</blockquote><p>It should be recognized that this statement can actually be viewed as either a <em>definition</em>,<em> </em>or a <em>hypothesis</em>. If we view it as a hypothesis, then the Church-Turing thesis hypothesizes that any problem we have a means of solving using only a finite set of instructions and no insight, will turn out to be implementable by a Turing machine, i.e. it hypothesizes that our intuitive definition is covered by Turing’s definition (see e.g. <a href="https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Book/Introduction%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20computation_third%20edition%20-%20Michael%20Sipser.pdf">page 183 here</a>). That leaves open the possibility that someday the Church-Turing thesis will be violated. However, Church and Turing were seeking to formalize the concept of “algorithm”. Moreover, the Church-Turing thesis is generally taken as a given by researchers, so when people seek a proof that there is no algorithm for some function, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/csc463h/notes/comp.pdf">they sometimes do so by proving that you can’t do it with a Turing machine</a>. Therefore, it is safe to say that it has become a definition in computer science, meaning that the formal definition of algorithm is given by the Church-Turing thesis:</p><blockquote><strong>The Church-Turing thesis (as definition):</strong></blockquote><blockquote>An algorithm is anything that a Turing machine can do.</blockquote><p>With the definition of algorithm in hand, we can now define “computable functions” and “computer”. A “computable function” is defined as any task that can be solved using an algorithm. A “computer” is then defined as any physical machinery that can solve computable functions via algorithms. If we think back to the use of the word “computer” at this point in history, this makes sense. “Computers” at this time were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer">people</a> whose job was to sit down with pencil and paper and use an algorithm to solve computable functions (e.g. to integrate some equation). Clearly, these people were computers according to this definition, because they were providing solutions to computable functions via algorithms.</p><p>Importantly, there are many processes that consist of a finite set of instructions, but not discrete, step-by-step instructions, and which can still be done with a Turing machine. This is where things get confusing. Consider, for example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_recording">analog audio system</a>. Many people mistakenly think that Turing machines cannot implement analog functions because they are not defined by a discrete set of step-by-step values. But remember, <em>Turing machines are not machines</em>. They’re abstract mathematical constructs that can operate with infinite memory and no time restrictions (any finite amount of time counts, no matter how large). As such, an analog system can be implemented by a Turing machine to any desired level of precision. That’s why we consider all of the functions that audio systems perform to be computable functions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Live">and why we can simulate them well</a>). Of course, it must be recognized that if we require infinite precision for an analog function, then it isn’t computable, but that is rarely a situation we are faced with practically.</p><p>Indeed, any procedure for solving a computable function can be implemented by a Turing machine, <em>by definition</em>, no matter the specific mechanism involved. Part of the reason a lot of confusion sets in, even amongst <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxxiv-is-the-brain-a-computer-2/">really smart people</a>, is that when you study Turing machines and computable functions in school as a computer science student, the concern is rarely with analog, or stochastic, or distributed processes. <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">Example after example are deterministic step-by-step algorithms that are easy to teach with</a>. That’s good for learning the basics, but it leads many people to mistakenly think that any system which isn’t clearly a step-by-step, discrete system can’t be running algorithms, and that’s simply not true.</p><p>That’s not to say that Turing machines can do everything. For example, it has been proven mathematically that there are some problems that Turing machines can’t do, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem#History">like Hilbert’s 10th problem</a>. But the reason a Turing machine cannot do some things is not because those things are analog, or stochastic, or distributed, etc. It’s because there are certain limits to mechanical, axiomatic methods — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">some questions simply have no concrete answer within mathematics as we know it</a>.</p><p>To summarize the formal definitions: <br />(1) an algorithm is anything a Turing machine can do,<br />(2) computable functions are defined as those functions that we have algorithms for,<br />(3) a computer is anything which physically implements algorithms in order to solve computable functions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A9sd70XUUthRhWxirJza9Q.jpeg" />Nature implementing some computable functions</figure><h4>Is everything a computer?</h4><p>Given these definitions, is the brain a computer? Most certainly, because our brains implement various algorithms to solve computable functions, ranging from the obviously computable (you can mentally sort a list, pick which of two numbers is larger, multiply two numbers, etc.) to the less obviously, but still, computable (you can run, talk, play music, etc.). However, a big issue with this approach, and more broadly with the definitions provided above, is that they can be applied to almost <em>anything</em>. For example, the macroscopic laws of physics are computable functions (e.g. a parabolic path is computable). Therefore, technically, every object in the universe, every planet, every rock, every feather, every snowflake, every grain of sand, etc., can be viewed as a computer, implementing algorithms to solve the functions that describe that object’s evolution through time. That would appear to render the definitions above so broad as to be useless.</p><p>In my opinion (and as a subscriber to <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54889e73e4b0a2c1f9891289/t/564b61a4e4b04eca59c4d232/1447780772744/Ludwig.Wittgenstein.-.Philosophical.Investigations.pdf">Wittgenstein’s later philosophies</a>), the way to contend with this problem is to examine our usage of the word “computer”. What do we usually use this word for, and how do computer scientists use this word? Can we generate some mapping between the two that renders our usage non-trivial? Obviously, we are all comfortable with calling the machines we now carry in our pockets and keep on our desks “computers”. That’s how we usually use the word, e.g. when we get a new laptop we say “I just bought a new computer”, rather than, “I just bought a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann architecture programmable machine</a>” (which is a reasonable description of what they are). And it’s not just the average person: computer scientists also use the word “computer” to refer to these machines. So, what is it about these machines that makes this usage less trivial than, say, calling every grain of sand a “computer”? Is this usage actually grounded in a scientific, formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)">language game</a>, or is it just a funny quirk of our everyday, non-scientific language games?</p><p>There are very good, formal reasons to use the word “computer” when referring to our laptops and phones. One of the things that Turing proved was that some Turing machines could be used to implement <em>any</em> other Turing machine. These are called <strong>universal Turing machines</strong>. Now, remember, <em>Turing machines are not actually machines</em>, they’re a formalism, a mathematical tool. A universal Turing machine is a mathematical tool that can be used to perform the functions of any other mathematical tool that is also a Turing machine. Moreover, a mathematical tool that can be proven to be capable of implementing any algorithm is called “<strong>Turing complete</strong>”. For example, the programming languages familiar to us all (C++, Python, etc.) <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-Turing-complete-languages-and-which-programming-languages-comes-under-this">are Turing complete</a>, because it can be <em>proven</em> that any algorithm can be programmed with these languages.</p><p>Given this, we can see why the machines we apply the word “computer” to deserve their name. These machines provide a physical substrate for running algorithms using Turing complete programming languages. This means that, with the right programming, they can solve any computable function for us. (Note: this does not provide a practical guarantee, e.g. it may take billions or trillions of years for any given function to run in any given language. The question of practical computation is addressed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory">computational complexity theory</a>.) As such, these machines that are now ubiquitous in our lives are a much more powerful form of computer than a stone or a snowflake, which are limited to computing only the functions of physics that apply to their movement. Your laptop is an “uber-computer”, as it were, and therefore, arguably deserves the title “computer” much more than any other object in your house (except maybe you).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SS4mn4-psfnt07dBbpV2xw.jpeg" />A squishy computer</figure><h4>What about brains then?</h4><p>What does all this business about Turing completeness have to do with brains? As many people have noted, the internal workings of brains are nothing like the internal workings of the Von Neumann architecture machines that we usually call computers. So, surely brains aren’t computers, right? Well, no, brains are also “uber-computers”, they just work in a different manner.</p><p>First, we can consider the anecdotal evidence. Consider all the functions that an adult human with sufficient education is capable of implementing. It’s a pretty big list! In fact, with no more than a pencil and piece of paper, any human is arguably capable of running any program that has been programmed in a language like Python. Even without a pencil and paper, you can implement a huge swathe of functions that well outstrips the functions that a stone, a chair or a thermometer, say, can implement.</p><p>Second, we can consider the formal evidence. Computer scientists have demonstrated that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089360809190009T">multilayer</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000085710136">recurrent</a> artificial neural networks are Turing complete, meaning you can implement any algorithm with them<em>.</em> That’s one of the reasons why we can do all sorts of impressive stuff with neural networks! This doesn’t mean that any given neural network can compute any function, though. Rather, it means that for any given function there exists a neural network that can compute it.</p><p>Put another way, we can think of neural networks as a sort of programming language: the synaptic connections in a neural network define the functions that they implement, so the set of all possible neural network architectures is effectively a programming language, and this language is Turing complete. Although there are many differences between artificial neural networks and brains, arguably those differences only render real brains <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627303001491"><strong>more</strong></a> computationally powerful than artificial neural networks. This means that when we consider the set of all <em>possible</em> brains, then for any given computable function, there is probably a hypothetical brain that can solve it. Thus, the “language of brains”, as it were, is probably Turing complete.</p><p>Moreover, we can make some stronger statements about individual animals, including of course, humans. Our brains have roughly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11418939">10¹⁴</a> synapses, and there is a surprising amount of flexibility in how those synapses are set. This means that we can implement many, many different functions. Is any individual human Turing complete, then, i.e. can we implement the entire set of computable functions? Probably, if we were immortal, but practically, no. However, the same caveat applies to our laptops and phones. The languages they can be programmed with are Turing complete, but like us, they would require immortality to guarantee that they could implement any computable function. Thus, the set of functions that we can implement as humans is not radically different in scope than the set of functions that our trusty old Von Neumann architecture machines can implement.</p><p>Of course, not all animals are as flexible as humans. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2612">I worked</a> for many years with the toad species <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/species/5255"><em>Xenopus laevis</em></a>, and I can tell you, they’re much more limited in their behavioural repertoire than humans. Nonetheless, they can still do a <em>hell</em> of a lot more than a stone. Any animal can, thanks to their brains. Rodents can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3736">replicate spatial probability distributions in their searches</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(14)01107-6">optimize their strategies in oppositional games</a>. <a href="https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/12572/elife-12572-v2.pdf"><em>C. elegans</em> implement a Markov model in their search behaviour</a>. Because these functions are computable (e.g. solvable with a Turing machine) we can say these animals are running algorithms.</p><p>For example, one of the most appropriate uses of the word “algorithm” in recent neuroscience work came from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23014">Ortezia et al</a>. They demonstrated that zebrafish embryos use the following recipe for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheotaxis">rheotaxis</a>:</p><ul><li>Determine the change in the gradient of water flow.</li><li>If the gradient decreases, swim straight.</li><li>If the gradient increases, turn in the direction of flow field rotation.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gjD6mrvKg6z7KOiThnvQRg.jpeg" />A computer for swimming upstream</figure><p>That’s an algorithm, both intuitively and formally. It’s a finite set of instructions to solve a given function, and it can be implemented with a Turing machine. Of course, the zebrafish probably isn’t engaged in a step-by-step program that looks anything like a computer program on your laptop. It must be using analog sensors, an array of neurons with fluctuating voltages, stochastic transmitter release, etc. Nonetheless, Ortezia et al. are right, the zebrafish is using an <em>algorithm</em> to solve this ecologically relevant problem. That makes the zebrafish embryo’s nervous system a computer.</p><p>Hence, when we consider both the formal definitions and the common usage of the word “computer”, it is perfectly reasonable to say that the brain is a computer. Any brain is a sophisticated device capable of implementing a very large set of algorithms to solve many different computable functions. It should be noted that where we draw the line is unclear, e.g. is a single cell a computer? What about DNA? Both can implement more functions than a rock. We have to accept that there is a subjective decision to be made in these borderline cases. The definitions do not say how many algorithms a machine needs to implement to be a computer. But, given that the set of neural networks is Turing complete (and therefore also probably the set of possible brains), it is pretty clear that brains deserve the title “computer”. Therefore, the brain is a computer.</p><p>It’s not a metaphor, it’s not an analogy, it’s a fact.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pScJ0PZQBtgF6p9OGQLzGQ.jpeg" />A second hilarious brain as computer image available for download</figure><h3>Objections to the “brain is a computer” argument</h3><p>When I’ve advanced this argument in public, I’ve encountered a number of objections, some very strong and worth considering, others indicating a basic misunderstanding of the logic. I’ll try to briefly contend with the common objections I’ve encountered here, moving from objections founded on misunderstanding to valid objections that need to be contended with:</p><h4>Objection 1. Brains are nothing like Turing machines (or laptops), therefore they’re not computers</h4><p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer">This objection</a> is borne of a misunderstanding of the definitions above. Nothing in the definition of “algorithm”, “computable function”, or “computer” states that computers must be like Turing machines or Von Neumann architecture machines. A computer need not operate with binary codes, it doesn’t need to use discrete-time processes, it doesn’t need registers or memory banks, or step-by-step instructions — it doesn’t need to be remotely like our laptops of phones for the definitions to apply.</p><p>The definitions simply say that algorithms are things that you can do with a Turing machine, and computers are things that run algorithms. Importantly, those definitions do not state any practical limits on how a Turing machine could do it. So, for example, if you have an algorithm that uses analog, continuous processes (like the zebrafish algorithm for swimming upstream probably does), then the Turing machine corresponding to it will have to run for potentially very long in order to approximate that analog process to sufficient precision. But, Turing machines aren’t real machines! They’re mathematical constructs, so there’s no problem with this. Nothing in the definition of “algorithm” says that it must be economical to implement an algorithm with a Turing machine. As long as you are solving computable functions, you’ve got yourself a computer running algorithms. Thus, it doesn’t matter that the brain is nothing like a Turing machine (nothing is, really) or nothing like your laptop. Yes, the brain is a jumble of cells using voltages, neurotransmitters, distributed representations, etc. Yes, it has no programmer, and yes it is shaped by evolution and life experience. None of that matters. As long as we don’t require infinite precision in our description of neural processes (and I see no reason to think we would), then the brain is a computer running algorithms, according to the definitions provided by the Church-Turing thesis.</p><h4>Objection 2. Just because you can simulate the brain with a Turing machine doesn’t make the brain a computer</h4><p>This objection is related to the first objection, in that it stems from a failure to understand the definitions and the role of Turing machines in those definitions. The thrust of this objection is that even though we can run a Turing machine for as long as we want in order to implement analog processes, we’re really just <em>simulating</em> those processes with a Turing machine, so we cannot say that they count as something a Turing machine can do. Thus, Turing machine can’t actually do what brains do, so brains aren’t running algorithms.</p><p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the point that must be returned to here is that <em>Turing machines are not machines</em>. We don’t simulate <em>anything</em> with Turing machines, just as we don’t “simulate” things with lambda calculus. We use Turing machines to mathematically determine whether a particular process counts as an algorithm or not. Therefore, if we can demonstrate mathematically that a given analog process can be implemented by a Turing machine to any arbitrary degree of precision, then we have demonstrated that we have an algorithm. Yes, we simulate many things, including brains, with our Von Neumann machines. But, <em>Von Neumann machines are not Turing machines</em>. It’s important to remember this, because many people fall into the trap of thinking that computers are defined as Turing machines, when they most certainly are not. No physical object is a Turing machine, just as no physical object is an algebra.</p><h4>Objection 3. Computers cannot explain the mind, therefore the brain is not a computer</h4><p>This one is tough because it is a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/">thorny philosophical argument</a>, and how one reacts to it depends on one’s philosophical stances. Many philosophers have argued that purely mechanical accounts of the brain cannot account for the mind, and given that the definition of computer provided above is very much mechanical, it is true that if the mind cannot be accounted for by purely mechanical means, then there must be something missing when I say “the brain is a computer”.</p><p>Ultimately, as I noted in the introduction, I do not have time to contend with the long debates on this issue in philosophy of mind and cognitive science here. All I will say, is that I <em>personally</em> find all of the philosophical objections to the idea that the mind can arise from mechanical processes unconvincing. Whether it’s <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/">Searle’s Chinese Room Argument</a>, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/">Chalmer’s zombies</a>, or <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/#2">Jackson’s Mary the Scientist</a>, I’ve never been persuaded that there’s anything really worthy of serious consideration for neuroscientists in these thought experiments. I’m much more convinced by the works of philosophers like <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661">Daniel Dennett</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Neurophilosophy-Toward-Unified-Science-Mind-Brain/dp/0262530856">Patricia Churchland</a>, who seem much more clear-eyed and logical to me. But hey, that’s my perspective. If someone rejects the idea that the mind can be reduced to physical mechanism, then I recognize that my arguments above are unconvincing. But, anyone who is comfortable with reductionism, and who understands the definitions above, should also recognize that the brain is a computer by definition.</p><h4>Objection 4. Brains can implement non-computable functions, therefore the brain is not a computer</h4><p>This is a very interesting argument that has been advanced by various people. The physicist <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/0192861980">Roger Penrose</a> has claimed that humans have various insights and behaviours that require non-Turing computation and quantum effects for explanation. <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/penrose.htm">Like Dennett</a>, I consider Penrose’s claims questionable. It’s not clear from scientific evidence that human behaviour requires any radical rethinking of computation or physiology.</p><p>But, there are other more serious attempts in this vein. Notably, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hava_Siegelmann">Hava Siegelmann</a>, who provided one of the proofs that recurrent neural networks are Turing complete, also published an <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/268/5210/545">article in Science</a> in which she argued that recurrent neural networks can, in fact, be <strong>super Turing</strong>. This means that they can solve the set of computable functions (as defined by Turing machines) and <em>more, </em>i.e. they can implement algorithms that Turing machines cannot. It’s a very interesting result. I will admit that I find Siegelmann’s proof in that paper hard to understand, so I prefer to remain agnostic as to whether this is an accepted fact. (I will note though, that if Sigelmann’s proof is valid, it calls for a revision of the Church Turing thesis, so I wonder why computer science has not apparently taken this leap.)</p><p>But, for argument’s sake, let’s say that Siegelmann’s proof is correct, and that recurrent neural networks are super Turing. That would suggest that brains are also super Turing. If the space of possible brains is super Turing, then someone, someday, could engage in computations that no laptop could ever do. In that case, arguably, the brain is not just a computer, it’s a <em>super computer</em>. This would only make my case that the brain is a computer stronger.</p><h4>Objection 5. The brain has many constraints placed on it by evolution that would prevent it from being Turing complete</h4><p>This objection raises some important points. Certainly, we know that evolution can take odd paths to get to certain physiological functions, and brains are likely no exception. Moreover, brains face major energy constraints, both spatial and temporal, and memory capabilities limited by the size of our mnemonic networks. Thus, the chances that the entire set of computable functions could be implemented by any real brain are zero.</p><p>All of this is true, but it fails to recognize that many of the same things could be said about our trusty Von Neumann machines. Though we seem to have little concern for our energy usage as a species, the reality is that we cannot devote infinite energy to our digital computers. Moreover, although the cloud is growing rapidly, we still don’t have infinite memory capabilities (at least, not us mere mortals who don’t run big tech companies). As such, your laptop also has many functions that it cannot calculate for you given reasonable energy and memory constraints. That doesn’t stop you from calling your laptop a “computer”, because it is still an incredibly powerful machine for solving computable functions with algorithms, just like our brains.</p><p>Of course, the energetic and evolutionary constraints that impinge on brains are very different from the constraints on our Von Neumann machines, and that is also important. As we compile the principles of <em>neural</em> computation in the coming century, some of those principles will surely have to do with the unique constraints that brains face. But, that doesn’t render brains non-computers, it makes them a special kind of computer, one shaped by evolution.</p><h4>Objection 6. These definitions are useless and potentially misleading</h4><p>This objection is potentially valid. As I noted, the technical definitions of “computer” and “algorithm” are so abstract that they can be applied to everything in the universe. As I argued above, I think it’s reasonable to restrict their usage to machines, like the brain, that not only solve the functions of physics, but a much larger array of computable functions, potentially even all of them (assuming the space of possible brains is Turing complete). But, what do we achieve by applying the words “computer” and “algorithm” to the brain? How does that help us to understand the brain, given that the formal definitions are mechanism agnostic? If many people do not know these formal definitions, and they think that “computers” are Von Neumann architecture machines and “algorithms” are discrete step-by-step instructions for Von Neumann architecture machines, then we run the risk of grossly misleading these people when we use these words in relation to the brain. My response to this objection is twofold.</p><p>First, there are many terms that scientists use formal definitions for, but which many people misuse. For example, the term “significant” means something very specific in statistical hypothesis testing, even though its usage in common language means anything that’s “big”, “meaningful”, or “impactful”. Should we stop using the term “significant”, then? I don’t think so. I think we merely need to be careful to articulate clearly to people what we mean when we use this word.</p><p>I think it’s the same with “computer” and “algorithm”. When we use these words, we need to be clear what definitions we’re operating with. If speaking to the lay public, that means highlighting the fact that the brain is not a computer that is anything like their laptops or phones, lest they think otherwise. If speaking to other scientists, it means articulating clearly the formal definitions and asserting only that the brain implements a large array of algorithms to solve many different computable functions.</p><p>Second, I think we actually gain something when we say the brain is a computer. There is a rich vein of theories in computer science that are mechanism agnostic, including computability theory, computational complexity theory, and information theory. When we note that the brain is a computer, we are highlighting that these theories are applicable to the brain — which they are! Neuroscientists can, and do, examine how the brain implements various algorithms, how it deals with computationally intractable functions, and how it does things like store, compress or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005497">transmit information</a>. All of this scientific activity is useful, and it derives from our understanding that the brain is a computer.</p><p>The desire to reject the statement “the brain is a computer” out of fear that it misleads those of us who don’t quite understand or know the definitions is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Can we not simply work hard at being precise and transparent in our definitions? Need we reject a true statement that feeds various streams of scientific inquiry simply because some people don’t actually understand what it means? This seems overly myopic and pessimistic to me. I think neuroscientists can, and should, use the formal definitions of “algorithm” and “computer” provided by computer science, and simply be careful not to overstate what those words imply.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*np9V6bGTJcQ7DpiO6ogbAQ.jpeg" />One last ridiculous brain as computer image for the road…</figure><h3>I shouldn’t count my computers before they halt…</h3><p>That last argument, that it’s useful to say the “brain is a computer”, is really the key one. For example, if in the distant future of neuroscience it turns out that information theory provides little in the way of helpful insight, then maybe using these abstract definitions and applying them to the brain has been a silly waste of time. Maybe I’ve just been wasting my glucose on banging out this argument. We know the brain works nothing like our laptops or phones, so maybe all I’ve ever done is confuse more people than I’ve helped with this argument.</p><p>Obviously, my bet is that this will turn out to be important for understanding the brain. Indeed, as I stated in the introduction, I think that neuroscience is just as much a branch of computer science as it is of physiology and psychology. I am one of a number of researchers who <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317305093">view artificial intelligence and neuroscience as intimately related</a>, and who consider artificial intelligence as key to theoretical inquiry in neuroscience. Perhaps people like me who think this way are just part of a trend that has grown into a bubble due to hype in machine learning. Perhaps… but this line of thinking certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">predates</a> today’s hype in artificial intelligence. Whether it will be important to recognize that the brain is a computer according to the definitions of computer science is something that we cannot fully grok at this moment in history.

<p>One eyewitness to a robbery reports that the culprit was a male in his 40s with brown hair, wearing a light-coloured T-shirt. Another describes a blond man in his early 30s wearing a denim shirt. If you’re a police officer investigating the crime, whose memory do you trust?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Identifying which of two apparently credible but conflicting eye-witness statements to trust is a big problem for law enforcement agencies (as is deciding, in the case of a witness who has no incentive to lie, which among their memories are accurate). Now a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xap0000175">new paper</a>, reported in the<i> Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, provides initial evidence for a new, objectively verifiable method for doing this. This work has, as the researchers write, “potentially far-reaching significance, not the least in the legal context.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34816"></span></p>
<p>Torun Lindholm at Stockholm University and her fellow researchers report two studies. For the first, they recruited 34 men, who separately watched a video of a staged abduction of a woman by two men. Afterwards, the men, who were interviewed separately, were first asked to recall all they could about the crime, then they were given 12 specific prompts – to describe the clothing of the men who waited outside the victim’s house, for instance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These interviews were recorded, and raters later identified and pooled all the “accurate” and “inaccurate” responses. Next, two more raters then coded each of these individual responses, this time looking for cues that indicated how hard the participant had to work to produce their response (so-called “effort cues”). These included pauses in speech; filler non-words (like “um” or “uh”); filler words (like “you know” or “well”); and hedges (words that reduced the force of an assertion, such as “maybe” or “I guess”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earlier work has found that correct memories are recalled faster than incorrect memories, which led the researchers to suspect that signs of slow, more effortful recall – like the use of lots of filler words – might indicate that a memory was faulty. As expected, the analysis showed that inaccurate responses included significantly more hedges and filler non-words and words than accurate responses. This result raises the possibility that these cues could in future be used to differentiate accurate from mistaken memories in an objective way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A second study on 10 men and 10 women mostly replicated these findings, but also found that, for this group, delays while reporting a memory – another effort cue – were associated with inaccuracy. (This study also found that asking a participant how confident they were in the accuracy of a particular memory provided no additionally useful information, on top of the hedge, delay and filler data.)</p>
<p>These studies do have some limitations. The number of participants was small. And they were interviewed immediately after viewing the events they were asked to describe, which would rarely happen in real life eye-witness situations. Might delays in interviewing make it harder to use effort cues to predict statement accuracy? Only further research will tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Also, while use of a greater use of filler words and hedges was strongly associated with inaccuracy, that doesn’t mean that participants reporting accurate memories never used them. Will the total number of effort cues observed in a witness’s testimony allow police officers easily to distinguish between accurate and faulty memories? As yet, no one knows. Still, this work does reveal some objectively verifiable markers, and that’s an important first step. As the researchers point out, “Given research showing that most people have vast difficulties in judging the quality of others’ memories, combined with the scarcity of research on genuinely reported memories, these initial findings suggest unexplored alternatives that may prove highly useful for improving accuracy judgements.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/ramon_y_cajal_conexiones-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Even though it’s smaller than a basketball, the scale of the human brain can feel astronomical. “There are as many neurons in the human brain as there are stars (100 billion) in the Milky Way” is commonly stated in musings on the brain. And while this figure isn’t quite accurate (it’s closer to 86 billion neurons/brain), the comparison is staggering.<sup>1</sup> Neurons, though, aren’t useful without synapses – the point of contact between neurons where chemical messages are conveyed. It’s at synapses where memories are formed and skills like dribbling a basketball are honed. And it’s at the level of the synapse where the human brain scales up to numbers that dwarf our tiny galaxy – 100 trillion synapses is the crude estimate. Any effort to catalog and characterize the brain’s population of synapses probably sounds as futile as cataloging all the stars in the universe. A new field called synaptomics, however, has emerged to try and do just that: map the molecular composition and spatial distribution of every single synapse in the brain.</p>
<p>The scale of synapses is so staggering, there actually isn’t a consensus on how many there are. The number <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/100-trillion-connections/">100 trillion</a> appears in popular articles and <a href="http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43512#_edn4">teaching tools</a>, but it’s not typically referenced in peer-reviewed journals. 100 trillion is calculated by multiplying 100 billion neurons by 1,000 connections each, which belies the diversity in neuronal shape and size.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19644"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/Sam1.png"><img alt="A sampling of the dendritic arbors of different neuron types, each making a different number of synapses." class="wp-image-19644" height="438" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/09/Sam1-300x211.png" width="622" /></a><em>A sampling of the dendritic arbors of different neuron types, each making a different number of synapses.</em></figure>
<p>Neurons, like “E” in the figure above, may only form a dozen synapses on its simple dendritic arbor. A neuron with a dense network of dendrites, like in “B” or “F”, above, may form 10,000 to 100,000 synapses. With 86 billion neurons spread through roughly 200 unique regions<sup>2</sup> – each region containing unique combinations of neuron types – accurate estimation becomes close to impossible. This is not to say that finding the precise number of synapses in a human brain is the most pressing question in neuroscience. But framing this question does show how difficult it is to answer even the most basic questions at this scale. In other words, if figuring out the number of synapses isn’t feasible, how does the field begin to answer more complex questions about the brain’s catalog of synapses?</p>
<p>The approach most neuroscientists take is to compartmentalize. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time, according to proverb. Neuroscientists take their fork and steak knife and start sawing away at one brain region or circuit and learn the rules that govern the set of synapses there. For example, there have been over 11,500 Pubmed cataloged publications on “hippocampal plasticity” – studies that furthered our understanding of synapses in this memory-formation region. But how do the synapses in this region compare to the rest of the brain? Will it take another 2.3 million bites (11,500 x 200 brain regions) of elephant meat to figure this out?</p>
<p>A group led by Seth Grant at University of Edinburgh is attempting to define some simple principles that distinguish and group the brain’s trillions (?) of synapses, in an effort they call the <em><a href="http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org/">Genes to Cognition Synaptome Mapping</a></em> pipeline or, more simply, synaptomics. They started with the mouse brain in a recent issue of <em><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(18)30581-6">Neuron</a>.</em><sup>3</sup> The group genetically engineered mice to express two different fluorescently “tagged” proteins: PSD95 attached to a green marker and SAP102 to an orange marker. PSD95 and SAP102 are found exclusively in synapses, so under a microscope the brains of these mice are a canvas of green and orange dots, each dot a synapse. With the naked eye, Grant and colleagues could distinguish three groups of synapses: those with PSD95, those with SAP102, and those with both. But they also measured the brightness, size, and relative density of each dot throughout the brain. Including these factors, they used machine learning to characterize the ~1 billion glowing synapses in the mouse brain. Clustering algorithms categorized 37 subtypes of synapses, each subtype with its own unique signature of brightness, size and density. The way these 37 subtypes are distributed throughout the mouse brain creates the first synaptome “signature” of a brain.</p>
<p>At this point, you could argue that an attempt to catalog 1 billion of anything would find clusters. If one were to catalog a billion cracks in the surface of a highway, groupings would likely arise. Do the synapse subtypes that Grant and colleagues observed have any significance to brain function? The fact that different synapse subtypes were enriched in certain brain regions argues that they do. For example, subtype “24” was abundant in the cerebral cortex and absent in the cerebellum. This makes sense since cerebral cortex and cerebellum develop differently and perform different functions.</p>
<p>Grant and colleagues also show that the synaptome signature is sensitive to insults in brain development. It has long been known that neuropsychiatric diseases like autism and schizophrenia are associated with disrupted brain connectivity. The authors saw changes in the synaptome signature of mutant mice with behavioral abnormalities resembling these neuropsychiatric diseases. These data show that the synaptome is sensitive to developmental disturbances, and changes in it may be a marker for psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>This study is more of a starting point for synaptomics than a presentation of its fruition. For one, this study builds its synaptome map with only two of the synapse’s thousands of proteins. The stated goal of the <em>Genes to Cognition Synaptome Mapping</em> pipeline is to map as many of these thousands of proteins as possible and incorporate them into a global catalog. What will neuroscience gain from this this catalog? Will future neuroscientists be able to see a memory form or a disease develop by simply “perusing” the catalog? These questions aren’t possible to answer right now, but hopefully this new field will provide some general principles that transcend the astronomical.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 6, 2018 – PALO ALTO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE) — Science Exchange, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading marketplace for outsourced R&amp;D<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced today a collaboration with Renovo Neural, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Contract Research Organization (CRO) specializing in degenerative neurological conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renovo has a history in model development for multiple sclerosis (MS) and recently expanded its efforts to offer other non-clinical research services such as immunohistochemistry and 3-D electron microscopy for a wide range of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome. Renovo is best known for having developed an augmented cuprizone model of MS. This model – developed by the pioneering work of Bruce Trapp and Wendy Macklin – has been documented to provide superior reliability in evaluating the remyelination potential of novel therapeutic candidate compounds. Renovo has an experienced team and proven capabilities to support research and development in neurology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Renovo is already well-known in the field, collaborating with Science Exchange will help expand our reach to researchers who can benefit from the technical expertise our team can provide,” stated Vivek Shenoy, CEO of Renovo. “We will be in a better position to support R&amp;D teams actively involved in the discovery of new therapies to treat or even reverse the debilitating effects of MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very excited to collaborate with Renovo Neural to make available its novel neurological research services readily available to scientists worldwide,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Science Exchange. “Science Exchange is committed to adding the most innovative and qualified service providers to our platform, so scientists have secure, rapid access to the services they need to aid their discoveries. Renovo Neural has impressed us with their progress in the field of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">neurodegenerative diseases.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
