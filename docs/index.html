                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/546822708/0/oupblogpsychology/">Child’s play: pioneers of child psychoanalysis</a></h4>

<p>Psychoanalysis, a therapeutic method for treating mental health issues, explores the interaction of the conscious and unconscious elements of the mind. Originating with Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, the practice has evolved exponentially in terms of both treatment and research applications. Much of Freud’s theory acknowledged that childhood experiences often affect individuals later in life, which was expanded upon by analysts who believed that mental health issues can affect individuals at all stages of their life. Child psychoanalysis has developed into a well-established technique for children and adolescents, with specialised approaches to working with younger individuals.</p>
<p>When considering the history of this specialism, a few key figures come to mind. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Melanie Klein</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Donald Winnicott</a>, and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anna Freud</a> began work with adolescents and infants as young as three years of age. Among a variety of techniques, each of the analysists incorporated elements of play in their therapeutic approaches as a means of understanding adult associations, behavioural and internalised expression, or in order to develop an authentic self.</p>
<p>Below is a brief introduction to each of their contributions to the field:</p>
<div class="flex-video"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Interested in finding out more? Here are some additional facts about the lives and work of Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, and Anna Freud:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1914, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freud</a> took a holiday in England but became an enemy alien when war broke out. After returning to Vienna, she began work as an apprentice elementary school teacher, qualifying six years later and joining the school staff. She remained a teacher—in the widest sense—all her life.</li>
<li>Despite being exempt from wartime service, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Winnicott</a> interrupted his studies in 1917 and joined the Royal Navy, to serve on a destroyer as a surgeon-probationer. During his downtime on the ship, he tackled the novels of Henry James.</li>
<li>Modernist writer <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-37018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Virginia Woolf</a> found <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Klein</a> to be a “woman of character and force and some submerged—how shall I say—not craft, but subtlety: something working underground. A pull, a twist, like an undertow: menacing. A bluff grey-haired lady, with large bright imaginative eyes.”</li>
<li>Analysis of one family member by another, or even by a close friend, is considered unacceptable in contemporary analysis. Yet in 1918, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-55514" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sigmund Freud</a> did not set a precedent and he would often analyse <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his daughter Anna</a>. Klein also analysed her sons, Erich and Hans, as well as her daughter Melitta. Unlike Freud, however, she published their analyses under pseudonyms. No records exist of Freud’s analysis of Anna.</li>
<li>In 1936, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Winnicott</a>’s work was supervised by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Klein</a>, whose influence in the British Psychoanalytical Society was substantial. Winnicott was attracted to many of Klein’s ideas but always processed them in the light of his own clinical experience. Winnicott remained an independent thinker as the ideas he valued, whether Klein’s or not, often underwent alteration.</li>
<li>There were disputes between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Klein</a> and her followers and the psychoanalytic refugees from Vienna and Berlin, led by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31126" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freud</a>, who strongly objected to what they regarded as the “London-centred doctrinal deviance” of the Kleinian group. The two groups disagreed over the depth of interpretation of the unconscious, and the presence, or absence, of transference in children. These disagreements led to a series of Controversial Discussions held between 1941 and 1945, moderated by a “Middle Group” that included <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38140" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Winnicott</a>. The differences were never fully resolved, but the debate ended in a compromise whereby two separate training groups were organized. A split in the society, though threatened, was averted.</li>

A study claiming that a "memory" could be transferred from one animal to another in form of an injection has caused a lot of excitement. The Futurist said that Scientists Transferred Memories From One Snail to Another. Someday, They Could Do The Same in Humans. But I have to say I'm not convinced.

In recent years <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/stop-torture/">Amnesty International</a> has found torture occurring in 141 countries, corresponding to three-quarters of the world’s countries. Torture as a phenomenon has received increasing attention as a public health concern and our understanding of the complexity of the consequences of torture has developed to include a focus on the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2397.2005.00336.x">inter-generational</a>, <a href="https://www.medicaljournals.se/jrm/content/abstract/10.2340/16501977-2322">economic</a> and <a href="https://archive.udmercy.edu/handle/10429/800">genetic</a> manifestation of the harm torture creates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3979573/">calls for economic studies</a> of the cost of torture have focused how knowledge of these cost can aide calls for torture prevention and inform better rehabilitation programmes, as well as shed light on the longer-term economic consequences for torture survivors and their families. The economic perspective is a central part of an evidence-based approach to understanding and supporting the <a href="https://www.diw.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=diw_01.c.519323.de">labour market integration of refugees resettled in Europe</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We conclude that rehabilitating torture survivors benefits not only the individuals who receive it but also … provides a net social benefit to society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our study “<a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3145-3?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Health_Services_Research-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Rehabilitation_economic_torture_survivors">Does multidisciplinary rehabilitation of tortured refugees represent ‘value-for-money’? A follow-up of a Danish case-study</a>” is the first economic evaluation of this type of rehabilitation, from society’s point of view, as we look at the economic impact of providing rehabilitation to torture survivors and their families in host countries.</p>
<p>We attempt to capture some of the complexity of the consequences by including cost incurred directly at the individual, family and societal level. In doing so, we conclude that rehabilitating torture survivors benefits not only the individuals who receive it but also, once the families are included in the analysis, rehabilitation provides a net social benefit to society. However, Support systems and services addressing the after-effects of torture are challenged by the complex symptomatology presented by torture survivors.</p>

<h3><strong>The terror of torture</strong></h3>
<p>Torture serves the purpose of terrorizing and controlling the individual and <a href="https://www.cvt.org/resources/publications">breaking down the social fabric of communities</a>. The physical and psychological trauma following torture often result in severe long-term impediments for the survivor, and not only it is devastating to the subjected individual, it affects whole families and society.</p>
<p>Some torture survivors display a high level of physical disability, persisting over time. These include, but are not restricted to, chronic muscle pain, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. The psychological responses to torture include Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, psychosis, phobias, bipolar disorder, and neuropsychological impairment. Typically, survivors also report sleep disturbances, flashbacks, guilt, concentration and memory issues, and a general negative self-image.</p>
<p>Survivors might also experience difficulties in controlling emotions, such as anger, which at times can lead to isolation, with knock-on adverse effect on their quality of life. Fulfilling parental or familial obligations can become problematic for survivors. Dysfunctional family relations might escalate into violence, but more subtle trauma transmission pathway could involve <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363461514568442">inappropriate communication of parental trauma</a> to children in the families, leading to psychological distress in the children. These effects disseminate and impact society and communities in which survivors live.</p>
<p>Perhaps less debated is the perspective that torture is not only a terrible human rights violation, but in addition to the damaging health effects and social costs to individuals and families, torture also results in economic losses. One such economic loss is related to the loss of labour income for the individual in cases where the physical or psychological ramifications of torture inhibit the person’s ability to retain a job or perhaps a caretaker in the family. Society might also bear cost related to long-term impairment.</p>
<blockquote><p>This can create a circle of disadvantages, where poor education and mental distress lead to lack of opportunities and unemployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, costs of a more diffuse and less clearly associated nature also exist; society’s expenses related to provision of services are unlikely to be limited to health care alone but these expenses can be difficult to associate directly with the trauma.</p>
<p>Children of torture survivors may suffer from physical and emotional problems and experience learning difficulties, as well as difficulties in reasoning and participating appropriately in a classroom context. They might experience problems with developing healthy attachments to parents, educators or other caretakers, and lack a sense of self-efficacy and future orientation. This can create a circle of disadvantages, where poor education and mental distress lead to lack of opportunities and unemployment. Ultimately, the result could be a sense of alienation from society, which attributes to the greater loss of productivity for the whole of society.</p>
<h3><strong>Moving on from here</strong></h3>
<p>The findings presented in our study suggest that rehabilitation is not only in the interest of society based on moral and ethical grounds, but it might well be an economically sound priority as well. While the right to rehabilitation is set out in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/RemedyAndReparation.aspx">international law</a>, economic priorities could influence policy makers to uphold and protect this right more than on human rights grounds alone. In addition, it should not be neglected either that economic self-sufficiency and labour force participation is part of regaining quality of life and dignity for torture survivors.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>It’s well established that elite athletes have a longer life expectancy than the general public. A recent <a href="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-015-0024-x">review</a> of over 50 studies comprising half a million people estimated the athletic advantage to be between 4 and 8 years, on average. This comes as little surprise. One can easily imagine how the same genetic endowment and training necessary to develop physical prowess in sport might also manifest in physical health. Now for the first time, a study <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938">published in <em>PLOS One</em></a> (open access) shows that athletes of the mind – chess grandmasters – show the same longevity advantage as athletes of the body.</p>
<p><span id="more-33906"></span></p>
<p>An Tran-Duy at the University of Melbourne and his colleagues obtained data on over 1,200 chess grandmasters, mostly men, from 28 countries in three world regions, including whether or not they survived each successive year after receiving their title, all the way up to the beginning of 2017. From this, the researchers calculated the average yearly survival rates, adjusting for region, age and sex, which allowed them to come up with estimated life expectancies for grandmasters of different ages in different years. They did the same with data for over 15,000 olympic medalists.</p>
<p>There was no difference in the average life expectancy of the athletes and the chess grandmasters, but both groups showed a sizeable life expectancy advantage compared to the general population. For instance, in 2010, the average life expectancy of a chess grandmaster aged 25 was 6.3 years longer than the average for a 25-year-old member of the public. For a 55-year-old chess grandmaster, life expectancy was 4.5 years longer.</p>
<p>The study can’t tell us anything about why chess grandmasters live longer than the public. It’s possible some of the causes are indirect, such as the grandmasters possibly having higher average IQ (which is itself associated with longevity); elite chess players are also known to take more care of their physical fitness than the general population; and the social and economic benefits of becoming a grandmaster, especially notable in Eastern Europe, may have health benefits. Chess may also have direct health benefits, including via its known effects on the brain – for instance, it reduces risk of dementia.</p>
<p>Tran-Duy and his team begin their paper quoting Isaac Asimov: “In life, unlike chess, the game continues after checkmate”, and they reference this quote in their conclusion. “Not only does the game of life continue after the checkmate,” they write, “but excelling in mind sports like chess means one is likely to play the game for longer.”</p>

<p>Abraham Maslow was one of the great psychological presences of the twentieth century, and his concept of self-actualisation has entered our vernacular and is addressed in most psychology textbooks. A core concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology">humanistic psychology</a>, self-actualisation theory has inspired a range of psychological therapies as well as approaches taken in social work. But a number of myths have crept into our understanding of the theory and the man himself. In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167818761929">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</i>, William Compton of Middle Tennessee State University aims to put the record straight.</p>
<p><span id="more-33899"></span></p>
<p>Maslow’s most penetrating idea is that we have a hierarchy of needs, proceeding from physiological needs like water or warmth, through safety, love, esteem and then self-actualisation. He argued that lower needs occupy our attention when they are unmet and make it more difficult to fulfil the higher ones – including self-actualisation, which is about becoming the self you always had the potential to be.</p>

He finds there is a lack of strong evidence showing that individuals transition from one level of the hierarchy to the next, as Maslow claimed. However, research on this point is complicated by the widely mistaken belief that Maslow considered needs must be fully satisfied at each level before progressing. In fact, Maslow stated that everyone has unsatisfied needs at every level – who feels safe 100 per cent of the time?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the other hand, in favour of the idea of progression through the hierarchy is evidence from comparisons of national populations. Cross-cultural research shows that when more people in a population have their basic needs met, a greater proportion also tend to reach self-actualisation, as compared with populations that are preoccupied with scarcities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Maslow also claimed that people are more likely to flourish when they hold self-actualising values like spontaneity, positive self-regard, and acceptance of paradoxes. There is supportive data associating these qualities with positive outcomes – including creativity, lower anxiety or a personal locus of control, and also – and perhaps more surprisingly – higher instances of peak experiences, higher sexual satisfaction, and less fear of death.</p>
<p>The hierarchy is sometimes presented with another element slotted in: cognition needs, placed just below self-actualisation (as seen in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=need+for+cognition+maslow+hierarchy&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy_aakiYrbAhUiCsAKHQ3bCb0Q_AUICigB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=680">these examples</a>). In fact Maslow opposed this, as he saw cognition as a tool that can serve every need at every level, whether in knowing self-defense techniques to help you feel safe, or knowing ourselves. For him, it lay outside the hierarchy. Another point often forgotten is that self-actualisation isn’t Maslow’s pinnacle. He broke out another stage for “peakers” – self actualised individuals who also experience peak or mystical experiences.</p>
<p>Compton moves on to address allegations about who and what the theory is for. He disputes the idea that it encourages self-centredness: many of the self-actualisation qualities Maslow emphasised are actually centred on others, like fairness, service, and adherence to a universal framework of values. Moreover, two of Maslow’s favoured reference points when talking about self-actualisation were Alfred Adler’s <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gemeinschaftsgefuhl">gemeinschaftsgefühl</a> (the psychological health that follows from caring about others) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva">bodhisattva</a> (the Buddhist notion of one who strives for compassion towards others).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What about the related charge that self-actualisation is elitist, a preoccupation reserved for the privileged? This criticism needs some thinking through. There is a case that Maslow didn’t pay enough attention to how sexism or racism could impede self-actualisation, although his writings did show a more vague sensitivity to life throwing you a trickier hand. It’s true many of his self-actualised examples are white men, but he also cited figures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Addams">Jane Addams</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a>. And while it may seem like self-actualisation requires plenty of disposable income and leisure time, what Maslow meant by self-actualisation is bringing your full self to the moment, which includes dedicating yourself to work, how you treat others in daily interactions, and holding yourself to the highest standards. You can do all that from wherever you are standing.</p>
<p>Finally, Compton deals with the references in Maslow’s copious writing to the self-actualised<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>as “more fully human” versus the “less evolved persons” who are lower down the hierarchy – at the very least, this is a case of bad optics. In his defense, Maslow repeatedly emphasised that he did not believe anyone was innately superior, just that some people made more of their potential. Compton argues that some of the criticism around this is motivated by defensiveness: that some people are apparently stung by the claim that someone can work on their personality and thus make it excellent, just as they can become an excellent gymnast or painter. I disagree – I think there is a case that Maslow’s language unhelpfully conjures a sense of individualistic exceptionalism that would probably feel right at home in a TED summit or posthumanist away-day. Not, I think, what he would have wanted.</p>
<p>Clearly, Maslow’s work is not without flaws. But his reframing of psychology to look at upwards possibilities rather than constantly into pathology sparked a shift that anticipated the positive psychology movement by decades. So his ideas deserve to be better understood, so we can use them more effectively to better ourselves, and so they can be developed and built upon for professionals who are seeking a ladder to help humanity reach greatness.</p>

<p>This review has been published as part of an ongoing “Systems Medicine” thematic series in <em>BMC Systems Biology</em> and gives us an overview of the systems biology tools currently being used to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, Zeller and colleagues state that applying innovative methodologies to increase our understanding of the causes of CVD may result in better assessment of the risk facts involved and pave the way for tailored therapies.</p>
<p>They describe the current tools available, including various cardiac disease models, epidemiological cohort studies (such as the Framingham Heart Study) and publically available data sources. Various proposed methods for integrated data analyses are then discussed, all with general aim of classifying the data available in order to help guide diagnosis, treatment decisions and patient prognosis.  Finally, the authors acknowledge the various challenges and limitations that exist in systems medicine.</p>

<p>Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and is associated with a number of chronic diseases, such as CVD, cancer and stroke. Poor diet is also one of the top three preventable risk factors for CVD as well as being linked to obesity. Due to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, cigarette smoking is negatively associated with obesity.</p>
<p>In this study, published in <em>BMC Public Health</em>, MacLean and colleagues investigated the correlation between smoking and poor diet. They analyzed data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and found that there was a strong linear relationship between smoking and dietary energy density(ED), indicating high levels of consumption of high fat foods such as potato chips, cookies and processed cheese rather than low-ED foods such as leafy vegetables, fruit and pasta.</p>
<p>The authors conclude by stating that this demonstrates that that smoking is associated with poor diet and also that former smokers, although consuming a lower-ED diet than smokers, have a poorer diet compared to people who have not smoked at all.</p>

<p>In general, female doctors earn less and are less likely to be senior authors on academic paper but are also less likely to be sanctioned and have been found to perform better academically and clinically. International medical students also tend to perform less well academically that those from the UK, USA or Canada. What is not known, however, is to what extent gender influences performance.</p>
<p>Here, in an article recently published in <em>BMC Medical Education</em>, Unwin et al looked at the association between gender and performance via the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians (UK) Practical Assessment of Clinical Examination Skills (PACES) examination. Taking the results of 7671 PACES, sex differences in first time pass rates were analyzed for three groups: (1) UK Medical graduates (2) non-UK medical graduates registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) and (3) non-UK medical graduates without GMC registration.</p>
<p>It was found that, for all groups, female doctors were more likely to pass at their first attempt, with the differences between genders particularly significant for non-UK medical graduates that were not registered with GMC. The authors conclude that further investigation is required in order to explain these results and also how examination performance may relate to performance in practice.</p>

Using data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australian (HILDA) survey, they performed a longitudinal analysis using tailored Poisson regression models to estimate the risk of a person falling into poverty with adjustments made for age, employment status, place of residence, marital status and housing tenure.</p>
<p>Population Attributable Risk methodology was then applied to estimate the proportion of poverty  directly attributable to psychological distress, as measured by the Kessler 10 scale.</p>
<p>The researchers found that men, being psychological distressed increased their risk of falling into income poverty by 1.68 and multidimensional poverty (taking into account income, health status and education attainment) by 3.40. For women, having high psychological distress increased the risk of multidimensional poverty by 2.15. Based on this Is evidence, they conclude that falling into poverty has been an overlooked cost of poor mental health.</p>

<p>It is thought that some people will suck their fingers or thumbs (digit sucking) when they are suffering from anxiety or another emotional problem. In this study, published in <em>BMC Oral Health</em>, a team of researchers investigated whether digit sucking is an indicator not only of general anxiety but also anxiety associated with dental issues, for example caries in a group of children in Nigeria.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is digit sucking  an indicator of both general anxiety and anxiety associated with dental issues?</p></blockquote>
<p>The study used data of children aged between 6 and 12 taken as part of a larger household survey. General anxiety levels were measured using the Revised Child Manifest Anxiety Scale and dental anxiety was measured using the Dental Subscale of the Child Fear Survey Schedule. Logistic regression was used to determine whether general anxiety or dental anxiety could be predicted according to whether someone was sucking their fingers and/or thumbs. The researchers used the same analysis to see whether general anxiety and dental anxiety could predict whether a child had caries and the general state of their oral health.</p>
<p>Results showed that, although digit sucking is not a significant predictor of dental anxiety and general anxiety, children with high general anxiety and high dental anxiety are more likely to have caries and good oral hygiene respectively.</p>

<p>Three years ago, in a time before Trump and Brexit and <em>Yanny and Laurel,</em> <a href="http://meatybeefy.tumblr.com/post/147701310172/behind-the-dress-the-untold-story-of-thedress">someone posted an overexposed photograph of a black and blue striped dress on Tumblr</a>. Soon millions of people had seen it and started arguing about it. The reason? It quickly became apparent that about half of us – more often women and older people – perceive the dress, not as black and blue, but white and gold.</p>
<p>In a neat example of real life echoing a classic psychology experiment (I’m referring to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p4403ed">Asch</a>), #thedress was enough to make you think your friends were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting">gas lighting</a> you – how could it be that you and they were looking at the exact same picture and yet seeing entirely different things?</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_33879" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="440px-Grey_square_optical_illusion.svg" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-33879" data-attachment-id="33879" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="440px-Grey_square_optical_illusion.svg" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png?w=440" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png" data-orig-size="440,340" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/16/three-years-of-research-into-thedress-digested-a-lesson-in-humility-for-perceptual-science/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg/" height="232" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/440px-grey_square_optical_illusion-svg.png?w=300&amp;h=232" width="300" />The squares marked A and B are actually the same shade of grey, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion">Wikipedia</a></figure>
<p>Of course there are many optical illusions, including others that involve colour (see, for example, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion">checker shadow</a>” illusion, pictured right). What was special about #thedress was that it triggered a bimodal split in perceptual experience among the population. Also, many illusions trigger a fluctuating percept, but once someone perceives the dress one way, they usually keep seeing it that way.</p>
<p>Viral hits happen overnight. Science is slow, but it’s catching up. With the passing of the years, numerous studies into #thedress have now been published – 23 according to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422223">new review</a>. Here we present you with a fascinating digest of what’s been discovered so far about the famous frock – researchers have made progress, certainly, yet much remains mysterious, making this a humbling experience for perceptual science.</p>
<p><span id="more-33874"></span></p>
<p><strong>A big part of how you see the dress has to do with a process called colour constancy</strong></p>
<p>Before any studies had been published, psychologists and vision experts were quick to explain that the #thedress illusion is related to a process called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy">colour constancy</a>” whereby your brain takes environmental lighting effects (which are ambiguous in #thedress photo), and your own past experiences, into account when interpreting the precise wavelengths it believes are being reflected off a surface. The same automatic adjustment process allows us to recognise grass as green whatever the weather or time of day. The process sometimes goes wrong, though, like when the blue top you bought at the clothes store turns out to be black when you get home.</p>
<p><strong>How you see the dress depends partly on what inferences you make about the lighting</strong></p>

A team led by Rosa Lafer-Sousa found this to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921196/#SD2">the case</a>. When they presented the dress against an obviously cool, blue-ish background (see image, left), most people saw it as white and gold, but when they presented it against a warm, yellowish background (right), most saw it as black and blue<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921196/#SD2"><img alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-17 at 08.39.21" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-33911" data-attachment-id="33911" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2018-05-17 at 08.39.21" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png?w=211" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png?w=211" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png" data-orig-size="211,246" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/16/three-years-of-research-into-thedress-digested-a-lesson-in-humility-for-perceptual-science/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21/" height="150" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-08-39-21.png?w=129&amp;h=150" width="129" /></a>.</p>
<p>The researchers Andrey Chetverikov and Ivan Ivanchei later developed this idea by showing that people’s perception of the dress are <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0301006616643664">related to their assumptions about the light source in the original photograph</a>. In their survey, people who saw the dress as black and blue were twice as likely as the white and gold group to believe that the dress is illuminated from the front, as if with a flash. Conversely, white and gold perceivers were more likely to believe there was a window behind the dress (implying under exposure).</p>
<p>In the survey, time of day seemed to make a modest difference to these assumptions, but still, the fundamental reasons why we come to make different inferences about the lighting remains largely unknown. In their <a href="http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-archivos-sociedad-espanola-oftalmologia-english-496-resumen-which-are-colors-dress-review-S2173579418300239">new review</a> of research into #thedress, published in <em>Archivos de la Sociedad Española de Oftalmología</em>, ophthalmologist Julio González Martín-Moro and his colleagues state that the “dichotomic behaviour of this optical illusion is surprising and leads us to consider two different versions of the software in charge of maintaining chromatic [colour] constancy.”</p>
<p><strong>Your initial impression of the dress are likely to stick</strong></p>

This stubbornness of the percept could be because our brains continue to make the same assumptions about the scene, but alternatively it might be what Leila Drissi Daoudi and her colleagues describe as an example of “one shot learning”.</p>
<p><a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2613309">To test this, they manipulated naive participants’ perception of the dress by using occluders to block out the background</a> – when they used black occluders (see above), this induced the perception of the dress as white and gold in nearly everyone; when they used white occluders, the opposite was true. Crucially, when the researchers took the occluders away, very few participants experienced any change in their perception of the dress’ colours. “There seems to be a one-shot learning mechanism in play, which leads to an imprinting of the color perceived”, the researchers wrote, although they were unable to explain what (without the use of occluders) induces the initial and lasting perception – they tested the location of people’s initial eye movements to the dress, but this made no difference.</p>
<p><strong>The brains of gold/white perceivers are engaged in more interpretive processing</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the idea that our inferences about the background lighting are important to #thedress illusion, the results from a brain imaging study that was published in 2015 suggested that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/27/first-brain-scan-study-to-feature-that-dress/">people who see the dress as white and gold may be engaged in more “top down” interpretive processing, albeit that this processing leads to a misleading perception</a>. The researchers scanned the brains of volunteers while they looked at the dress and found that those who perceived it as white and gold exhibited more neural activity in a raft of brain areas, including in frontal, parietal (near the crown of the head) and temporal (near the ears) regions.</p>
<p>What this brain scan study couldn’t answer is whether the extra neural processing is the cause or consequence of the gold/white perceptual experience of the dress. However, a survey of patients with multiple sclerosis suggested the neural activity may be causal. Researchers in Italy found that <a href="https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211-0348(16)30022-0/pdf">with greater progression of the disease, people were more likely to perceive the dress as blue and black</a>. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because greater impairment of colour processing regions in the cortex led to “a less demanding black and blue vision of The Dress in more advanced MS”.</p>
<p><strong>Differences in the eye may also account for the illusion</strong></p>
<p>The way we perceive the dress might not all be about colour constancy and top-down brain processing. A 2016 study found that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161090">“front end” factors might also be relevant</a>. Specifically, the researchers found that  “macular pigment optical density” was higher in volunteers who saw the dress as white and gold. Macular pigment is found in the retina and a greater density increases the amount of short wavelength light that is absorbed by the eye. “Our results indicate that early-stage optical, retinal and neural factors influence perception of the Dress”, the researchers said. Consistent with this, <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/viewmedia.cfm?uri=josaa-33-3-A137&amp;seq=0&amp;html=true">another study</a> found that white and gold perceivers tended to have smaller pupils potentially limiting the amount of light that falls on the retina, thus suggesting another early stage influence upon the perception of the dress.</p>
<p><strong>Past experience seems to be more important than genetics</strong></p>
<p>Last year, researchers in London and Cambridge published <a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2599740">the first twin study</a> into how people perceive the dress. By comparing the similarities in perception between identical and non-identical twins, they estimated that around 34 per cent of the variance in people’s perception is due to genetic differences, while 66 per cent is due to environmental factors (i.e. including learning and past experience). This was a small study, however, and the findings are tentative. Omar Mahroo and his colleagues concluded that the environmental factors “…may include prior lifetime experience to different spectral and luminance environments, shaping retinal and higher neuronal processing, and the development and evolution of [how we come to name] object colors in various contexts.”</p>
<p>In other words, there are lots of possibilities for how experience shapes our varied perceptions of colour in ambiguous scenes, all of which remain to be studied. We also know nothing about how common visual deficits, such as colour blindness and cataracts, interact with the perception of #thedress.</p>
<p><strong>A lesson in humility</strong></p>
<p>Of all the senses, vision is the one that’s been studied most intensively by psychologists and neuroscientists. Despite this, there are no tests available that would allow even the best experts in the land to predict whether you will see the dress as black and blue or white and gold. And while we have some good ideas about the processes that are involved in #thedress illusion, so much remains mysterious about what leads each of us to view it one way or the other.</p>
<p>At the end of their review, González Martín-Moro and his colleagues come to a stark <a href="http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-archivos-sociedad-espanola-oftalmologia-english-496-resumen-which-are-colors-dress-review-S2173579418300239">conclusion:</a> “…the fact is that researchers have failed to come up with a theory that can satisfactorily explain the dichotomic behaviour of the population when viewing said optical illusion.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/sun-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is generally understood that vitamin D plays a role in exerting health benefits related to bone strength and condition. However, the significance of that role is not well understood. A number of misconceptions about vitamin D may have contributed to the ambiguity and should be addressed.</p>
<p>First, vitamin D is not really a vitamin. Vitamins are essential nutrients that the human body is incapable of producing. As such, vitamins must be obtained through diet. Vitamin D, on the other hand, is produced in mammalian skin upon exposure to UV rays from the sun.</p>
<p>Secondly, vitamin D is not <em>directly</em> responsible for exerting health benefits related to bone strength. Instead, vitamin D is converted to a pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in the liver. This pre-hormone circulates in the blood and is measured to determine the vitamin D status of an individual. However, it (like vitamin D) is inactive under normal biological conditions. Conversion of the pre-hormone to the active hormone (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) takes place in the kidney. The biological effects of the active hormone (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) have been demonstrated at a number of cell and tissue sites, and its activity is strongly linked to calcium maintenance.</p>
<p>Thirdly, many consumers and healthcare providers are either unaware or simply fail to acknowledge that vitamin D status (when determined via measurements of serum levels of the pre-hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D) does not necessarily correlate to the same health outcomes in all individuals. This underappreciated detail about vitamin D status was explored in depth in <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12919-018-0102-4?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Proceedings-Public_Health-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_MAY2018_Vitamin_D_paradox_Black_Americans">The vitamin D paradox in Black Americans: a systems-based approach to investigating clinical practice, research, and public health – expert panel meeting report. </a><u><br />
</u></p>
<h3><strong>How does the relationship between vitamin D status and bone health differ in various segments of the population? </strong></h3>
<p>Studies show that low measures of vitamin D status correlate to increased risk of osteopenia and fractures in White and Mexican-Americans, but measures of vitamin D status do not correlate to the same health outcomes in Black Americans. Despite markedly low measures of vitamin D status in Black Americans, the incidence of falls, fractures, or osteopenia are significantly lower compared to White American counterparts with similar vitamin D status. The <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12919-018-0102-4"><em>BMC Proceedings</em> report</a> describes discussions amongst expert panelists that revealed that Black Americans gain no skeletal benefits from high doses of vitamin D supplementation; and high levels of the current marker for vitamin D status are almost certain to result in adverse effects in this population.</p>
<h3><strong>Should Black Americans worry about low measures of vitamin D status?</strong></h3>
<p>There are many factors that affect vitamin D status and skeletal health in Black Americans. Data presented in the <em>BMC Proceedings</em> report shows that adiposity, skin pigmentation, genetics, and environment all contribute to differences in vitamin D status with respect to skeletal health in Black Americans vs. White Americans; but no one factor could fully explain the significance of low measures of vitamin D status with respect to skeletal health in Black Americans. A better understanding of these factors may be key to understanding mechanisms for improving bone health in all populations.</p>
<h3><strong>Where do we go from here?  </strong></h3>
<p>Consumers and healthcare providers should appreciate the potential for adverse effects following over-supplementation with high doses of vitamin D in some individuals. While threshold values (deficient lower levels vs. safe upper levels) for individuals require further refinement, outcomes presented in the <em>BMC Proceedings</em> report suggest that the Recommended Daily Allowance values (400-600 IU/day) should be appropriate for most healthy populations.</p>
<p>Health scientists should appreciate the need to better understand the role of vitamin D and its significance in various segments of the population that are commonly underrepresented in clinical studies. A larger forum or workshop on the topic may help to stimulate more research on vitamin D with respect to bone health as well as implications beyond bone health.</p>

<p>Social class may seem different today than in the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century. Former British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott’s comment in 1997 that “we are all middle class now” had a ring of truth, given that most people in the West have access to what once were luxuries, such as running water, in-house entertainment, and eye-catching brands. But this is something of an illusion, according to Cardiff University’s Antony Manstead, who shows <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12251">in the <i>British Journal of Social Psychology </i></a>(open access)<i> </i>how class is still written into our psychology, and the implications this has for how we behave and our wellbeing.</p>
<p><span id="more-33886"></span></p>
<p>First, Manstead presents evidence that shows socio-economic status (based on income and educational attainment – not identical with class, but an overlapping concept that’s used in much of the relevant research) remains as important to people’s identity as factors like gender or ethnicity. This is truer for wealthier people than lower earners suggesting some eroding of a positive working-class identity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Apart from obvious class markers like clothing, our behaviour is also still a giveaway: lab studies show that working-class people are more likely to employ eye-contact, laughter and head nods when interacting with others, compared to a more disengaged non-verbal style from the middle/upper classes. And class can be read at greater than chance levels even from stimuli as basic as Facebook photographs or seven words of speech. So we feel a certain class, and others can detect that class fairly easily.</p>
<p>What are the psychological consequences of this awareness of social class? Manstead describes how working class people are more likely to consider the world as a mass of forces and risks to contend with and accommodate, which manifests in various ways including their measurably higher levels of vigilance and a heightened threat detection system. This makes sense if you lack some of the resources (e.g. rich parents) that can buffer you from catastrophe, but may also reflect limiting beliefs. Meanwhile, middle/upper-class people are more motivated by internal states and personal goals. They are more solipsistic, on average: the issue is how they should shape the world, not how it pushes back on them. This is indicated by a higher sense of perceived control, and more confidence that good things happen to people due to their choices.</p>
<p>For working class people, this approach to the world has personal downstream consequences, including a higher degree of fatalism towards serious life outcomes, such as contracting HIV. These attitudes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>may also contribute to greater illness susceptibility: one study found that people exposed to a cold or flu virus and held in quarantine were more likely to become ill if they considered themselves as a lower status social class, even while controlling for their actual class and levels of wealth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the costs of the middle and upper-class approach seem to be externalised on the society at large. Put bluntly, the research that Manstead amasses suggests that those with of a higher socioeconomic class are less empathic, have more favourable attitudes towards greed, and are more likely to lie in negotiations. Merely thinking about yourself as higher up the status ladder leads to more selfishness. One can see how a solipsistic view could lead to these attitudes. In contrast, the contextual, real-world focus of lower-class people leads to empathy and a greater ability to see how external events may be shaping the emotions of other people. In addition, they have a greater degree of interdependent relationships and higher levels of social engagement.</p>
<p>One would think social mobility might bridge this psychological gap between the classes, sliding more socially-minded people into positions of influence. Higher education is meant to be one of the engines of social mobility, but people from lower social classes are more likely to report feeling like a fish out of water at university, or to perceive the opportunities available to them as second-rate. Although it ought to be possible to address these anxieties about the unfamiliar, research suggests that the culture of universities may not be designed with the working classes in mind. University deans and administrators asked to list qualities of their culture tended to endorse words more about independence – the natural state of the solipsistic upper-class person, charting their course into the future – than interdependence, which tends to be a particular priority for first-generation university goers, looking to give back to their community. Manstead notes that these same cultural factors are also likely to be present in many workforces and professions.</p>
<p>So “the system” has a psychological component that helps maintain the status quo. Yet there is an appetite for change: in surveys of nationally representative samples, including the wealthy, people repeatedly express a preference for a more equal society. There is even some evidence that greater equality can flip some of the negative trends described about the middle and upper class, leading them to be more, rather than less generous in some economic tasks (perhaps because they feel less entitlement and sense of threat in a more equal society). And the good news is that studies show that giving people an accurate picture of their socioeconomic standing, or telling them that inequality is rising, leads them to being more receptive to change.</p>

The figure above shows the electrode implantation procedure for PD, where a stimulating electrode is placed in either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subthalamic_nucleus" target="_blank">subthalamic nucleus</a>, (STN), a tiny collection of neurons within the basal ganglia circuit, or in the internal segment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a>, another structure in the basal ganglia (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMct1208070" target="_blank">Okun, 2012</a>). DBS of the STN is more common, and more often a source of disturbing non-motor side effects.<br /><br />In brief, DBS of the STN alters neural activity patterns in complex cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical networks (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19804831" target="_blank">McIntyre &amp; Hahn, 2010</a>).<br /><br />DBS surgery may be recommended for some patients in whom dopamine (DA) replacement therapy has become ineffective, usually after a few years. DA medications include the classic DA precursor L-DOPA, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_agonist" target="_blank">DA agonists</a> such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and  bromocriptine. But unfortunately, impulse control disorders (ICDs, e.g., compulsive shopping, excessive gambling, binge eating, and compulsive sexual behavior) occur in about 17% of PD patients on DA agonists (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229895" target="_blank">Voon et al., 2017</a>).<br /><br />There are many first-person accounts from PD patients who describe uncharacteristic and embarrassing behavior after taking DA agonists, like this grandpa who started seeing prostitutes for the first time in his life:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/mar/31/familyandrelationships" target="_blank">'I have become an embarrassment'</a> </b></span><br /><br /><b>For most of his life John Smithers was a respected family man who ran a  successful business.

I was a magistrate for 25 years, and worked hard to feed my children and build up the family business.

Over the last two decades I have spent a fortune on prostitutes and lost two wives. I have made irrational business decisions that took me to the point of bankruptcy.

A recent paper included a first-person account of altered personality and a sense of self-estrangement in a 46 year old woman undergoing STN DBS for PD (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29657181" target="_blank">Gilbert &amp; Viaña, 2018</a>): <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>The patient reported a persistent state of self-perceived changes  following implantation. More than one year after surgery, her narratives  explicitly refer to a persistent perception of strangeness and  alteration of her concept of self. For instance, she reported: </span><br /><blockquote class="disp-quote"><span>"<i>can't be the real me anymore—I can't  pretend . . . I think that I felt that the person that I have been  [since the intervention] was somehow observing somebody else, but it  wasn't me. . . . I feel like I am who I am now. But it's not the me that  went into the surgery that time. . . . My family say they grieve for  the old [me]. . . .</i>"</span></blockquote></blockquote><br />Many of her quotes are striking in their similarity to behaviors that occur in the <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/manic-episode/" target="_blank">manic phase</a> of bipolar disorder {<u>loss of control, grandiosity</u>}: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span><i><span style="color: red;"><b>The patient also reported developing severe postoperative impulsivity</b></span>:  "I cannot control the impulse to go off if I'm angry." In parallel,  while describing a sense of loss of control over some impulsions, she  has also recognized that <span style="color: red;"><b>DBS gave her increased feelings of strength</b></span>: "I  never had felt this lack of power or this giving of power—until I had  deep brain stimulation.</i>" </span></blockquote><br />{also <u>uncharacteristic sexual urges and hypersexuality; excessively energetic; compulsive shopping</u>}:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span>...she experienced radically enhanced capacities, in the form of increased<span style="color: red;"><b> uncontrollable sexual urges</b></span>:  </span><br /><blockquote class="disp-quote"><span>"<span style="color: red;"><b><i>I know this is a bit embarrassing. But  I had 35 staples in my head, and we made love in the hospital bathroom  and that wasn't just me.

She also took up painting and perceived the world in a more vibrant, colorful way {which resembles narratives of persons experiencing manic episodes}:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span><i>"I don't know, all the senses came alive. I wanted to listen to Paul  Kelly and all of my favorite music really loud in the toilet. And you  know, also everything was colourful. . . . Well, since brain surgery I  can. I didn't bother before. I can see the light . . . the light that is  underlying every masterpiece in  photography. . . . I've seen it like I've never seen it before . . . <span style="color: red;"><b>I  am a totally different person. I like it that I love photography and  music and colourful clothes, but where is the old me now?</b></span>"</i></span></blockquote><br />However, she appears to display more insight into her altered behavior than {most} people in the midst of bipolar mania. Perhaps her reality monitoring abilities are more intact? Or it's because her symptoms wax and wane.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span> But like in many manic individuals, she did not want this feeling to stop:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i><span>"I went to the psychiatrist, and he said, <span style="color: red;"><b>'Right, well, this is bordering  on mania</b></span></span> </i><b>[NOTE: that is an understatement]</b><i>,<span> you need to turn the settings right down to manage it.' <span style="color: red;"><b>I  said to him, 'Please don't, this is not over the top—this is just joy.' </b></span>"</span></i></blockquote><br />I think this line of research <span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span> studying individuals with Parkinson's who have impulse control disorders due to DA replacement or DBS <span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span>  can provide insight into bipolar mania. Certainly, drugs that act as antagonists at multiple DA receptor subtypes (typical and atypical antipsychotics) are used in the management of bipolar disorder.<br /><br />Patient narratives are also informative in this regard, and provide critical information for individuals considering various types of therapies for PD. In this paper, the patient was not informed by the medical team that there could be undesirable psychiatric side effects. She has taken legal action against the lead neurosurgeon, and the proceedings were ongoing when the article was written.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: purple;"><b>ADDENDUM (May 14 2018): </b>The study was conducted in accordance with Human Research  Ethics Committee regulations.

A few years ago, Richard Miller of the University of Michigan had a serious dilemma: He discovered a former researcher in his lab was doing research somewhere else. Normally, that would be fine — except this research had admitted to committing misconduct in Miller’s lab. Should he tell the researcher’s new employer?

<p>Studies of identical and non-identical twins indicate that our self-esteem is influenced by the genes we inherited from our parents, but also, and perhaps slightly more so, by environmental factors. And according to a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-06114-001">new study</a> in <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, these environmental influences started playing a lasting role very early in life.</p>
<p>Ulrich Orth at the University of Bern has reported evidence that, on average, the higher the quality of a person’s home environment when they were aged between 0 and 6 years – based on warm and responsive parenting; cognitive stimulation; and a safe, organised physical environment – the higher their self-esteem many years later in adulthood.</p>
<p><span id="more-33860"></span></p>
<p>The data come from nearly 9,000 individuals, born between 1970 and 2001, whose mothers had enrolled in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth that started in the US in 1979.</p>
<p>Orth analysed the biennial interviews with the mothers that took place in their homes when their children – the participants in this study – were aged 0 to 6. This provided the measure of the quality of the participants’ early childhood home environment in terms of parental warmth and responsiveness, cognitive stimulation and the safety and organisation of the home. Orth also noted the quality of the relationship between mother and father during this period; the presence or not of the father; maternal depression; and family poverty.</p>
<p>Measures of the participants’ self-esteem started when they were aged just 8 and continued biennially until they were 27. The survey researchers used a measure designed for children until the participants were age 14, and thereafter switched to the well-known Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale.</p>
<p>The critical finding is that the quality of the home environment between the ages of 0 to 6 correlated significantly with participants’ self-reported self-esteem in later childhood, and even with their self-esteem into adulthood, although the association weakened over time. “The findings suggest that the home environment is a key factor in early childhood that influences the long-term development of self-esteem”, Orth said.</p>
<p>Other childhood environmental factors besides the quality of the home environment were also associated with later self-esteem. Maternal depression (associated with lower self-esteem) and better quality of parents’ relationship (associated with higher self-esteem) correlated with participants’ self-esteem in later childhood, but these correlations approached zero over the longer-term into adulthood.</p>
<p>In contrast, the families’ poverty (associated with lower self-esteem) and, to a lesser extent, the presence of the father (associated with higher self-esteem) continued to correlate with later self-esteem through to age 27.</p>
<p>When factoring out quality of the home environment, the association between these other childhood factors (maternal depression, parents’ relationship, poverty, and father’s presence) and participants’ later self-esteem was weakened substantially (but not entirely eradicated) suggesting that these other factors are tied to later self-esteem largely via their influence on the quality of the home environment.</p>
<p>Orth added a note of caution in relation to the findings for fathers’ presence. The data do not say anything about homosexual same-sex parents and children’s later self-esteem because such a family situation was too rare in the survey. It’s possible, he says, that the presence of any second parent – not necessarily a father – would have the same associations with later, higher self-esteem. In any case, the association between father’s presence and later self-esteem, though statistically significant, was only very small (over the long term, the effect sizes for poverty and especially for quality of the home environment were larger).</p>
<p>Why should the early family environment have such enduring associations with later self-esteem? Orth believes it is because early child-parent interactions affect a person’s pre-conscious representations of who they are and their self worth, eventually becoming deeply embodied in their self concept.</p>
<p>Orth says his findings have important practical implications because they suggest that interventions designed to enhance the quality of the early home environment could have lasting benefits for a child’s self-esteem. The way that the quality of the home environment mediated the role of other factors, like poverty, is particularly relevant. This suggests, Orth explains, that “…the negative effects of poverty on children’s self-esteem could be prevented, or at least reduced, by interventions that improve the quality of the home environment in families that are in poverty.”</p>
<p>As with all survey research of this kind, it’s important to remember that causality has not been demonstrated conclusively between the earlier measured factors and later self-esteem – it’s possible unknown factors are at play. Most obviously, a study of this kind cannot account for the role played by genes shared between parents and their children.</p>
<p>Perhaps a deeper question is whether higher self-esteem is a desirable outcome at all. There was a time when many psychologists and social reformers believed increasing the average self-esteem of a community would open the doors to a range of welcome outcomes, from superior mental health to career success. However, we know today that the benefits of greater self-esteem are <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1529-1006.01431?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed">quite modest</a>, mostly centred on feeling happier and having more initiative, and that excessive self-esteem can even be problematic in some cases, especially if it slides into narcissism.</p>

<p><em>By Corey Moran</em></p>
<p>“Mens et Manus” a phrase coined years ago, was adopted by one of the nation’s most prestigious and distinguished Universities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Very simply it translates as “Mind and Hand”. Yet this seemingly simple statement harbors a rather impactful notion, one that was a drastic departure from the status quo of the time. Education at its core should not be for the sole sake of scholarly enlightenment but rather have tangible implications; enabling discoveries and advancements in practical knowledge that directly impact society in a positive way. </p>
<p>A curious, talented high school student embodies the very essence of these ideals. In just a few short months she will be joining MIT’s ranks, quickly becoming an example of what it means to practice “Mind and Hand”. </p>
<p>For most, reminiscing about high school evokes flashbacks of typical milestones and events that were important to the teenage versions of ourselves. The feeling of elation after obtaining a driver’s license and the smidgen of freedom that comes with it. Laughing with friends at Friday night football games. Prom in all of its glory and teenage awkwardness. The stress and anxiety accompanying college applications.</p>
<p>For Claudia Cabral, a senior at Suncoast Community High School and scientist in the making, the snapshot of her high school journey includes some rather extraordinary experiences and accomplishments.   </p>
<p>Those that are fortunate enough to know Claudia describe her as bright, driven, personable, a savvy coder and most importantly cognizant and caring of the world around her. While Claudia’s exceptional grades and demanding course load alone are clear indications of her intelligence and determination, it’s what she does in her free time that truly showcases her passions and commitment to making a difference. </p>
<p>In addition to a busy academic schedule, Claudia is president of not one but two charitable organizations focusing on local and extended community outreach. The first named “Hugs and Kisses Club” raises money to assist local cancer patients and the second, which she is also the founder, named “Two Feet Club” tackles a diverse set of social issues in creative ways. Through the combined efforts of these two organizations, Claudia has raised money and promoted awareness for issues like foster care, Syrian refugees, victims of domestic violence and people with mental disabilities to name a few. Even at her young age, the drive to make a positive impact in her community is evident, a sentiment she describes as “just a part of who I am.” </p>
<p>This past November Claudia was recognized as a “Future Lady of Grace” by the Bethesda Hospital Foundation for her outstanding work in philanthropy. Due to her remarkable accomplishments and merit, Claudia was selected as 1 of only 6 interns to participate in the 2017 High School Summer Research Program at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI). </p>
<p>Each summer MPFI offers aspiring, young scientists an immersive laboratory experience where local students have the opportunity to work side-by-side with world class neuroscientists. As a part of the six-week internship, students along with their mentors, design and execute a high-level research project that culminates into a presentation of their work at the end of the summer. Interns gain a first-hand insight into brain structure and function, scientific collaboration and the cutting-edge techniques and advanced imaging technologies that MPFI scientists use every day. </p>
<p>This immersive program at MPFI wouldn’t be possible without the generous support and funding from the J.M Rubin Foundation, the Celia Lipton Farris and Victor W. Farris Foundation, and the Gertrude E. Skelly Charitable Foundation which support students in their exploration of science and help to cultivate the next generation of future scientists.</p>
<p>After participating in the MPFI internship, students continue their education at some of the most elite universities, further developing their skills in outstanding STEM programs across the nation.   </p>
<p>Dr. David Fitzpatrick, CEO and Scientific Director of MPFI thoughtfully remarked that “I don’t believe that the brief few months working in the labs at MPFI are the main reason our interns were accepted to such prestigious universities, the students were already exceptional to begin with. We just know how to pick them.”</p>
<p>Poised and articulate, Claudia delivered an engaging final presentation on her work in the Schummers’ lab studying the phenomenon called visual contrast adaptation. This process describes the brain’s ability to acclimate to new surroundings and respond quickly to any changes in it. Although studied previously, the exact mechanisms that drive this process are unknown. Through her work, Claudia both engineered a computational algorithm that could precisely model the events as well as proposed astrocytes as being the cell type responsible. </p>
<p>In that moment, detailing the intricacies of relevant scientific theories, obstacles encountered and innovative solutions developed, it would be hard to think of Claudia simply as a high school student and not a seasoned graduate level researcher. </p>
<p>A common thread linking Claudia’s collegiate future, her internship and the ideals she advocates every day, is another visionary. Alexander W. Dreyfoos a graduate of MIT, board member of MPFI and unwavering supporter of the arts and sciences, champions the very same principles that Claudia does. </p>
<p>“The core values of MPFI align very closely to my own and the ideals of MIT that resonated with me while studying there. I have kept them with me ever since.” -Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Chairman of the Dreyfoos Group.</p>
<p>Moving forward with her education at MIT and beyond, Claudia sees herself as a biomedical engineer and neuroscientist, innovating technology to help treat people with movement disorders like Parkinson’s, ALS and essential tremor. Staying true to her philanthropic side she hopes to continue public outreach, engaging in speaking and fundraising events, giving back to her local communities and abroad. There is no one better suited than Claudia to take up the mantle of the simple but profound motto “Mens et Manus”.</p>

A new paper in ACS Chemical Neuroscience pulls no punches in claiming that most of what we know about the neuroscience of learning is wrong: Dendritic Learning as a Paradigm Shift in Brain Learning



According to authors Shira Sardi and colleagues, the prevailing view which is that learning takes place in the synapses is mistaken. Instead, they say, 'dendritic learning' is how brain cells really store information.

If a neuron is a tree, the dendrites are the branches, while the synapses

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation is the spice of life; it brings out the complex flavors of our ideas and elevates them to new heights. Scientific research becomes stagnant without it, as does just about every other profession. To put it plainly, innovative breakthroughs have the potential to challenge the way we think and live. Within the past few years, we have witnessed significant paradigm shifts within life science research thanks to breakthroughs from several sources such as Silicon Valley tech startups, biotech companies, CROs, academic labs, and government institutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To illustrate, some providers in our network now offer virtual reality services for highly-advanced 3D molecular visualization, while others provide blockchain technology to help you protect your IP (intellectual property)  and facilitate secure data storage and transfer. These providers and many more can be found on Science Exchange — offering services ranging from artificial intelligence platforms that help scientists make better drug efficacy predictions early in the research cycle, to highly inventive 3D organoid models that recapitulate human pathology in vitro. As such, we have witnessed many technologies of the future become the reality of today. Science Exchange has been and will always be ready to give you access to innovative technologies before they become mainstream.</span></p>

Popular culture has depicted characters with the disease in films such as ‘Fight Club’ and ‘A Beautiful Mind’. But what is the disease really?</p>
<blockquote><p>There are records since at least the emergence of the written alphabet, that describe signs and symptoms which today would be called schizophrenia.</p></blockquote>
<p>For starters, schizophrenia is extremely complex and manifests itself in myriad ways. It is a psychiatric disorder that primarily affects one of the most, if not the most, important organs in our body: the brain. In the clinic, a presentation of the so-called positive symptoms: hallucinations and delusions  along with negative symptoms: apathy and depression for a period lasting anywhere from one to six months tends to be classified under the category of Schizophrenia.</p>
<p>There are records since at least the emergence of the written alphabet, that describe signs and symptoms which today would be called schizophrenia. Furthermore, these records exist in cultures that have been separated by geography and time. This is one of the defining features of the disease – a global lifetime prevalence of 1% that does not depend on where or when one is born.</p>
<h3><strong>A stable global prevalence</strong></h3>
<p>Manifestation of this disease across cultures and millenia makes one wonder why natural selection, seems to neither eliminate nor reduce the prevalance of the disease. The disease usually manifests  in late adolescence to early 20’s, the prime period of reproduction. Yet despite the observation of reduced fecundity amongst patients, the disease persists.</p>
<p>While many hypotheses have been suggested to explain the persistence of the disease, the most prominent is Timothy J. Crow’s ‘evolutionary hypothesis’, put forward more than twenty years ago.  This hypothesis stipulates that the disease is a by-product of the evolution of the human mind – <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996497001102">that language and psychosis are connected</a>. This was initially very difficult to test as there was no way to determine when language nor psychosis manifested first in the human lineage.</p>
<p>However, the sequencing of the entire human genome opened many frontiers, including the possibility of tracing evolutionary events that shaped humans. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/523">Recent work</a> has traced the evolution of DNA methylation on the human genome since the divergence from the common ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans. Such regions of the human genome, with variable methylation between humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans are termed as differentially methylated regions or DMRs for short.</p>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10170" height="466" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/figure-1-1024x746.png" width="640" />
<h3><strong>Examining DMRs for Schizophrenia associated SNPs</strong></h3>
<p>In our work, published in <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em></a>, we build upon the results of these DMRs. We systematically investigated whether these regions are enriched for individual nucleotides on the human genome, otherwise known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs have been  associated with Schizophrenia and twelve other traits through previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our findings indicate that the human DMRs but not Neanderthal or Denisovan DMRs harbour more SNPs associated with Schizophrenia than can be expected by chance alone.</p>
<p>An important caveat to keep in mind is the fact that GWAS studies only help to determine regions of the human genome (SNPs) <em>associated</em> with a trait/disease and seldom to variants that are <em>causative</em>. More often than not, the results from GWAS instead point to markers involved in various developmental pathways or regions that regulate the complex orchestra of protein formation in the human body. Thus even when we say schizophrenia associated SNPs, the SNPs in and of themselves are merely associated and not causative of the disease.</p>
<p>The lack of enrichment of Neanderthal or Denisovan DMRs for SNPs associated with Schizophrenia could be interpreted in at least two different ways. The first and obvious interpretation is that the regions delineating methylation differences in our evolutionarily extinct cousins did not harbour more genetic variants associated with schizophrenia than expected by chance. This might make us tempted to believe that they may have been devoid of symptoms classified as schizophrenia.</p>
<blockquote><p>We show that regions of the human genome whose methylation has changed specifically in the human lineage, over evolutionary time, are enriched for schizophrenia associated SNPs.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, such an interpretation is potentially misleading due to limitations in the methodology and materials for analyses. The genetic variants we analysed have been mapped to the human genome. However we do not know if the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes possess any genetic variants associated with schizophrenia. A crude way to solve this issue would be to try an alignment of the genome sequences of humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans and determine sequence similarity in the regions associated with schizophrenia, but this is easier said than done.</p>
<p>The second interpretation would be that the methylation changes that occurred in the human lineage since the divergence from Neanderthals and Denisovans, at least in-part have co-occurred in genomic regions harbouring schizophrenia risk variants. This interpretation has the support of other genetic studies that looked at  only the underlying human genome sequence, i.e the DNA, that have been under <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/5/1148/1134520">selective pressure</a> for enrichment of Schizophrenia associated SNPs.</p>
<p>Our results on these DMRs , together with other <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(15)00855-0/abstract">genetic studies</a> are now beginning to lend support to the evolutionary hypothesis of schizophrenia formulated by TJ Crow. We show that regions of the human genome whose methylation has changed specifically in the human lineage, over evolutionary time, are enriched for schizophrenia associated SNPs.</p>
<p>Since methylation is oftentimes influenced by the environment, our results may also suggest the environments experienced by our ancestors might have contributed to the variable methylation in genomic regions associated with schizophrenia. We are still a long way off from proving language and psychosis are linked. However, we and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169227">others</a> have now shown that at a group-level, recent evolution may in part have made us vulnerable to schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The idea that stress increases the risk of breast cancer is a persistent one, despite a number of major large-scale findings to the contrary. “Over the past 40 years, women have been exposed to strong messages about the importance of ‘thinking positively’ and reducing stress in their lives, which can add to the burden of guilt in those who develop cancer, who feel they have somehow failed”, note the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pon.4740">new prospective study</a> of women in Australia, published in <i>Psycho-Oncology</i>. Their findings suggest that neither acute nor chronic stressors recorded over a three-year period influenced the likelihood that a woman with a strong family history of breast cancer would develop the disease over the next three years.</p>
<p>“Our results, based on rigorous methodology, add to the growing literature providing reassurance to women at increased risk of breast cancer, who are concerned that the (often unavoidable) stressors in their lives may increase their risk of breast cancer”, the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-33851"></span></p>
<p>The team led by Phyllis Butow at the University of Sydney recruited 2,739 women from 990 families via a centre for research into familial breast cancer. Some of these women had genes that are known to increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer whereas the others did not, although there was an unusually high number of breast cancer cases in their family. At the start of the study, none of the women had ever been diagnosed with the disease.</p>
<p>On enrolment, the women were interviewed by a researcher over the phone, to collect details of any acute and chronic stressors they’d experienced over the past three years. Independent raters later rated these stressors as either acute or chronic; mild, moderate or severe; and noted their duration (for example, the death of a spouse was considered a severe acute stressor; moving home was a moderate acute stressor; caring for a handicapped child was a severe chronic stressor; a neighbourly dispute was rated as a moderate chronic stressor).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The women also completed questionnaires that measured their levels of social support, optimism, anger control, “anti-emotionality” (emotional stunting), and also anxiety and depression (the researchers measured and adjusted for anxiety and depression because of their potential influence on the self-reports of stressors and the psychosocial variables).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The interviews and questionnaires were repeated at three-yearly intervals for another 12 years, though only a few women completed all of the follow-ups. During the study period, 103 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer. The researchers analysed the data to see if moderate/severe acute or chronic stress, or the psycho-social variables (adjusting for anxiety and depression), were associated with a subsequent increased risk of being diagnosed with cancer, but in fact none of them were (there was a trend for chronic severe stress to increase risk of diagnosis, but this was statistically non-significant).</p>
<p>The researchers argue that the study overcame methodological limitations of some other studies, in that, for example, there were objective ratings of various different kinds of stressor, and these stressors were assessed before diagnosis, rather than being reported by women after diagnosis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It is in theory possible that stress did have an influence on breast cancer risk, but it was so small, compared with the genetic influences on the particular women in this study, that it couldn’t be detected. Also, while the results may not generalise to women in the general population, the researchers note that “internationally, most rigorous studies have also failed to find an association between psychosocial factors and cancer” (for example, check out <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/20/new-meta-analysis-undermines-the-myth-that-negative-emotions-can-cause-cancer/">the meta-analysis</a> we covered last year). However, there are some conflicting findings, including those from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/157/5/415/76660">a study of Finnish twins</a> published in 2003 that found severe negative life events, like divorce, were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Still, the researchers concluded: “Given the lack of evidence for an association between stressors and psychosocial factors and [breast cancer], we suggest that women at increased risk of [breast cancer] focus on proven methods of risk reduction such as close monitoring, risk-reduction medication, or, for those at high risk, surgery.”</p>

<p>Sports coaches are always on the look out for new ideas to improve their players’ performance and it’s understandable that insights from psychology and neuroscience hold particular appeal. However, as with other applied fields, it’s not easy to translate neuroscience findings into useful sports interventions. There are also a lot of charlatans who use the mystique of the brain to sell quack sports products and programmes. Without specialist neuroscience training, coaches might struggle to distinguish genuine brain insights from neuro-based flimflam.</p>
<p>It’s in this context that a group of researchers, led by Richard Bailey at the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education in Berlin, thought it would be useful to see which scientifically challenged practices sports coaches use, and whether they are able to identify brain facts from myths. Previous work has identified widespread belief in neuromyths among several other groups, including <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/05/belief-in-brain-myths-and-child-development-myths-continues-even-among-those-whove-studied-psychology/">psychology students</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/19/music-teachers-and-students-fall-for-music-related-neuromyths-german-study/">music teachers</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/20/oh-dear-even-people-with-neuroscience-training-believe-an-awful-lot-of-brain-myths/">neuroscience graduates</a>, but this is the first time sports coaches have been tested.</p>
<p>Reporting their results in <em><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00641/full">Frontiers in Psychology</a></em>, Bailey and his colleagues found that sports coaches endorsed, on average, just over 40 per cent of the six brain myths presented to them. “The figure is substantial enough to warrant concern,” according to Bailey and his colleagues “because it is likely that these beliefs will shape coaching philosophy and practice.”</p>
<p><span id="more-33846"></span></p>
<p>The findings are based on a survey of nearly 550 coaches in the UK and Ireland who took part by responding to adverts on social media. They coached a range of sports including football, rugby, swimming and cricket.</p>
<p>The coaches reported using the scientifically unsupported concept of “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/">learning styles</a>” frequently and this also happened to be the neuromyth that they endorsed most strongly (over 62 per cent of the coaches said they agreed with the concept). Around half also endorsed the idea that short bursts of coordination exercises can improve the integration of left and right-hemishphere brain function, which chimes with the fact they said they made frequent use of the pseudoscientific Brain Gym programme that espouses this idea.</p>
<p>On a positive note, the coaches reported only infrequent use of the empirically challenged approaches of NLP, the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory and Action Types Approach, while they made frequent use of the more scientifically legitimate techniques/approaches of direct instruction, guided discovery, demonstrations and growth mindset.</p>
<p>Turning to the other myths on the list, 43 percent and 55 per cent of the coaches said they believed in the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-myths/201206/why-the-left-brain-right-brain-myth-will-probably-never-die">left-brain, right-brain myth</a> and the myth that children are less attentive after consuming sugar, respectively. In contrast, their endorsement was much lower for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/">10 per cent brain myth</a> and the myth that there are critical periods in childhood after which things can no longer be learned (22.6 and 16.6 per cent of them endorsed these myths, respectively, on average).</p>
<p>The researchers also presented the coaches with six “general assertions” about the brain that are scientifically supported, including that vigorous exercise can improve mental function. On average, the coaches agreed with 56.6 per cent of these more evidence-based statements, although fewer than 10 per cent realised that boys have bigger brains than girls and fewer than 20 per cent realised that the two brain hemispheres always work together.</p>
<p>Previous research on misbeliefs about the brain has found that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing – for instance, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=teachers#v=snippet&amp;q=teachers&amp;f=false">belief in brain myths was previously found to be higher among teachers with more general knowledge about the brain</a>. This pattern was replicated here among sports coaches – those with superior brain knowledge, and those who thought neuroscience was more likely to be helpful for their work, also tended to believe more in the neuromyths.</p>
<p>Bailey and his colleagues end with a number of recommendations to combat neuro-bunk in sports coaching, including increasing contact between coaches and scientists and establishing an independent advisory body for sports governing bodies, akin to the UK’s National Institute for Health Care Excellence that provides evidence-based guidelines to health professionals. More generally, “coach education should be strengthened by encouraging the cultivation of a healthy scepticism,” they concluded. “As the first of its kind with sports coaches, this study can be understood as a contribution to these endeavours”, they concluded.</p>

A prominent (yet controversial) journalist in Australia has admitted to duplicating three images that were part of her PhD thesis — a practice outside experts agreed was acceptable, if not ideal, at the time, according to a report released today.

<p>The idea that taking a gap year allows you to “find yourself” is often derided. But if you spend that time living in one foreign country, it just might. And if you can make it year<i>s</i>, even better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Hajo Adam at Rice University, US, led what his team say is the first empirical investigation of the effects of living abroad on “self-concept clarity” – how clearly and confidently someone defines who they “are”. Since people are increasingly spending time living abroad for work or study – and since other “transitional” life experiences, such as getting a new job or getting divorced have been associated with <i>decreases</i> in self-concept clarity – it’s important to study this, the researchers write in their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597817301279">paper</a> in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-33848"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited a total of 1,874 people to take part in a series of studies. The first involved 296 people, recruited online. Half had lived abroad at some point. They all completed a 12-item self-concept clarity scale, indicating the extent to which they did or didn’t agree with statements like: “In general, I have a clear sense of who I am and what I am” and “I seldom experience conflict between the different aspects of my personality”. Those who had lived abroad had a clearer self-concept.</p>
<p>But might this be because this type of person is more likely to pursue opportunities abroad? To find out, the team recruited 261 more people, 136 of whom had lived abroad. The others hadn’t yet, but had definite plans to, with most intending to move within around nine months. As well as the self-concept clarity scale, participants completed an assessment of their “self-discerning reflections” – such as: “I have figured out if my relationships with others are driven by my own values or follow the values of those around me” and “I have determined whether my personality is defined by who I truly am or by the culture I grew up in”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Those participants who’d already lived abroad had clearer self-concepts than the others who shared the same plans to live abroad but hadn’t travelled yet, and this was explained statistically by their higher scores for self-discerning reflections (this was after controlling for a range of demographic and personality variables). These results suggest that time abroad increases self-discerning reflection and in turn this leads to greater self concept clarity.</p>
<p>Other studies the researchers conducted, including in some cases with students from dozens of different countries, led them to conclude that it’s total time spent living abroad – rather than the number of different countries lived in – that makes for greater self-concept clarity (among these participants the average time spent living abroad was 3.3 years). Greater clarity can also have a practical advantage: international students who’d spent more time living abroad reported feeling clearer about their future career direction, an outcome that was mediated by increased self-concept clarity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The fact that we found consistent support for our hypotheses across different subject populations…mixed methods…and complementary methods of self-concept clarity…highlights the robustness of living abroad on self-concept clarity”, the researchers write. “The present research is the first to show that living abroad can change structural aspects of the self-concept.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other research has found that living abroad can influence the content of a person’s self-concept – with words such as “adventurous” being added to their self-descriptions. But the new findings suggest that, because living abroad, away from your usual cultural environment, allows you to confront and perhaps redefine what truly is and isn’t important to you, it also leads to improved confidence in and clarity about who you are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the longer you live abroad, the more self-discerning reflections you’re likely to have, the researchers write.</p>
<p>The paper concludes with a quote from a 1919 book called <i>Travel Diaries of a Philosopher</i> by German philosopher Hermann von Keyserling: “The shortest path to oneself leads around the world.” The researchers add: “Almost 100 years later, our research provides empirical evidence in support of this idea.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
