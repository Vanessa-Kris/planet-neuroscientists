              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alexander-friedmann-universes-expansion-1922-cosmology">A century ago, Alexander Friedmann envisioned the universe’s expansion</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millennia, the universe did a pretty good job of keeping its secrets from science.</p>



<p>Ancient Greeks thought the universe was a sphere of fixed stars surrounding smaller spheres carrying planets around the central Earth. Even Copernicus, who in the 16th century correctly replaced the Earth with the sun, viewed the universe as a single solar system encased by the star-studded outer sphere.</p>



<p>But in the centuries that followed, the universe revealed some of its vastness. It contained countless stars agglomerated in huge clusters, now called galaxies.</p>





<p>Then, at the end of the 1920s, the cosmos disclosed its most closely held secret of all: It was getting bigger. Rather than static and stable, an everlasting and ever-the-same entity encompassing all of reality, the universe continually expanded. Observations of distant galaxies showed them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/death-universe-required-physical-law-may-be-avoided">flying apart from each other</a>, suggesting the current cosmos to be just the adult phase of a universe born long ago in the burst of a tiny blotch of energy.</p>



<p>It was a surprise that shook science at its foundations, undercutting philosophical preconceptions about existence and launching a new era in cosmology, the study of the universe. But even more surprising, in retrospect, is that such a deep secret had already been suspected by a mathematician whose specialty was predicting the weather.</p>





<p>A century ago this month (May 1922), Russian mathematician-meteorologist <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Friedmann/">Alexander Friedmann</a> composed a paper, based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity, that outlined multiple possible histories of the universe. One such possibility described cosmic expansion, starting from a singular point. In essence, even without considering any astronomical evidence, Friedmann had anticipated the modern Big Bang theory of the birth and evolution of the universe.</p>



<p>“The new vision of the universe opened by Friedmann,” writes Russian physicist Vladimir Soloviev <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10650">in a recent paper</a>, “has become a foundation of modern cosmology.”</p>



<p>Friedmann was not well known at the time. He had graduated in 1910 from St. Petersburg University in Russia, having studied math along with some physics. In graduate school he investigated the use of math in meteorology and atmospheric dynamics. He applied that expertise in aiding the Russian air force during World War I, using math to predict the optimum release point for dropping bombs on enemy targets.</p>



<p>After the war, Friedmann learned of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes gravity as a manifestation of the geometry of space (or more accurately, spacetime). In Einstein’s theory, mass distorts spacetime, producing spacetime “curvature,” which makes masses appear to attract each other.</p>



<p>Friedmann was especially intrigued by Einstein’s <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/433">1917 paper</a> (and a similar paper by Willem de Sitter) applying general relativity to the universe as a whole. Einstein found that his original equations allowed the universe to grow or shrink. But he considered that unthinkable, so he added a term representing a repulsive force that (he thought) would keep the size of the cosmos constant. Einstein concluded that space had a positive spatial curvature (like the surface of a ball), implying a “closed,” or finite universe.</p>



<p>Friedmann accepted the new term, called the cosmological constant, but pointed out that for various values of that constant, along with other assumptions, the universe might exhibit very different behaviors. Einstein’s static universe was a special case; the universe might also expand forever, or expand for a while, then contract to a point and then begin expanding again.</p>



<p>Friedmann’s <a href="https://wwwphy.princeton.edu/~steinh/ph563/friedmann.pdf">paper describing dynamic universes</a>, titled “On the Curvature of Space,” was accepted for publication in the prestigious <em>Zeitschrift für Physik</em> on June 29, 1922.</p>



<p>Einstein objected. He wrote a note to the journal contending that Friedmann had committed a mathematical error. But the error was Einstein’s. He later acknowledged that Friedmann’s math was correct, while still denying that it had any physical validity.</p>



<p>Friedmann insisted otherwise.</p>



<p>He was not just a pure mathematician, oblivious to the physical meanings of his symbols on paper. His in-depth appreciation of the relationship between equations and the atmosphere persuaded him that the math meant something physical. He even wrote a book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-as-Space-Time/dp/1927763193/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em>The World as Space and Time</em></a>) delving deeply into the connection between the math of spatial geometry and the motion of physical bodies. Physical bodies “interpret” the “geometrical world,” he declared, enabling scientists to test which of the various possible geometrical worlds humans actually inhabit. Because of the physics-math connection, he averred, “it becomes possible to determine the geometry of the geometrical world through experimental studies of the physical world.”</p>



<p>So when Friedmann derived solutions to Einstein’s equations, he translated them into the possible physical meanings for the universe. Depending on various factors, the universe could be expanding from a point, or from a finite but smaller initial state, for instance. In one case he envisioned, the universe began to expand at a decelerating rate, but then reached an inflection point, whereupon it began expanding at a faster and faster rate. At the end of the 20th century, astronomers measuring the brightness of distant supernovas concluded that the universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-138">had taken just such a course</a>, a shock almost as surprising as the expansion of the universe itself. But Friedmann’s math had already forecast such a possibility.</p>

<p>No doubt Friedmann’s deep appreciation for the synergy of abstract math and concrete physics prepared his mind to consider the notion that the universe could be expanding. But maybe he had some additional help. Although he was the first scientist to seriously propose an expanding universe, he wasn’t the first person. Almost 75 years before Friedmann’s paper, the poet Edgar Allan Poe had <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32037">published an essay</a> (or “prose poem”) called <em>Eureka</em>. In that essay Poe described the history of the universe as expanding from the explosion of a “primordial particle.” Poe even described the universe as growing and then contracting back to a point again, just as envisioned in one of Friedmann’s scenarios.</p>



<p>Although Poe had studied math during his brief time as a student at West Point, he had used no equations in <em>Eureka</em>, and his essay was not recognized as a contribution to science. At least not directly. It turns out, though, that Friedmann was an avid reader, and among his favorite authors were Dostoevsky and Poe. So perhaps that’s why Friedmann was more receptive to an expanding universe than other scientists of his day.</p>



<p>Today Friedmann’s math remains at the core of modern cosmological theory. “The fundamental equations he derived still provide the basis for the current cosmological theories of the Big Bang and the accelerating universe,” Israeli mathematician and historian Ari Belenkiy noted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1498">in a 2013 paper</a>. “He introduced the fundamental idea of modern cosmology — that the universe is dynamic and may evolve in different manners.”</p>



<p>Friedmann emphasized that astronomical knowledge in his day was insufficient to reveal which of the possible mathematical histories the universe has chosen. Now scientists have much more data, and have narrowed the possibilities in a way that confirms the prescience of Friedmann’s math.</p>



<p>Friedmann did not live to see the triumphs of his insights, though, or even the early evidence that the universe really does expand. He died in 1925 from typhoid fever, at the age of 37. But he died knowing that he had deciphered a secret about the universe deeper than any suspected by any scientist before him. As his wife remembered, he liked to quote a passage from Dante: “The waters I am entering, no one yet has crossed.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many mentally well people experience hallucinations. An estimated 6 &#8211; 15% of us hear, see, feel or even smell things that aren’t real. But there has been little research into what those hallucinations are like — and how they might differ from those experienced by people with psychosis. Now Mascha M.J. Linszen at Utrecht University and her colleagues report the results of a large study of more than 10,000 people aged 14 to 88. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-022-00229-9">The work</a>, published in <em>Schizophrenia,</em> throws up a few surprises among a host of interesting findings.</p>



<span id="more-46278"></span>



<p>The team’s online survey was open to anyone aged over 14 who could understand enough Dutch to complete the questionnaires. In total, 10,448 participants (68.9% female) took part.</p>



<p>The team’s first finding was that hallucinations were common. About 80% reported having hallucinated at least once in their lifetime. About half had hallucinated within the past month and 32% within the past week. Auditory hallucinations were most common, with about 30% of the respondents saying they had experienced them in the past month, followed by visual (21.5%), tactile (about 20%) and olfactory hallucinations (about 17%). Of course, the participants were self-selecting, and not gender-balanced, and people who had hallucinated may well have been more likely to take part. It’s also worth noting that the team did not gather medical histories, so some of the participants may have had a diagnosis of psychosis. For all these reasons, it’s not possible to extrapolate these rates to the general population. But the team’s further exploration of answers given by everyone who had experienced a hallucination within the past month did lead to some unexpected results.</p>



<p>There were “remarkably high” percentages of people reporting characteristics of hallucinations previously associated only with schizophrenia, substance abuse and some neurological disorders. For example, almost half of this group had experienced hallucinations in more than one sense. Also, a large proportion of those who reported auditory hallucinations heard music, something previously regarded as rare.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most striking finding, though, was the range of content described. People reported everything from seeing shadows to hearing children crying, and from smelling food to being slapped. There was also a big spectrum of severity — from fleeting, benign experiences to minutes-long, highly distressing hallucinations. The team argues that this finding fits with the idea that psychotic symptoms fall along a continuum, ranging from isolated, minor experiences affecting people who are mentally well to those suffered by people with psychosis. (Though it’s also worth noting that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/category/psychosis/">the continuum idea has been challenged.</a>)</p>



<p>A popular explanation for hallucinations is that, in generating these misperceptions, the brain is jumping to conclusions — it’s relying more on faster top-down predictions of what it’s perceiving than bottom-up data from the senses. According to this theory, hallucinations are more likely to happen when the quality of sense data is poor. This could be down to dim lighting, for example, for a healthy individual, or perhaps a failure of the brain to properly process sense data for someone diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p>



<p>As the researchers note, from an evolutionary perspective, fast top-down predictions are especially useful if they potentially aid survival or reproduction. “This might explain why the majority of the contents in our sample involved ‘warning signs’,” the team writes. For example: hearing threatening voices, sirens or footsteps; seeing shadows or figures approaching; feeling insects crawling; smelling fire, smoke or gas; perceiving social cues, such as telephones ringing, kids crying or names being called; feeling hands on shoulders; even smelling food.</p>



<p>To better understand the causes of various types of hallucinations, they suggest that groups of people who experience a specific type, whether they are mentally well or have a clinical diagnosis, should be studied together.</p>



<p>For now though, the findings do suggest that contrary to some portrayals, hallucinations are not rare, and are not necessarily distressing. This extends similar work which had argued that <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/hearingthevoice/">hearing voices</a>, specifically, is more common than often recognised. “Overall, our findings provide a more nuanced and less severe perspective on hallucinations and other misperceptions, which are typically depicted in a negative way and often pathologized in Western news media,” the team concludes. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caribou-gut-parasites-tundra-helminth-ecosystem">Caribou gut parasites indirectly create a greener tundra</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gut parasites in large plant eaters like caribou thrive out of sight and somewhat out of mind. But these tiny tummy tenants can have big impacts on the landscape that their hosts travel through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digestive tract parasites in caribou can reduce the amount that their hosts eat, allowing for <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117381119">more plant growth in the tundra where the animals live</a>, researchers report in the May 17 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding reveals that even nonlethal infections can have reverberating effects through ecosystems.</p>





<p>Interactions between species have long been known to ripple through ecosystems, indirectly impacting other parts of the food web. When predators eat herbivores, for example, a reduction in plant-eating mouths leads to changes in the plant community.&nbsp;This is how sea otters, for example, can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-kelp-forests-california-urchin-takeover-sea-otter">encourage kelp growth</a> by feeding on herbivorous urchins (<em>SN</em><em>: 3/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>&#8220;Anytime you have a change in species interactions that changes what the animals are doing on the landscape, it can influence their impact on the ecosystem,” says Amanda Koltz, an ecologist at Washington University in St. Louis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When parasites and pathogens kill their hosts, it can have a similar effect to predators on ecosystems. A prime example is the rinderpest virus, which in the late 19th century devastated populations of ruminants — buffalo, antelope, cattle — in sub-Saharan Africa. Once wildebeest populations in East Africa were spared further infection following the vaccination of cattle and the eradication of the virus, their exploding numbers trimmed the grass back in the Serengeti and led to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000210">other landscape changes</a>.</p>



<p>But unlike rinderpest, most infections aren’t lethal. Nonlethal parasite infections are pervasive in ruminants — plant eaters that play key roles in shaping vegetation on land. Koltz and her team wondered if changes to a ruminant’s overall health or behavior from a chronic parasitic infection could also induce changes in the surrounding plant community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers looked to caribou (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>). Using data from published studies, Koltz and her team developed a series of mathematical simulations to test how caribou survival, reproduction and feeding rate could be influenced by stomach worm (<em>Ostertagia </em>spp.) infections.</p>



<p>The scientists then calculated how these effects could alter the total mass of and population changes in the caribou, parasites and plants. The simulations predict that not only could lethal infections trigger a cascade leading to more plant mass, but also nonlethal infections had just as large an effect. Sickened caribou that ate less or experienced a drop in reproduction rate led to an increase in plant mass when compared with a scenario with no parasites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also analyzed data from 59 studies on 18 species of ruminants and their parasites, gathering information on how the parasites impact host feeding rates and body mass. The analysis found that chronic parasitic infections generally cause many types of herbivores to eat less, also reducing their body mass and fat reserves.</p>



<p>Indirect ecological ramifications from parasitic infections could be common in ruminants all over the world, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>The study “highlights that there are widespread interactions that we’re not considering in ecosystem contexts quite yet, but we should be,” Koltz says.</p>



<p>Globally, parasites face an uncertain future with fast environmental changes — like climate change and habitat loss from changes in land use — altering relationships with their hosts, potentially leading to many <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602422">parasite extinctions</a>.&nbsp;“How such changes in host-parasite interactions might disrupt the structure and functioning of ecosystems is a topic that we should be thinking about,” Koltz says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings also are “going to change how we think about what controls ecosystems,” says Oswald Schmitz, a population ecologist at Yale University who was not involved in the research. “Maybe it isn’t predators that are necessarily controlling the ecosystem, maybe the parasites are more important,” he says. “And so, what we really need to do is more research that disentangles [this].”</p>



<p>Scientists are rapidly gaining a better understanding of parasites’ ubiquity and abundance, says Joshua Grinath, an ecologist at Idaho State University in Pocatello. “Now we are challenged with understanding the roles of parasites within ecological communities and ecosystems.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ufo-science-research-uap-congress-pentagon">Why some scientists want serious research into UFOs</a></h4>

              
                <p>The U.S. defense and intelligence communities are taking unidentified flying objects, officially known as unidentified aerial phenomena, seriously. And some researchers think the scientific community should too.</p>



<p>On May 17, the U.S. Congress held its first public hearing about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/whatever-happened-ufos">these objects in decades</a> (<em>SN: 6/26/71</em>). Two Pentagon officials <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/117th-congress/house-event/114761?s=1&amp;r=4">described efforts to catalog and analyze sightings</a>, many by military personnel such as pilots, of the unexplained phenomena because of their potential threat to national security.</p>



<p>Scott Bray, the deputy director of naval intelligence, shared new details on a database of images and videos that now includes about 400 reports of sightings of unidentified phenomena from 2004 to 2021. While officials were able to attribute some of the sightings to artifacts of certain sensors or other mundane explanations, there were others the officials “can’t explain,” Bray said.</p>





<p>Bray stressed that nothing in the database or studied by a task force set up to investigate the sightings “would suggest it’s anything nonterrestrial in origin.”</p>





<p>Both Bray and Ronald Moultrie, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security, identified “insufficient data” as a barrier to understanding what the unidentified phenomena are. “That’s one of the challenges we have,” Moultrie said.</p>



<p>That’s something that other scientists can help with, say astrobiologists Jacob Haqq Misra and Ravi Kopparapu.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Haqq Misra, of Blue Marble Space Institute of Science in Seattle, and Kopparapu, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., to learn more about how and why. Their answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<h4>What are unidentified aerial phenomena?</h4>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> “What are they” is the billion-dollar question. We don&#8217;t know what they are, and that&#8217;s what makes them interesting.</p>



<p>Unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, is the term that the military has been using. It&#8217;s a little different from the term UFO in the sense that a phenomenon could be something that&#8217;s not necessarily a physical solid object. So UAP is maybe a more all-encompassing term.</p>



<h4>Should we scientifically study them? Why?</h4>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> Yes. We conduct scientific studies of unknown phenomena all the time. This should not be any different. The most critical point to remember is that when conducting those studies, we should not let our speculations drive the conclusions. The collected data should do it.</p>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> As scientists, what we should do is study things that we don&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>With UAP, there seem to be some anomalous observations that are difficult to explain. Maybe they’re a sign of something like new physics, or maybe it’s just instrumental artifacts that we don&#8217;t understand or things that birds are doing.</p>



<p>It could be anything, but any of those possibilities, anything from the most extreme to the most mundane, would teach us something.</p>



<p>So there’s the scientific curiosity. And it’s also about safety for pilots too, especially if there’s something in the sky that pilots are seeing that they consider a flight safety risk.</p>



<h4>How can we study these phenomena?</h4>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> The problem with studying UAP so far is that all of the data are held by the government. From the hearing, there does seem to be a plan to declassify some data, once it’s been vetted for possible security risks, but I’m not holding my breath for that to happen soon. It was nice to hear, though.</p>



<p>The reality is if you want to understand a particular set of data, you need to know something about the instrument that collected the data. Military instruments are probably classified for good reason, for our safety. I think we’re not going to get the kind of data from the government that we need to scientifically answer the question. Even if you had that data, from the government or commercial pilots or others, it has not been intentionally collected. These have been accidental, sporadic observations.</p>



<p>So what you would need is to set up a network of detectors all around the world. Ideally, you’d have ground-based sensors and you’d have satellite coverage. It’s not enough for someone to just see something. You need to measure a detection with multiple sensors and multiple wavelengths.</p>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> Some of these are transient events. We need, for example, fast-tracking cameras and optical, infrared and radar observations to collect more data to find patterns in the events’ behaviors.</p>



<p>And we need to share such data with scientists so that independent groups can reach a consensus. This is how science progresses. There are some initiatives from academics in this direction, so that is a good sign.</p>



<h4>What are some possible next steps for the scientific community for studying them?</h4>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> There are some groups that are trying to build detectors now. Fundraising is the hardest part. [The nonprofit] <a href="https://www.uapexpedition.org/">UAPx</a> is one, and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home">Galileo Project</a> [at Harvard University] is another.<strong></strong></p>



<p>And this was underscored in the hearing, but stigma has been a big problem. It seems like the military is trying to not only streamline the reporting process but also destigmatize it. That’s important for science too. If that starts to change more in the culture, that would go a long way.</p>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> I think the scientific study of UAP should not be stigmatized. There should be open discussions, comments and constructive criticisms that can help further the study of UAP.</p>



<p>There should be discussions about how and which kinds of instruments are needed to collect data. The focus should be on collecting and sharing the data and <em>then</em> commenting on the topic.</p>



<h4>How did you get interested in this topic?</h4>



<p><strong>Kopparapu:</strong> Over a couple of years, I read several articles either dismissing or advocating for a particular explanation regarding UAP. Then I started digging into it, and I found <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Science-in-Default-%3A-Twenty-Two-Years-of-Inadequate-McDonald/ebe88e9c34880cae3b403b504ede15ab5064f8cb">physicist James McDonald’s “Science in Default” report from 1969</a>. That one particular report about UFOs changed my perspective. It was written similar to how we write our scientific articles. That resonated with me as a scientist, and I started to think that a science investigation is the only way we can understand UAP.</p>



<p><strong>Haqq Misra:</strong> I got interested in this subject because I&#8217;m an astrobiologist and other people asked me about UFOs. UFOs are not necessarily an astrobiology topic, because we don&#8217;t know what they are. But lots of people think that they&#8217;re extraterrestrials. And I felt a little silly, being an astrobiologist and having nothing to say.</p>



<p>So I went to Carl Sagan’s files, and I realized that even though he lived decades before me, there are things in his files that we&#8217;re talking about now, that are related to airborne anomalies seen by pilots.</p>



<p>Ultimately, I realized for a scientist who wants to understand what&#8217;s going on with this UFO thing, there&#8217;s a lot of noise to sift through. There&#8217;s a lot of public discourse about other topics like crop circles, alien abductions and paranormal&nbsp;stories that muddy the waters, and the more we can be clear about the specific aerial anomalies that&nbsp;we&#8217;re talking about, the more we can actually solve the problem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dolphin-coral-antibacterial-skin-care-health-infection">These dolphins may turn to corals for skin care</a></h4>

              
                <p>On her deep-sea dives, wildlife biologist Angela Ziltener of the University of Zurich often noticed Indo-Pacific bottlenosed dolphins doing something intriguing. The dolphins (<em>Tursiops aduncus</em>) would line up to take turns brushing their bodies against corals or sea sponges lining the seafloor. After more than a decade as an “adopted” member of the pod — a status that let Ziltener get up close without disturbing the animals — she and her team may have figured out why the animals behave this way: The dolphins may use corals and sea sponges as their own private pharmacies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The invertebrates <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.104271">make antibacterial compounds</a> — as well as others with antioxidant or hormonal properties — that are probably released into the waters of the Northern Red Sea  when dolphins make contact, Ziltener and colleagues report May 19 in <em>iScience</em>. So the rubbing could help dolphins maintain healthy skin.</p>





<p>Ziltener captured video showing members of the pod using corals as if they were a bath brush, swimming through to rub various parts of their bodies. Oftentimes it’s a peaceful social gathering. “It’s not like they’re fighting each other for the turn,” Ziltener says. “No, they wait and then they go through.” Other times, an individual dolphin will arrive at a patch of coral on its own.</p>



<p>But the dolphins won’t buff their bodies against just any corals, Ziltener says. They’re picky, primarily rubbing up against gorgonian corals (<em>Rumphella aggregata</em>) and leather corals (<em>Sarcophyton </em>sp.), as well as a kind of sea sponge (<em>Ircinia </em>sp.).</p>



<p>Ziltener and colleagues analyzed one-centimeter slices taken from wild corals and sponges. The team identified 17 compounds overall, including 10 with antibacterial or antimicrobial activity. It’s possible that as the dolphins swim through the corals, the compounds help protect the animals from skin irritations or infections, says coauthor Gertrud Morlock, an analytical chemist at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Other animals, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/medicine-wild-side">including chimpanzees, can self-medicate</a> (<em>SN: 11/3/90</em>). Marine biologist Jeremy Kiszka of Florida International University in Miami says the new study convinces him that the dolphins are using corals and sea sponges for that purpose. But, he says, additional experiments are necessary to prove the link. Lab tests, for instance, could help identify the types of bacteria that the compounds might work against.</p>



<p>Ziltener agrees there’s more to be done. For instance, it’s also possible that in addition to prevention, dolphins use corals and sea sponges to treat active skin infections, she says, but the team has yet to see proof of a coral cure. Next up though, Ziltener says, is figuring out whether dolphins prefer to rub specific body parts on specific corals in such an “underwater spa.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hepatitis-cases-children-liver-adenovirus">Unexplained hepatitis cases in kids offer more questions than answers</a></h4>

              
                <p>As health officials continue their investigation of unexplained cases of liver inflammation in children, what is known is still outpaced by what isn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>At least 500 cases of hepatitis from an unknown cause have been reported in children in roughly 30 countries, according to health agencies in Europe and the United States. As of May 18, 180 cases are under review in 36 U.S. states and territories.</p>



<p>Many of the children have recovered. But some cases have been severe, with more than two dozen of the kids needing liver transplants. At least a dozen children have died, including five in the United States.</p>





<p>The illnesses have mainly been seen in children under age 5. So far, health agencies have ruled out common causes of hepatitis, while reporting that some of the children have tested positive for adenovirus. That pathogen — which infects basically everyone, usually without serious issues — is not known as a primary cause of liver damage. For some children who are positive, officials have identified the particular adenovirus: type 41.</p>



<p>But there are several reasons why pinning an adenovirus as the sole hepatitis culprit doesn’t fully add up, researchers say. Nor is it clear whether the recent cases indicate an uptick in hepatitis illnesses, or just more attention. Though the cases seem to have popped up out of nowhere, “we’ve seen similar rare severe liver disease like this in children,” says Anna Peters, a pediatric transplant hepatologist at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.</p>



<p>Most of all, it’s important for parents to remember that the cases described so far “are a rare phenomenon,” Peters says. “Parents shouldn’t panic.”</p>



<h4>Hepatitis in children</h4>



<p>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can interfere with the organ’s many functions, including filtering blood and regulating clotting. Three hepatitis viruses, called hepatitis A, B and C, are common causes of the illness in the United States. Hepatitis A is spread when infected fecal material reaches the mouth. Children can get B and C when it’s transmitted from a pregnant person to an infant. There are vaccines available for A and B but not C. An excessive dose of acetaminophen can also cause hepatitis in children.</p>



<p>The signs of hepatitis can include nausea, fatigue, a yellow tinge to skin and eyes, urine that’s darker than usual and stools that are light-colored, among other symptoms. Hepatitis that arises quickly usually resolves, whereas some cases progress more slowly and lead to liver damage over time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s rare for a child to develop sudden liver failure. An estimated <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fulltext/2022/01000/North_American_Society_for_Pediatric.23.aspx">500 to 600 cases occur each year in the United States</a>, and around 30 percent of those are “indeterminate,” meaning a cause isn’t found, according to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition.</p>



<p>The indeterminate category of sudden liver failure has been known for some time, Peters says, and that subset of cases has similarities to the hepatitis under investigation. There hasn’t been data reported yet on whether the recent cases represent an increase over what’s been seen in prior years, Peters says. “Maybe this is just increased recognition of something that’s been going on.”</p>



<h4>Adenovirus as a suspect</h4>



<p>Not all of the children with hepatitis have been positive for adenovirus, nor have they all been tested. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, or ECDC, has reported <a href="https://cdn.ecdc.europa.eu/novhep-surveillance/">that of 151 cases tested, 90 were positive</a>, or 60 percent. The last dispatch from the U.K. Health Security Agency, from early May, noted that 126 samples out of 163 had been tested, with 91, or 72 percent, positive. Further analysis of 18 cases <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1073704/acute-hepatitis-technical-briefing-2.pdf">identified adenovirus type 41</a>.</p>



<p>Adenoviruses commonly infect people, typically causing colds, bronchitis or other respiratory illnesses. Two types, adenovirus 40 and 41, target the intestines, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea.</p>



<p>“All of these types, including this prime suspect type 41, have been detected everywhere continuously,” says virologist Adriana Kajon of the Lovelace Biomedical Research Institute in Albuquerque. “All of them have existed and have been reported continuously for decades.”</p>



<p>People usually recover from an adenovirus infection. The exception is those whose immune systems aren’t functioning properly — then, an infection can be serious. There have been cases of hepatitis from adenovirus in immunocompromised children, but the kids under investigation are not immunocompromised.</p>



<p>There are several curious details about the adenovirus findings. For example, the children who have tested positive for the virus had low levels in their blood. In cases of hepatitis from adenovirus, “the virus levels are very, very high,” Peters says.</p>



<p>Nor has adenovirus been found in the liver. In a study of nine children with the hepatitis in Alabama who were positive for adenovirus in blood samples, researchers studied liver tissue from six of the kids. There was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7118e1.htm">no sign of the virus in the liver</a>, the researchers report May 6 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s very hard to implicate a virus that you cannot find in the crime scene,” Kajon said May 3 at a symposium for clinical virology in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>



<p>Another oddity: There doesn’t seem to be a path of viral spread from one location to another. That’s unlike SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, “where there was quite clearly a spread from some epicenter originally,” says virologist and clinician Andrew Tai of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, who treats patients with liver disease.</p>



<p>An adenovirus culprit is not out of the realm of possibility, but “virus associations with diseases are always hard to really nail down and prove,” says virologist Katherine Spindler, also of the University of Michigan Medical School. “We’re going to be hard pressed to say this is due to adenovirus 41, let alone adenovirus.”</p>



<h4>Considering COVID-19</h4>



<p>Looming over all of this is the possibility that a many-magnitudes-larger infectious disease outbreak, COVID-19, could have a part.</p>



<p>Researchers have found that SARS-CoV-2 impacts the liver in milder and more severe cases of COVID-19. There is evidence that the liver becomes inflamed in children and adults during an infection. Liver failure can occur with a severe bout of COVID-19. And children who develop <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7655704/">multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, after COVID-19 can have hepatitis</a> as part of that syndrome.</p>



<p>Peters and her colleagues have described yet another way SARS-CoV-2 could put the liver at risk. The team reported the case of a young female patient from the fall of 2020, who had sudden liver failure about three weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. She did not have MIS-C. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9052356/">liver biopsy showed signs of autoimmune hepatitis</a>, a type in which the body attacks its own liver, Peters and colleagues report in the May <em>Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition Reports</em>. The patient recovered after treatment with anti-inflammatory medication.</p>



<p>Some of the children with hepatitis have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but more haven’t. The ECDC has reported that 20 of 173 cases tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the U.K. Health Security Agency detected the virus in 24 of 132 samples tested.</p>



<p>However, there have been very little data reported on whether the children have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, which would be evidence of a past infection. (Vaccination hasn’t been available to most of these young children.) The ECDC found that of 19 cases tested, 14 were positive for antibodies to the virus.</p>



<p>One theory is that an earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection has set the stage for an unexpected response to an adenovirus or other infection. With people no longer minimizing contact, the spread of adenoviruses and other respiratory viruses is returning to prepandemic levels.</p>



<p>“We are possibly seeing the return of these forgotten pathogens, so to speak, aggravating disease or eliciting severe inflammation resulting from some kind of preexisting condition,” which could be COVID-19, Kajon said on May 3.</p>



<p>“I cannot think of anything else that has had a worldwide impact that can explain cases of hepatitis in places as distant as the U.K. and Argentina,&#8221; Kajon says.</p>



<p>With SARS-CoV-2, researchers have a good sense of how it causes disease during an active infection, Peters says. But for the longer-term effects, “everybody is still sorting things out.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh will talk about his paper
accepted for IJCNN (International Joint Conference for Neural Network)
&quot;Sentiment Analysis Using BLSTM-ResNet on Textual Images&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sentiment Analysis is a popular classification problem where the degree of
emotion is analysed based on text. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are part
of various sentiment classification models, but their use has been limited to
one-dimensional (1D) convolution or shallow two-dimensional (2D) convolution.
The primary focus of this research is to use deep 2D-CNN architectures,
inspired by the popular computer vision model ResNet, to replace a shallow
2D-CNN in an existing BLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)-2DCNN model.
This research investigates a new method for sentiment analysis which is an
amalgam of the practices popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well
as Computer Vision, striving to extract opinions from a text by transforming
text into images. The text images are formed by transforming the word
embeddings matrix into a greyscale image with the help of BLSTM cell. Intensive
experiments have been conducted on the Sentiment140 dataset with our novel
BLSTM-ResNet model, which contains residual blocks with skip connections.
Several BLSTM-ResNet variants were tested to investigate the impact of network
depth and dataset size on sentiment detection. Moreover, two sets of residual
blocks are designed to form our shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models. Our best
shallow BLSTM-ResNet models have achieved 4.06% and 3.43% increases in
accuracy for dataset sizes 80,000 and 200,000 respectively, compared with the
baseline BLSTM-2DCNN model. In addition, an overall improvement is observed on
accuracy with every additional residual block in our shallow BLSTM-ResNet model
until accuracy saturates, and the same trend has been seen on the impact of
dataset size on the performance. Our deep BLSTM-ResNet models show the same
positive impact of network depth impact and dataset size on sentiment analysis.
Further investigation on the shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models shows that
deep BLSTM-ResNet outperforms shallow BLSTM-ResNet, in general.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pipe-organs-violate-rule-sound-physics-vortex-vibration-air">Here’s why pipe organs seem to violate a rule of sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>A speck of gold dancing to a pipe organ’s tune has helped solve a long-standing mystery: why certain wind instruments violate a mathematical formula that should describe their sound.<br><br>In 1860, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/classics-science-helmholtz-harmonizing-music">physicist Hermann von Helmholtz</a> — famous for his law of the conservation of energy — devised an equation relating the wavelength of a pipe’s fundamental tone (the lowest frequency at which it resonates) to pipe length (<em>SN: 3/31/28</em>). Generally, the longer a pipe is, the lower its fundamental tone will be.</p>



<p>But the equation doesn’t work in practice. A pipe’s fundamental tone always sounds lower than the pipe’s length suggests it should according to Helmholtz’s formula. Fixing this problem requires adding an “end correction” to the equation. In the case of open-ended pipes such as flutes and those of organs, the end correction is 0.6 times the radius of the pipe. Why this was, nobody could figure out.<br><br>A break in the case came in 2010. Instrument builder and restorer Bernhardt Edskes of Wohlen, Switzerland was tuning an organ when he spotted a piece of gold that had come loose from a pipe’s gilded lip. Air pumping through the pipe should have carried away the gold. Instead, it seemed to be trapped in a vortex just above the pipe’s upper rim.</p>



<p>Edskes told his friend, physicist Leo van Hemmen of the Technical University of Munich, about the observation. Together with colleagues from Munich and Wageningen University in the Netherlands, they studied how air moves through playing organ pipes using cigarette smoke.</p>



<p>When an organ pipe sounds, a vortex indeed forms over the pipe’s rim, the team reported March 14 in Chicago at a meeting of the American Physical Society. What&#8217;s more, this vortex is <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/D09.2">capped by a hemisphere of resonating air</a>.</p>

<p>This vibrating air cap, van Hemmen says, is the long-sought explanation for the “end correction.” The cap effectively lengthens the organ pipe by the exact amount that must be tacked on to Helmholtz’s formula to explain the pipe’s fundamental tone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-dark-matter-dwarf-galaxies-physics-space">A galactic smashup might explain galaxies without dark matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two mysterious galaxies, devoid of dark matter, could have a smashing origin story.</p>



<p>About 8 billion years ago, researchers propose, two dwarf galaxies slammed into one another. That cosmic crash caused the gas within those two galaxies to split up and form multiple new dwarf galaxies, including the two dark matter–free ones.</p>



<p>A newfound <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04665-6">row of dwarf galaxies</a>, more than 6 million light-years long, could have formed in the aftermath of the hypothesized crash, researchers report in the May 19 <em>Nature.</em> If correct, the finding could help solve the mystery of how such unusual dark matter–free galaxies form, and reveal new details about the nature of dark matter.</p>





<p>But other scientists are skeptical that there’s enough evidence to support this backstory. “If this is true, I think it would be really exciting. I just don’t think the bar has been met,” says astronomer Michelle Collins of the University of Surrey in Guildford, England.</p>



<p>In 2018, Yale University astronomer Pieter van Dokkum and colleagues reported a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-mia-strange-galaxy">dwarf galaxy with no dark matter</a> (<em>SN: 3/28/18</em>). The invisible, mysterious substance is typically detectable in galaxies via its gravitational effects on stars. When a second dark matter–free dwarf galaxy was found in the vicinity in 2019, it raised an obvious question: How did the two oddball galaxies form? Dark matter is generally thought to form the foundation of all galaxies, gravitationally attracting the gas that eventually forms stars. So some process must have separated the dark matter from the galaxies’ gas.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously seen dark matter and normal matter separate on a very large scale in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enlightened-dark-matter-spotted-after-cosmic-crash">Bullet Cluster</a>, which formed when two clusters of galaxies rammed into one another (<em>SN: 8/23/06</em>). Other researchers had proposed that something similar might happen with colliding dwarf galaxies, what van Dokkum and colleagues call “bullet dwarfs.”</p>



<p>In such a collision, the dwarf galaxies’ ethereal dark matter would continue on unperturbed, because the dark matter doesn’t interact with other matter. But the gas from the two galaxies would slam together, eventually forming multiple clumps that would each become its own galaxy, free of dark matter.</p>



<p>Now, van Dokkum and colleagues say that the bullet dwarf idea explains the two previously reported dark matter–free galaxies — and several other galaxies nearby. The two galaxies are moving away from each other as if they had come from the same spot, the researchers say. What’s more, the two galaxies are part of a chain of 11 galaxies aligned in a row, a structure that could have formed in the aftermath of a bullet dwarf collision.</p>

<p>“It’s super satisfying to finally have an explanation for these weird objects,” van Dokkum says.</p>



<p>But, Collins says, “there could be much more done to make it convincing.” For example, she says, the scientists didn’t measure the distances of all the galaxies from Earth. That means some of the galaxies could be much farther away than others, and it could be a coincidence that the galaxies appear to be lined up from our viewpoint. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And the researchers haven’t yet measured the velocities of all the galaxies in the trail or determined whether those galaxies are also missing their dark matter, which would help confirm whether the scenario is correct.</p>



<p>Other scientists are more optimistic. “The origin story is very plausible in my opinion,” says astrophysicist Eun-jin Shin of Seoul National University in South Korea. Shin cowrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01298-7">a perspective article on the discovery</a> with astrophysicist Ji-hoon Kim, also of Seoul National University, that was also published in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Computer simulations performed by Shin, Kim and others have shown that bullet dwarfs can produce such dark matter–free galaxies. If confirmed, the bullet dwarf idea could help pin down dark matter’s properties, in particular whether dark matter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-isnt-interacting-itself-after-all">interacts with itself</a> (<em>SN: 4/5/18</em>).</p>



<p>Van Dokkum and colleagues are planning additional measurements that could confirm or refute the case. But so far, he says, “It has, to me, the ring of truth.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">COVID-19 has killed a million Americans. Our minds can’t comprehend that number</a></h4>

              
                <p>One million deaths. That is now roughly <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/united-states">the toll of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. And that official milestone is almost certainly an undercount. The World Health Organization’s data suggest that this country hit a million deaths early in the year.</p>



<p>Whatever the precise dates and numbers, the crisis is enormous. The disease has taken the lives of more than 6 million people worldwide. Yet our minds cannot grasp such large numbers. Instead, as we go further out on a mental number line, our intuitive understanding of quantities, or number sense, gets fuzzier. Numbers simply start to feel big. Consequently, people’s emotions do not grow stronger as crises escalate. “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/behavioural-public-policy/more-who-die-the-less-we-care-psychic-numbing-and-genocide/5C41D141244217E7E1CA4D37783E1AEF">The more who die, the less we care</a>,” psychologists Paul Slovic and Daniel Västfjäll wrote in 2014.</p>

<p>But even as our brains struggle to grasp big numbers, the modern world is awash in such figures. Demographic information, funding for infrastructure and schools, taxes and national deficits are all calculated in the millions, billions and even trillions. So, too, are the human and financial losses from global crises, including the pandemic, war, famines and climate change. We clearly have a need to conceptualize big numbers. Unfortunately, the slow drumbeat of evolution means our brains have yet to catch up with the times.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Our brains think 5 or 6 is big.</h4>



<p>Numbers start to feel big surprisingly fast, says educational neuroscientist Lindsey Hasak of Stanford University. “The brain seems to consider anything larger than five a large number.”</p>



<p>Other scientists peg that value at four. Regardless of the precise pivot from small to big, researchers agree that humans, along with fish, birds, nonhuman primates and other species, do remarkably well at identifying really, <em>really</em> small quantities. That’s because there’s no counting involved. Instead, we and other species quickly recognize these minute quantities through a process called “subitizing” — that is, we look and we immediately see how many.</p>



<p>“You see one apple, you see three apples, you would never mistake that. Many species can do this,” says cognitive scientist Rafael Núñez of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>When the numbers exceed subitizing range — about four or five for humans in most cultures — species across the biological spectrum can still compare approximate quantities, says cognitive scientist Tyler Marghetis of the University of California, Merced.</p>



<p>Imagine a hungry fish eyeing two clumps of similarly sized algae. Because both of those options will make “awesome feasts,” Marghetis says, the fish doesn’t need to waste limited cognitive resources to differentiate between them. But now imagine that one clump contains 900 leaves and the other 1,200 leaves. “It would make evolutionary sense for the fish to try to make that approximate comparison,” Marghetis says.</p>





<p>Scientists call this fuzzy quantification ability an “approximate number sense.” Having the wherewithal to estimate and compare quantities gives animals a <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/224/6/jeb218289/237916/Neuroethology-of-number-sense-across-the-animal">survival edge</a> beyond just finding food, researchers wrote in a 2021 review in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. For example, when fish find themselves in unfamiliar environments, they consistently join the larger of two schools of fish.</p>



<p>The approximate number system falls short, however, when the quantities being compared are relatively similar, relatively large or both. Comparing two piles, one with five coins and the other with nine coins, is easy. But scale those piles up to 900,005 coins and 900,009 coins, and the task becomes impossible. The same goes for when the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 goes from 999,995 to 999,999.</p>



<h4>We can improve our number sense — to a point.</h4>



<p>The bridge between fuzzy approximation and precision math appears to be language, Núñez says.</p>



<p>Because the ability to approximate numbers is universal, every known language has words and phrases to describe inexact quantities, such as a lot, a little and a gazillion. “For example, if a boy is said to have a ‘few’ oranges and a girl ‘many’ oranges, a safe inference — without the need of exact calculations — is that the <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(17)30048-7">girl has more oranges</a> than the boy,” Núñez writes in the June 1, 2017 <em>Trends in Cognitive Science.</em></p>



<p>And most cultures have symbols or words for values in the subitizing range, but not necessarily beyond that point, Núñez says. For instance, across 193 languages in hunting and gathering communities, just 8 percent of Australian languages and 39 percent of African languages have <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lity-2012-0002/html">symbols or words beyond five</a><em>, </em>researchers reported in the 2012 <em>Linguistic Typology</em>.</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>The origin of counting beyond subitizing range, and the complex math that follows, such as algebra and calculus, remains unclear. Núñez and others suspect that cultural practices and preoccupations, such as keeping track of agricultural products and raw materials for trade, gave rise to more complex numerical abilities. As math abilities developed, people became adept at conceptualizing numbers up to 1,000 due to lived experience, says cognitive scientist David Landy. Those experiences could include getting older, traveling long distances or counting large quantities of money.</p>



<p>Regular experiences, however, rarely hit the really big number range, says Landy, a senior data scientist at Netflix in San Francisco. Most people, he says, “get no experience like that for a million.”</p>



<h4>Numbers that exceed our experience perplex us.</h4>



<p>When big numbers exceed our lived experiences, or move into the abstract, our minds struggle to cope. For instance, with number sense and language so deeply intertwined, those seemingly benign commas in big numbers and linguistic transitions from thousands to millions or millions to billions, can trip us up in surprising ways.</p>



<p>When Landy and his team ask participants, often undergraduates or adults recruited online, to place numbers along a number line, they find that people are very accurate at placing numbers between 1 and 1,000. They also perform well from 1 million to 900 million. But when they change the number line endpoints to, say, 1,000 and 1 billion, people <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12342">struggle at the 1 million point</a>, Landy and colleagues reported in the March 2017 <em>Cognitive Science</em>.</p>



<p>“Half the people are putting 1 million closer to 500 million than 1,000,” Landy says. “They just don’t know how big a million is.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>All aligned</h3>



<p>People had to place ‘1 million’ and ‘500 million’ along a number line that spanned from 1,000 to 1 billion. Roughly half the respondents correctly placed both values (top). But the other half placed both numbers too far to the right (bottom). People struggle to envision numbers beyond a million, researchers say.</p>

<p>Landy believes that as people transition from their lived experiences in the thousands to the more abstract world of 1 million, they reset their mental number lines. In other words, 1 million feels akin to one, 2 million to two and so on.</p>



<p>Changing our notations might prevent that reset, Landy says. “You might be better off writing ‘a thousand thousand’ than ‘1 million’ because that’s easier to compare to 900,000.” The British used to do this with what people in the U.S. now call a trillion, which they called a million million.</p>



<h4>Without comprehension, extreme numbers foster apathy.</h4>



<p>Our inability to grasp big numbers means that stories featuring a single victim, often a child, are more likely to grab our attention than a massive crisis — a phenomenon known as the identifiable victim effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, on September 2, 2015, Aylan Kurdi, a 2-year-old refugee of the Syrian Civil War, was on a boat with his family crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Conservative estimates at the time put the war’s death toll at around 250,000 people. Kurdi’s family was trying to escape, but when their overcrowded boat capsized, the boy drowned, along with his brother and mother. The next day a picture of the infant lying dead on a Turkish beach hit the front pages of newspapers around the world.</p>



<p>No death up until that point had elicited public outcry. That photograph of a single innocent victim, however, proved a catalyst for action. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613977114">Charitable contributions</a> to the Swedish Red Cross, which had created a fund for Syrian refugees in August 2015, skyrocketed. In the week leading up to the photo’s appearance, daily donations averaged 30,000 Swedish krona, or roughly $3,000 today; in the week after the photo appeared, daily donations averaged 2 million Swedish krona, or roughly $198,500. Paul Slovic, of the University of Oregon, Eugene, Daniel Västfjäll, of Linköping University, Sweden, and colleagues reported those results in 2017 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>

<p>Earlier research shows that charitable giving, essentially a proxy for compassion, decreases even when the number of victims goes from one to two. The flip side, however, is that psychologists and others can use humans’ tendency to latch onto iconic victims to reframe large tragedies, says Deborah Small, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>Some research suggests that this power of one need not focus on a single individual. For instance, when people were asked to make hypothetical donations to save 200,000 birds or a flock of 200,000 birds, people gave <a href="https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/1007181">more money to the flock</a> than the individual birds, researchers reported in the 2011 <em>E-European Advances in Consumer Research.</em></p>



<p>Framing the current tragedy in terms of a single unit likewise makes sense, Västfjäll says. Many people react differently, he says, to hearing ‘1 million U.S. citizens dead of COVID’ vs. ‘1 million people, roughly the equivalent of the entire city of San José, Calif., have died from COVID.’</p>



<h4>Milestones do still matter, even if we can’t feel them.</h4>



<p>Kurdi’s photo sparked an outpouring of empathy. But six weeks after it was published, donations had dropped to prephoto levels — what Västfjäll calls “the half-life of empathy.”</p>



<p>That fade to apathy over time exemplifies a phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation, or humans’ ability to eventually adjust to any situation, no matter how dire. We see this adaptation with the pandemic, Small says. A virus that seemed terrifying in March 2020 now exists in the background. In the United States, masks have come off and people are again going out to dinner and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-norms-covid-masks-risk-conformity-normal">attending large social events</a> (<em>SN: 5/17/22</em>).</p>



<p>One of the things that can penetrate this apathy, however, is humans’ tendency to latch onto milestones — like 1 million dead from COVID-19, Landy says. “We have lots of experience&nbsp;with small quantities&nbsp;carrying&nbsp;emotional impact. They are meaningful in our lives. But in order to think about big numbers, we have to go to a more milestone frame of mind.” That’s because our minds have not caught up to this moment in time where big numbers are everywhere.</p>



<p>And even if we cannot feel that 1 million milestone, or mourn the more than 6 million dead worldwide, the fact that we even have the language for numbers beyond just 4 or 5 is a feat of human imagination, Marghetis says. “Maybe we are not having an emotional response to [that number], but at least we can call it out. That’s an amazing power that language gives us.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Adjusting to parenting can be difficult for many new parents — particularly when it comes to judging their own competence or knowing whether or not they are doing the &#8220;right&#8221; thing. Subsequently, many new parents seek advice: from peers, family members, friends, and, increasingly, from social media.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001081?dgcid=rss_sd_all#!">new study</a>, published in <em>Acta Psychologica,</em> explores the impact of parenting-related Instagram accounts on mothers. It finds a mixed experience: while mothers can feel supported by a community of fellow parents, they can also feel less competent when comparing themselves to others.</p>



<span id="more-46236"></span>



<p>Ida Egmose from the University of Copenhagen and colleagues recruited 270 mothers of one or more children. After completing demographic measures, the mothers were asked how much time, on average, they had spent on Instagram every day during the last week. Next, they indicated what sort of accounts they followed: &#8220;InstaParents&#8221; — that is, influencers who post about their experiences with parenting; professional accounts that share information about child development or parenting; or a university-run account about child development. If they did follow such accounts, they were asked how much they felt their posts negatively affected their feelings about their parental competence, and how much they felt supported by them. They also gave examples of how they felt negatively affected or supported. Finally, mothers indicated how much they compared themselves to parents they followed on Instagram.</p>



<p>The results showed that mothers frequently followed accounts that discussed parenting: 84.8% followed InstaParents and 90% followed the professional profiles. They spent, on average, nearly an hour a day on the platform.</p>



<p>On average, 84.2% felt supported by the different kinds of profiles, and they felt most supported by the professional accounts. Yet there were also those who felt that following the profiles negatively affected them: 40.7% felt this way about the InstaParents accounts and 37.1% about the professional profiles. Those who felt a higher degree of social comparison were more likely to be negatively affected by each kind of profile, but also felt more supported by InstaParents profiles.</p>



<p>In response to the open-ended questions, some wrote that they felt the accounts decreased their sense of competence, and made them worried that they were “not doing a good enough job if [they didn’t] follow all the advice” they saw. Others worried more about child development, while some pointed out that parents on Instagram can “make it all look a little too perfect”. Positive themes included the sharing of parenting tips, increased knowledge about child development, reassurance, and a sense of wider community.</p>



<p>Overall, then, mothers seemed to have a mixed experience on Instagram. Though there was certainly a level of support, negative feelings, such as concerns about not being a good enough parent, also emerged, particularly among those prone to social comparison. Instagram thus offers a potential space for learning and knowledge dissemination — but can be a double-edged sword.</p>



<p>The study only looked at mothers — looking at fathers and the impact social media has on their feelings around parenting could also be interesting. The participants were also primarily white: images of mainly white parenting influencers may have a different impact on parents of colour, which is also worth exploring.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001081?dgcid=rss_sd_all#!">How are mothers negatively affected and supported by following parenting-related Instagram profiles? A mixed-methods study</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/denisovan-girl-fossil-tooth-hominid-laos-anthropology">A Denisovan girl’s fossil tooth may have been unearthed in Laos</a></h4>

              
                <p>A molar tooth from Southeast Asia probably belonged to a member of a cryptic group of Stone Age hominids called Denisovans, researchers say.</p>



<p>If so, this relatively large tooth joins only a handful of fossils from Denisovans, who are known from ancient DNA pegging them as close Neandertal relatives.</p>



<p>Analyses of the tooth’s internal structure and protein makeup indicate that the molar came from a girl in the <em>Homo</em> genus. She died between the ages of 3½ and 8½, paleoanthropologist Fabrice Demeter of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues say.</p>





<p>A Denisovan molar that dates to at least 160,000 years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir">was previously found on the Tibetan Plateau</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29923-z">newly discovered tooth</a> strongly resembles that other molar, indicating that the new find is probably Denisovan too, the team reports May 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Before the Tibetan Plateau tooth, all known fossils from the mysterious hominids had been found in Siberia.</p>



<p>Estimated ages of sediment and fossil animal bones in Tam Ngu Hao 2, or Cobra Cave, in Laos place the tooth found there between 164,000 and 131,000 years old.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the Cobra Cave tooth represents a Neandertal or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-first-known-child-neandertal-and-denisovan">someone with Denisovan and Neandertal ancestry</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/18</em>), Demeter says. His group hopes to extract DNA from the fossil, which could clarify its evolutionary status.</p>



<p>It now appears that at least five <em>Homo</em> species, including Denisovans, inhabited Southeast Asia between roughly 150,000 and 40,000 years ago, Demeter says. Others include <em>Homo sapiens</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>Homo erectus</em></a> (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines"><em>Homo luzonensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought"><em>Homo floresiensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>), also known as hobbits, he contends.</p>



<p>Still, some researchers regard Denisovans as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals">one of several closely related, ancient <em>Homo</em> populations</a> rather than a distinct species (<em>SN: 6/25/21</em>). Whatever evolutionary ID Denisovans actually held, the Cobra Cave tooth adds to suspicions that the hominids inhabited Southeast Asia’s tropical forests as well as Central Asia’s cold mountain ranges and Siberia.</p>

<p>In my opinion, patient education plays a vital role in planning for dialysis options in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).  It involves more than just having a 5-minute discussion during an office visit or providing patients with handouts.  It requires an in-depth discussion about what the different dialysis options are, how patients can manage their symptoms, what patients can do to improve their outcomes, and how they can be engaged in their healthcare.  Patients who are progressing to ESKD and looking at dialysis or conservative care are vulnerable to numerous complications of their disease and poor outcomes can occur.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-022-02800-z"> Wang’s article</a>, they examine the impact of a MDPC on the risks of post-dialysis peritonitis, technique failure and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.  The MDPC team consisted of nephrologists, dietitians and nurses.  They provided standardized pre-dialysis education according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.07.015">Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines</a>.  They did not demonstrate any significance between the MDPC group and non-MDPC group in rates for development of the first episode of peritonitis, technique failure, or mortality.  But PD patients with diabetes, who received MDPC, were found to have a lower risk of mortality.</p>
<p>The impact of pre-dialysis education has been studied by other groups.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01860-9">Chou et al.</a> found that pre-ESKD care education for those with CKD stage G3-5 was associated with improved patient outcomes, including the incidence of hemodialysis and hospitalization events and a higher overall survival rate.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.02.334">Koch-Weser et al.</a> examined multiple patient education practices on content and accessibility or whether they support shared-decision making for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.  The study highlighted the great variability in education delivery, follow-up, and outcomes reported.  Additionally, the education programs were not consistently following best practices related to health literacy or supporting shared-decision making.</p>
<p>Nephrology guidelines, such as Kidney Disease:  Improving Global Outcomes (<a href="https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO_2012_CKD_GL.pdf">KDIGO</a>) and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), recommend education for patients but there is no guidance on the format or structure of how to provide this education.  There is probably not a single optimal format and providers will need to gauge the learning styles of patients and tailor programs.  The study by Wang et al. brings up two areas that are worth studying further.  First, the long-term impact of pre-dialysis education on mortality benefits continued post-dialysis initiation.  Second, those factors specifically related to the dialysis procedure may not be retained long-term and perhaps ensuring there is a multidisciplinary approach to training would be important to reinforce this additional knowledge.</p>
<p>As long as education is provided to patients, I do not believe there is a specific format needed.   A program should offer many forms of education since adult patients have different learning styles.  Furthermore, ensuring that the same level of education is provided not only in pre-dialysis education but also once a patient has started dialysis.</p>
<p>What are you doing to educate your patients?</p>

<p>It was a privilege to attend PAS 2022 this year. It was invaluable to be able to connect with our community face to face and meet our esteemed</p>
<p>Editorial Board Members throughout the weekend. The caliber of research presented was truly staggering and I was very pleased to see and meet several of our authors whom presented their work at PAS. A personal highlight was listening to our author Prof. Samir Gupta present his latest Randomized Clinical Trial for which their Study Protocol was published with us at BMC Pediatrics entitled “<a class="is-external" href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02558-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after Selective early treatment for Closure of patent ductus ARteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial</a>&#8220;. It is well known that randomized clinical trials in any field are notoriously difficult to plan, fund and conduct and so it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to consider their excellent study protocol at the journal and hear about their subsequent results at PAS 2022.</p>

<p><em>“Contribution of Immature Control to the respiratory morbidity of Preemies was one of the highlights of PAS 2022 that deserves to be commented on.  </em></p>
<p><em>In the last years the incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has been progressively high, and it may be due in part to immature ventilatory control, contributing to hypoxemia. The Prematurity Related Ventilatory Control (PreVent Study) aim to elucidate individualized cardiopulmonary phenotypes and mechanisms of ventilatory control contributing to adverse respiratory outcomes in premature infants using different biomarkers to predict respiratory outcomes: Physiologic providing results from the PreVent Study focused on the natural history of disordered respiratory control in preterms  and long term morbidities; clinical characterizing the relationship between apnea, bradycardia and hypoxemic episodes as predictive parameters for later respiratory morbidities in this cohort study. The longitudinal disease burden to that time point were: 7, 14, 28 days and 32 wPMA. IH (desaturation threshold Sp02 &lt; 90%; IH &lt;90) average duration of each episode is a major physiologic predictor at all evaluated time points; AUC of 0.74 at day 7; increasing to 0.81 by day 28 and 0.84 by 32SW PMA. So, respiratory morbidity in former premies is not just BPD and clinical and physiological parameters, as periodic breathing, desaturations episodes, bradycardia, apnea, are early predictors. Clinicians need to pay attention to bedside data: Continuous ECG, heart rate, respiratory, and oxygen saturation.”</em></p>

His conference was an excellent argument for the benefits of Evidence Based Medicine and the importance of optimal methodologic design of clinical trials. Wherever is the result of the trial (whether it confirms or not our hypothesis) they help to advance knowledge in the field. Also, the emotional ending of Dr Kirpalani’s conference is an eloquent sign that advances in knowledge are never made by one individual alone, but rather, they are the result of building strong relationships throughout our professional life.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-norms-covid-masks-risk-conformity-normal">Pressure to conform to social norms may explain risky COVID-19 decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pandemic has entered a murky stage, and social norms are quickly shifting, something I’ve thought a lot about lately. Many people are testing at home, or not at all. Here in Vermont, where I live, you can pick up a type of PCR test that can be taken at home. But state officials both here and elsewhere are no longer carefully monitoring the results of these tests, which means that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">actual spread of&nbsp;coronavirus</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. population remains unclear (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a few weeks, rumors of a stealth COVID-19 wave have been circulating both in the media and on my Twitter feed. Now cases and hospitalizations are rising, as are the levels of&nbsp;<a href="https://biobot.io/data">coronavirus&nbsp;in wastewater</a>.&nbsp;That suggests that more cases, and ultimately deaths, could follow.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Even with rising caseloads and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker">vaccination rate that has flatlined</a>&nbsp;at about 66 percent of the eligible population, the American public has largely begun to move on from the COVID-19 crisis. People are shedding their masks, eating out, attending concerts, traveling to far-flung locations, having large, indoor weddings and doing all the social things that people tend to do when left to their own devices.<br><br>The 2,600-person&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/05/covid-white-house-correspondents-dinner-guests-positive/">White House Correspondents’ Association dinner</a>&nbsp;late last month is a case in point. Just as host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfnHU9i38E">Trevor Noah prophesied</a>,&nbsp;many of those in attendance have since tested positive for COVID-19, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and reporters from NBC, ABC, the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post,&nbsp;</em>Politico and other media outlets. And those who almost certainly knew better — cue White House&nbsp;Coronavirus&nbsp;Response Coordinator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/06/fauci-correspondents-dinner-covid-message-00030767?">Ashish Jha</a>&nbsp;— nonetheless made an appearance.<br><br>Myriad quirks related to human behavior undoubtedly underpin these arguably poor choices. The Decision Lab website has a list of the&nbsp;<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases">biases and mental shortcuts</a>&nbsp;people use to make decisions. The one that caught my eye is social norms. This particular quirk outlines what behaviors people deem appropriate in a given situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I started thinking about social norms while writing a feature on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-diet-western-norm-change-food-preferences">how to get people in the United States to eat less meat</a>&nbsp;when the practice is so, well, normal (<em>SN: 5/11/22</em>). Social norms, my research informed me, vary with the group one is hanging out with and one’s environs. “We&nbsp;<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/society/how-social-norms-complicate-behavioral-research">rapidly switch our perspective</a> depending on the context of the situation we find ourselves in,” writes marketing expert John Laurence on the Decision Lab site.</p>



<p>I might have found this idea of rapid switching suspect had I not recently experienced the phenomenon. My husband’s Disney-phile brother and his wife had been planning a family reunion in Disney World in Florida since the start of the pandemic. And I, a curmudgeonly sort not prone to feeling the magic, long ago agreed to go on the condition that other people do all the planning. And so it was, after multiple COVID-related postponements, that my kids, my husband and I landed in Orlando on a blisteringly hot April day.&nbsp;<br><br>Disney normal, I soon learned, bore little resemblance to Vermont normal. This was obvious immediately from people’s attire. All around me parents and kids dressed in coordinated outfits and matching Mickey Mouse ears. (Apologies to my kids — your mom missed the fashion memo.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social norms almost certainly arose to foster cohesion among our earliest ancestors, who needed solidarity to hunt large prey, share limited resources and ward off predators and enemy tribes. In-group norms also provide humans with a sense of belonging, which research suggests is vital for our overall health. A meta-analysis of more than 3.4 million people followed for an average of seven years showed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-psychological-fallout">likelihood of dying</a>&nbsp;during the study period increased by 26 percent for participants who reported feeling alone (<em>SN: 3/29/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, then, one of the strongest drivers of human behavior is to seek out belonging. At Disney, that quest means blocking out the reality that exists just outside the fiefdom. Wars, climate crises, political fighting and the like have no place within those magical walls. Nor do reminders of a global health crisis that, according to the latest World Health Organization estimates, has thus far&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic">killed nearly 15 million people</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within Disney’s walls, throngs of&nbsp;<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/experience-updates/">mostly maskless tourists</a>&nbsp;packed onto iconic rides and into restaurants. When halfway through our trip, a Florida judge ruled that masks could not be mandated on public transit, nary a mask was to be seen on buses shuttling people to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center. And everywhere, all the time, people seemed to be coughing, sniffling or blowing their noses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a science reporter covering COVID-19, I certainly knew that I should keep my mask on. And yet, my resolve soon faltered. My kids pointed out that no one else was masking, not even my typically rule-following relatives. Donning my mask meant confessing that I was not reveling in the sparkle and glitz and magic and making all too obvious to my beloved extended family that I did not, in fact, belong. I kept my face covering in my pocket. &nbsp;<br><br>Humans’ tendency toward conformity is not all bad. In a now classic study from the 1980s, researchers investigated how to reduce water consumption in drought-prone California. Signs at the University of California, Santa Cruz asking students to turn off the shower while soaping up led to only 6 percent compliance. So researchers recruited male students to serve as norm-setting role models. These role models would hang out in the communal shower until they heard another student come in, and then soap up with the water off. When one role model soaped with the shower off, roughly&nbsp;<a href="http://triggered.stanford.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http://baywood.stanford.clockss.org/BWES/BAWOOD_BWES_12_3/UBD54Y9B61EFWUM6.pdf&amp;">half of the unwitting students</a>&nbsp;also began turning off their faucets at soaping time. Compliance&nbsp;jumped to 67 percent when two role models followed the sign.</p>



<p>But conformity can also distort how we make decisions. For instance, in the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was still new, researchers asked 23,000 people in Mexico to predict how a fictional woman named Mariana would decide whether or not to attend a birthday party. Most participants believed Mariana should not attend. But when they read a sentence suggesting her friends would attend or that others approved of the party, their predictions that&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247454">Mariana would also go</a>&nbsp;increased by 25 percent, researchers reported in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My decision to conform to Disney normal ended predictably — with a positive COVID-19 test. After weeks of coughing and sleepless nights, though, my frustration is less directed at myself than at political leaders who so blithely ignore both epidemiology and human behavior research and tell us to live like it’s 2019. It’s not. Nor is it 2020 or 2021. It’s the murky year known as 2022. And the rules of behavior that bolster our social norms — such as role models who refrain from large, indoor, unmasked gatherings, and leaders who uphold mask mandates on public transit to protect the most vulnerable — should reflect this liminal space.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>If we have strong political leanings, it’s likely that we’ll have similarly strong feelings about our opponents. We might think they’re misguided or stupid; we might consider them self-serving and selfish; or, worst of all, we may believe they’re actually evil.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221089451">new study</a> published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> explores this question: do we think our opponents are evil or just stupid? While the common understanding is that liberals see conservatives as evil and conservatives see liberals as stupid, the team finds that whatever our political affiliation, we’re more likely to see each other as unintelligent than immoral.</p>



<span id="more-46228"></span>



<p>In the first study, 481 American participants indicated where they would place themselves on a political scale running from very liberal to very conservative. They then thought about conservatives and liberals as a group, and indicated how many people in the group could be described using 12 different adjectives. Six of the adjectives were related to stupidity (e.g. illogical, unreasonable) and six to immorality (e.g. bad moral character, willing to harm others).</p>



<p>The results showed that, unsurprisingly, people were more likely to rate those with different political ideologies to their own as more unintelligent and more immoral than those with the same ideology. Ratings of unintelligence were also significantly higher than ratings of immorality, suggesting people see their opponents as stupid rather than evil. This was replicated in a second study, which took place after a midterm election in North Carolina.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants were instead asked to what extent they felt the average Democrat of Republican was stupid or evil, rating them on the same adjectives as in the previous studies. The framing of the question was therefore about identity rather than ideology. Again, participants rated members of their political ingroup as less stupid and less evil than members of their political outgroup. And again, participants rated political opponents as more stupid than evil.</p>



<p>The final study took a different tack, asking what people <em>think</em> Democrats and Republicans think of one another. Participants indicated how they believed their own ingroup sees the outgroup and vice versa, how their ingroup sees themselves, and how the outgroup sees themselves as well — regardless of their own perceptions. They then provided their own ratings of the in- and outgroup’s unintelligence and immorality.</p>



<p>Both Democrats and Republican participants believed — correctly — that Republicans would see Democrats as more stupid than evil, though they overestimated how negative their views would be. Democrats also accurately believed fellow Democrats would see Republicans as more unintelligent than immoral — but Republicans felt Democrats saw them as equally stupid and evil. Again, this group overestimated how negative Democrats saw them.</p>



<p>So, overall, the idea that liberals see conservatives as evil while conservatives see liberals as stupid did not bear out — participants of all political ideologies tended to see each other as stupid rather than evil.</p>



<p>The studies also found that we overestimate how negatively our political opponents view us. This misunderstanding, the team suggests, could provide a way of crossing divides or reducing conflict, offering some potential to reconcile with those with different ideologies by moving past assumptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">High-energy neutrinos may come from black holes ripping apart stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a star gets too close to a black hole, sparks fly. And, potentially, so do subatomic particles called neutrinos.</p>



<p>A dramatic light show results when a supermassive black hole rips apart a wayward star. Now, for the second time, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2a075Y64Ze91ba71d60a829359ac583e5abb498d8">a high-energy neutrino has been spotted</a> that may have come from one of these “tidal disruption events,” researchers report in a study accepted in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>These lightweight particles, which have no electric charge, careen across the cosmos and can be detected upon their arrival at Earth. The origins of such zippy neutrinos are a big mystery in physics. To create them, conditions must be just right to drastically accelerate charged particles, which would then produce neutrinos. Scientists have begun lining up likely candidates for cosmic particle accelerators. In 2020, researchers reported the first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-black-hole-high-energy-neutrino">neutrino linked to a tidal disruption event</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>). Other neutrinos have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">tied to active galactic nuclei</a>, bright regions at the centers of some galaxies (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>





<p>Discovered in 2019, the tidal disruption event reported in the new study stood out. “It was extraordinarily bright; it’s really one of the brightest transients ever seen,” says astroparticle physicist Marek Kowalski of Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, or DESY, in Zeuthen, Germany.</p>



<p>Transients are short-lived flares in the sky, such as tidal disruption events and exploding stars called supernovas. Further observations of the brilliant outburst revealed that it shone in infrared, X-rays and other wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>Roughly a year after the flare’s discovery, the Antarctic neutrino observatory IceCube spotted a high-energy neutrino. By tracing the particle’s path backward, researchers determined that the neutrino came from the flare’s vicinity.</p>



<p>The matchup between the two events could be a coincidence. But when combined with the previous neutrino that was tied to a tidal disruption event, the case gets stronger. The probability of finding two such associations by chance is only about 0.034 percent, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s still not clear how tidal disruption events would produce high-energy neutrinos. In one proposed scenario, a jet of particles flung away from the black hole could accelerate protons, which could interact with surrounding radiation to produce the speedy neutrinos.</p>



<p>‘We need more data … in order to say that these are real neutrino sources or not,” says astrophysicist Kohta Murase of Penn State University, a coauthor of the new study. If the link between the neutrinos and tidal disruption events is real, he’s optimistic that researchers won’t have to wait too long. “If this is the case, we will see more.”</p>



<p>But scientists don’t all agree that the flare was a tidal disruption event. Instead, it could have been an <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5ab1">especially bright type of supernova</a>, astrophysicist Irene Tamborra and colleagues suggest in the April 20 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>In such a supernova, it’s clear how energetic neutrinos could be produced, says Tamborra, of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. Protons accelerated by the supernova’s shock wave could collide with protons in the medium that surrounds the star, producing other particles that could decay to make neutrinos.</p>



<p>It’s only recently that observations of high-energy neutrinos and transients have improved enough to enable scientists to find potential links between the two. “It’s exciting,” Tamborra says. But as the debate over the newly detected neutrino’s origin shows, “at the same time, it’s uncovering many things that we don’t know.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-monkey-hybrid-borneo-habitat">A ‘mystery monkey’ in Borneo may be a rare hybrid. That has scientists worried</a></h4>

              
                <p>Six years ago, tour guide Brenden Miles was traveling down the Kinabatangan River in the Malaysian part of Borneo, when he spotted an odd-looking primate he had never seen before. He snapped a few pictures of the strange monkey and, on reaching home, checked his images.</p>



<p>“At first, I thought it could be a morph of the silvered leaf monkey,” meaning a member of the species with rare color variation, Miles says. But then he noticed other little details. “Its nose was long like that of a proboscis monkey, and its tail was thicker than that of a silvered leaf [monkey],” he says. He posted a picture of the animal on Facebook and forgot all about it.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of that photo and others suggests that the “mystery monkey” is a hybrid of two distantly related primate species that share the same fragmented habitat.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10764-022-00293-z">putative offspring</a> was produced when a male proboscis monkey (<em>Nasalis larvatus)</em> mated with a female silvered leaf monkey (<em>Trachypithecus cristatus)</em>, researchers suggest April 26 in the <em>International Journal of Primatology</em>. And that conclusion has the scientists worried about the creature’s parent species.</p>



<p>Hybridization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinese-mountain-cats-dna-domestic-genetics">between closely related organisms</a> has been observed in captivity and occasionally in the wild (<em>SN: 7/23/21)</em>. “But hybridization across genera, that’s very rare,” says conservation practitioner Ramesh Boonratana, the regional vice-chair for Southeast Asia for the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s primate specialist group.</p>





<p>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation caused by expanding palm oil plantations along the Kinabatangan River could explain how the possible hybrid came to be, says primatologist Nadine Ruppert.</p>



<p>“Different species — even from the same genus — when they share a habitat, they may interact with each other, but they may usually not mate. This kind of cross-genera hybridization happens only when there is some ecological pressure,” says Ruppert, of the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang Island.</p>



<p>The state of Sabah, where Kinabatangan River is located, lost about <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101654">40 percent of its forest cover from 1973 to 2010</a>, with logging and palm oil plantations being the main drivers of deforestation, a study in 2014 found.</p>





<p>“In certain areas, both [monkey] species are confined to small forest fragments along the river,” Ruppert says. This leads to competition for food, mates and other resources. “The animals cannot disperse and, in this case, the male of the larger species — the proboscis monkey — can easily displace the male silvered leaf monkey.”</p>



<p>Since 2016, there have been some more documented sightings of the mystery monkey, though these have been sporadic. The infrequent sightings and the COVID-19 pandemic has, for now, prevented researchers from gathering fecal samples for genetic analysis to reveal the monkey’s identity. Instead, Ruppert and colleagues compared images of the possible hybrid with those of the parent species, both visually as well as by using limb ratios. “If the individual was from one of the two parent species, all its measurements would be similar to that of one species,” Ruppert says. “But that is not the case with this animal.”</p>



<p>A photograph of a male proboscis monkey mating with a female silvered leaf monkey, along with anecdotes from boat operators and tour guides about a single male proboscis monkey hanging around a troop of female silvered leaf monkeys, has added further weight to the researchers’ conclusion.</p>



<p>The mystery monkey is generating a lot of excitement in the area, but Ruppert is concerned for the welfare of both proposed parent species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies proboscis monkeys as endangered and silvered leaf monkeys as vulnerable. “The hybrid is gorgeous, but we don’t want to see more of them,” Ruppert says. “Both species should have a large enough habitat, dispersal opportunities and enough food to conduct their natural behaviors in the long term.”</p>



<p>Increasing habitat loss or fragmentation in Borneo and elsewhere as a result of changing land uses or climate change could lead to more instances of mating — or at least, attempts at mating — between species or even genera, Boonratana says.</p>



<p>The mystery monkey was last photographed in September of 2020 with swollen breasts and holding a baby, suggesting that the animal is a fertile female. That’s another surprising development, the researchers say, because most hybrids tend to be sterile.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/16/top-performers-dont-always-provide-the-best-advice/">Top performers don’t always provide the best advice</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you want to learn a new skill, who are you going to ask for advice? Someone with a track record as a top performer would seem an obvious choice. Indeed, as the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976211054089?journalCode=pssa">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> point out, Americans alone pay hundreds of millions of dollars each year “to connect them to ‘icons, experts and industry rock stars’ who will teach them to write novels, start businesses, play chess or barbecue brisket, and they pay these premiums because they naturally believe that the best advice comes from the best performers.” However, this new work, led by David E. Levari at Harvard Business School, suggests that it does not.</p>



<span id="more-46216"></span>



<p>In an initial study, over 1,000 online participants played a game called Word Scramble. They had 60 seconds to find as many words as possible in a 4&#215;4 board of 16 letters. There were a few rules: the words had to be formed from contiguous letter tiles; no square could be used more than once in each word; any English word of three letters or more was allowed, except for proper nouns.</p>



<p>After they’d played three rounds (with the letter board changing each time), participants were told that 100 previous participants, who’d each played six rounds, had written advice for future players. They were then asked which of these players’ advice they’d like to see, or which they expected to be most helpful.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, most participants wanted to receive advice from the top performers, because they believed top performers would give the best quality advice. This study affirmed the existence of a belief that many people clearly already have. But it was an important first step in the team’s investigation.</p>



<p>Next, a fresh group of participants played six rounds of Word Scramble. The team noticed that the players did get better over time. This certainly suggests that performing well on this game requires some skill, which might in theory be trained by good advice. The players then wrote down some advice for future participants, and also rated the quality of their own advice, and how helpful they expected it to be.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that the best performers believed that they had given the best advice. However, when pieces of advice were then given to a fresh group of players, this turned out not to be the case: players who were given advice from the best performers didn’t improve at the game any more than players given advice from from other performers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also report a fascinating extra finding from this study: the second group of players rated advice that had come from the top performers as being the best — even though they had no knowledge of these people’s performance.</p>



<p>In a fresh study, the team considered some possible explanations for this. Perhaps the top performers gave more articulate or more authoritative advice, for example. In fact, they found that it was the number of independent suggestions that mattered — and top performers offered more. “In short, advice from the best performers was not better. It just sounded better because there was more of it.”</p>



<p>Why might top performers not offer more useful advice? A person’s performance level and their communication skills do not necessarily tally, the team points out. They also suggest another possibility: a greater number of suggestions might have been more valuable, if only the recipients had been able to absorb and act on all of them. Perhaps they were only able to follow one good suggestion at a time, making less extensive advice just as helpful. “Do our results, then, suggest that people are wasting their time and money when they seek advice from the best performers? Yes, sometimes. But not always.”</p>



<p>Of course, their study focused on &#8220;how to do&#8221; something, whereas, as they point out, sometimes we just want advice on &#8220;what to do&#8221;. For example, even if a billionaire stock market investor can’t teach other people how to invest, their tips on what to invest in may still be worth heeding.</p>



<p>It’s also worth pointing out that while the recipients of the Word Scramble advice didn’t benefit from more extensive advice in the short term, over a longer term, it might have been a different story. Given more time to absorb and implement lots of good suggestions, recipients of that advice might have done better. This research did not explore this.</p>



<p>The team does stress, however, that their results shouldn’t be taken to mean that an advisor’s performance is never a useful indicator of the quality of their advice. “Rather, they simply suggest that in at least some ordinary situations in which ordinary people expect the best-performing advisors to provide the best performance advice, those ordinary people are likely to be mistaken. Tips from the top are not always worth top dollar.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbon-footprint-farming-india-solar-power-agroforestry">Farmers in India cut their carbon footprint with trees and solar power</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In 2007, 22-year-old P. Ramesh’s groundnut farm was losing money. As was the norm in most of India (and still is), Ramesh was using a cocktail of pesticides and fertilizers across his 2.4 hectares in the Anantapur district of southern India. In this desert-like area, which gets less than 600 millimeters of rainfall most years, farming is a challenge.</p>



<p>“I lost a lot of money growing groundnuts through chemical farming methods,” says Ramesh, who goes by the first letter of his father’s name followed by his first name, as is common in many parts of southern India. The chemicals were expensive and his yields low.</p>





<p>Then in 2017, he dropped the chemicals. “Ever since I took up regenerative agricultural practices like agroforestry and natural farming, both my yield and income have increased,” he says.</p>



<p>Agroforestry involves planting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trees-crops-agroforestry-climate-biodiversity">woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) alongside agricultural crops</a> <em>(SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 30)</em>. One natural farming method calls for replacing all chemical fertilizers and pesticides with organic matter such as cow dung, cow urine and jaggery, a type of solid dark sugar made from sugarcane, to boost soil nutrient levels. Ramesh also expanded his crops, originally groundnuts and some tomatoes, by adding papaya, millets, okra, eggplant (called brinjal locally) and other crops.</p>

<p>With help from the nonprofit Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre in Anantapur, which works with farmers who want to try sustainable farming, Ramesh increased his profits enough to buy more land, expanding his parcel to about four hectares. Like the thousands of other farmers practicing regenerative farming across India, Ramesh has managed to nourish his depleted soil, while his new trees help keep carbon out of the atmosphere, thus playing a small but important role in reducing India’s carbon footprint. Recent studies have shown that the carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry is as much as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-017-0147-9">34 percent higher than standard forms of agriculture</a>.</p>



<p>In western India, more than 1,000 kilometers from Anantapur, in Dhundi village in Gujarat, 36-year-old Pravinbhai Parmar is using his rice farm for climate change mitigation. By installing solar panels, he no longer uses diesel to power his groundwater pumps. And he has an incentive to pump only the water he needs because he can sell the electricity he doesn’t use.</p>



<p>If all farmers like Parmar shifted to solar, India’s carbon emissions, which are 2.88 billion metric tons per year, could <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17583004.2020.1750265">drop by between 45 million and 62 million tons annually</a>, according to a 2020 report in <em>Carbon Management</em>. So far, the country has about 250,000 solar irrigation pumps out of an estimated 20 million to 25 million total groundwater pumps.</p>



<p>For a nation that has to provide for what will soon be the world’s largest population, growing food while trying to bring down already high greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices is difficult. Today, agriculture and livestock account for 14 percent of India’s gross national greenhouse gas emissions. Adding in the electricity used by the agriculture sector brings this figure up to 22 percent.</p>



<p>Ramesh and Parmar are part of a small but growing group of farmers getting assistance from government and nongovernmental programs to change how they farm. There’s still a ways to go to reach the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/revealing-indias-actual-farmer-population-7550159/">estimated 146 million others</a> who cultivate 160 million hectares of arable land in India. But these farmers’ success stories are testimony that one of India’s largest emitting sectors can change.</p>

<h4>Feeding the soil, sustaining farmers</h4>



<p>India’s farmers are already deeply feeling the effects of climate change, coping with dry spells, erratic rainfall and increasingly frequent heat waves and tropical cyclones. “When we talk about climate-smart agriculture, we are largely talking about how it has reduced emissions,” says Indu Murthy, sector head for climate, environment and sustainability at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, a think tank in Bengaluru. But such a system should also help farmers “cope with unexpected changes and weather patterns,” she says.</p>



<p>This, in many ways, is the philosophy driving a variety of sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices under the agroecology umbrella. <a href="https://www.niti.gov.in/natural-farming-niti-initiative">Natural farming</a> and agroforestry are two components of this system that are finding more and more takers across India’s varied landscapes, says Y.V. Malla Reddy, director of Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre.</p>



<p>“For me, the important change is the change in attitude of people towards trees and vegetation in the last few decades,” Reddy says. “In the ’70s and ’80s, people were not really conscious of the value of the trees, but now they consider trees, especially fruit and utilitarian trees, as also a source of income.” Reddy has advocated for sustainable farming in India for close to 50 years. Certain types of trees, such as pongamia, subabul and avisa, have economic benefits apart from their fruits; they provide fodder for livestock and biomass for fuel.</p>



<p>Reddy’s organization has provided assistance to more than 60,000 Indian farming families to practice natural farming and agroforestry on almost 165,000 hectares. Calculation of the soil carbon sequestration potential of their work is ongoing. But a 2020 report by India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notes that <a href="http://webline.co.in/fsi-result/technical-information-series-vol2-no1-2020.pdf">these farming practices can help India reach its goal of having 33 percent forest and tree cover</a> to meet its carbon sequestration commitments under the Paris climate agreement by 2030.</p>



<p>Regenerative agriculture is a relatively inexpensive way to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as compared with other solutions. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0491-z">Regenerative farming costs $10 to $100 per</a> ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere, compared with $100 to $1,000 per ton of carbon dioxide for technologies that mechanically remove carbon from the air, according to a 2020 analysis in <em>Nature Sustainability</em>. Such farming not only makes sense for the environment, but chances are the farmers’ earnings will also increase as they shift to regenerative agriculture, Reddy says.</p>

<h4>Growing solar</h4>



<p>Establishing agroecology practices to see an effect on carbon sequestration can take years or decades. But using renewable energy in farming can quickly reduce emissions. For this reason, the nonprofit International Water Management Institute, IWMI, launched the program Solar Power as Remunerative Crop in Dhundi village in 2016.</p>



<p>“The biggest threat climate change presents, specifically to farmers, is the uncertainty that it brings,” says Shilp Verma, an IWMI researcher of water, energy and food policies based in Anand. “Any agricultural practice that will help farmers cope with uncertainty will improve resilience to climate change.” Farmers have more funds to deal with insecure conditions when they can pump groundwater in a climate-friendly way that also provides incentives for keeping some water in the ground. “If you pump less, then you can sell the surplus energy to the grid,” he says. Solar power becomes an income source.</p>



<p>Growing rice, especially lowland rice, which is grown on flooded land, requires a lot of water. On average it takes about 1,432 liters of water to produce one kilogram of rice, according to the International Rice Research Institute. The organization says that irrigated rice receives an estimated 34 to 43 percent of the world’s total irrigation water. India is the largest extractor of groundwater in the world, accounting for 25 percent of global extraction. When diesel pumps do the extracting, carbon is emitted into the atmosphere. Parmar and his fellow farmers used to have to buy that fuel to keep their pumps going.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>High groundwater use</h4>



<p>Starting in the 1960s, India’s ground-water extraction began rising sharply, at a rate higher than in other places. This was primarily driven by the Green Revolution, a water- intensive agricultural policy to make the country food secure in the 1970s and ’80s and continues in some form even today.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>“We used to spend 25,000 rupees [about $330] a year for running our diesel-powered water pumps. This used to really cut into our profits,” Parmar says. When IWMI asked him in 2015 to participate in a pilot solar-powered irrigation project with zero carbon emissions, Parmar was all ears.</p>



<p>Since then, Parmar and six fellow farmers in Dhundi have sold more than 240,000 kilowatt-hours to the state and earned more than 1.5 million rupees ($20,000). Parmar’s annual income has doubled from 100,000–150,000 rupees on average to 200,000–250,000 rupees.</p>



<p>The boost is helping him educate his children, one of whom is pursuing a degree in agriculture — an encouraging sign in a country where farming is out of vogue with the younger generation. As Parmar says, “Solar power is timely, less polluting and also provides us an additional income. What is not to like about it?”</p>

<p>Parmar has learned to maintain and fix the panels and the pumps himself. Neighboring villages now ask for his help when they want to set up solar-powered pumps or need pump repairs. “I am happy that others are also following our lead. Honestly, I feel quite proud that they call me to help them with their solar pump systems.”</p>



<p>IWMI’s project in Dhundi has been so successful that the state of Gujarat started replicating the scheme in 2018 for all interested farmers under an initiative called Suryashakti Kisan Yojana, which translates to solar power project for farmers. And India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy now subsidizes and provides low-interest loans for solar-powered irrigation among farmers.</p>



<p>“The main thing about climate-smart agriculture is that everything we do has to have less carbon footprint,” says Aditi Mukherji, Verma’s colleague and an author of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-united-nations-ipcc-report-people-nature">February’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 7</em>). “That is the biggest challenge. How do you make something with a low carbon footprint, without having a negative impact on income and productivity?” Mukherji is the regional project leader for <a href="https://solar.iwmi.org/">Solar Irrigation for Agricultural Resilience in South Asia</a>, an IWMI project looking at various solar irrigation solutions in South Asia.</p>



<p>Back in Anantapur, “there is also a visible change in the vegetation in our district,” Reddy says. “Earlier, there might not be any trees till the eye can see in many parts of the district. Now there is no place which doesn’t have at least 20 trees in your line of sight. It’s a small change, but extremely significant for our dry region.” And Ramesh and other farmers now enjoy a stable, sustainable income from farming.</p>

<p>“When I was growing groundnuts, I used to sell it to the local markets,” Ramesh says. He now sells directly to city dwellers through WhatsApp groups. And one of India’s largest online grocery stores, bigbasket.com, and others have started purchasing directly from him to meet a growing demand for organic and “clean” fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p>“I’m confident now that my children too can take up farming and make a good living if they want to,” Ramesh says. “I didn’t feel the same way before discovering these nonchemical farming practices.”</p>

<p>This week in <em>Research Highlights</em>, our new post series highlighting recent noteworthy studies from across PLOS journals, <em>PLOS Genetics</em> authors Natasha Barrios at the Universidad Austral de Chile, Chile, Elaine Ostrander at the National Institutes of Health, US, and colleagues have found that Modern day Patagonian sheepdogs are the closest living relative to now-extinct varieties of herding dogs of Victorian-era Britain. Learn more about the study design and the authors&rsquo; findings below or jump to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full study</a> on our journal site.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>In the article, the authors explain that European settlers colonizing new lands often took their working dogs with them, and this shared history is reflected in the genome of modern dog breeds. The Patagonian sheepdog is a distinct variety from southern Chile and Argentina, thought to have been introduced by European colonists in the late 1800s. But it is not recognized as a formal breed and its relationship to modern herding dogs is poorly understood.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Study design and findings</strong></p>



<p>The researchers genotyped 159 Patagonian sheepdogs from Chile and the Chubut province in Argentina and used published data for 175 recognized domestic dog breeds and two wild dog species to create a phylogenetic tree. They found that Patagonian sheepdogs are most closely related to Border collies and Australian kelpies and share a common ancestor with modern herding breeds from the UK around 150 years ago. They identified distinct populations in the north and south of Patagonia, separated by the Patagonian ice fields. Northern populations are more genetically similar to Border collies, while southern populations are more closely related to the Australian kelpie.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>This population structure mirrors the pattern and timing of European colonization of the region, in which Scottish settlers first migrated from the Falkland Islands to southern Chile in 1877, before later moving north into the Ays&eacute;n region and Argentina. The first sheepdogs were likely introduced to Patagonia before the formalization of dog breeds in the late 1800s, suggesting that modern Patagonian sheepdogs are the closest living representatives of the foundational sheepdog &ndash; the ancestor of modern herding breeds from the UK &ndash; and probably look and behave quite similarly, the authors say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers add, &ldquo;Using a variety of genomic approaches, we ascertain the relationship between this dog population and modern herding breeds. We propose that the Patagonian sheepdog is the closest living representative of the common ancestor of modern UK herding breeds. These findings, in turn, increase our understanding of human migratory events at the time.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-children-sacrifice-ayahuasca-chemical">A special brew may have calmed Inca children headed for sacrifice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two Inca children slated for ritual sacrifice more than 500 years ago quaffed a special soothing concoction that has gone undetected until now.</p>



<p>Those young victims, most likely a girl and a boy roughly 4 to 8 years old, drank a liquid that may have lightened their moods and calmed their nerves in the days or weeks before they were ceremonially killed and buried on Peru’s Ampato mountain, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>The youngsters’ bodies contained chemical remnants from one of the primary ingredients of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-pouch-reveals-hallucinogen-stash-andes-shaman">ayahuasca, a liquid concoction known for its hallucinogenic effects</a>, say bioarchaeologist Dagmara Socha of the University of Warsaw, Poland, and her colleagues (<em>SN: 5/6/19</em>). Analyses focused on hair from the girl’s naturally mummified body and fingernails from the boy’s partially mummified remains.</p>





<p>While no molecular signs of ayahuasca’s strong hallucinogens appeared in those remains, the team did find <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103415">traces of harmine and harmaline</a>, chemical products of <em>Banisteriopsis</em> <em>caapi</em> vines, Socha’s group reports in the June <em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>. In ayahuasca, <em>B. caapi</em> amplifies the strength of other more hallucinogenic ingredients.</p>



<p>Recent investigations with rodents suggest that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05407-9">solutions containing harmine affect the brain much like some antidepressant drugs do</a>. “This is the first [evidence] that <em>B. caapi</em> could have been used in the past for its antidepressant properties,” Socha says.</p>



<p>While research on whether harmine can lessen depression or anxiety in people is in its infancy, archaeologist Christine VanPool of the University of Missouri, Columbia, thinks it’s possible that the ingredient was used on purpose. Spanish documents written after the fall of the Inca empire say that alcohol was used to calm those about to be sacrificed, so other brews may have been used too, speculates VanPool, who was not part of Socha’s team.</p>



<p>“I tentatively say yes, the Inca understood that <em>B. caapi</em> reduced anxiety in sacrificial victims,” she says.</p>



<p>Spanish chroniclers may have mistakenly assumed that Inca sacrifice victims drank a popular corn beer known as chicha rather than a <em>B. caapi</em> beverage, Socha suspects. No evidence of alcohol appeared in molecular analyses of the Ampato mountain children. But alcohol consumed just before being sacrificed would have gone undetected in the researchers’ tests.</p>



<p>Trace evidence did also indicate that both children had chewed coca leaves in the weeks leading up to their deaths. Spanish written accounts described the widespread use of coca leaves during Inca rites of passage. Those events included ritual sacrifices of children and young women, who were believed to become envoys to various local gods after death.</p>

<p>The sacrificed children <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/archaeology-13">were found during a 1995 expedition</a> near the summit of Ampato (<em>SN: 11/11/95</em>). It would have taken at least two weeks and possibly several months for the pair of Inca children to complete a pilgrimage from wherever their homes were located to the capital city of Cuzco for official ceremonies and then to Ampato mountain, Socha says.</p>



<p>Giving those kids a calming <em>B. caapi</em> drink as well as coca leaves to chew doesn’t surprise archaeologist Lidio Valdez of the University of Calgary, who did not participate in the new study. Children may not have understood that they were going to die, but they had to endure the rigors and loneliness of a long trip while separated from their families, he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Valdez suspects Ampato mountain was originally called Qampato, a word meaning <em>toad</em> in the Inca language. Andean societies such as the Inca associated toads with water or rain. “The mountain was also likely linked with water or rain and the children perhaps sacrificed to ask the mountain gods to send water,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">NASA’s InSight lander has recorded the largest Marsquake yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any Martians out there should learn to duck and cover.</p>



<p>On May 4, the Red Planet was rocked by a roughly magnitude 5 temblor, <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-records-monster-quake-on-mars">the largest Marsquake detected to date</a>, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., reports. The shaking lasted for more than six hours and released more than 10 times the energy of the previous record-holding quake.</p>



<p>The U.S. space agency’s InSight lander, which has been studying Mars’ deep interior since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">touching down on the planet in 2018</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/18</em>), recorded the event. The quake probably originated near the Cerberus Fossae region, which is more than 1,000 kilometers from the lander.</p>





<p>Cerberus Fossae is known for its fractured surface and frequent rockfalls. It makes sense that the ground would be shifting there, says geophysicist Philippe Lognonné, principal investigator of the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, InSight’s seismometer. “It’s an ancient volcanic bulge.”</p>



<p>Just like earthquakes reveal information about our planet’s interior structure, Marsquakes can be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">probe what lies beneath Mars’ surface</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>). And a lot can be learned from studying this whopper of a quake, says Lognonné, of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris. “The signal is so good, we’ll be able to work on the details.”</p>

<p><strong>From carefully avoiding cracks in the pavement to saluting every magpie that you meet, superstitious behaviour is really common.</strong> But why do we have superstitions? Where do they come from? And are they helpful or harmful?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/">Ginny Smith</a> talks to <a href="https://stuartvyse.com/">Stuart Vyse</a>, former professor of psychology at Connecticut College and author of <em>Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition</em>. Ginny also chats to <a href="https://communication.ucdavis.edu/people/ldt">Laramie Taylor</a>, professor of communication at the University of California Davis, who explains how superstition and magical thinking is linked to being a fan of both fiction and sports.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-nest-sturdy-physics">Experiments hint at why bird nests are so sturdy</a></h4>

              
                <p>To build its nest, a bird won’t go for any old twig. Somehow, birds pick and choose material that will create a cozy, sturdy nest.</p>



<p>“That’s just totally mystifying to me,” says physicist Hunter King of the University of Akron in Ohio. Birds seem to have a sense for how the properties of an individual stick will translate to the characteristics of the nest. That relationship “is something we don’t know the first thing about predicting,” King says.</p>





<p>A bird’s nest is a special version of a granular material: a substance, such as sand, made up of many smaller objects (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). King and colleagues combined laboratory experiments and computer simulations to better understand the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/8e074Y5fZ6d1a27c828d1768a5ab18a512f96b9b9">quirks of nestlike granular materials</a>, the researchers report in a study to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>In the experiments, a piston repeatedly compressed 460 bamboo rods scattered inside a cylinder. The computer simulations let researchers analyze the points where sticks touched, which is key to understanding the material, the team says.</p>



<p>The more force the piston applied to the pile, the stiffer the pile became, meaning it resisted further deformation. As the piston bore down, sticks slid against one another, and the contact points between them rearranged. That stiffened the pile by allowing additional contact points to form between sticks, which prevented them from flexing further, the simulations showed.</p>



<p>Changes in the pile&#8217;s stiffness seemed to lag behind the piston’s motion, a phenomenon called hysteresis. That effect caused the pile to be stiffer when the piston pushed in than when the material bounced back as the piston retracted. Simulations suggest that the hysteresis arose because the initial friction between sticks needed to be overcome before the contact points started to rearrange.</p>



<p>Beyond bird nests, this research could be applied to other materials made of disordered arrangements of long fibers, such as felt. With a better understanding of the physical qualities of such materials, engineers could use them to create new structures designed to protect not only bird eggs, but other cargo that humans consider precious.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prehistoric-people-fire-light-dynamic-art">Prehistoric people may have used light from fires to create dynamic art</a></h4>

              
                <p>Prehistoric people may have used firelight to create the illusion of movement in their art.</p>



<p>An analysis of 50 engraved stones excavated in France suggests that when the stones were placed near a fire, the flickering light made the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266146#sec005">engraved animal</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266146#sec005">s</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266146#sec005"> seem to move</a>, researchers report April 20 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>These stones, or “plaquettes,” were found in the 1860s in a rock-shelter called Montastruc, and are engraved with animals such as horses, ibex and deer. The site was used by Magdalenian people, hunter-gatherers who inhabited the area between 23,000 and 14,000 years ago.</p>





<p>The researchers analyzed heat damage on the stones, which was indicative of them being directly exposed to high temperatures for a prolonged period, and created 3-D models of the plaquettes. Those models were imported to a virtual reality software where they were placed next to a virtual hearth so that the areas of heat damage were closest to the flames, mimicking how the stones may have been placed in real life. The researchers then observed the visual effects of the virtual reality light.</p>



<p>It was surprising to see how dynamic the art was and “how changed your experience of the art was by a simple thing, just putting it close to a fire,” says Andy Needham, an archaeologist at the University of York in England. The work suggests that the artists purposely engraved along the contours of the rock to influence viewers to see meaningful movement through the random pattern of firelight, he says.</p>



<p>The finding adds to archaeologists’ understandings of the relationship between early people’s artwork and fire. Another recent study found that Stone Age humans created “hidden” art in dark caves which could be illuminated and made visible only with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-cave-art-lighting-torch-lamp">help of the right lighting</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">We finally have an image of the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a new addition to astronomers’ portrait gallery of black holes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Astronomers announced May 12 that they have finally assembled an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This image shows a bright ring surrounding the darkness, the telltale sign of the shadow of the black hole,” astrophysicist Feryal Özel of the University of Arizona in Tucson said at a news conference announcing the result.</p>



<p>The black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, appears as a faint silhouette amidst the glowing material that surrounds it. The image reveals the turbulent, twisting region immediately surrounding the black hole in new detail. The findings also were published May 12 in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_First_Sgr_A_Results">6 studies</a> in the<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>





<p>A planet-spanning network of radio telescopes, known as the Event Horizon Telescope, worked together to create this much-anticipated look at the Milky Way’s giant. Three years ago, the same team released the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first-ever image of a supermassive black hole</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That object sits at the center of the galaxy M87, about 55 million light-years from Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* for short, is “humanity&#8217;s black hole,” says astrophysicist Sera Markoff of the University of Amsterdam, and a member of the EHT collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 27,000 light-years away, the behemoth is the closest giant black hole to Earth. That proximity means that Sgr A* is the most-studied supermassive black hole in the universe. Yet Sgr A* and others like it remain some of the most mysterious objects ever found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because, like all black holes, Sgr A* is an object so dense that its gravitational pull won’t let light escape. Black holes are “natural keepers of their own secrets,” says physicist Lena Murchikova of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who is not part of the EHT team. Their gravity traps light that falls within a border called the event horizon. EHT’s images of Sgr A* and the M87 black hole skirt up to that inescapable edge.</p>

</div><figcaption>This sonification is a translation into sound of the Event Horizon Telescope’s image of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The sonification sweeps clockwise around the black hole image. Material closer to the black hole orbits faster than material farther away. Here, the faster-moving material is heard at higher frequencies. Very low tones represent material outside the black hole’s main ring. Louder volume indicates brighter spots in the image.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sgr A* feeds on hot material pushed off of massive stars at the galactic center. That gas, drawn toward Sgr A* by its gravitational pull, flows into a surrounding disk of glowing material, called an accretion disk. The disk, the stars and an outer bubble of X-ray light “are like an ecosystem,” says astrophysicist Daryl Haggard of McGill University in Montreal and a member of the EHT collaboration. “They&#8217;re completely tied together.”</p>



<p>That accretion disk is where the action is — as the gas moves within immensely strong magnetic fields — so astronomers want to know more about how the disk works.</p>



<p>Like the majority of supermassive black holes,&nbsp; Sgr A* is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/accretion-disk-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole">quiet and faint</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/19 </em>). The black hole eats only a few morsels fed to it by its accretion disk. Still, “it&#8217;s always been a little bit of a puzzle why it&#8217;s so, so faint,” says astrophysicist Meg Urry of Yale University, who is not part of the EHT collaboration. M87’s black hole, in comparison, is a monster gorging on nearby material and shooting out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-m87-galaxy-jets-plasma-simulation">enormous, powerful jets</a> (<em>SN: 11/10/21</em>). But that doesn’t mean Sgr A* isn’t producing light. Astrophysicists have seen its region feebly glowing in radio waves,<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf71f"> jittering in infrared and burping in X-rays</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, the accretion disk around Sgr A* seems to constantly flicker and simmer. This variability, the constant flickering, is like a froth on top of ocean waves, Markoff says. “​​And so we&#8217;re seeing this froth that is coming up from all this activity, and we&#8217;re trying to understand the waves underneath the froth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The big question, she adds, has been if astronomers would be able to see something changing in those waves with EHT.&nbsp;In the new work, they’ve seen <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac6675">hints of those changes</a> below the froth, but the full analysis is still ongoing.</p>



<p>By combining about 3.5 petabytes of data, or the equivalent of about 100 million TikTok videos, captured in April 2017, researchers could begin to piece together the picture. To tease out an image from the initial massive jumble of data, the EHT team needed years of work, complicated computer simulations and observations in various types of light from other telescopes.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Scientists created a vast library of computer simulations of Sagittarius A* (one shown) to explore the turbulent flow of hot gas that rings the black hole. That rapid flow causes the ring’s appearance to vary in brightness on timescales of minutes. Scientists compared these simulations with the newly released observations of the black hole to better understand its true properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Those “multiwavelength” data from the other telescopes were crucial to assembling the image. “By looking at these things simultaneously and all together, we&#8217;re able to come up with a complete picture,” says theorist Gibwa Musoke of the University of Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sgr A*’s variability, the constant simmering, complicated the analysis because the black hole changes on timescales of just a few minutes, changing as the researchers were imaging it. “It was like trying to take a clear picture of a running child at night,” astronomer José L. Gómez of Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía in Granada, Spain, said at a news conference announcing the result. M87 was easier to analyze because it changed over the course of weeks.</p>



<p>Ultimately, a better understanding of what is happening in the disk so close to Sgr A* could help scientists learn how many other similar supermassive black holes work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new EHT observations also confirm the mass of Sgr A* at 4 million times that of the sun. If the black hole replaced our sun, the shadow EHT imaged would sit within Mercury’s orbit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also used the image of Sgr A* to put <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">general relativity</a> to the test (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). Einstein’s steadfast theory of gravity passed: The size of the shadow matched the predictions of general relativity. By testing the theory in extreme conditions — like those around black holes — scientists hope to pinpoint any hidden weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Black hole history</h3>

<p>Scientists have previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-orbiting-black-hole-einstein-gravity-general-relativity">tested general relativity</a> by following the motions of stars that orbit very close to Sgr A* — work that also helped confirm that the object truly is a black hole (<em>SN: 7/26/18</em>). For<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-prize-2020-black-hole-roger-penrose-reinhard-genzel-andrea-ghez"> that discovery</a>, researchers Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel won a share of the Nobel Prize in physics in 2020 (<em>SN: 10/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>The two types of tests of general relativity are complementary,&nbsp; says astrophysicist Tuan Do of UCLA. “With these big physics tests, you don’t want to use just one method.” If one test appears to contradict general relativity, scientists can check for a corresponding discrepancy in the other.</p>



<p>The Event Horizon Telescope, however, tests general relativity much nearer to the black hole’s edge, which could highlight subtle effects of physics beyond general relativity. “The closer you get, the better you are in terms of being able to look for these effects,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>



<p>However, some researchers<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.024023"> have criticized</a> a similar test of general relativity made using the EHT image of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-image-einstein-general-relativity">M87’s black hole</a> (<em>SN: 10/1/20</em>). That’s because the test relies on relatively shaky assumptions about the physics of how material swirls around a black hole, says physicist Sam Gralla of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Testing general relativity in this way “would only make sense if general relativity were the weakest link,” but scientists’ confidence in general relativity is stronger than the assumptions that went into the test, he says.</p>



<p>The observations of Sgr A* provide more evidence that the object is in fact a black hole, says physicist Nicolas Yunes of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “It’s really exciting to have the first image of a black hole that is in our own Milky Way. It’s fantastic.” It sparks the imagination, like early pictures astronauts took of Earth from the moon, he says.</p>



<p>This won’t be the last eye-catching image of Sgr A* from EHT.&nbsp;Additional observations, made in 2018,&nbsp;2021 and 2022, are still waiting to be analyzed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is our closest supermassive black hole,” Haggard says. “It is like our closest friend and neighbor. And we&#8217;ve been studying it for years as a community. [This image is a] really profound addition to this exciting black hole we&#8217;ve all kind of fallen in love with in our careers.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/12/a-religious-upbringing-strengthens-childrens-belief-in-divine-miracles-but-not-magic/">A religious upbringing strengthens children’s belief in divine miracles, but not magic</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Children are exposed to all kinds of stories, fact and fiction. Books about figures such as <a href="https://littlepeoplebigdreams.com/book/rosa-parks/">Rosa Parks</a> or <a href="https://littlepeoplebigdreams.com/book/jesse-owens/">Jesse Owens</a> teach young people about history, while novels are populated with colourful characters like Harry Potter or Bilbo Baggins. Religious figures often represent a middle ground, both real and fantastical. So how do children differentiate between fantasy and real life figures — and how does religious teaching affect the way they make these kinds of distinctions?</p>



<p>A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-021-01270-2">new study</a>, published in <em>Memory &amp; Cognition,</em> finds that a religious upbringing leads kids to judge religious stories as real. But, interestingly, this doesn’t seem to make non-religious magical stories seem real.</p>



<span id="more-46193"></span>



<p>Participants were 85 children in Tehran; half were aged between 5 and 6, and half 9 to 10. The children were presented with twelve stories: three realistic, three magical, three religious and three unusual.</p>



<p>In the realistic stories, only physically possible events occurred (e.g. a character feeds a hungry town by buying bread from a far-away city). In the magical condition, magical powers or fairies resolved the story (e.g. the character conjures bread from thin air). In the religious versions, the story was resolved through divine intervention (e.g. a character makes bread with powers given by God); and in the unusual condition, the story was resolved through implausible events (e.g. a character finds bread in a forest). After reading the stories the children were asked to categorise them, indicating whether they thought either the event or the character in the story was &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;pretend&#8221;, and then explaining why they had made their decision.</p>



<p>Older children were more likely than younger children to judge stories as real — except when stories were magical, which younger children were more likely to judge as real. Older children were also more likely to judge religious stories specifically as real compared to younger children. That is, they differentiated between religious and magical stories in a way that younger children did not.</p>



<p>Older children referred to causal mechanisms more than younger children when it came to justifying why they had categorised the story as real or pretend. For instance, they might say religious stories were real because God is able to help anyone in any way. &nbsp;But this reference to causality was particularly common when older children justified their &#8220;pretend&#8221; judgements for magical stories, denying that things could be caused by magic. This suggests that “religious exposure does not commit children to an unconstrained conception of causality where causal violations are generally possible”, say the authors.</p>



<p>The team suggest that as children get older and are more exposed to religion, they are more likely to accept causally impossible occurrences in religious contexts compared to magical or unusual contexts. This strengthens previous research that suggests that religious education can change children’s reasoning about what is and is not possible in a way that does not happen in other domains.</p>



<p>Future research could look at different cultural settings — the participants in this study were Muslim and living in a country where religious values are part of everyday life, so studies that look at Christianity, Judaism or other religions in different, perhaps secular, countries would also be interesting. Overall, however, the study shows the impact of religious education, how it can affirm the possibility of divine causation, and how this differs from ideas about magic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machine-learning-gravity-earthquake-ai">Machine learning and gravity signals could rapidly detect big earthquakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massive earthquakes don’t just move the ground — they make speed-of-light adjustments to Earth’s gravitational field. Now, researchers have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04672-7">trained computers to identify these tiny gravitational signals</a>, demonstrating how the signals can be used to mark the location and size of a strong quake almost instantaneously.</p>



<p>It’s a first step to creating a very early warning system for the planet’s most powerful quakes, scientists report May 11 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Such a system could help solve a thorny problem in seismology: how to quickly pin down the true magnitude of a massive quake immediately after it happens, says Andrea Licciardi, a geophysicist at the Université Côte d’Azur in Nice, France. Without that ability, it’s much harder to swiftly and effectively issue hazard warnings that could save lives.</p>





<p>As large earthquakes rupture, the shaking and shuddering sends seismic waves through the ground that appear as large wiggles on seismometers. But current seismic wave–based detection methods notoriously have difficulty distinguishing between, say, a magnitude 7.5 and magnitude 9 quake in the few seconds following such an event.</p>



<p>That’s because the initial estimations of magnitude are based on the height of seismic waves called P waves, which are the first to arrive at monitoring stations. Yet for the strongest quakes, those initial P wave amplitudes max out, making quakes of different magnitudes hard to tell apart.</p>



<p>But seismic waves aren’t the earliest signs of a quake. All of that mass moving around in a big earthquake also changes the density of the rocks at different locations. Those shifts in density translate to tiny changes in Earth’s gravitational field, producing “elastogravity” waves that travel through the ground at the speed of light — even faster than seismic waves.</p>



<p>Such signals were once thought to be too tiny to detect, says seismologist Martin Vallée of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, who was not involved in the new study. Then in 2017, Vallée and his colleagues were <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao0746">the first to report seeing these elastogravity signals</a> in seismic station data. Those findings proved that “you have a window in between the start of the earthquake and the time at which you receive the [seismic] waves,” Vallée says.</p>



<p>But researchers still pondered over how to turn these elastogravity signals into an effective early warning system. Because gravity wiggles are tiny, they are difficult to distinguish from background noise in seismic data. When scientists looked retroactively, they found that only six mega-earthquakes in the last 30 years have generated identifiable elastogravity signals, including the magnitude 9 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-quake-location-surprise">Tohoku-Oki earthquake</a> in 2011 that produced a devastating tsunami that flooded two nuclear power plants in Fukushima, Japan (<em>SN: 3/16/11</em>). (A P wave–based initial estimate of that quake’s magnitude was 7.9.)</p>



<p>That’s where computers can come in, Licciardi says. He and his colleagues created PEGSNet, a machine learning network designed to identify “Prompt ElastoGravity Signals.” The researchers trained the machines on a combination of real seismic data collected in Japan and 500,000 simulated gravity signals for earthquakes in the same region. The synthetic gravity data are essential for the training, Licciardi says, because the real data are so scarce, and the machine learning model requires enough input to be able to find patterns in the data.</p>



<p>Once trained, the computers were then given a test: Track the origin and evolution of the 2011 Tohoku quake as though it were happening in real time. The result was promising, Licciardi says. The algorithm was able to accurately identify both the magnitude and location of the quake five to 10 seconds earlier than other methods.</p>



<p>This study is a proof of concept and hopefully the basis for a prototype of an early warning system, Licciardi says. “Right now, it’s tailored to work … in Japan. We want to build something that can work in other areas” known for powerful quakes, including Chile and Alaska. Eventually, the hope is to build one system that can work globally.</p>



<p>The results show that PEGSNet has the potential to be a powerful tool for early earthquake warnings, particularly when used alongside other earthquake-detection tools, Vallée says.</p>



<p>Still, more work needs to be done. For one thing, the algorithm was trained to look for a single point for an earthquake’s origin, which is a reasonable approximation if you’re far away. But close-up, the origin of a quake no longer looks like a point, it’s actually a larger region that has ruptured. If scientists want an accurate estimate of where a rupture happened in the future, the machines need to look for regions, not points, Vallée adds.</p>



<p>Bigger advances could come in the future as researchers develop much more sensitive instruments that can detect even tinier quake-caused perturbations to Earth’s gravitational field while filtering out other sources of background noise that might obscure the signals. Earth, Vallée says, is a very noisy environment, from its oceans to its atmosphere.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit the same as the challenge that physicists face when they try to observe gravitational waves,” Vallée says. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">ripples in spacetime, triggered by colossal cosmic collisions</a>, are a very different type of gravity-driven wave (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). But gravitational wave signals are also dwarfed by Earth’s noisiness — in this case, microtremors in the ground.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-drugs-treatments-latest-news">Here’s the latest good and bad news about COVID-19 drugs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe you’ve heard that the pandemic is over in the United States. (It’s not.) Masks are no longer required in most places and large gatherings are becoming commonplace again. Most of the country is in the green, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view">tracking site</a>, which monitors COVID-19 transmission and hospitalization rates. Many people have been relying on vaccines to control outbreaks, and there is renewed attention on getting newly available treatments to sick people.</p>



<p>But coronavirus cases are on the rise again with <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=Risk&amp;null=Risk">more than a quarter of counties </a>reporting high levels of transmission. And those are official numbers. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/covid-ba2-omicron-invisible-wave/629708/">No one really knows</a> how many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">at-home tests come back positive</a> and are never reported (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). Those cases are driving hospitalization rates up, with pockets of yellow and orange popping up on the CDC’s map, indicating that hospitals are entering the danger zone for being overwhelmed. Deaths have remained fairly low. That could change if another wave of infection sweeps the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe we think we’re on the edge of the woods, but we’re not out of it yet,” says Mark Denison, a coronavirus researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p>

<p>Preventing hospitalizations and deaths is what vaccines were designed to do, but even the very good COVID-19 vaccines aren’t perfect. And with new immune-evasive variants of the coronavirus, even vaccinated people and those who previously had COVID-19 &nbsp;— particularly the elderly or people with weakened immune systems or other health concerns — can wind up in the hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next line of defense against that bad outcome are three antiviral drugs and a monoclonal antibody that may keep people newly diagnosed with COVID-19 from becoming severely ill and dying.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>The test-to-treat initiative</h4>



<p>About 20,000 pharmacies, hospitals, urgent care centers and other places have the antiviral pills Paxlovid (a combo of two medications), made by Pfizer. The federal government plans to extend that number to<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/26/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-white-house-covid-19-response-coordinator-dr-ashish-jha/"> 40,000 in the coming weeks</a>, Ashish Jha, the White House COVID Response director, said April 26 during a news briefing. Many of those sites also have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda">molnupiravir</a> (Logevrio) antiviral pills, made by Merck (<em>SN:12/2/21</em>). The expansion is part of the federal government’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2022/04/29/additional-support-arrives-for-the-covid-19-test-to-treat-program/?sh=129c309b12b9">test-to-treat initiative</a> to make testing and treatment widely available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In much more limited supply are intravenous doses of monoclonal antibodies and the antiviral drug remdesivir — the only antiviral drug fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One preventative treatment is a monoclonal antibody called Evusheld. It is for people with weakened immune systems who may not respond to vaccines or who can’t be vaccinated. In a clinical trial, it <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116620">reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infections by 82 percent</a> compared with a placebo, researchers reported April 20 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That treatment is plentiful but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/evusheld-covid-treatment.html">isn’t being used much</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">Remdesivir</a>, or Veklury as its maker Gilead Sciences calls it, was approved by the FDA in 2020 for treating hospitalized patients (<em>SN:4/29/20</em>). A recent clinical trial showed that the drug <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116846">reduced the chance of hospitalization by 87 percent</a> in nonhospitalized people at high risk of severe disease, researchers reported in the January 27 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Such positive results prompted the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-actions-expand-use-treatment-outpatients-mild-moderate-covid-19">FDA to expand its approval to outpatient use</a> in people 12 and older. Then on April 25, the FDA authorized the drug to be<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-approves-first-covid-19-treatment-young-children"> used in children 12 and younger</a>, making it the first antiviral COVID-19 treatment available for young kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main downside to remdesivir is that it has to be administered intravenously. “There’s nothing convenient about that,” says Abraar Karan, an infectious diseases physician at Stanford University. Researchers are working on an oral form of remdesivir. Early experiments suggest it’s <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abm3410">effective at protecting mice</a> against severe illness. Tests still have to be done to see if it works for people, too.</p>



<p>Two other drugs, Paxlovid and molnupiravir, come in pill form. They are theoretically more readily available, but many people don’t know about them or how to get them. And some <a href="https://twitter.com/dianaberrent/status/1520920108801175552">social media posts</a> suggest that it’s not as easy as it sounds for everyone to lay their hands on the drugs after a positive COVID-19 test, even when they do know about them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not as simple as, ‘We have a pill, now everything is solved,’” Karan says.</p>



<p>That’s partly because some doctors aren’t aware that they can or should prescribe the drugs for their high-risk patients who get infected with the coronavirus, says Jason Gallagher, a pharmacist and infectious diseases doctor at Temple University in Philadelphia. “There’s a lot of education that needs to occur on the medical side, also,” he says.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Ideally, people would talk to their doctors about whether they are candidates for the drugs before they get infected, Karan says. And people who don’t have a doctor need to know their options, because timing is important: The pills need to be started within three to five days of symptoms appearing.</p>



<p>Access to the drugs is getting better, but it’s still patchy. In the interest of being prepared, I went to <a href="https://www.covid.gov/">COVID.gov</a> to learn about where I could get the drugs in case I catch the coronavirus. I’m relatively lucky. There are seven <a href="https://covid-19-test-to-treat-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/">test-to-treat sites </a>within five miles of my house just outside of Washington, D.C., though one is a military hospital not open to the general public.&nbsp;And I spoke to my doctor to ask if I should take Paxlovid if I get COVID-19. He said I should and that if I do a home test, I can call with the result, and he will call a prescription in to my pharmacy.</p>



<p>My mom in rural Nebraska is in a different situation. She would have to drive more than 25 miles to the nearest test-to-treat site. Many other rural areas have pharmacies that can fill prescriptions, but people would have to go elsewhere to be tested and get a doctor to prescribe the medication. For instance, residents of Gypsum, Colo., would have to get tested somewhere, get a prescription from a doctor, drive about six miles to get the prescription filled, or travel nearly 100 miles to the Denver suburbs for a test-to-treat site.</p>



<h4>Drawbacks to these drugs</h4>



<p>There are other wrinkles besides access to using the drugs. “For all of the therapeutics, they have been studied primarily in unvaccinated people who are at risk of going on to develop severe disease,” says Gallagher. “So we basically end up projecting that data onto the population we have now, which is largely vaccinated.” It’s not clear that every person who has health conditions that put them at risk needs the drugs, especially if they have gotten a vaccine booster shot. The drugs might decrease symptoms, but there’s no real evidence to show they’re effective in making people feel better faster, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drugs are good at keeping people out of the hospital, though. Paxlovid reduced the relative risk of hospitalization and death by <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2118542">about 89 percent</a>, researchers reported in the April 14 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Its side effects included a distorted sense of taste, and a small number of people developed diarrhea.&nbsp;</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>A bigger drawback is one of the drugs in the Paxlovid combo. Paxlovid’s main drug, nirmatrelvir, works by inhibiting an enzyme that the virus needs to replicate. It is taken with a drug called ritonavir, which keeps nirmatrelvir from being broken down by enzymes in the body. Ritonavir can react with other medications, like cholesterol-lowering statins, making levels of those medications in the body dangerously high. There are ways to work around that, though, Gallagher says. For instance, cholesterol-lowering medications could be halted for a short time. “I can’t think of a single person who can’t stop taking those for a week or two” while being treated for COVID-19, he says.</p>



<p>Another wrinkle is relapse. One <a href="https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1588371/v1/48342d2c-b3ea-4228-b600-168fca1fded7.pdf?c=1650977883">preprint</a> and other <a href="https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/yes-relapses-after-paxlovid-happen-now-what/2022/04/25/">anecdotal accounts</a> have reported that some people have relapses of the virus a few days after stopping Paxlovid. No one really knows how common that is or why it happens. The U.S. National Institutes of Health are collaborating with the CDC and the FDA to better understand the phenomenon, according to a statement the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sent to me. But the agencies have no formal studies underway.</p>



<p>Experts I talked to had some ideas about what might be happening. It could be that the immune system “chills out” while people are taking the drug, giving the virus the opportunity to rebound once the drug is stopped, Gallagher speculates. Or the virus might hide in certain places in the body that the drug has trouble reaching, Denison says. Both of those situations might be solved by giving people the drug for longer, they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-updates-paxlovid-health-care-providers">FDA rejected that suggestion</a> in a post citing John Farley, director of the agency’s Office of Infectious Diseases. Similar relapses happened to people taking placebo pills in Pfizer’s clinical trial of the drug, so the viral rebound may not be related to taking the drug, Farley stressed. And there has been no indication that people get sicker and are hospitalized after a relapse. There’s also no data to say whether people would benefit from taking Paxlovid longer or getting another round of the pills if they have a relapse, he said.</p>



<p>Resistance to the drug is another reason infections might relapse. “I think drug resistance is the least likely explanation,” says Denison. For resistance to develop, the virus has to replicate, which it can’t do when the drug is around. Still, researchers should watch for mutations in viruses taken from relapsed patients that might indicate resistance, he says.</p>



<p>None of the drugs are likely to prevent waves of infection. For instance, Paxlovid <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-shares-top-line-results-phase-23-epic-pep-study">slightly reduced the chance of contracting COVID-19</a> in people who were exposed to infected household members, but the result wasn’t statistically meaningful, Pfizer reported April 29 in a news release. That means it’s not great as a preventative and won’t affect case counts.</p>



<p>“What [the drugs] could flatten is a surge in hospitalizations and deaths,” Gallagher says. But, he notes, people at high risk of severe disease should not rely on the drugs alone to save them. “I don’t think that any of these therapeutics is as good as a booster.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Manal Helal will talk about a paper &quot;Tensor
Decomposition with Relational Constraints for Predicting Multiple Types of
microRNA-disease Associations&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in multifarious biological processes
associated with human diseases. Identifying potential miRNA-disease
associations contributes to understanding the molecular mechanisms of
miRNA-related diseases. Most of the existing computational methods mainly focus
on predicting whether a miRNA-disease association exists or not. However, the
roles of miRNAs in diseases are prominently diverged, for instance, Genetic
variants of microRNA (mir-15) may affect expression level of miRNAs leading to
B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while circulating miRNAs (including
mir-1246, mir-1307-3p, etc.) have potentials to detecting breast cancer in the
early stage. In this paper, we aim to predict multi-type miRNA-disease
associations instead of taking them as binary. To this end, we innovatively
represent miRNA-disease-type triplets as a tensor and introduce Tensor
Decomposition methods to solve the prediction task. Experimental results on two
widely-adopted miRNA-disease datasets: HMDD v2.0 and HMDD v3.2 show that tensor
decomposition methods improve a recent baseline in a large scale (up to 38% in
top-1 F1). We further propose a novel method, Tensor Decomposition with
Relational Constraints (TDRC), which incorporates biological features as
relational constraints to further the existing tensor decomposition methods.
Compared with two existing tensor decomposition methods, TDRC can produce
better performance while being more efficient.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/11/heres-how-actors-differ-in-their-ability-to-read-their-own-bodily-signals/">Here’s how actors differ in their ability to read their own bodily signals</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How is it that some people can slip into another character so perfectly that they win acting plaudits, while the rest of us struggle to act at all?</p>



<p>Good actors have to convincingly convey a range of emotions. And one way that we feel and control our own emotions is by tuning into bodily signals — such as the more rapid heartbeat that comes with excitement, joy or fear. So, reasoned Peter Sokol-Hessner at the University of Denver and colleagues, perhaps actors are better at sensing these signals — a process known as interoception.</p>



<span id="more-46177"></span>



<p>For <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53427-001">their study</a>, published in <em>Emotion</em>, the team recruited a total of 26 current and former graduates of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts Graduate Acting Program plus a group of 11 other people with extensive acting experience. The control group consisted of 29 people with none or very little acting experience.</p>



<p>The participants were fitted with ECG electrodes, to monitor their heartbeats. In each trial, they were played 10 tones. The researchers controlled the timing of the tones, so that they were either in-sync with the participant’s heartbeat, or out of sync. The participants were not allowed to feel for their pulse during this time; instead they had to try to sense or guess whether the tones were in or out of sync. This task measured their &#8220;interoceptive accuracy&#8221;. They also had to report on how confident they were in their answer. This assessed their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051114002294">metacognitive awareness </a>of their accuracy. Each participant completed 160 trials.</p>



<p>The results were clear: non-actors were just as good at actors at judging whether the tones were in or out of sync with their heartbeat — they had very similar levels of interoceptive accuracy. But actors scored better on metacognitive awareness: on trials when they indicated not being confident in their answer, they were indeed more likely to be wrong, but when they were confident, they were more likely to be right. This result fits with earlier research finding that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZigEDvbsGb8">interoceptive accuracy and metacognitive awareness of this are separate constructs</a>. Earlier studies have also found that people who are better judges of their inner sensing accuracy have richer emotional experiences, feel more empathy and are better at regulating their emotions. So actors’ better metacognitive awareness might indeed help them to better create, express and convey emotion.</p>



<p>The team also looked at the Tisch actors’ academic scores on various aspects of acting. And they found that those who’d got better scores for Mimicry (copying a posture) and Movement (navigating obstacles without knocking them over) had better metacognitive scores. This suggests that perhaps, among actors, better awareness of inner sensing accuracy aids better acting (or at least aspects of acting; the team did not find a link between metacognitive ability and scores on Audition, an overall evaluation of their acting performance). However, the sample size in this analysis was only 19. As the researchers note, this should be considered a preliminary result.</p>



<p>A bigger question is: what explains the difference in metacognitive awareness of interoception between actors and non-actors? Is this the result of their acting training — or were they like that to start with?</p>



<p>To try to address this, the team explored whether there was a link between the duration each individual Tisch actor had studied at the school and their metacognitive ability. There wasn’t. This suggests that acting training did not explain their better scores — but, rather, superior metacognitive awareness helped them into acting. However, time spent at grad school didn’t capture participants’ lifetime experience of acting training and practice, so these results should be considered tentative. It would certainly be worth exploring this further, though — if elements of acting training can in fact enhance metacognitive awareness, perhaps this training could help to improve the emotional lives of other people.</p>



<p>For now, though, when it comes to the interoceptive abilities of actors vs no-actors, “these data establish for the first time that there is a quantitative, objective difference in the first place,” the team writes. And that’s certainly an interesting finding in itself.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53427-001">The actor’s insight: Actors have comparable interoception but better metacognition than nonactors.</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-diet-western-norm-change-food-preferences">Eating meat is the Western norm. But norms can change</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">When my friend Julie Babulski was a freshman in high school in the mid-1990s, she decided to stop eating meat. “I loved animals. I couldn’t see them suffering,” Babulski says. “The fact that it pissed off my mom was an added, happy bonus.”</p>



<p>For her meat-loving family of Polish immigrants, meals frequently featured kielbasa or bacon, Babulski says. Even the sauerkraut had meat. With such limited food options at home, teenage Babulski initially subsisted on starches and salads. Her mom, she says, thought she “was going to straight up die.”</p>



<p>Babulski, now a biologist at Monroe Community College in Rochester, N.Y., eventually learned to eat a more balanced vegetarian diet, including beans, whole grains and the occasional neon orange veggie dog. But, Babulski remembers, her mom still wished she’d give up the madness.</p>





<p>Mom was probably reacting to the fact that eating is a social activity, uniting family, friends and even strangers. Her daughter could no longer enjoy the turkey at Thanksgiving, the traditional Polish meal of fish on Christmas Eve or even the family’s “lazy pierogies” — dumplings filled with noodles, mushrooms and, of course, bits of bacon.</p>



<p>On a societal level, the decision by Babulski and others to go vegetarian can feel threatening to those who view eating animals as quintessentially American. Eating meat is the norm in the United States, says social psychologist Gregg Sparkman of Princeton University. “It’s literally the center of that Norman Rockwell painting.”</p>

<p>Yet Rockwell’s vision of meat as the star of the American meal has big drawbacks. Besides concerns about animal welfare, medical experts have long encouraged people to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-officially-raises-cancer-risk">eat less processed and red meat</a> for health reasons (<em>SN: 11/28/15, p. 9</em>). What is becoming crystal clear is that a meat-heavy diet is also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-based-diets-greenhouse-gases-environment">terrible for the planet</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/18, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Shifting demand from meat to beans, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds could have substantial benefits for the climate. In 2018, total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide were almost 49 billion metric tons. That same year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, estimated that if everyone in the world went vegan, eating only plant-based foods, global emissions could drop by roughly 16 percent in a year, or 8 billion tons.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, going vegetarian, a plant-based diet that includes dairy, eggs and the very occasional meat or seafood allowed in IPCC’s definition, resulted in a 6-billion-ton drop. For those reluctant to give up the bacon entirely, the IPCC says a less absolutist approach could still reap big benefits. The panel estimates that a flexitarian diet — reducing meat and dairy consumption by 75 percent — could cut emissions by 5 billion tons.</p>



<p>Individual behavior changes alone cannot fix a supply chain built around the mass production of meat and animal products. But a more recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">April report from the IPCC</a> suggests that the world’s wealthiest individuals could substantially decrease emissions through lifestyle changes, such as driving and flying less and eating less meat. That’s because households with incomes in the top 10 percent generate roughly 36 to 45 percent of global emissions, while households with incomes in the bottom 50 percent contribute just 13 to 15 percent. Moreover, wealthier individuals serve as role models. So those who adopt a low-carbon lifestyle can help establish new, more sustainable social norms.</p>





<p>Social norms are unwritten rules for how to behave in a given group. Norms encourage conformity. If everyone in a group wears clothes, a single member is unlikely to wander outside naked. But if people think that shedding one’s clothing is becoming the new norm, can this encourage others to follow suit? Yes, Sparkman says. “Actions you do … ripple outward and can change others.”</p>



<p>The challenge, he and others say, is sorting out how to encourage that snowball effect to transform really strong social norms, such as eating meat. These scientists are, in a sense, trying to understand how to make the abnormal appear normal. What would it take, for instance, for people to mentally swap Rockwell’s Thanksgiving turkey for something greener?</p>



<h4>Changing normal</h4>



<p>Social norms, which by design remain relatively stable across time, typically hinder social change. But research shows that people conform not just to present norms but also to perceived future norms, what Sparkman calls “preconformity.” That suggests that reframing the Julie Babulskis among us as trendsetters rather than social <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/success-fail-why-outliers-people-communities-nudges">deviants</a> could encourage others to conform to their plant-based vision of the future (<em>SN: 2/26/22, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>In that vein, Sparkman and colleagues have been testing whether giving information on changing, or “dynamic,” norms can shift people’s food choices. In a pilot study, the team surveyed café-goers at Stanford University. When the 304 mostly faculty, staff and graduate students were waiting to order, researchers handed them one of three written statements.</p>



<p>Some participants received a static norm message: “Recent research has shown that 30 percent of Americans make an effort to limit their meat consumption.” Some participants got a dynamic norm statement: “Recent research has shown that, over the last five years, 30 percent of Americans have started to make an effort to limit their meat consumption.” Participants in a control group read that people are starting to limit the time they spend on Facebook. While the static statement emphasizes change in the present, the dynamic statement emphasizes changes happening over time and theoretically into the future, Sparkman says.</p>



<p>Roughly 20 percent of participants in the control and static norm groups went on to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617719950">order a meatless lunch</a> in the café compared with 34 percent of participants in the dynamic norm condition, the team reported in 2017 in <em>Psychological Science</em>. The results suggest people’s values can shift, Sparkman says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Eye to the future</h3>



<p>Café-goers who read that meat-eating is decreasing over time, the dynamic norm group, were more likely to order a vegetarian meal than those who read that some Americans limit their meat intake, a static norm, and the controls, who got an irrelevant message.</p>

<h4>Group dynamics</h4>



<p>As Babulski grew older, she learned about the health and environmental impacts of meat production. Her resolve to stay vegetarian solidified, and a once-impulsive decision became a way of life.</p>



<p>Babulski now shares her personal journey with students in her environmental science course. There’s always that student who treats her dietary choices as a personal affront, Babulski says. One student told her: “I’m going to eat three more chickens because you’re vegetarian to make up for the difference.”</p>



<p>People have long used food restrictions as a proxy for group membership. Hindu and Muslim people live side by side in South Asia, for instance, but can identify members of their own group just by noting who eats pork and who eats beef. “Food taboos are to do with establishing both in and out groups,” says Harriet Ritvo, an environmental historian at MIT.</p>



<p>Divisions around food can encourage tribal identities. For instance, Jewish people in Chicago who avoid leavened food during Passover often feel disconnected from their non-Jewish peers, Kaitlin Woolley, a behavioral scientist at Cornell University, and colleagues reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. But that sense of alienation helps them forge stronger connections with their Jewish peers. In a way, the Passover tribe grows stronger.</p>

<p>“In the West … to become a vegetarian is a very conscious choice to deviate from what is socially normal,” says social psychologist Daniel Rosenfeld of UCLA. “To form a community is often a way to buffer against that feeling of social alienation.”</p>



<p>Strong food-based communities help those within the group, but can repel those outside the group, such as Babulski’s chicken-eating student. Research shows that when people identify a certain diet, such as kosher or vegan, with an out-group, they can develop negative attitudes about the diet or avoid those “specialty” foods.</p>



<p>For instance, setting apart vegetarian items and labeling them “vegetarian” on a menu <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419308011?via%3Dihub">decreased the percentage of nonvegetarians who chose those entrées</a> versus when the options were incorporated into the main menu, researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>But there are ways to thwart that us-versus-them mentality, says Michael Schmitt, a social psychologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. One option is for researchers and policy makers to promote more inclusive labels. For instance, highlighting movement toward a more flexitarian diet does not seem to trigger the same sort of backlash as highlighting movement toward a vegetarian diet, Schmitt says. “That offers people an identity that might be closer to existing norms.”</p>



<p>Subtly changing the food environment to make veggie options, rather than meat, the default is another idea. For instance, simply increasing the availability of vegetarian meals in a university cafeteria from a quarter of the choices to half the choices increased sales of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1907207116">vegetarian entrées</a> by almost 8 percent, researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>

<h3>Labeling decisions</h3>



<p>Three groups of online participants who were meat eaters saw different menus: One menu set vegetarian choices apart and called them “vegetarian,” one labeled them as good for the environment and a third listed vegetarian and nonvegetarian items together. The vegetarian framing was least likely to lead to veggie orders.</p>

<p>Then there’s the grocery store. Researchers reported in March in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> that moving Easter chocolates away from prominent locations, like the store entrance and end of aisles, in a chain of U.K. grocery stores caused sales of those items to plummet. Compared with 151 stores that stuck with business as usual, 34 stores that moved the candy sold, on average, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003951">21 kilograms less chocolate</a> per week. Assuming the average chocolate Easter bunny weighs about 100 grams, that equals roughly 200 fewer bunnies sold per store each week.</p>



<p>Imagine if U.S. grocery store operators shunted meat to hard-to-find locations, Schmitt says. Changing perceptions of normal requires first envisioning a new normal.</p>



<h4>Ripple effects</h4>



<p>Given the sheer scope of climate change, how can one person’s actions make a difference?</p>



<p>Using dynamic norms to change behavior hinges on the simple premise that individual actions do, in fact, matter. Research from the sustainability field bears this out. From 2012 to 2015, officials in Connecticut sought to get more people to install solar panels through a program called Solarize Connecticut. At that time, only 0.4 percent of U.S. homeowners had solar panels, making their use outside the ordinary. So volunteers traveled to 58 towns to encourage residents to make the energy switch. Researchers reported in 2018 in <em>Nature</em> that volunteers who had invested in solar panels themselves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0647-4#citeas">convinced almost 63 percent more residents</a> to go solar than volunteers who had made no such investment.</p>

<p>Conversely, individual inaction also matters. In a now classic study from the 1960s appearing in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, male undergraduate students sat in a room that slowly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1969-03938-001">filled with smoke</a>. When the students were alone, 75 percent of them reported the situation. But when others were in the room and failed to act, only 10 percent of students reported the problem. Doing nothing had become socially acceptable.</p>



<p>In essence, we live in a world filling with smoke and must choose between inaction and action. Why not choose action?</p>



<p>Babulski applies this philosophy to her own teaching. Minus a naysayer or two, many of her students come to realize the power of their individual choices. “You can actually see students over the course of the semester going, ‘Wow, the little things I do actually do add up and make a difference,’ ” Babulski says.</p>



<p>Eventually, perhaps, a future Norman Rockwell will paint a less meat-heavy meal on that American dinner platter: beans, crickets or a plant-based turkey. Imagine that.</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Politics in the UK is becoming increasingly diverse. But there is still a way to go. When it comes to gender, the proportion of women in the House of Commons is at an <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01250/">all time high</a> — but at 35%, is still far from representative of the population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/6/e2112616119">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, looks at the barriers to women being elected. And the Stanford University team finds even voters who would prefer a female candidate show a level of &#8220;pragmatic bias&#8221;: if they believe that women candidates face barriers that make them less electable, they are less likely to vote for them.&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-46171"></span>



<p>Participants in the first study were Democrat voters. First, they were asked whether they felt it would be easier or harder for a woman to win the 2020 election against Trump compared to a man, and how ready they felt the US population was for a woman president. Next, they assessed the electability of specific candidates: Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. They were also asked about their personal preference for presidential candidate and who they would actually vote for in the Democratic primary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across the measures, participants consistently felt that women candidates were less electable: 76% believed it would be harder for a woman to win the 2020 election than a man, while only 18% believed Americans were extremely ready for a woman president. Half of the participants also believed that Harris and Warren were less electable than Biden and Sanders, while just 27% felt they were more electable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, participants whose preferred candidate was a woman were more likely to say they’d vote for a woman candidate. But if they believed that male candidates were more likely to be elected, then many of these participants indicated that they’d shift their actual vote to a man. That is, concerns that women were less electable seemed to lead people to vote for men even when they really wanted to vote for a woman. A second study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>A third study found that simply giving people information about women’s electability was not enough to counteract this effect. Democratic primary voters were assigned to one of three conditions. In the true information condition, participants saw a correct figure showing that 52.5% of voters are very or extremely ready for a woman president; in the misperception condition, participants saw a figure showing only 15.7% are ready; and in the control condition, participants read general information about the election. They were then asked their likelihood of voting for a woman candidate. However, providing candidates with true information about the electorate’s willingness to elect a woman was not enough to overcome their pragmatic bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the final studies, the team instead gave participants evidence that women are actually as successful as men in elections. They read that women are just as likely to win general elections as men, that they receive slightly more support than men, and that they are as successful as men at primaries. This time, the intervention increased their likelihood of intending to vote for a woman presidential candidate. And in a follow-up study, those who had seen this evidence were still more likely to say they’d vote for women candidates a month later, suggesting that sharing information about electability can increase voting intentions over a longer period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the study suggests that a belief that women candidates are not electable ironically makes people less likely to vote for them — even voters who they profess to support these candidates. Future research could look at different levels of politics — does this stand for council elections, for example, or non-governmental elections, or was the executive level position explored here relevant? And would it apply to Republicans or those outside of the United States?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team notes that in order to overcome pragmatic bias, it is not enough to believe others are simply ready for a female president but that “others will act on that readiness and vote accordingly”. Thinking and acting collectively could, then, shift attitudes and change representation.</p>
