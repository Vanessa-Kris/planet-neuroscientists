                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>The advent of the internet shifted how we socialise. Chat rooms, forums, and eventually social media platforms opened up new ways to both communicate and express ourselves. Online anonymity, for example, allowed us to be whoever we pleased to anyone with a connection — for better or worse. Psychological research followed this shift, and decades later there are troves of papers on almost every aspect of online interaction you could hope to explore.</p>



<p>As technology continues to march onwards, it’s brought with it increasingly accessible options for socialising in virtual reality (VR). Though VR is by definition virtual, the experiences users have in it are very much real. Since VR’s accessibility is so recent, we currently don’t have good understanding of what users get out of socialising in these spaces, or even a solid grasp of potential risks associated with them. With rapidly increasing uptake, especially in a time of mass isolation, that’s a pretty big blind spot.</p>



<p>However, work by soon-to-be PhD graduate <a href="https://www.divinemaloney.com/">Divine Maloney</a> at Clemson University is beginning to fill this gap. His PhD research has focused primarily on understanding VR social spaces and designing safe, equitable, and fulfilling VR spaces for young users.</p>



<span id="more-44755"></span>



<p>In a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459990.3460703">recent paper</a>, presented at this year’s Interaction Design and Children conference, Maloney explored what attracts teenagers to socialising in VR. Conducting in-depth interviews with 20 teens from North America, Europe, and Africa, his research was able to zero in on some key themes motivating continued engagement with this technology.</p>



<p>For these teens, VR spaces served as both a social hub and a place they could creatively express themselves. The time spent engaging in various available VR activities — such as games, or designing new objects and spaces — varied widely between participants, but throughout their responses, participants consistently placed emphasis on the value of interacting with other players in an immersive environment. “You can go into a random room, a random place, say hey to someone and they will generally talk to you,” says Maloney. “If not, that’s okay, you move on and talk to the next person. It’s very normal, as opposed to [many] places in the offline world. When you go into [social VR spaces] the consensus is that you’re going there for a social experience.”</p>



<p>Particularly during isolation brought on by the pandemic, VR offered a more natural and familiar way for these younger users to interact with those outside of their home than your average zoom call. “When COVID-19 shut down schools, I didn’t have very many people to talk to or hang out with,” one participant shared. “I used social VR as a substitute for that. I would find people around my age and just simply talk to them.”</p>



<p>VR social spaces are more than just a new and improved Zoom call, though. They provide tools for creativity and self-expression that can’t be replicated in reality. For example, users can craft entire mini-game experiences, in-game objects, or even create new worlds. This is where socialising and self-expression in VR begins to diverge more heavily from social spaces we’re familiar with. One of Maloney’s papers from 2021 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432938">explored this in more depth</a>, focusing on the role of avatars.</p>



<p>In VR spaces such as <em>RecRoom</em>, fully customisable avatars are an important component of the social experience, and can act as the social lubricant that starts conversations. Embodying your favourite game series’ main character, for example, is likely to attract other fans. Even non-human avatars such as Kermit the Frog might indicate something as intangible as sense of humour, and attract other users to chat based on that alone. Players can change between presentations at will, either for fun, to convey their true selves, or even to conceal things about themselves.</p>



<p>Participants in Maloney’s studies described the many ways in which donning an entirely manufactured digital body can also act as a mask, helping users to circumnavigate adversity they face, yet find difficult to escape, in day-to-day life. In one of his studies, women and girls shared how the right avatar could allow them to socialise without typical levels of harassment they would otherwise encounter. As one participant reported, “Girls are more valued than guys because there are way more guys than girls in social VR or in the game world. So if I’m a male walking around, no one pays attention to me. But if I was like a girl, people would probably try to interact with me more.&#8221;</p>



<p>The story is similar for players of ethnic minorities, with participants able to use avatars to shield against racial abuse by muting their microphones and communicating non-verbally, while visually presenting an avatar that may not attract racial abuse. This can also go in the other direction, and allow users to embrace their ethnicity in spite of potential harassment; some users even take the opportunity to experiment with Whiteness, which one participant reported as a self-affirming experience: “I was always aware of me being minority at some level. I’ve always wondered, ’what would it be like to be a majority?’ So I have used white avatars in social VR. That did not end well. But surprisingly, that experience actually made me more confident and had a better understanding of who I was. I am Asian American and I don’t need to be white.”</p>



<p>Transgender and non-binary participants also commented on the way VR allowed them to more safely explore new bodies and gender expressions. One trans woman shared that in the real world “I tend to curb my personality and express a lot more in line with what I feel like is socially acceptable and normal. When I’m in social VR, I feel more comfortable just being how I feel at full blast.” More than being social lubricant alone, complete control over avatar presentation gives users that wish to try out a different gender performance a relatively safe space to do so, see how they feel, and gauge how others react to them in an environment that — unlike the real world — has zero risk of physical harm (although, these participants also pointed out that harassment is still very much a risk).</p>



<p>VR social spaces are still somewhat in that wild-west era most of us remember from the earlier days of the internet. As such, many parents have safety concerns about what their teens may be exposed to in these virtual worlds composed of both their peers and those from generations above them. These concerns aren’t without basis — there are many reported instances of adults making advances on younger users, and the nature of current moderating tools for VR spaces make harassment of all kinds difficult to police.</p>



<p>While it’s important to protect young users from online dangers, Maloney says that when speaking with participants about dealing with difficult interactions in VR, “every single one, one-hundred percent, said that social VR helps them be more socially adept and socially confident. And that’s great for a young person’s development.” While part of his work centres around making these spaces safer, paradoxically, it seems that in a space where physical harm is impossible, users can more safely practice their responses to both difficult people and harassment. This may present interesting research avenues for those primarily drawn to developmental topics.</p>



<p>Research about socialising in VR, like the technology itself, is still very young. While Maloney’s research highlights many of the intricacies, and indeed positive aspects, of these spaces, future research will also need to better assess the negative impacts of VR. For example, Maloney’s research found that (during the pandemic) teens in his sample were spending as much as 22 hours per week in VR during term time, and around 60 hours per week during the summer. Though <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">recent research</a> into traditional video games suggest little impact on wellbeing from long sessions of gaming, the fully immersive, fully embodied nature of VR may pose its own issues that are as of yet unidentified. Indeed, some participants mentioned concerns that long play times in VR might take time away from real-life interactions and skill building that can’t be replicated virtually. The complexity of this space demands much more high-quality qualitative research in order to properly understand the draw, the positives, and the negatives of socialising in VR.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marijuana-skunk-smell-cannabis-pot-plant-chemistry">Here’s the chemistry behind marijuana’s skunky scent</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have finally sniffed out the molecules behind marijuana’s skunky aroma.</p>



<p>The heady bouquet that wafts off of fresh weed is actually a cocktail of hundreds of fragrant compounds. The most prominent floral, citrusy and piney overtones come from a common class of molecules called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roses-scent-genetics-fragrance">terpenes</a>, says analytical chemist Iain Oswald of Abstrax Tech, a private company in Tustin, Calif., that develops terpenes for cannabis products (<em>SN: 4/30/18</em>). But the source of that funky ganja note has been hard to pin down.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis is the first to identify a group of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c04196">sulfur compounds in cannabis that account for the skunklike scent</a>, researchers report November 12 in <em>ACS Omega</em>.</p>



<p>Oswald and colleagues had a hunch that the culprit may contain sulfur, a stinky element found in hops and skunk spray. So the team started by rating the skunk factor of flowers harvested from more than a dozen varieties of <em>Cannabis sativa </em>on a scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the most pungent. Next, the team created a “chemical fingerprint” of the airborne components that contributed to each cultivar’s unique scent using gas chromatography, mass spectroscopy and a sulfur chemiluminescence detector. &nbsp;</p>





<p>As suspected, the researchers found small amounts of several fragrant sulfur compounds lurking in the olfactory profiles of the smelliest cultivars. The most dominant was a molecule called prenylthiol, or 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skunk-walks-bar">gives “skunked beer” its notorious flavor</a> (<em>SN: 11/27/05</em>).</p>



<p>The sulfur compounds have been found in nature, but never before in cannabis, says Amber Wise, an analytical chemist with Medicine Creek Analytics in Fife, Wash., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Oswald was surprised to find that prenylthiol and many of the other sulfurous suspects in cannabis share structural similarities with molecules found in garlic. And like these alliaceous analogs, a little goes a long way.</p>



<p>These compounds “can be in very low concentrations on the flower, but still make a huge impact on the smell,” Oswald says. The sulfur molecules are most abundant in cannabis flowers when they reach maturity and during the curing process.</p>



<p>Smell psychologist Avery Gilbert of Headspace Sensory, a startup company in Fort Collins, Colo., that specializes in quantifying the many scents of cannabis, is excited to see the molecules added to marijuana’s chemical repertoire. “The spectrum of cannabis odor is just amazing,” he says. “I think it beats the pants off of wine.”</p>



<p>The discovery of prenylthiol in marijuana, Gilbert says, is the first step to masking its nuisance odor — or maximizing its perversely pleasant stink.</p>



<p>Prenylthiol has a “polarizing scent,” Oswald says. While many people think it reeks, some cannabis users will pay top dollar for skunky grass, which some consider an indicator of quality.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-ix-why-integrated-information-theory-fails/">Notes on consciousness. (IX) Why Integrated Information Theory fails</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory">Integrated Information Theory</a> (IIT) is a theory of consciousness that assigns a certain degree of consciousness (called Phi) to any system. Philosophically, it is a kind of property dualism: mental states are not reduced to states of matter, but assigned to arrangements of matter that have certain formal properties.</p>
<p>One of the most criticized aspects of the theory is that it embraces panpsychism: for example, it assigns consciousness to elementary systems such as a photodiode. However, the objection is easy to bypass: a theory does not have to produce intuitive claims. It is certainly not intuitive that the passing of time depends on how fast you move, yet it seems to be true.</p>
<p>But in the case of relativity, the counter-intuitive prediction can be tested empirically (and it has been). In the case of IIT, it cannot: there is no independent way to assess whether a photodiode is conscious. This is the fundamental epistemological issue with trying to explain a subjective phenomenon: there is no other way to directly establish the reality of the phenomenon than to experience it yourself. You will never have first-hand evidence that your stomach is another conscious entity in your body.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways to assess a theory, for example to exhibit incoherencies, contradictions or logical fallacies.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want to point out that property dualism is much closer to materialism than to religious kinds of dualism. In IIT, mental states are really properties of matter, just not physical properties. This means that mental states depend only on the arrangement of matter: the physical system is not just a host for the mind, as in Cartesian dualism. In Buddhism, the mind can reincarnate in another body, and bring memories with it. This is impossible with property dualism, because mental states are an intrinsic property of the system.</p>
<p>It is precisely this point that is inconsistent with the formulation of IIT. The central concept that I will discuss is information. IIT builds on the classical notion of information as differentiation: if a state can take values A or B, then observing A is informative, because it could have been B. If we assign equal probabilities to the two alternatives, then observing the state brings exactly 1 bit of information. Information is the reduction of uncertainty. This is why a binary photodiode exposed to a visual scene can get no more than 1 bit of information, while you would get much more information from the same scene: it could have been so many different other scenes.</p>
<p>At first sight, this seems like a reasonable characterization of information, so that IIT considers it as a self-evident axiom. However, there is a big problem here, one that will lead to major inconsistencies. State A is informative because it excludes possibility B. But this assumes that the entity that gets informed is aware that B was a possibility. How could that be possible if it has never encountered B before, and has no cognitive resources to imagine that B could exist? The reduction in uncertainty is relative to prior knowledge, but what is the prior knowledge of a photodiode?</p>
<p>The confusion, of course, is that the reduction of uncertainty occurs for the observer who formalized the range of possibilities, but it is ascribed to the system itself. There is some magic operating here, where we ascribe information and uncertainty to a physical system, without ever defining what it means for a physical system to have knowledge.</p>
<p>Let us be more concrete. Suppose the photodiode starts its life covered by a box, but then the experimenter removes the box and puts it back from times to times. In terms of information, the state of the photodiode will hold some information about light, or if it consists of a sensor and a detector, about its previous state. According to IIT, this will make the photodiode minimally conscious (in the last version of IIT, the photodiode must have some recurrent connectivity, e.g. reciprocal connection between a sensor and a detector, but this makes no difference to the present discussion).</p>
<p>But consider the very beginning of the photodiode’s life. It has always been in the dark, never exposed to light. In terms of information, the state is still informative because it excludes the possibility of light, but what does that mean for the photodiode that has never seen the light?</p>
<p>Now consider another photodiode. It is physically exactly the same photodiode, but this time the box permanently covers it. Thus, there is only one possible state for that photodiode. According to IIT, this photodiode is not conscious. Yet, it is physically identical to the photodiode at the beginning of the previous scenario.</p>
<p>Thus, we have exhibited two situations where the same physical system in the exact same state is assigned two different states of consciousness. This contradicts the claim that consciousness is an intrinsic property of the system.</p>
<p>The problem arises from the fact that consciousness is defined not from what happens presently with the system, but from what <em>could</em> happen, and it is very unclear what “could” might mean. “Could” the box collapse and expose the photodiode to light? Would that make the photodiode conscious? From that event? Or from the start of the photodiode’s life? Or from the moment when that event “could” happen? What does it mean exactly that an event that does not happen “could” have happened? (if what?)</p>
<p>Let us now turn to brains. According to <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory">Tononi</a>, “IIT predicts that a particular brain area can contribute to experience even if it is inactive, but not if it is inactivated.” Specifically, he contrasts the case of a person seeing a gray picture with the case where a colored picture is presented but color-sensitive neurons are lesioned. In the first case, the person perceives the picture as gray. In the second case, there is no experience of color at all. The difference in experience occurs because in the first case, the color-sensitive neurons <em>could have</em> been in a different state, but not in the second case.</p>
<p>“Could have” is very problematic here, because it does not refer to the present state of the system, but to hypothetical states.</p>
<p>Suppose the color area of the brain is not lesioned but reversibly inactivated by cooling, for a random duration. In this case, the person should be color conscious, because at any time, the neurons <em>could have</em> been in a different state.</p>
<p>An important precision in these thought experiments: the subject does not know what the experimenter is doing. Thus, from the viewpoint of the subject, all that happens is the neurons are inactive, and the cause of this inactivity leaves no trace in the subject. Yet, according to IIT, mental states depend on that cause. If it is a gray picture: color-conscious. Lesioning: color-unconscious. Reversible cooling: conscious. Irreversible cooling with a refrigerating device permanently implanted in the brain: unconscious. The fridge breaks down: conscious. The fridge <em>might</em> break down, but actually doesn’t: conscious from the time of cooling.</p>
<p>In summary, IIT fails to consistently assign consciousness to a system, because the definition is based on hypotheticals, which by definition are not instantiated by the system. Deep down, the troubles arise from the circularity of the definition of information as reduction of uncertainty. Uncertainty refers to a prior state of knowledge, but the notion of knowledge for the subject is never defined. In practice, the knowledge underlying the reduction of uncertainty is the knowledge of the observer who formalizes scenarios and quantifies probabilities of events that the system itself has never lived.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-carbon-storage-soil-earth-warm-climate">Fungi may be crucial to storing carbon in soil as the Earth warms</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to storing carbon in the ground, fungi may be key.</p>



<p>Soils are a massive reservoir of carbon, holding about three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere. The secret behind this carbon storage are microbes, such as bacteria and some fungi, which transform dead and decaying matter into carbon-rich soil.</p>



<p>But not all carbon compounds made by soil microbes are equal. Some can last for decades or even centuries in the soil, while others are quickly consumed by microbes and converted into carbon dioxide that’s lost to the atmosphere. Now, a study shows that fungi-rich soils grown in laboratory experiments <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43705-021-00071-7">released less carbon dioxide when heated than other soils</a>.</p>



<p>The result suggests that fungi are essential for making soil that sequesters carbon in the earth, microecologist Luiz Domeignoz-Horta and colleagues report November 6 in <em>ISME Communications</em>.</p>





<p>Who is making soil matters, Domeignoz-Horta says.</p>



<p>The study comes as some scientists warn that climate change threatens to release more carbon out of the ground and into the atmosphere, further worsening global warming. Researchers have found that rising temperatures can lead to population booms in soil microbes, which quickly exhaust easily digestible carbon compounds. This forces the organisms to turn to older, more resilient carbon stores, converting carbon stored away long ago into carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>With the combined threat of rising temperatures and damage to soil microbe communities from intensive farming and disappearing forests, some computer models indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/natural-ally-against-global-warming-not-strong-thought">40 percent less carbon will stick in the soil by 2100</a> than previous simulations have anticipated (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/22/16</em>).</p>





<p>To see if scientists can coax soils to store more carbon, researchers need to understand what makes soil microbes tick. But that is no simple task. “Some say soil is the most complex matrix on the planet,” says Kirsten Hofmockel, an ecologist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>To simplify matters, Domeignoz-Horta, of the University of Zurich, and colleagues grew their own dirt in the lab. The researchers separated fungi and bacteria from forest soil and grew five combinations of these communities in petri dishes, including some that were home only to bacteria or fungi. The researchers sustained the microbes on a diet of simple sugar and left them to churn out soil for four months. The team then heated the different soils to see how much carbon dioxide was produced.</p>



<p>Bacteria were the main drivers behind making soil, but fungi-rich soils produced less carbon dioxide when heated than soils made solely by bacteria, the researchers found. Why is still unclear. One possibility is that fungi could be producing enzymes — proteins that build or break up other molecules — that bacteria aren’t capable of making on their own, Domeignoz-Horta says. These fungi-derived compounds may provide bacteria with different building blocks with which to build soil, which may end up creating carbon compounds with a longer shelf life in soils.</p>



<p>What happens in lab-grown soil may not play out the same in the real world. But the new research is an important step in understanding how carbon is locked away long-term, Hofmockel says. This kind of information could one day help researchers develop techniques to ensure that more carbon stays in the ground for longer, which could help mitigate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“If we can get carbon in the ground for five years, that’s a step in the right direction,” Hofmockel says. “But if we can have stable carbon in the soil for centuries or even millennia, that’s a solution.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541672420">Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid</a><em><br>Thor Hanson<br>Basic Books, $28</em></p>



<p>As a conservation biologist, Thor Hanson has seen firsthand the effects of climate change on plants and animals in the wild: the green macaws of Central America migrating along with their food sources, the brown bears of Alaska fattening up on early-ripening berry crops, the conifers of New England seeking refuge from vanishing habitats. And as an engaging author who has celebrated the wonders of nature in books about feathers, seeds, forests and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-humans-and-big-macs-depend-bees">bees</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/18, p. 28</em>), he’s an ideal guide to a topic that might otherwise send readers down a well of despair.</p>



<p>Hanson does not despair in his latest book, <em>Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid</em>. Though he outlines the many ways that global warming is changing life on our planet, his tone is not one of hand-wringing. Instead, Hanson invites the reader into the stories of particular people, places and creatures of all sorts. He draws these tales from his own experiences and those of other scientists, combining reporting with narrative tales of species that serve as examples of broader trends in the natural world.</p>





<p>A trip to La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, for example, has Hanson reliving the experience of tropical ecologist and climatologist Leslie Holdridge, who founded the research station in the 1950s and described, among other things, how climate creates different habitats, or life zones, as elevation increases. As Hanson sweats his way up a tropical mountainside so he can witness a shift in life zones, he notes, “I had to earn every foot of elevation gain the hard way.” I could almost feel the heat that he describes as “a steaming towel draped over my head.” His vivid descriptions bring home the reason why so many species have now been documented moving upslope to cooler climes.</p>



<p>Hanson doesn’t waste much breath trying to convince doubters of the reality of climate change, instead showing by example after example how it is already playing out. The book moves quickly from the basic science of climate change to the challenges and opportunities that species face — from shifts in seasonal timing to ocean acidification — and the ways that species are responding.</p>



<p>As Hanson notes, the acronym MAD, for “move, adapt or die,” is often used to describe species’ options for responding. But that pithy phrase doesn’t capture the complexity of the situation. For instance, one of his titular characters, a lizard slammed by back-to-back Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, illustrates a different response. Instead of individual lizards adjusting, or adapting, to increasingly stormy conditions, the species evolved through natural selection. Biologists monitoring the lizards on two islands noticed that after the hurricanes, the lizard populations had longer front legs, shorter back legs and grippier toe pads on average than they had before. An experiment with a leaf blower showed that these traits help the lizards cling to branches better — survival of the fittest in action.</p>



<p>In the end, the outcomes for species will probably be as varied as their circumstances. Some organisms have already moved, adapted or died as a result of the warming, and many more will face challenges from changes that are yet to come. But Hanson hasn’t given up hope. When it comes to preventing the worst-case scenarios, he quotes ecologist Gordon Orians, who is in the seventh decade of a career witnessing environmental change. When asked what a concerned citizen should do to combat climate change, he responded succinctly: “Everything you can.” And as Hanson points out, this is exactly how plants and animals are responding to climate change: by doing everything they can. The challenge feels overwhelming, and as a single concerned citizen, much feels out of my hands. Yet Hanson’s words did inspire me to take a cue from the rest of the species on this warming world to do what I can.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates&#8230; if you’re looking for motivation or personal inspiration, it’s likely that you’ll see quotes from rich, prominent people. At the same time, there seems to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/20/new-wealth-tax-uk-arguments">growing</a> <a href="https://www.wealthandpolicy.com/wp/EP2_PublicAttitudes.pdf">discontent</a> with the levels of inequality in the world — a discontent seemingly at odds with the worship of wealthy people we see in the media and online.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2100430118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, explores this disconnect. It finds that even as we see the wealth of billionaires as a <em>group</em> as unfair, we remain tolerant of the achievements and wealth of individuals. And this also has an impact on the policies and positions people are willing to support.</p>



<span id="more-44745"></span>



<p>An initial study explored how much executives should make, with participants reading either about the recent increase in the salaries of CEOs from the largest companies in America, or about the increase of one specific CEO. Those who read about individual CEOs thought their salaries should be significantly higher than those who read about CEOs as a group. A second study replicated these findings in the context of sport, where high-financed individual players were seen as having less of an unfair advantage over low-financed players than high-financed <em>teams</em> over low-financed teams.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants read two passages, one about a conglomerate and one about an individual. In both pieces of writing, the conglomerate or individual were in a competition to win a government contract; because of their wealth, they were able to spend more than their rivals for the contract, which they eventually won. Again, participants felt that the competition between individuals was more fair, both in terms of outcome and in terms of the resource distribution between competitors.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants were told either the average wealth of the 25 wealthiest people in America or about the wealth accrued by one of the wealthiest individuals. No information was given about their identity or the way they became rich. Participants then wrote about why they thought the individual or group had become rich, the factors they felt were responsible, and how fair they thought it was. Finally, they rated their support for a wealth tax.</p>



<p>Participants who read about individuals had a stronger belief that wealth was down to personal characteristics, and also believed it had been obtained more fairly than those who read about the group. Those who read about the group were also marginally more in favour of a wealth tax, suggesting again that we feel more sympathetic towards rich individuals than groups.</p>



<p>The final study looked at the impact of the media. Half of the participants saw a cover from Forbes magazine highlighting seven of the wealthiest people in the world. The other half of participants saw a cover with just one of the seven billionaires.</p>



<p>After viewing the cover, participants were then asked to write about how they felt about the person or people depicted, how much they thought they deserved their wealth, how fair it was, and how much their success was due to talents and abilities versus an unequal and unfair economic system. Finally, participants rated how much they supported an inheritance tax to close the inequality gap.</p>



<p>Those in the individual condition wrote less angry responses about how they felt than those in the group condition, and were more likely to chalk success up to talent than any unfair advantage. Those who saw the group of billionaires were also more likely to back an inheritance tax than those who saw individuals.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first study to find a difference in attitudes between individuals and groups — other <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/11/were-more-likely-to-steal-from-large-groups-than-from-individuals/">research</a> published this year found that we’re also more likely to steal from large groups than we are from individuals, while <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/14/people-love-winning-streaks-by-individuals-more-than-those-by-teams/">another study</a> found that we prefer individual to team winning streaks. So why is this the case? The team suggests that we are better able to stereotype groups — so when confronted with a particular individual, the traits of theirs that don’t align with these stereotypes lead us to see them as less prototypical of the group and thus more sympathetic. And if we think negatively about “the 1%”, the individuals we bring to mind will be especially negative, making those less egregious individuals seem better in comparison.</p>



<p>&#8220;How we express and communicate information about inequality is important,” <a href="https://news.osu.edu/people-love-the-billionaire-but-hate-the-billionaires-club/">said</a> co-author Jesse Walker. “Talking about ‘the 1%’ is going to get a different reaction than personalizing it by talking about one person in that exclusive club.&#8221; Rethinking how we talk about inequality, showing the negative impact of individual as well as collective wealth, may help shift attitudes.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2100430118">People are more tolerant of inequality when it is expressed in terms of individuals rather than groups at the top</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-reef-microplastics-skeletons">Corals may store a surprising amount of microplastics in their skeletons</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprising amount of plastic pollution in the ocean may wind up in a previously overlooked spot: the skeletons of living corals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up to about 20,000 metric tons of tiny fragments called microplastics may be stored in coral skeletons worldwide every year, says ecologist Jessica Reichert of Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany. That corresponds to nearly 3 percent of the microplastics estimated to be in the shallow, tropical waters where corals thrive.</p>



<p>Corals <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/corals-dine-microplastics">have been observed eating</a> or otherwise <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0726">incorporating</a> microplastics into their bodies (<em>SNS: 3/18/15</em>). But scientists don’t know how much of the debris reefs take up globally. So Reichert and colleagues exposed corals in the lab to microplastics to find out where the particles are stored inside corals and estimate how much is tucked away.</p>



<p>Corals consumed some of the trash, or grew their skeletons over particles. After 18 months, most of the debris inside corals was in their skeletons rather than tissues, the researchers report October 28 in <em>Global Change Biology</em>. After counting the number of trapped particles, the researchers estimate that between <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15920">nearly 6 billion and 7 quadrillion microplastic particles may be permanently stored in corals</a> worldwide annually.</p>

Reichert</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s the first time that a living microplastic “sink,” or long-term storage site, has been quantified, Reichert says.</p>



<p>Scientists are learning how much microplastic is being introduced to the oceans. But researchers don&#8217;t know <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">where it all ends up</a> (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>). Other known microplastic sinks, such as sea ice and seafloor sediments, need better quantification, and other sinks may not yet be known.</p>



<p>Reefs are typically found near coasts where polluted waterways can drain to the sea, placing corals in potential microplastic hot spots.</p>



<p>“We don’t know what consequences this [storage] might have for the coral organisms, [or for] reef stability and integrity,” Reichert says. It “might pose an additional threat to coral reefs worldwide.” &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">A sailor’s story captures the impact of rising serious fungal infections</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Tyson Bottenus once captained an 80-foot schooner called the <em>Aquidneck</em>. He sailed tourists off the coast of Newport, R.I., discussing the area’s history and sites. In January 2018, he had finished another season at the schooner’s helm and had recently gotten engaged to his partner of many years, Liza Burkin. To celebrate, the couple, avid cyclists who’ve ridden through New Zealand and Japan, set off for a bike tour of Costa Rica.</p>



<p>“We were on this very, very dusty road for a long time,” Bottenus remembers of a ride to Montezuma on the Nicoya Peninsula. “It was a dirty, sandy, hard-packed road.” While going downhill, Bottenus crashed, badly scraping his elbow. The next morning, a doctor spent about an hour picking out little rocks and cleaning dirt from the wound before she bandaged it up. The injury kept him from swimming but otherwise didn’t disrupt the trip.</p>



<p>About a month after returning to Rhode Island, Bottenus started having headaches. He couldn’t control his mouth properly — his speech was off, and he was drooling. Eventually his doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed a lesion in his brain. “My first thought was, I must have some sort of cancer,” he says. “I’m only 31…. I’m way too young for this.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t cancer. Nor was it any of the infections proposed as doctors searched for a diagnosis. Two brain biopsies didn’t provide enough tissue to identify the problem.</p>



<p>In August 2018, Bottenus became very ill and was hospitalized. He couldn’t walk. His mouth muscles weren’t working. And he could no longer tie the drawstring of his pants with a square knot, a common knot sailors use to fasten two ropes together. It’s a knot Bottenus has taught others and could previously do with his eyes closed. “I’m a captain of boats, supposedly,” he remembers thinking. “I am not the person I think I am.”</p>



<p>Finally, a third brain biopsy, taking a slightly larger amount of tissue, yielded a diagnosis: Bottenus had a fungus growing in his brain. It was a black mold called <em>Cladophialophora bantiana </em>that can breach the blood-brain barrier. The best medical guess is that Bottenus was exposed in Costa Rica — probably from the dusty air he inhaled, or maybe from the debris-laden wound on his elbow.</p>



<p>People are exposed to fungi all the time, and usually we get along just fine. Fungi are in the air, in the soil and in us, part of the community of microbes that live in our bodies. Fungi that inhabit plant roots form crucial partnerships with more than 90 percent of land plant species, helping the plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil in exchange for food. But <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007964">some fungi are also infectious pathogens</a> that can cause pneumonia, blindness and meningitis.</p>

<h3>Emerging threats</h3>



<p>An estimated <a href="https://gaffi.org/why/">2 million people globally die from fungal diseases</a> each year. And pathogenic fungi tend to harm those with the least means. Fungal keratitis, an infection of the cornea, strikes more than a million people annually, estimates suggest, and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30448-5/fulltext">blinds around 600,000</a>. Found in tropical and subtropical areas, the disease — usually treatable when diagnosed early — often impacts young, poor agricultural workers. Another example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7440622/">chronic pulmonary aspergillosis</a>, is a lung infection that commonly occurs in people already burdened with lung damage from tuberculosis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30303-1/fulltext">Fungal infections are also a threat to people with HIV</a>, a virus that weakens the immune system. When defenses are down, typically benign fungi can take advantage of the gaps in our immunological armor and cause an infection. In resource-rich areas, fungal infections have decreased with earlier HIV diagnosis and the availability of antiretroviral drugs. But in places where people can’t get early, consistent HIV care, fungal infections have stubbornly persisted as dangerous complications of HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p>Advances in modern medicine that have extended lives have also led to more fungal infections. Organ transplantation and treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases have created a large population of people who regularly take drugs that inhibit components of the immune system, leaving these patients susceptible to fungal invaders.</p>



<p>Some fungi have emerged as recent threats to human health. First <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19161556/">reported in Japan in 2009 as the cause of an ear infection</a>, a yeast called <em>Candida auris </em>unexpectedly caused outbreaks of invasive infections — those that reach the blood, spinal fluid or other typically sterile areas of the body — on three continents a few years later. Hospital patients are especially at risk from the yeast, which is resistant to certain antifungal drugs.</p>



<p>Scientists have proposed that the emergence of <em>C. auris</em> as a danger to people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans">may be tied to our warming climate</a>, with the yeast gaining temperature tolerance in the environment. That could explain why <em>C. auris</em> can replicate inside human bodies, a niche that’s usually too hot for many fungi.</p>



<p>The warming climate may make other fungal pathogens more widespread. <em>Coccidioides</em>, a fungus that shape-shifts from a soil-dwelling, fluffy mold to aerosolized spores to round, parasitic cells at the site of infection, causes a disease called valley fever. Someone who breathes in the spores might not have symptoms at all or could become fatigued, short of breath and develop a fever, cough and night sweats. It’s among the fungal pathogens that can strike healthy immune systems. In the United States in 2019, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/statistics.html">18,407 cases</a> were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p><em>Coccidioides</em> is primarily found in southwestern states, but global warming could change that. “The entire western United States has been identified as potential habitat,” says medical mycologist Bridget Marie Barker of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The fungi thrive in hot, dry environments where there are brief, heavy rains. Climate change is expected to make western states hotter and alter precipitation patterns. Research reported in <em>GeoHealth</em> in 2019 predicts that by 2100, the areas impacted by <em>Coccidioides</em> could expand north in the western half of the country and annual <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GH000209">cases could increase by 50 percent</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>One fungus’ spread&nbsp;</h4>



<p>By the end of the century, global warming could expand the habitat of the fungus that causes valley fever. These maps show the predicted increase in the incidence of the disease, which today is found mainly in the southwestern United States. Symptoms include fever, fatigue and cough.</p>

<h3>Treatment pitfalls</h3>



<p>Despite the heavy burden of fungal diseases and the potential for that burden to grow, there are no approved vaccines against fungi, and the medicine cabinet of fungal remedies is not deep. There are only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996373/">a few types of antifungal drugs</a>. It’s difficult to develop antifungals in part because fungi are eukaryotes. Like us, and unlike bacteria, their cells have distinct, membrane-bound compartments, including a nucleus that holds their genetic material. That shared biology means that if a drug can kill fungi, it might harm us too.</p>



<p>The antifungals that do exist “are not spectacular,” says pediatric infectious disease physician and medical mycologist Damian Krysan of the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City. Even with treatment, invasive fungal infections are difficult to survive. For example, an invasive infection with the mold <em>Aspergillus</em> has a mortality rate ranging from 40 to 90 percent in patients with weakened immune systems, depending on where the infection is, among other factors. For a cancer patient with a great prognosis who develops an <em>Aspergillus</em> infection, Krysan says, “you can be cured of your cancer and die of your fungal infection.”</p>



<p>Even diagnosing a fungal infection is challenging. For one, there are fewer diagnostic tests specific to fungi than there are for viruses and bacteria. Another problem is that the symptoms of a fungal infection can resemble those caused by other pathogens. And fungi grow slowly, so it takes longer to confirm that a blood or tissue sample is infected with a fungus. A delayed diagnosis can mean delayed treatment, which complicates the chances of recovery.</p>



<p>Into this uncertain medical terrain landed Bottenus, a previously healthy young man who acquired an exceedingly rare fungal infection in his brain.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="340" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-340x450.jpg" alt="black and white brain scan" class="wp-image-3106096" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-340x450.jpg 340w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-289x383.jpg 289w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-141x186.jpg 141w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-438x580.jpg 438w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan-586x776.jpg 586w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/120421_fungal_inline_brainscan.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3106096">This 2018 image of Tyson Bottenus’ brain shows a lesion (white spot) that was later diagnosed as an infection with a fungus called&nbsp;<em>Cladophialophora bantiana</em>.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3106096">Courtesy of T. Bottenus</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Uncharted waters</h3>



<p>Bottenus has been treated with antifungal drugs and steroids. It’s been a “vicious cycle,” says Robbie Goldstein, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who has been part of Bottenus’ team of doctors. The steroids reduce the inflammation from the infection, which puts dangerous pressure on Bottenus’ brain. But the steroids also suppress his immune system, impairing his ability to clear the fungus. When doctors have tried to taper the steroids, the inflammation in Bottenus’ brain has gotten worse.</p>



<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic began, Bottenus became nervous that being immunocompromised put him at greater risk of getting sick from the coronavirus. So he stopped taking the steroids. The resulting inflammation triggered a stroke at the end of March 2020. In the several weeks he spent in the hospital, pandemic restrictions prevented Burkin from visiting.</p>



<p>Bottenus is still coping with the effects of the brain infection and the stroke. He has lost most of his peripheral vision. His speech is altered. Navigation is a struggle — he has a hard time finding his way around, even in his home. Bottenus kept telling himself that he’d wake up one day and be back to where he used to be. “But of course that’s a fantasy,” he says.</p>



<p>Yet other brain functions don’t seem to have been harmed. Bottenus began graduate school in the fall of 2020 and has done well in his classes. “He can’t really bike across our neighborhood by himself,” Burkin says, “but he can write a 20-page research paper.”</p>



<p>The whole experience has changed Bottenus’ personality, Burkin says. Her adventurous partner has become reliant on structure and routine. “I think that’s really normal for people who’ve gone through a life-threatening disease, where you have no control,” she says. Bottenus says, living “is as much adventure as I can get.”</p>



<p>In the published cases of <em>C. bantiana</em> infections, the death rate can be as high as 70 percent. Many times, the infection isn’t diagnosed until a patient’s autopsy, Goldstein says. For those who live with this infection, he says, the studies “don’t say what that life is like.” Bottenus and Burkin are crossing uncharted medical territory.</p>



<p>For now, Bottenus is a passenger on friends’ boats. When he bikes, he follows Burkin, or they ride a tandem. He makes sure to have his cell phone when he goes out, in case he gets lost. “He used to literally be able to do celestial navigation and lead us on bike tours across continents,” Burkin says. “I don’t know that it is permanent, these changes. I don’t think there’s any way to know.”</p>

Bottenus’ infection with a rare fungus is “the universe being purely chaotic,” Burkin says.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3106094">Courtesy of T. Bottenus</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But “I can’t blame this fungus,” she says. “We were out on a bike ride and some dirt got into his body.”</p>



<p>Sometimes a doctor meets a patient after they’ve already been seriously harmed by an infection, Goldstein says. But he got to know Bottenus from the beginning, when the young sailor was searching for a diagnosis. Goldstein says this experience has made him really aware, when he’s talking to a patient, of how devastating an infection can be to the life they had before.</p>



<p>“Before there was an infection,” he says, “there was a person.”</p>

<p>Over the last decade, states have enacted a variety of restrictive abortion policies at a rapidly increasing rate. Since 2011, nearly 500 abortion restrictions have been enacted in states around the U. S, increasing the hostility of state environments towards abortion access. According to the Guttmacher Institute, over half of states are hostile to abortion rights, and 58% of women aged 15–44 reside in states considered hostile or very hostile to abortion services, meaning states had four or five (hostile), or six (very hostile) restrictive abortion policies in place. Using a state-level abortion restrictiveness index comprised of 18 restrictive abortion policies, the authors conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining whether race/ethnicity and education level moderated the relationship between the restrictiveness index and individual-level probabilities of preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW). Findings demonstrate that Black individuals at all educational levels and those with fewer years of education disproportionately experienced adverse birth outcomes associated with restrictive abortion policies. Restrictive abortion policies may compound existing racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and intersecting racial/ethnic and socioeconomic perinatal and infant health inequities.</p>

<p>Dental caries in adolescents remains a significant public health problem with few oral health promotion interventions aimed at reducing dental caries in secondary school-aged students. Previous oral health and mobile health (mHealth) research has suggested the need for the development of a school-based behaviour change intervention incorporating a digital component. This study aimed to describe the development process of a behaviour change intervention to improve the oral health of students aged 11–16 years attending secondary schools in the UK. A six-step process was used to develop the complex intervention informed by behaviour change theory and involving students, young people, parents and teachers in the process. Here an intervention to improve the oral health of secondary school students through improved tooth brushing was developed based on behaviour change theory and work with young people, parents and school staff.</p>

<p>Excess consumption of alcohol and energy-dense foods are two significant preventable causes of a range of non-communicable diseases globally, including heart disease and many cancers. Interventions that involve changing cues in the immediate physical environments that influence consumption could contribute to reducing excess food and alcohol consumption altering the size of tableware, plates, glasses, packaging and bottles. There is considerable uncertainty, however, around the potential effects of different sizes and shapes of tableware on how much food and alcohol people self-serve. These studies aimed to estimate the impact of: 1. Plate size and shape on amount of food self-served; and 2. Wine glass and bottle size on amount of wine self-poured. The authors found that smaller tableware (i.e. plates and wine glasses) decreased the amount of food and wine self-served in an initial serving. Studies are therefore warranted that assess initial as well as subsequent servings, and consumption behaviour—including detailed meal microstructure behaviours.</p>

<p>Over 45 jurisdictions globally have implemented sweetened beverage taxes. Researchers and policymakers need to assess whether and how these taxes change beverage demand and supply, their intended and unanticipated health, economic and equity impacts. Lessons from such evaluations can maximise the policies’ success and impact on non-communicable disease prevention globally. There is ample evidence showing that consumption of sweetened beverages is strongly and positively associated with the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, as well as all-cause mortality. In this article, rather than provide a review of the findings of existing evaluations, the authors ask: what are the lessons we can learn from sweetened beverage tax evaluations?</p>

<p>Following periods of acute ill-health and injury, older people are frequently assessed and provided with rehabilitation services. Healthcare practitioners are required to make nuanced decisions about which patients are likely to benefit from and respond to rehabilitation. The clinical currency in which these decisions are transacted is through the term “rehabilitation potential”. The aim of this study was to explore information about rehabilitation potential in older people to inform the development of an evidence-based assessment tool. 13,484 papers were identified and 49 included in the review. Current approaches to rehabilitation potential provide a snapshot of an individual’s abilities and conditions which fail to capture the dynamic nature and fluctuations associated with frailty and rehabilitation. New approaches to measures abilities over time are required which allow for the prognostication of outcomes and potential benefits of rehabilitation interventions for older people living with frailty.</p>

<p><strong>Research into the use of deep brain stimulation to treat depression has produced mixed results. </strong>But there may promise in a more personalised approach to treatment. At <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/next-generation-deep-brain-stimulation-aims-tackle-depression">Kelly Servick reports</a> on studies using imaging and electrode recordings from individuals to figure out exactly which region to stimulate — and when — for the optimal response.</p>

<p><strong>According to a recent study, psychologists are pretty good at updating their beliefs about an apparently established scientific finding, after reading about a failed replication attempt. </strong>This was even true of scientists who had a personal interest in the outcome of the replication, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/are-scientists-less-prone-to-motivated-reasoning/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica.</em> Of course, this might come as a surprise given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/22/introductory-psychology-books-accused-of-spreading-myths-and-left-leaning-bias/">continued persistence</a> of questionable findings in introductory psychology textbooks — and as Timmer writes, there are some big caveats to the results.</p>

<p><strong>As more and more children become eligible to receive COVID vaccines, how do we make sure that their parents don’t fall for anti-vax conspiracy theories?</strong> People are more likely to subscribe to such beliefs if they overestimate how common they are among other parents, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-dissuade-parents-from-believing-in-anti-vaxxer-conspiracy-theories-171781">explain Darel Cookson and colleagues</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/673711012/0/oupblogpsychology/">How research abstracts succeed and fail</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/how-research-abstracts-succeed-and-fail/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Frustrated-person-on-laptop-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>The abstract of a research article has a simple remit: to faithfully summarize the reported research. After the title, it’s the most read section of the article. It’s freely available on the publisher’s website and in online databases. Crucially, it makes the case to the reader for reading the article in full.&nbsp;</p><p>Alas, not all abstracts succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some take the notion of abstraction to extremes.&nbsp;This example is from a physics article:</p><blockquote><p>Unitarity and geometrical effects are discussed for photon-photon scattering.</p></blockquote><p>It has just ten words. Fortunately, most abstracts say rather more, though it’s possible to say too much. The next example, from a geology article, has over 370 words. It starts:</p><blockquote><p>Diagenesis of the Holocene-Pleistocene volcanogenic sediments of the Mexican Basin produced, in strata of gravel and sand, 1H<sub>2</sub>O- and 2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite, kaolinite, R3-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite, R1-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite, R3-kaolinite (0.75)-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite and R1-1H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite. Smectite platelets&#8230;</p></blockquote><p>It continues in a similar vein for a further 350 words, accumulating more and more detail. The reason for the work is hinted at, but only becomes clear in the full article, at which&nbsp;point it’s too late.</p><p>Some abstracts introduce citations to previous research to provide background, contrary to the expectation that abstractions stand alone. In practice, citations can block the reader’s progress, as in this example from a remote-sensing&nbsp;article:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of this paper is to extend the stationary stochastic model defined in [1] to a time evolving sea state and platform motion.</p></blockquote><p>The reference pointed to by “[1]” isn’t attached to the abstract, and the source article is obviously elsewhere. Yet without it, the rest of the text is difficult to appreciate. Similar problems can occur with abbreviations explained only in the article.</p><p>Some abstracts confuse their remit by summarizing the paper rather than its content. The shift to meta-reporting can lead to uninformative boiler-plate text. This example is from a medical education article:</p><blockquote><p>Implications of these results are discussed.</p></blockquote><p>It’s uninformative because readers already know that most research articles contain a discussion section where, by definition, results and their implications are discussed.</p><p>Some abstracts expand their remit to include&nbsp;personal research plans. This example is from a clinical article:</p><blockquote><p>We plan to investigate why general practitioners are not complying with the pathway.</p></blockquote><p>It’s common to find research aspirations in internal reports and in research grant applications, where they have a specific function. But published in an abstract, they can present a reader working in the same area with a difficult <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/08/why-academics-announce-plans-for-research-that-might-never-happen/">choice</a>.</p><p>Some abstracts expand their remit even further with a self-evaluation of the research.

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Sometimes, our emotions are one-dimensional. This morning, for example, when both my kids and my dog jumped into bed, I felt happy. During the Halloween party that my husband and I organised for our boys, though, happiness at their pleasure was definitely tinged with anxiety/stress at managing a houseful of rampaging kids. And here we get into murkier emotional territory. While so much research has been done on individual, &#8220;basic&#8221; emotions, more complex emotional experiences have been neglected. But recent studies have revealed some surprising and special roles for mixed emotions in our lives.</p>



<span id="more-44704"></span>



<p><strong>What<em> do</em> we feel?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073916639661">One of the most impressive explorations of our everyday feeling experiences</a> was published in 2017 in <em>Emotion Review</em>. The US participants wore a beeper that sounded at random moments. Whenever it went off, they jotted down what, if anything, had just been present in their inner experience. Christopher Heavey at the University of Nevada and colleagues found that most of the time, the participants weren’t <em>feeling</em> anything in particular. When they were, it was usually a single feeling — such as happiness or anxiety. But they did sometimes report experiencing multiple distinct feelings simultaneously, which could involve a negative plus a positive emotion. Sometimes, they also reported single, &#8220;blended&#8221;, feelings with both positive and negative facets — a &#8220;sad kind of happiness&#8221;, for example. Of course we already have a term for this: poignancy. But new studies are revealing other emotion combinations.</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The curious case of threat-awe&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>This is the title of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-85863-001">new paper in </a><em><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-85863-001">Emotion</a> </em>from researchers at the University of New South Wales. &#8220;Curious&#8221;, because although <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/15/feeling-awe-can-sometimes-be-awful/">&#8220;threatening awe&#8221;</a> at the sight of an approaching thunderstorm, say, has been viewed as a negative, fearful sub-aspect of awe, this is not what the team found.</p>



<p>Awe and fear are well-defined, both in terms of how they feel and the kinds of thoughts and behaviours associated with them. Srinwanti Chaudhury and colleagues found that threat-awe has some fear-related aspects and some awe-related aspects, and an overall feeling/behaviours profile that differentiates it from either. So, for example, people experiencing threat-awe were, like people feeling fear, less willing to take risks than those feeling straight awe, but threat-awe felt significantly more pleasant than fear. When participants were simply asked to indicate on a matrix what threat-awe felt like, they reported both negative <em>and</em> positive feelings. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to empirically demonstrate that threat-awe should be regarded as a mixed emotion rather than a negative variant of awe,” the team concludes. They also speculate about the function of threat-awe. Perhaps, they write, it helps us to see &#8220;beauty in adversity&#8221;, which might build resilience in the face of stressful or even traumatic situations.</p>



<p><strong>Mixed emotions and meaning in life</strong></p>



<p>Hedonistic wellbeing — often called happiness — involves feeling plenty of positive emotions, such as joy and excitement. But <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-017-9849-y">work led by Raul Berrios at the University of Santiago in Chile</a> suggests that mixed positive/negative emotions contribute to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/14/weve-neglected-the-role-of-psychological-richness-when-considering-what-makes-a-good-life-study-argues/">psychological wellbeing.</a> However, they boost not happiness but eudaimonia — the important feeling that one’s life has meaning. The team ran two studies to explore this. One surveyed participants who recalled a recent challenge to their life goals or values. In the other, students watched a video about graduating from university, which focused on the poignancy of this event. Across both studies, participants who then reported feeling stronger mixed emotions also rated their lives as being more meaningful. This work suggests that mixed emotions don’t just help people to cope with stress but have broader impacts on wellbeing. And a 2021 study goes further…</p>



<p><strong>Mixed emotions make for smarter thinking</strong></p>



<p>Vincent Oh and Eddie Tong at the National University of Singapore <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-021-00045-x">ran four studies</a> on 1,419 people in Singapore and the US during March and April 2020, a peak period for Covid-19 infections and deaths. They report that more frequent mixed emotions — but not levels of positive or negative emotions — were linked to greater eudaimonic wellbeing and also more self-reported infection-prevention behaviours, such as using hand sanitiser frequently and avoiding sharing food. These findings sit well with some other recent studies suggesting that mixed emotions make it easier for us to integrate information from multiple perspectives, supporting more complex thought, and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Interestingly, relatively high levels of positive or negative emotions predicted &#8220;unsupported and atypical virus-prevention behaviours&#8221;, such as eating more honey, or even using detergent as a mouthwash. This is “consistent with findings that positive emotions may promote gullibility and negative emotions may promote maladaptive coping,” the team writes.</p>



<p>So the next time you feel conflicting emotions, don’t worry — the lesson from all this recent work seems to be: it’s good for you.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental advertising: A question of integrity</strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environmental-advertising-question-integrity"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 27, 1971</p>



<p>A new report published by the Council on Economic Priorities clearly outlines facts showing that much corporate advertising on environmental themes is irrelevant or even deceptive.… A large percentage of the environmental advertising comes from companies that are the worst polluters.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Concerns about “greenwashing,” a term coined in the 1980s to describe the practice of organizations marketing their products as environmentally friendly when they are not, have persisted into the current climate crisis. As more consumers have become environmentally conscious, corporations’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies">greenwashing tactics have evolved</a>. For instance, some energy companies in the United States have claimed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-michael-moore-new-film-gets-wrong-about-renewable-energy">natural gas is a “clean” energy source </a>because the power plants emit less carbon dioxide than coal plants. But natural gas plants can emit large amounts of methane, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">a potent greenhouse gas</a>. In 2022, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission plans to review its “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/02/2021-13724/regulatory-review-schedule">Green Guides</a>,” rules for companies that make environmental claims.</p>

<p>Perfectionism can be a useful trait: striving always to do better, perfectionists may be more likely to thrive <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-019-09484-2">academically</a> or <a href="https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/36886/10/749-3957-1-PB.pdf">accomplish</a> other achievements.

<p>One common critique of perfectionism is that it kills creativity, and it’s this question Jean-Christophe Goulet-Pelletier and team from the University of Ottawa, Ontario, explore <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12530?saml_referrer">in a paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology. </em>They find that shooting for greatness, rather than perfection, can lead to higher creativity and increased openness to experience.</p>



<span id="more-44672"></span>



<p>Participants in the first study were 279 Canadian undergraduate students. After sharing demographic data, they completed measures of perfectionism and excellencism (the striving for excellence, rather than perfection). Participants were shown statements about their goals, with some reflecting perfectionism (“My goal at school is to be exceptionally productive all the time”) and some excellencism (“My goal is to perform very well”), rating how much they agreed with them on a scale from one to seven.</p>



<p>Next, their creativity was tested with a &#8220;divergent thinking&#8221; measure. Participants were asked to come up with as many creative answers as they could to several questions, including “tell us the different ways you could use a newspaper” and “name all the things you can think of that make noise”. Finally, they completed a scale measuring openness to experience, which included questions about imagination, interest in art, emotionality, adventurousness, intellect, and liberalism.</p>



<p>The results revealed that the more participants strove for excellence, the greater originality and openness to experience they showed. In contrast, the more perfectionist participants were, the fewer original ideas they had and the less open to experience they were. This suggests that an element of flexibility not present in perfectionism can improve our creative thinking.</p>



<p>The second study involved 401 participants, again Canadian undergraduates. As in the first experiment, excellencism and perfectionism were measured, along with divergent thinking and openness to experience. General self-efficacy was recorded through agreement or disagreement with statements like &#8220;I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I have set for myself&#8221;, while creative self-efficacy and creative personal identity were measured through statements such as &#8220;I trust my creative abilities&#8221; and &#8220;My creativity is important to who I am&#8221;.</p>



<p>Participants also took part in two extra tests. In the first, an association test, participants were given a word and asked to create a chain in which each word can be related to the previous word but not the others. If you started with the word &#8220;summer&#8221;, to use the team’s example, a chain could be &#8220;beach, sand, castle, knight, horse, race&#8221;. The second was a <em>dis</em>sociation task. This takes the format of the association task, but asks participants to create a chain of words completely unrelated from one another (e.g. &#8220;summer, computer, banana, bicycle&#8221;).</p>



<p>Again, excellencism was a strong predictor of openness and originality, with perfectionism predicting lower scores on these measures. Those who strove for excellence also did better on the association and dissociation tasks, while perfectionists performed worse. However, there was no significant difference between excellencists and perfectionists on general self-efficacy, creative self-efficacy, and creative personal identity, suggesting that people may not recognise their creativity is being inhibited by their perfectionism.</p>



<p>Much of the study suggests that striving for perfection can prove less positive than perfectionists would like, with those looking merely for excellence faring better overall. Future research could explore how to swap toxic perfectionism for excellencism — but in the meantime, contemplating <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/">how to deal with failure</a>, and how it can even be productive, may be worth some time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/albatross-bird-divorce-ocean-warm-breeding-climate">Albatrosses divorce more often when ocean waters warm</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to fidelity, birds fit the bill: Over 90 percent of all bird species are monogamous and — mostly — stay faithful, perhaps none more famously than the majestic albatross. Albatross couples rarely separate, sticking with the same breeding partner year after year. But when ocean waters are warmer than average, more of the birds split up, a new study finds.</p>



<p>In years when the water was warmer than usual, the divorce rate — typically less than 4 percent on average — rose to nearly 8 percent among albatrosses in part of the Falkland Islands, researchers report November 24 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. It’s <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112">the first evidence that the environment</a><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112">, not just breeding failure,</a><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2112"> affects divorce in wild birds</a>. In fact, the team found that during warmer years, even some females that had bred successfully ditched their partners.<a></a></p>



<p>The result suggests that as the climate changes as a result of human activity, higher instances of divorce in albatrosses and perhaps other socially monogamous animals may be “an overlooked consequence,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Albatrosses can live for decades, sometimes spending years out on the ocean searching for food and returning to land only to breed. Pairs that stay together have the benefits of familiarity and improved coordination, which help when raising young. This stability is particularly important in dynamic, marine environments, says Francesco Ventura, a conservation biologist at the University of Lisbon in Portugal.</p>





<p><a></a>But if breeding doesn’t work out, many birds — mostly females — leave their partner and try to find better <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/when-birds-divorce">luck elsewhere</a> (<em>SN: 3/7/98</em>). Breeding is more likely to fail in years with more difficult conditions, with knock-on effects on divorce rates the following years. Ventura wanted to find out whether the environment also has a direct impact: changing the rate of divorce regardless of whether the breeding had gone well.</p>



<p>Ventura and his team analyzed data collected from 2004 to 2019 on a large colony of black-browed albatrosses (<em>Thalassarche melanophris</em>) living on New Island in the Falkland Islands. The team recorded nearly 2,900 breeding attempts in 424 females, and tracked bird breakups. Then, accounting for previous breeding success in individual pairs, the researchers checked to see if environmental conditions had any noticeable further impact on pairings.</p>



<p>Breeding failure, especially early on, was still the main factor behind a divorce: Each female lays just a single egg, and those birds whose eggs didn’t hatch were over five times as likely to separate from their partners as those who succeeded, or those whose hatched chicks didn’t survive. In some years, the divorce rate was lower than 1 percent.</p>



<p>Yet this rate increased in line with average water temperatures, reaching a maximum of 7.7 percent in 2017 when waters were the warmest. The team’s calculations revealed that the probability of divorce was correlated with rising temperatures. And surprisingly, females in successful breeding pairs were more likely to be affected by the harsher environment than males or females that either didn’t breed, or failed. When ocean temperatures dropped again in 2018 and 2019, so did divorce rates.</p>



<p>Warmer water means fewer nutrients, so some birds may be fueling up out at sea for longer, delaying their return to the colony or turning up bedraggled and unappealing. If members of pairs return at different times, this <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/separate-vacations-birds-winter-apart-return-sync">can lead to breakups</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/04</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, worse conditions one year might raise stress-related hormones in the birds too, which can affect mate choice. A bird may incorrectly attribute its stress to its partner, rather than the harsher environment, and separate even if hatching was successful, the researchers speculate.</p>



<p>Such misreading between cues and reality could make separation a less-effective behavior, suggests Antica Culina, an evolutionary ecologist at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology in Wageningen who was not involved in the study. If animals divorce for the wrong reason and do worse the following season, that can lead to lower breeding success overall and possibly population decline.</p>



<p>Similar patterns could be found in other socially monogamous animals, including mammals, the researchers suggest. “If you imagine a population with a very low number of breeding pairs &#8230; this might have much more serious repercussions,” Ventura says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you have a partner, how do you think your relationship would fare in the face of a natural disaster? Do you think it would bring you closer — or might the stresses make your relationship worse?</p>



<p>Various studies have explored this, and their conclusions have been mixed. But virtually all have been hampered by a lack of key data: measures of relationship satisfaction actually taken <em>before </em>a disaster (rather than later recalled), to compare with measures of satisfaction afterwards. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976211015677">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> now plugs this gap. Hannah Williamson at the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report a remarkable study of 231 couples living in Harris County, Texas, using data collected before and after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated the region in August 2017.</p>



<span id="more-44664"></span>



<p>A few years before Harvey struck, the team had enrolled a diverse group of newlyweds for a study of relationship development in the early years. By August 2017, these couples had already individually completed a couples satisfaction survey on three occasions, each about six months apart. The team realised that they had, then, the perfect initial data set for a study of the impact of a natural disaster on couples.</p>



<p>About six, 12 and 18 months after the hurricane, the participants completed the couples satisfaction survey again. They also reported on how badly the hurricane had affected them — whether they’d had to evacuate their home or be rescued, and whether they’d been physically injured, for example. And they reported on levels of chronic stress and social support.</p>



<p>Typically, relationship satisfaction for newlywed couples follows this trajectory: initially, they’re very satisfied, but then both wives and husbands report a gradual and continuous decline over time.</p>



<p>That’s not what these couples experienced.</p>



<p>During the period before the hurricane, yes, they reported a gradual decline (and this was more pronounced for the wives than the husbands). But right after the hurricane, both partners enjoyed a similar leap in relationship satisfaction. This might have been down to going through the disaster together, with a partner who was also a victim, the researchers suggest. Whatever the reason, this longitudinal study certainly suggests that natural disasters tend to bring couples together, rather than drive them apart. But this didn’t last long…</p>



<p>“As the initial impact of the hurricane wore off, so too did the increase in satisfaction,” the team reports. Participants soon reverted to reporting the same rate of gradual decline in satisfaction as before the disaster. As life gradually returned to normal, perhaps previous relationship issues resurfaced, or became trickier to overlook.</p>



<p>There were some interesting extra findings. The size of the satisfaction jump was not related to how badly they were personally affected by Hurricane Harvey, or their levels of chronic stress and social support. But couples who’d reported poorer relationships before the hurricane did tend to report the biggest satisfaction jumps afterwards. However, this might be down to a ceiling effect —&nbsp;the couples who were most satisfied before Harvey struck didn’t have much room for improvement.</p>



<p>There are a few limitations to the work that are worth noting. This study was on newlyweds; perhaps couples who’ve been together for longer wouldn’t have the same experience. Also, the data was of course from one group of US residents living in one location. Still, the group was a close match for the diverse racial and ethnic make-up of people living in poverty in that area, the team notes. And as more disaster-prone regions of the US tend to be home to communities with a similar profile, the researchers argue that they represent a sample of people who are more vulnerable to natural disasters in the US, at least.</p>



<p>Natural disasters — whether hurricanes or wildfires or intense rainfall and flooding — are of course becoming more common, and more severe around the world. For anyone affected, their relationship with their partner is likely to be more important than any other for how they cope. This makes it ever more important to understand what impact disasters have on these relationships.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-milky-way-galaxy-feather-gas-spiral-arms-gangotri-wave">Astronomers have found the Milky Way’s first known ‘feather’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way has a “feather” in its cap.<br><br>A long, thin filament of cold, dense <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac341f">gas extends jauntily from the galactic center, connecting two of the galaxy’s spiral arms</a>, astronomers report November 11 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. This is the first time that such a structure, which looks like the barb of a feather fanning off the central quill, has been spotted in the Milky Way.</p>



<p>The team that discovered our galaxy’s feather named it the Gangotri wave, after the glacier that is the source of India’s longest river, the Ganges. In Hindi and other Indian languages, the Milky Way is called Akasha Ganga, “the river Ganga in the sky,” says astrophysicist Veena V.S. of the University of Cologne in Germany.<br><br>She and colleagues found the Gangotri wave by looking for clouds of cold carbon monoxide gas, which is dense and easy to trace, in data from the <a href="https://www.apex-telescope.org/ns/">APEX telescope</a> in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. The structure stretches 6,000 to 13,000 light-years from the Norma arm of the Milky Way to a minor arm near the galactic center called the 3-kiloparsec arm. So far, all other known gas tendrils in the Milky Way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-milky-way-could-help-map-galactic-structure">align with the spiral arms</a> (<em>SN: 12/30/15</em>).</p>



<p>The Gangotri wave has another unusual feature: waviness. The filament appears to wobble up and down like a sine wave over the course of thousands of light-years. Astronomers aren’t sure what could cause that, Veena says.</p>



<p>Other galaxies have gaseous plumage, but when it comes to the Milky Way, “it’s very, very difficult” to map the galaxy’s structure from the inside out, she says. She hopes to find more galactic feathers and other bits of our galaxy’s structure. “One by one, we’ll be able to map the Milky Way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kamooalewa-moon-space-rock-quasisatellite">A space rock called Kamoʻoalewa may be a piece of the moon</a></h4>

              
                <p>The moon’s violent history is written across its face. Over billions of years, space rocks have punched craters into its surface, flinging out debris. Now, for the first time, astronomers may have spotted rubble from one of those ancient smashups out in space. The mysterious object known as Kamoʻoalewa appears to be a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-021-00303-7">stray fragment of the moon</a>, researchers report online November 11 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>Discovered in 2016, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-has-tiny-tagalong-and-no-its-not-moon">Kamoʻoalewa — also known as 2016 HO3</a> — is one of Earth’s five known quasisatellites (<em>SN: 6/24/16</em>). These are rocks that stick fairly close to the planet as they orbit the sun. Little is known about Earth’s space rock entourage because these objects are so small and faint. Kamoʻoalewa, for instance, is about the size of a Ferris wheel and strays between 40 and 100 times as far from Earth as the moon, as its orbit around the sun weaves in and out of Earth’s. That has left astronomers to wonder about the nature of such tagalong rocks.</p>



<p>“An object in a quasisatellite orbit is interesting because it’s very difficult to get into this kind of orbit — it’s not the kind of orbit that an object from the asteroid belt could easily find itself caught in,” says Richard Binzel, a planetary scientist at MIT not involved in the new work. Having an orbit nearly identical to Earth’s immediately raises suspicions that an object like Kamoʻoalewa originated in the Earth-moon system, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers used the Large Binocular Telescope and the Lowell Discovery Telescope, in Safford and Happy Jack, Ariz., respectively, to peer at Kamoʻoalewa in visible and near-infrared wavelengths. “The real money is in the infrared,” says Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Light at those wavelengths contains important clues about the minerals in rocky bodies, helping distinguish objects such as the moon, asteroids and terrestrial planets.</p>





<p>Kamoʻoalewa reflected more sunlight at longer, or redder, wavelengths. This pattern of light, or spectrum, looked unlike any known near-Earth asteroid, Reddy and colleagues found. But it did look like grains of silicate rock from the moon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/back-moon-sample-tests-begin">brought back to Earth</a> by Apollo 14 astronauts (<em>SN: 2/20/71</em>).</p>

<p>Kamoʻoalewa, also known as 2016 HO3, has an orbit (white) that is nearly identical to Earth’s (blue), causing the object to weave around Earth as it circles the sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To me,” Binzel says, “the leading hypothesis is that it’s an ejected fragment from the moon, from a cratering event.”</p>



<p>Martin Connors, who was involved in the discovery of Earth’s first known quasisatellites but did not participate in the new research, also suspects that Kamoʻoalewa is a chip off the old moon. “This is well-founded evidence,” says Connors, a planetary scientist at Athabasca University in Canada. But, he cautions, “that doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>



<p>More detailed observations could help confirm Kamoʻoalewa is made of moon stuff. “If you really wanted to put that nail in the coffin, you’d want to go and visit, or rendezvous with this little quasisatellite and take a lot of up-close observations,” says Daniel Scheeres, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder not involved in the work. “The best would be to get a sample.”</p>



<p>China&#8217;s space agency <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/pdf/1045.pdf">has announced plans</a> to send a probe to Kamoʻoalewa to scoop up a bit of rock and bring it back to Earth later this decade.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Most research into hallucinations focuses on unimodal hallucinations — hallucinatory experiences that only affect one sensory modality, such as hearing or touch. But for decades there has been evidence that multimodal hallucinations (which affect more than one sense at once) may be quite common. One of the main challenges in investigating them, however, has been capturing and communicating the wide array of features that comprise multimodal experiences.</p>



<p>However, thanks to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00433-8/fulltext">new research</a> in <em>EClinicalMedicine </em>from Katie Melvin and colleagues at the University of Leicester, this may be about to change. To improve our understanding of the feelings and sensations associated with hallucinations, the team gathered a group of participants to create what they dubbed MUSE maps — visual and written representations of what hallucinations feel like throughout (and around) the body. Not only do their findings suggest that most hallucinations seem to have emotional and multisensory components, but their new method offers a more intuitive way to communicate and understand hallucinatory experiences.</p>



<span id="more-44655"></span>



<p>For their study, the team recruited twelve participants who were experiencing hallucinations daily and had been given psychotic-spectrum diagnoses. For one week, these participants kept a visual diary documenting the feelings and modalities associated with their hallucinations.</p>



<p>In the diary entries, participants were encouraged to write and sketch about the details of their hallucinatory experiences. Each day’s diary page contained a tick-box list of modalities that were involved in hallucinations, free text boxes in which to write about the feelings and sensations associated with them, and a body-map to indicate which feelings were experienced in which parts of the body. The participants could use any medium to express the lived experience of their hallucinations, though all ultimately chose to provide their input using pen or pencil. The data gathered from these diaries were collectively referred to as multimodal unusual sensory experience (MUSE) maps. Finally, when the week was over, the participants came into a clinic to further discuss each of their MUSE maps in a 30-minute interview with the primary researcher.</p>



<p>The participants reported a wide range of hallucinatory experiences, such as auditory or gustatory hallucinations, all the way through to disruptions in the feeling of time. All participants shared that they experienced bodily feelings and sensations as co-occurring with hallucinations, and provided detailed schematic illustrations of their experiences on the body map templates provided (several of which are reproduced in the published article). Though some favoured words and arrows pointing to various points of the body, others took a more intuitive and artistic approach, illustrating waves of sensations with lines, sectioned bodies, broken hearts, and literally weighted limbs.</p>

From <em><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00433-8/fulltext">Melvin et al (2021)</a></em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Generally speaking, although hallucinations are typically thought of as unimodal experiences, 10 of the 12 participants in this study shared that many of their experiences were multimodal, regularly crossing emotional and sensory boundaries. Each participant typically experienced recurring sensations in particular areas of their body during hallucinations in different modalities, including feelings of pain, heat, or tension.</p>



<p>Analysis of written responses revealed 106 terms pertaining to feelings during hallucinations. The authors found that these divided into four main groups. All but one participant used <em>emotional language</em>, and most of the emotions were negative (eg. fear, powerlessness), with positive emotions only being reported in the minority of cases. Words pertaining to <em>feelings of knowing</em> were employed by half of the participants, who reported a wide range of feelings from boredom all the way to being alert during hallucinatory experiences. <em>Feelings of reality</em> being affected, such as feeling a presence, paranoia, or disorientation, were reported by almost all participants. Participants also reported <em>bodily feelings</em>, such as tiredness or heaviness.</p>



<p>Taken together, this data clearly illustrates that many hallucinations are in fact multimodal, are commonly associated with bodily sensations, and are often accompanied by unpleasant emotional responses. The exploratory nature of MUSE maps, however, does mean that this approach has some limitations. For example, the team highlights that MUSE maps may miss some pertinent sensations, in part because participants themselves decide which sensations are relevant to report, without too much prompting. Body maps including a back view, as opposed to just the front view used in this study, would also be necessary in future studies. In addition, the low sample size of this research may have failed to capture some aspects of multimodal hallucination experiences, or indeed issues with the MUSE map method. As such, future research looking at expanding the sample size and diversity is needed.</p>



<p>Even so, these findings echo contemporary research into hallucinations which suggests that multimodal experiences are common, if considerably harder to communicate. This extra layer of difficulty may have led to the general assumption that unimodal hallucinations are more prevalent. But, the authors say, tools such as MUSE maps may help to close this gap in understanding. The extent of hallucinatory experiences illustrated by the MUSE maps in this study suggest that clinicians may wish to consider broadening their assumptions on whether hallucinations are likely to be unimodal, and perhaps even consider modifying their clinical environment to be more comfortable for those with disturbances across multiple senses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-atom-light-pauli-exclusion-principle">Scientists finally detected a quantum effect that blocks atoms from scattering light</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cloud of ultracold atoms is like a motel with a neon “no vacancy” sign.</p>



<p>If a guest at the motel wants to switch rooms, they’re out of luck. No vacant rooms means there’s no choice but to stay put. Likewise, in new experiments, atoms boxed in by crowded conditions have no way to switch up their quantum states. That constraint means the atoms don’t scatter light as they normally would, three teams of researchers report in the Nov. 19 <em>Science</em>. Predicted more than three decades ago, this effect has now been seen for the first time.</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, atoms interact readily with light. Shine a beam of light on a cloud of atoms, and they’ll scatter some of that light in all directions. This type of light scattering is a common phenomenon: It happens in Earth’s atmosphere. “We see the sky as blue because of scattered radiation from the sun,” says Yair Margalit, who was part of the team at MIT that performed one of the experiments.</p>



<p>But quantum physics comes to the fore in ultracold, dense atom clouds. “The way they interact with light or scatter light is different,” says physicist Amita Deb of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, a coauthor of another of the studies.</p>





<p>According to a rule called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-exploit-quantum-rule-create-new-pauli-crystal">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, atoms in the experiments can’t take on the same quantum state — namely, they can’t have the same momentum as another atom in the experiment (<em>SN: 5/19/20</em>). If atoms are packed together in a dense cloud and cooled to near absolute zero, they&#8217;ll settle into the lowest-energy quantum states. Those low-energy states will be entirely filled, like a motel with no open rooms.</p>



<p>When an atom scatters light, it gets a kick of momentum, changing its quantum state, as it sends light off in another direction. But if the atom can’t change its state due to the crowded conditions, it won’t scatter the light. The atom cloud becomes more transparent, letting light through instead of scattering it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To observe the effect, Margalit and colleagues beamed light through <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi6153">a cloud of lithium atoms</a>, measuring the amount of light it scattered. Then, the team decreased the temperature to make the atoms fill up the lowest energy states, suppressing the scattering of light. As the temperature dropped, the atoms scattered 37 percent less light, indicating that many atoms were prevented from scattering light. (Some atoms can still scatter light, for example if they get kicked into higher-energy quantum states that are unoccupied.)</p>



<p>In another experiment, physicist Christian Sanner of the research institute JILA in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues studied <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3483">a cloud of ultracold strontium atoms</a>. The researchers measured how much light was scattered at small angles, for which the atoms are jostled less by the light and therefore are even less likely to be able to find an unoccupied quantum state. At lower temperatures, the atoms scattered half as much light as at higher temperatures.</p>



<p>The third experiment, performed by Deb and physicist Niels Kjærgaard, also of the University of Otago, measured a similar scattering drop in an <a href="http://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3470">ultracold potassium atom cloud</a> and a corresponding increase in how much light was transmitted through the cloud.</p>



<p>Because the Pauli exclusion principle also governs how electrons, protons and neutrons behave, it is responsible for the structure of atoms and matter as we know it. These new results reveal the wide-ranging principle in a new context, says Sanner. “It’s fascinating because it shows a very fundamental principle in nature at work.”</p>



<p>The work also suggests new ways to control light and atoms. “One could imagine a lot of interesting applications,” says theoretical physicist Peter Zoller of the University of Innsbruck in Austria, who was not involved with the research. In particular, light scattering is closely related to a process called spontaneous emission, in which an atom in a high-energy state decays to a lower energy by emitting light. The results suggest that decay could be blocked, increasing the lifetime of the energetic state. Such a technique might be useful for storing quantum information for a lengthier period of time than is normally possible, for example in a quantum computer.</p>



<p>So far, these applications are still theoretical, Zoller says. “How realistic they are is something to be explored in the future.”</p>

<p><strong>There’s a widespread belief that eating cheese before bed can give you weird dreams. </strong>But there’s no evidence that this is true, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211117-does-cheese-really-give-you-vivid-dreams">writes Jessica Brown</a> at <em>BBC Future</em>. The belief may have arisen from the fact that cheese is sometimes eaten as the last course of a meal, and eating late at night can disrupt our sleep.</p>
