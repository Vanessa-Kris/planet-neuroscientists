<p>I have just uploaded a technical draft on chapter 5 of <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-book-on-the-theory-of-action-potentials/">my book on action potentials</a>: <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/theory-of-action-potentials-chapter-5.pdf">Propagation of action potentials</a>. This draft introduces the cable equation, and how conduction velocity depends on axon diameter in unmyelinated and myelinated axons. There is also a short section on the extracellular potential. There are a few topics I want to add, including branching and determinants of conduction velocity (beyond diameter). There is also (almost) no figure at the moment. Finally, it is likely that the chapter is reorganized for clarity. I wanted to upload this chapter nonetheless so as to move on to the next chapter, on spike initiation with an initial segment.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>“The believer is not the one who eats when his neighbour beside him is hungry” said <a href="http://islam101.net/index.php/theology/prophet-muhammad-s-a-a-w/379-generosity-of-the-prophet">the founder of Islam</a>, but many unbelievers see this as the norm: that religious people rarely do the good demanded by their faith. Some evidence seems to support this cynicism. Surveys on tackling inequality and support for welfare often find that the religious <a href="http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-5052">show less enthusiasm</a> <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912909359404">for helping</a> the poorest in society. This would seem to reflect badly on the faithful, but <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/npe/9/3-4/182/">new research</a> in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics </i>involving Turkish Muslims offers some redemption. The findings suggest that the religious may be taking a pragmatic approach that expresses their compassion for the needy while remaining consistent with their beliefs about a just deity … and in fact, from a practical perspective, this approach may lead to surprisingly good outcomes.</p>
<p><span id="more-22529"></span></p>
<p>Ceyhun Elgin and colleagues from Boğaziçi University in Turkey, presented 550 students with a survey that asked them to tackle a resource-sharing problem. This involved a shipwreck where two parties, named Friday and Robinson, had become stranded on neighbouring islands: Island A and Island B, respectively. Each island had 12 fruit plants, and due to a quirk, each plant could only be tended (and consumed) by one person. For reasons unexplained, Robinson can only get 20 fruit from each plant (perhaps he’s a poor farmer), but he can visit both islands (maybe he’s a good swimmer or sailor). In contrast, Friday can harvest 120 fruit per plant, but he must remain on his island, Island A. The question is, what’s the fairest way to divide up ownership of the plants? Decide for yourself between the three options below.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_22530" style="width: 376px;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 09.48.50" class=" size-full wp-image-22530 aligncenter" data-attachment-id="22530" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 09.48.50" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screen-shot-2017-04-13-at-09-48-50.png?w=845?w=376" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screen-shot-2017-04-13-at-09-48-50.png?w=845?w=191" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screen-shot-2017-04-13-at-09-48-50.png?w=845" data-orig-size="376,590" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/13/who-cares-more-about-the-needy-religious-people-or-unbelievers/screen-shot-2017-04-13-at-09-48-50/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screen-shot-2017-04-13-at-09-48-50.png?w=845" />From <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/npe/9/3-4/182/">Elgin et al 2016</a></figure>
<p>These options actually represent three different political theories of distribution. The egalitarian Option Three pops out: it flattens out differences to produce equality for all. Elgin and his team measured (Islamic) religious belief in the participants and found that actually non-believers were much keener on this approach, with 38 per cent endorsing it compared to just a quarter of believers. This might seem to reinforce the idea that the religious disregard the plight of the needy. But if so, it would make sense for them to be especially drawn to utilitarian Option One, happy for inequality to thrive as long as the net total value is very high … but in fact there were no significant differences between groups in their preference for this option.</p>
<p>Instead, more than half of believers (55 per cent) settled in for Option Two, versus 43 per cent of non-believers. This distribution, called a Maximin split, aims to reduce inequality only insofar as it creates the best case for the worst off. Here, giving Robinson any more trees would make Friday the worst off – and actually worse off than Robinson is now, so going any further would be prohibited by the principle. The Maximin split is a desirable societal outcome articulated by liberal political philosopher <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a>. But many on the left find Rawls infuriating because his philosophy shores up the classic liberal compromise: endorsing the variations in wealth we see in our current capitalist system as long as the system promises an efficient route to eliminating poverty. In other words, the position doesn’t support eliminating inequality altogether.</p>
<p>However, the Rawlian compromise seems to suit the religious pretty well. Eglin’s team speculate that as religious people have more faith in a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000727">just world</a>, believing in a fair deity that guides affairs, they are reluctant to hobble winners in the name of egalitarianism. Some support for this interpretation came from a followup survey where Robinson’s poor ability to tend fruit was revealed to be due to injury. Option One, which is toughest on Robinson, became much less attractive to non-believers, but believers stuck to their guns. Non-believers see a lack of blame, and are motivated to redress the situation, whereas the religious see fate in action, and are not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most religious participants still cared about the worst off. Suspicious of social engineering to correct the way of things, but mindful of the virtue of compassion, they find their preferences best expressed via the Maximin distribution. <i>A half-hearted fudge! </i>we could cry – <i>less compassionate than the non-believer.</i> But look closely at the table, and you can see that Maximin actually leaves the poorest individual, Robinson, better off than in Option Three. In this case, an ideological focus on equality obscures the best outcome for the needy. Assuming these findings generalise to other faiths and cultures, perhaps religious and unbelievers don’t differ in their compassion for others, but in their ideologies – a just world, or the necessity of equality – that can colour how they act when they encounter someone in need.</p>

<img alt="Pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/truke-img-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As scientific research becomes more reliant on published datasets and online resources, the effects of data corruption are a growing concern. This is particularly the case in the field of genomics where researchers often use online depositories and published supplements for their analyses.</p>
<p>Problems can occur when data is altered by formatting defaults in programs such as Microsoft Excel. This poses a problem to genomics researchers when gene names are converted to dates. For example, inputted gene names such as ‘SEPT2’ may be converted to 2016/09/02 when the program automatically formats this gene name to a date.</p>
<p>The huge scale of this problem was highlighted by <em>Ziemann et al</em> in an <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7"><span style="color: #0066cc;">article published</span></a> recently in <em><a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/">Genome Biology</a></em>. The researchers scanned leading genomics journals to find that one fifth of papers containing supplementary gene lists harboured these errors. Altered gene names were present in 987 supplementary files of 704 publications. Interestingly, it transpired that the journals with the highest impact factors were more likely to contain the corrupted data.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8832" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Pixabay" class="size-medium wp-image-8832" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/truke-img-1-300x169.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Finding this high rate of data corruption in published materials is disconcerting to the genomics community, who utilise these data sources heavily. This error can be difficult to reverse, and there have been few known solutions to remediate it.</p>
<p>In order to combat this troubling issue a team from Health Research Institute Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP) in Spain have developed a new software tool named <em>Truke</em>, to help retain the integrity of genomic data. The new software which is described in an article <a href="http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3631-8">recently published</a> in <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Genomics</em></a>, restores corrupted symbols to their original gene names, through methods such as library referencing and reverse engineering.</p>
<p>By sourcing data from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><em>National Center for Biotechnology Information</em></a> (NCBI) database, a library of error prone gene symbols are collated, and their corresponding ‘dates’ predicted. When the user’s datasets are scanned by the system, the false dates are identified, and converted back to their original gene names. Safeguards are in place to avoid errors in the system. For example, in cases where a false date could correspond to more than one gene name, such as SEPT1 or SEPT-1, this discrepancy is flagged to the user for action.</p>
<p>The <em>Truke</em> web application was built using R, Shiny, HTML and bootstrap2 programming tools, and is freely available for use at <a href="http://maplab.cat/truke">http://maplab.cat/truke</a>.</p>
<p>As shown in this <a href="http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3631-8?utm_content=buffer6d452&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">article</a>, we are presented with a potential solution to a problem which can be commonly overlooked by both scientists and publishers. While more and more data is published each year, perhaps these threats to data integrity can be lessened with the help of software solutions.</p>

<p>The last decade hasn’t exactly been drama-free for Franck Mauvais-Jarvis, head of the Diabetes Research Program at Tulane University. After being accused of falsifying three figures in a submitted manuscript, Mauvais-Jarvis sued his accusers and officials at his former employer — Northwestern University — for defamation and conspiracy in 2011. In 2014, a judge dismissed the suit. We […]</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to work in an environment focused on cooperation and solidarity, one that put the needs of the many above those of the few? Sounds great … but collectivism has some surprising downsides, especially if you’re a star performer. New <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-06323-001/">research</a> in the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i> looks at workplace reactions to high performers and their polarising effect on those around them, and shows that in more cooperative climates, hotshots are actually more likely to get a raw deal.</p>
<p><span id="more-22509"></span></p>
<p>Elizabeth Campbell and her colleagues surveyed 350 hair stylists, mainly women, working within a chain of Taiwanese salons. The researchers were interested in how the most successful stylists were treated by their peers: they identified hotshots by asking managers for performance ratings, and then they surveyed all the staff to find out the benefits and threats they saw in each other, and how much criticism and support they received. They also asked stylists about their salon’s working climate by asking them how much they agreed with statements like “there is a high level of cooperation between stylists”.</p>
<p>You can consider a fellow hotshot a benefit: an inspiration, a source of advice and expertise, and a way to attract prestige. Or you can see them as a threat; they’re likely to take the best duties and customers, and garner the greatest favour from leadership.</p>
<p>The researchers found that hotshots experienced more negative treatment in the form of belittling and criticism when they were surrounded by co-workers who felt threatened. In contrast, hotshots received more help and support if their colleagues saw them as a benefit. The typical high performer had a mixed bag: compared to the typical stylist, they were criticised more, but also received more support.</p>
<p>But that support was lacking within salons with more cooperative climates. This might seem puzzling until you understand a cooperative climate isn’t about sweetness and biscuits, but rather a culture where group solidarity is paramount. Under these conditions, a stand-out performer is simply a nail that needs to be hammered down, like the 1940s factories whose unionised workers gave a hard time to “rate-busters” whose performance made the rest look bad.</p>
<p>To investigate this systematically, the researchers ran an experiment with 284 US undergraduates, divided into collaborative teams who were told in an introduction either to approach their problem-solving tasks with a highly cooperative focus (e.g. interaction was described as a “collaborative discussion”, and rewards were split equally) or a with a more competitive focus (interaction would be “spirited debate”, and there were more individualised rewards, but still collaborating toward a common goal). Participants were then isolated in separate cubicles and after each round of problem-solving, they received information about the performance of each team-member and had the chance to exchange messages with each other (actually the information and messages were made up by the researchers, but the participants didn’t know this).</p>
<p>After a few rounds, participants were asked how they felt about some of the other specific team members, including those made to seem like hotshots. Participants who perceived a star performer as a threat tended to join in with backbiting when receiving bitchy chat-messages about the hotshot from another member, but crucially this only happened in the cooperative condition. In the low-cooperative one, there was no heightened denigration of hotshots. So whereas the earlier survey evidence suggested that helping of strong performers was impaired by a more cooperative culture, this experiment showed a cooperative culture was associated with more belittling of strong performers.</p>
<p>It’s notoriously hard for organisations to hang on to high performers who are often courted by rival organisations with better financial packages or positions. But money can’t buy working with people who really know, value and respect you. So overly solidarity-focused organisations – the kind that may resent their outstanding performers – risk eroding their edge in holding onto their talent. Maybe that’s just fine for some of the rank and file, but not for those who want their organisations to excel.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/sKzumA7mtXo/nature22058">High-avidity IgA protects the intestine by enchaining growing bacteria</a></h4>

<p>
 Vaccine-induced high-avidity IgA can protect against bacterial enteropathogens by directly neutralizing virulence factors or by poorly defined mechanisms that physically impede bacterial interactions with the gut tissues (‘immune exclusion’). IgA-mediated cross-linking clumps bacteria in the gut lumen and is critical for protection against infection by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). However, classical agglutination, which was thought to drive this process, is efficient only at high pathogen densities (≥108 non-motile bacteria per gram). In typical infections, much lower densities (100–107 colony-forming units per gram) of rapidly dividing bacteria are present in the gut lumen. Here we show that a different physical process drives formation of clumps in vivo: IgA-mediated cross-linking enchains daughter cells, preventing their separation after division, and clumping is therefore dependent on growth. Enchained growth is effective at all realistic pathogen densities, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Furthermore, IgA enchains plasmid-donor and -recipient clones into separate clumps, impeding conjugative plasmid transfer in vivo. Enchained growth is therefore a mechanism by which IgA can disarm and clear potentially invasive species from the intestinal lumen without requiring high pathogen densities, inflammation or bacterial killing. Furthermore, our results reveal an untapped potential for oral vaccines in combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

<p>
 The Rad51 (also known as RecA) family of recombinases executes the critical step in homologous recombination: the search for homologous DNA to serve as a template during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although budding yeast Rad51 has been extensively characterized in vitro, the stringency of its search and sensitivity to mismatched sequences in vivo remain poorly defined. Here, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analysed Rad51-dependent break-induced replication in which the invading DSB end and its donor template share a 108-base-pair homology region and the donor carries different densities of single-base-pair mismatches. With every eighth base pair mismatched, repair was about 14% of that of completely homologous sequences. With every sixth base pair mismatched, repair was still more than 5%. Thus, completing break-induced replication in vivo overcomes the apparent requirement for at least 6–8 consecutive paired bases that has been inferred from in vitro studies. When recombination occurs without a protruding nonhomologous 3′ tail, the mismatch repair protein Msh2 does not discourage homeologous recombination. However, when the DSB end contains a 3′ protruding nonhomologous tail, Msh2 promotes the rejection of mismatched substrates. Mismatch correction of strand invasion heteroduplex DNA is strongly polar, favouring correction close to the DSB end. Nearly all mismatch correction depends on the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase-δ, although the repair proteins Msh2, Mlh1 and Exo1 influence the extent of correction.

<p>
 There are no disease-modifying treatments for adult human neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test RNA-targeted therapies in two mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease. Both models recreate the progressive adult-onset dysfunction and degeneration of a neuronal network that are seen in patients, including decreased firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a decline in motor function. We developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 gene by screening 152 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The most promising oligonucleotide, ASO7, downregulated ATXN2 mRNA and protein, which resulted in delayed onset of the SCA2 phenotype. After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection to ATXN2-Q127 mice, ASO7 localized to Purkinje cells, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 expression below 75% for more than 10 weeks without microglial activation, and reduced the levels of cerebellar ATXN2. Treatment of symptomatic mice with ASO7 improved motor function compared to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the BAC-Q72 SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized protein levels of several SCA2-related proteins expressed in Purkinje cells, including Rgs8, Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76 and Fam107b. Notably, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells returned to normal even when treatment was initiated more than 12 weeks after the onset of the motor phenotype in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings support ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human neurodegenerative diseases.

<p>
 The 2013–2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5% of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic ‘gravity’ model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.

<p>
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis and death 2–5 years after disease onset. Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords, and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS. There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases. Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression. However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2–5% of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions. Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies, and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS. We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS, targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy.

<p>The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established, but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies or are known from poorly preserved or incomplete material. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the bird–crocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22037">doi: 10.1038/nature22037</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/wNGe1vrWbc0" width="1" />

<p>
 A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome. Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such ‘human knockouts’ can provide insight into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare (&lt;1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3 has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3 homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations provide a roadmap for a ‘human knockout project’, a systematic effort to understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans.

<p>
 In vertebrates, skin colour patterns emerge from nonlinear dynamical microscopic systems of cell interactions. Here we show that in ocellated lizards a quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton (a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges from a continuous Turing reaction–diffusion system. Skin thickness variation generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying reaction–diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/FMCLBNGKrVo/nature21718">Topological defects in epithelia govern cell death and extrusion</a></h4>

<p>Epithelial tissues (epithelia) remove excess cells through extrusion, preventing the accumulation of unnecessary or pathological cells. The extrusion process can be triggered by apoptotic signalling, oncogenic transformation and overcrowding of cells. Despite the important linkage of cell extrusion to developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes such as cancer metastasis, its underlying mechanism and connections to the intrinsic mechanics of the epithelium are largely unexplored. We approach this problem by modelling the epithelium as an active nematic liquid crystal (that has a long range directional order), and comparing numerical simulations to strain rate and stress measurements within monolayers of MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells. Here we show that apoptotic cell extrusion is provoked by singularities in cell alignments in the form of comet-shaped topological defects. We find a universal correlation between extrusion sites and positions of nematic defects in the cell orientation field in different epithelium types. The results confirm the active nematic nature of epithelia, and demonstrate that defect-induced isotropic stresses are the primary precursors of mechanotransductive responses in cells, including YAP (Yes-associated protein) transcription factor activity, caspase-3-mediated cell death, and extrusions. Importantly, the defect-driven extrusion mechanism depends on intercellular junctions, because the weakening of cell–cell interactions in an α-catenin knockdown monolayer reduces the defect size and increases both the number of defects and extrusion rates, as is also predicted by our model. We further demonstrate the ability to control extrusion hotspots by geometrically inducing defects through microcontact printing of patterned monolayers. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for apoptotic cell extrusion: spontaneously formed topological defects in epithelia govern cell fate. This will be important in predicting extrusion hotspots and dynamics in vivo, with potential applications to tissue regeneration and the suppression of metastasis. Moreover, we anticipate that the analogy between the epithelium and active nematic liquid crystals will trigger further investigations of the link between cellular processes and the material properties of epithelia.</p><p>Nature 544 212 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21718">doi: 10.1038/nature21718</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/FMCLBNGKrVo" width="1" />

<p>During human evolution, our cerebral cortex increased in size in response to new environmental challenges. The cerebral cortex is the site of diverse processes, including visual perception and language acquisition. However, no accepted unitary theory of cortical function exists yet. One hypothesis is that there is an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit that implements a simple and flexible computation. This idea is known as the “canonical circuit.”  As Gary Marcus, Adam Marblestone, and Thomas Dean note in a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/346/6209/551.full.pdf">perspective piece in Science</a>, there is still no consensus about whether such a canonical circuit exists nearly four decades later. Researchers argue that there is little evidence that such a uniform structure can capture the diversity of cortical function in simple mammals.</p>
<p>What would it mean for the cortex to be diverse rather than uniform? Marcus and his colleagues propose that the brain may consist of an array of elementary computational units, which act in parallel as a microprocessor<sup>1</sup>. To probe at questions on cortical circuitry, collaborative endeavors engaging scientists and engineers have emerged. In parallel with the <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu">Human Brain Project</a> in Europe, the <a href="https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov">Brain Research through Advancing Imaging Neurotechnologies</a> Initiative is developing tools to view the brain at superior spatial and temporal resolution<sup>2</sup>. Researchers aim to directly study the relationship of a neuron’s function to its connections. This can be accomplished by mapping neuronal connections in conjunction with acquiring functional activity data.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up </strong></p>
<p>Researchers can scale up from the study of neurons and synapses to those of neural circuits and networks. However, this bottom-up approach may not be the best way to understand the neural basis of human cognition. Psychologist <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aai/2010/918062/#B14">Frank van der Welde</a> argues that this confuses the nature of understanding with the way to achieve understanding<sup>4</sup>. He provides an analogy to physics. To understand the universe, a bottom-up approach would begin with an understanding of elementary particles, how these particles combine to make atoms, and how atoms to combine to make molecules. However, physics did not begin with the study of elementary particles. It began with a study of the solar system, which provided the first law of motion. In summary, understanding can proceed from top to bottom as well as bottom to top.</p>
<p>To understand human cognition, neuroscientists should combine top-down and bottom-up approaches. One top-down approach is generating a large-scale simulation of neural processes that generate intelligence. This project intersects neuroscience and artificial intelligence. For instance, a research team at IBM represented 8 x 10<sup>6</sup> neurons and 6400 synapses per neuron on the IBM Blue Gene Processor, and ran 1 s of model time in 10 s of real time<sup>5</sup>. Large-scale simulations provide a tool to investigate the brain not limited by the experimental and ethical limitations of <em>in vivo </em>work. Through such virtual models alongside neuroscience studies, researchers may arrive at the neural basis of intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>As neuroscience details the anatomy and activity of the brain, artificial intelligence seeks to develop an independent, non-biological path to intelligence. Researchers of both fields can agree that artificial intelligence is not the equal of natural intelligence in most important tasks for human cognition such as vision, motor manipulations, and natural language understanding. However, this is not to say that artificial intelligence won’t ultimately achieve principles of natural intelligence. I met with <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, a professor of computer science at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu">New York University</a>, to learn more about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Advances in artificial intelligence have been incredible, from IBM Watson to Google DeepMind AlphaGo. Davis believes that AI will continue to advance and be used for positive and negative applications. For instance, AI can be used for improving <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md">the quality of medicine</a> and building <a href="https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/">self-driving cars</a>. “The impact of that will be largely positive though there will be a negative impact on employment. It will also be used for military purposes, and the immediate effects of that are mostly negative,” Davis says. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence is far from building programs that retain human-level intelligence. The human brain has an unsurpassed ability to do complex, real-time interactions in a dynamic world.</p>
<p>To implement reasoning in artificial intelligence, Davis explains different techniques available by example. For instance, chess-playing program Deep Blue did reasoning by thinking through a large number of paths to the future and determining what solution works out. A second example is software verification programs. These algorithms search for bugs in programs through logical reasoning. The program provides users with a formal proof that a program doesn’t have a certain kind of bug. A third example is taxonomic reasoning, which is a simple form of logical reasoning by category. This type of reasoning has been done in programs called semantic nets, which have been in use for 50 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A New Century of the Brain</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.paulallen.com">Paul Allen</a>, the co-founder of Microsoft, has funded two distinct research projects in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/09/30/brain/?utm_term=.eb1f3ef1b622">The Washington Post</a> aptly describes it as Allen’s $500 million quest to dissect the mind and code a new one from scratch. Elon Musk has funded a rival company called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/27/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-cranial-computing/">NeuroLink</a> to create human-computer hybrids. To build an artificial brain, Davis believes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The replica of the human brain can mean either the ability to do human-level tasks, which I think in principle is possible, or algorithms that are an imitation of the brain. We don’t yet know which direction is the best way to pursue AI. There’s an awful lot we don’t understand about the brain so it may be pre-mature to try the latter. </em></p>
<p>            Neuroscience and artificial intelligence both aim to identify architectures of intelligence and cognition. <a href="https://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/gazzaniga">Michael Gazzaniga</a> states that cognitive neuroscience asks: what are the algorithms that drive structural neural elements into the physiological activity that results in perception, cognition, and consciousness? Likewise, artificial intelligence asks: what are the algorithms that can generate human-like intelligence in machines to perform reasoning, planning, and learning? Both fields describe mechanisms of intelligence as “algorithms.”<sup>4</sup> To uncover human intelligence and cognition, intersections in neuroscience and artificial intelligence are necessary. Perhaps only then can we can understand what makes us human.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Some of us work to live, others live to work – these toilers see hard graft as virtuous and they’re more than happy to go the extra mile to climb the career ladder and serve their employer. Organisations, understandably, are interested in hiring people with this kind of work ethic and so psychologists are trying to find out where it comes from.</p>
<p>It’s already known that children with harder working parents also tend to have a stronger work ethic. But a new study in the <em>Journal of General Psychology</em> is one of the first to investigate whether our relationship with our parents in the past – when we were teenagers – is related to our attitude and approach to work as adults. Monique Leenders at the University of Groningen and her colleagues found some small but statistically significant correlations, in particular men’s approach to work seemed to be related to the quality of the teenage relationship they had with their fathers.</p>
<p><span id="more-22444"></span></p>
<p>The researchers surveyed nearly 4,000 people in the Netherlands, including 1526 men with an average age of 47 and 2291 women with an average age of 44. The participants answered items tapping the quality of the relationship they had with mother and with their father when they were in their teens, such as rating their agreement with “My mother [father] and I were very close” and “I always felt that my father [mother] supported me”. They also said whether they agreed with statements regarding their approach to work, such as “I’d rather work overtime than fail to get something done on time”, and their work ethic, such as “I feel happiest after I’ve worked hard”.</p>
<p>Overall, there was a small but statistically significant correlation between the quality of the participants’ teen relationships with their parents and their current work attitude and work ethic. Digging deeper into the stats separately for men and women, the researchers found that the male and female participants’ teen relationship with their fathers, but not their mothers, was correlated with their current approach to work. Meanwhile, men’s work ethic was correlated with their past relationship quality with their mothers and fathers, but women’s work ethic was not.</p>
<p>“These findings suggest that parents influence work values differently and that the relationship with the father is more central to the development of children’s work values than the relationship with the mother,” Leenders and her team said, adding that this may be because historically it is fathers who more often have jobs outside of the home and may therefore “serve as important role models and have more impact on their children than mothers in the work arena.”</p>
<p>The researchers said their study was just a “first step” and they acknowledged they haven’t proved any causal influence of parental relations on work attitudes. Nonetheless, they said that careers counsellors might help employees not only by discussing their current issues at work, but also by considering the possible influence of their past family relationships.</p>
<p>Another major complication in interpreting research of this kind, not mentioned by the researchers, is the role of genetic effects. Although it’s tempting to speculate about parental role modelling, any apparent transmission of work ethic from one generation to the next is in large part likely to be related to the inheritance of genes associated with trait Conscientiousness.</p>

<p>When someone breaks the speed limit, we tend to explain it away as recklessness, machismo, or impatience. But new research led by Vanessa Bowden at the University of Western Australia, suggests that problems in memory, not temperament, may often be the culprit. According to a recent <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-09892-001/">study</a> in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, traffic stops and other interruptions can disrupt our ability to keep track of recent changes to the speed limit. But the research doesn’t entirely let us off the hook: when waiting at a stop, we can reduce these interfering effects by making sure we keep our attention on the road.</p>
<p><span id="more-22419"></span></p>
<p>The research involved around 100 students at the University of Western Australia, mostly younger men, which is the demographic most likely to be involved in speeding-related accidents. Participants sat in a simulated driving cockpit with steering wheel, pedals and windscreen projecting a virtual road along which they had to drive for 15 kilometres without speeding, but also without dropping too far below the limit. In the first study, the limit was mostly a brisk 70km/hr, but it periodically decreased to 40km/hr for short sections of the road.</p>
<p>Five seconds after entering half of the 40 zones, participants were confronted with a red traffic signal, after which they were three times more likely to go on to speed in the zone – defined as five km/hr or more over the limit – than they were in the other half of the 40 zones, which had no interruption. In the rarer cases of speeding in the uninterrupted zones, the average top speed was just 47km/hr; a breach, but not a flagrant one. But the interrupted drivers reached an average top speed of 60km/hr, closer to the old limit than the current one. Bowden and her colleagues argue that this suggests that the interrupted drivers were frequently forgetting the new lower limit was in place.</p>
<p>These findings are consistent with similar evidence from real traffic data, which has also been interpreted in terms of drivers’ disrupted memory. But an alternative explanation is simply that people find traffic stops frustrating and speed to make up for lost time. With no real-life appointments at stake, the current simulation research makes this seem less plausible. But Bowden’s next experiment went one better, by flipping the zones so the default limit was 40km/hr and the exceptions were 70km/hr. They found that when a new 70 zone was interrupted by a red traffic light, participants tended to progress with an inappropriately <i>slow</i><i> </i>speed, not faster: a quarter of interrupted 70 zones involved under-speeding, with participants driving on average at 50km/hr (in contrast, under-speeding, even merely 5km/hr under the limit, almost never occurred in uninterrupted zones). This is strong evidence that participants aren’t hurrying after a light, but simply misremembering the new limit.</p>
<p>Other distractions can compound the problem. When the researchers gave participants a challenging task to do while waiting at a red light in a new speed zone (judging repeatedly whether the newest letter in series was earlier in the alphabet than the previous one; a real life parallel might be using a red light stop to reprogramme your satnav), they found that this led to more instances of what they called “corrected speeding” where the participant shot off and immediately exceeded the limit, but caught themselves later in the zone. With a distracting task, this occurred in one in ten zones, compared to one in a hundred without a distracting task.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that improving road safety is not only about changing attitudes, but also about considering drivers’ cognitive limitations, which gives some credence to the pleas of ignorance made by 20 to 50 per cent of drivers fined for speeding. Planners should think carefully about how speed changes intersect with focus-grabbing interruptions. And we should be aware that a stop in traffic isn’t always an opportunity to daydream, change the radio, or fiddle with the satnav. The road is a complicated place, and deserves our full attention.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Psychology is overly dependent on student samples, but on the plus side, you might assume that one advantage of comparing across student samples is that you can rule out the influence of complicating background factors, such as differences in average personality profile. In fact, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12224/abstract">writing in the <em>Journal of Personality</em></a>, a team of US researchers led by Katherine Corker at Kenyon College has challenged this assumption: their findings suggest that if you test a group of students at one university, it’s not safe to assume that their average personality profile will match that of a sample of students from a university elsewhere in the same country.</p>
<p><span id="more-22245"></span></p>
<p>Corker and her colleagues measured the personality of over 8,500 students studying a range of majors (including psychology, business and nutrition) at 30 colleges and universities across 20 different US states. They found some significant differences in average student personality between different sites. The amount of difference that was explained by the site of testing was modest – about 1 to 3 per cent – but Corker and her colleagues said that this “should not be dismissed as necessarily trivial or unimportant”.</p>
<p>Among the site-specific effects, larger universities tended to have more extraverted students; more urban and diverse universities had more open-minded students;  universities requiring letters of recommendation had more agreeable students; public colleges had less agreeable students than private colleges; and more expensive colleges had higher trait Neuroticism. Differences like these could reflect students with particular personality profiles being drawn to particular institutions; selection could be at play, in the sense of university selectors showing a preference for particular personality types; and also students’ personalities could be shaped by the culture of their university.</p>
<p>“All told, these results suggest there is more variability between students at different colleges and universities than some researchers might have expected,” Corker and her team said, though they warned their colleagues not to leap to this finding as an explanation for the replication crisis in psychology (the difficulty labs often have in trying reproduce earlier findings reported by researchers based at another institution), at least not until there is more data and a thorough theory in place to account for the site differences in personality.</p>
<p>It’s a shame the current research didn’t include students studying a more diverse set of subjects, but if anything, this makes it likely the observed between-institution differences are an underestimate. Perhaps for now the lesson to take is that if you’re comparing data from two sets of students at different institutions, it’s unwise to be overconfident about how similar they are likely to be.</p>

<p>
 Despite the success of monotherapies based on blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) in human melanoma, most patients do not experience durable clinical benefit. Pre-existing T-cell infiltration and/or the presence of PD-L1 in tumours may be used as indicators of clinical response; however, blood-based profiling to understand the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade has not been widely explored. Here we use immune profiling of peripheral blood from patients with stage IV melanoma before and after treatment with the PD-1-targeting antibody pembrolizumab and identify pharmacodynamic changes in circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells (Tex cells). Most of the patients demonstrated an immunological response to pembrolizumab. Clinical failure in many patients was not solely due to an inability to induce immune reinvigoration, but rather resulted from an imbalance between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. The magnitude of reinvigoration of circulating Tex cells determined in relation to pretreatment tumour burden correlated with clinical response. By focused profiling of a mechanistically relevant circulating T-cell subpopulation calibrated to pretreatment disease burden, we identify a clinically accessible potential on-treatment predictor of response to PD-1 blockade.

<p>The week at Retraction Watch featured a predatory journal sting involving a fake disorder from Seinfeld, and a study with disturbing findings about how retracted papers are cited. Here’s what was happening elsewhere: “Openness and reproducibility may be core to how science works, but they can be misused or turned into ways of pursuing ideological attacks,” […]</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=8690">Dogs Don't Process Language With Their Left Brains, After All</a></h4>

A case of left-right confusion misled researchers about how dogs process language.

Last August, Hungarian neuroscientists Atilla Andics and colleagues reported that the left hemisphere of the dog brain is selectively activated in response to the lexical properties (i.e. the meaning) of spoken words. This result was very interesting, not least because lexical processing is also lateralized to the left hemisphere in most humans. The paper appeared in the prestigious journal Science.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings from the AACR Annual Meeting!<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, we heard Joe Biden’s report on the progress of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative, compared immuno-oncology combination therapies, and mulled over the use of CRISPR screening to finding epigenetically controlled loci.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1049" style="width: 181px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1049 " height="228" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Biden-225x300.jpg" width="171" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Joe Biden delivers the Cancer Moonshot Initiative update at AACR 2017</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also checked out the groundbreaking research being done by service providers on the </span><a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their work directly addresses the recommendations made last fall by the Moonshot’s Blue Ribbon Panel, and we are excited to give cancer researchers rapid access to these technologies through the Science Exchange platform!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few highlights from our exploration of #AACR17:</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000000;">First humanized mouse model of tumor growth in bone: Pharmatest and Taconic Biosciences</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Moonshot Initiative’s recommendations specifically called out the potential of humanized mouse models to recapitulate the cellular architecture and heterogeneity found in human tumors. Traditional preclinical models that lack functional interactions between tumor, immune system and microenvironment have not been effective at predicting safety and efficacy of immunomodulating cancer drugs.</span></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1051" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1051 size-medium" height="225" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Taconic-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Taconic Biosciences showcases its novel animal models at AACR 2017</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/pharmatest-services-ltd?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pharmatest Services, Ltd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. and </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/taconic-biosciences?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taconic Biosciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both leaders in the development of predictive animal models, presented a </span><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4292/presentation/12085"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at AACR 2017 showing the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in the bone injection site of humanized mice. The observed tumor growth, bone remodeling, and infiltration by human immune cells were similar to that seen in human breast cancer patients suffering from bone metastases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validation of this mouse model would be a very promising development for preclinical testing of immuno-oncology drug candidates and combination therapies.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Mass spectrometry imaging to characterize tumor microenvironment: Imabiotech</strong></h2>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_1052" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1052 size-medium" height="225" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Imabiotech-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Imabiotech’s novel mass spectrometry imaging technology provides better toxicity and efficacy assessments in a number of therapeutic research areas, including immuno-oncology.</p></div>
<p>One challenge facing the Cancer Moonshot Initiative is that novel technologies are required to address tumor heterogeneity (at the cellular and molecular levels). Thus, the Blue Ribbon Panel called out multiplexed, quantitative imaging as a promising way to connect function with localization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/imabiotech-corp?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imabiotech Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/imabiotech-corp?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely-published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expert in the emerging field of mass spectrometry imaging, which is a promising technology to address tumor heterogeneity. Their </span><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4292/presentation/1571"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and exhibit at AACR 2017 showcased how mass spectrometry imaging could be used to quantitatively characterize responses to immunotherapy in the tumor microenvironment, with spatial resolution. </span></p>

<strong>Toward 3D patient-derived models of breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma: KIYATEC, Inc.</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another of the most challenging aspects of oncology is the fact that each patient has a different response to a particular therapy. Recognizing this, the Moonshot Initiative’s recommendations included a call to establish patient-derived test models, such as organoids and xenografts, in which candidate drugs could be tested before treatment.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KIYATEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose expertise lies in generating and using 3D cell-based models for drug response profiling, presented their work on breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), in </span><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4292/presentations/kiyatec/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three posters </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at AACR 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study addressed the challenges facing small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, for whom surgical resection is rarely feasible. Therefore, patient-derived tissue is difficult to obtain. </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KIYATEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was able to isolate functional cancer stem cells and circulating tumor cells, label-free, from SCLC patients, with the aim of developing 3D microtumors from these cells.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KIYATEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also showed that 3D models of breast cancer, which incorporated multiple stromal cell types and immune cells, responded differently to immune checkpoint inhibitors than standard 2D cell culture models. Finally, </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/kiyatec-inc?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=aacr2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KIYATEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tackled GBM, for which therapy is particularly confounded by intra-tumor and inter-patient heterogeneity. They developed an efficient method to develop patient-derived 3D models, which may enable more personalized treatments for GBM.</span></p>
