              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-children-parent-caregiver-loss-death-5-million">More than 5 million children have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>An estimated 5.2 million children worldwide have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19.</p>



<p>The tally covers the beginning of the pandemic through October 2021, during which there were about 5 million deaths globally from COVID-19. With each reported death, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(22)00005-0/fulltext">at least one child became orphaned — losing one or both parents — or experienced the loss of a caregiver</a>, such as a grandparent or other adult relative that lived in the home, researchers report online February 24 in the <em>Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<p>Of the more than 3 million children who became orphans, just over 2 million were 10 to 17 years old, nearly 740,000 were ages 5 to 9, and almost 500,000 were 4 years old or younger. Close to 800,000 children lost their mothers. The fathers of more than 2.5 million children died of COVID-19.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Staggering loss<br></h3>



<p>From May through October 2021, the estimated number of children who lost a parent or caregiver from COVID-19 nearly doubled, from 2.7 million to 5.2 million.</p>

<p>The international research team’s calculations are based on an analysis of reported COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths that occurred during the pandemic (those beyond what would be expected without a pandemic) and other data from 21 countries.</p>



<p>Previously, the team had estimated that from March 2020 through April 2021, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">1.5 million children lost a parent or caregiver</a> as a result of COVID-19 (<em>SN: 8/10/21</em>). The researchers adjusted that total to 2.7 million, based on updated mortality data. That means that over the six months from May through October 2021, the number of children who lost a parent or caregiver due to COVID-19 almost doubled, from 2.7 million to 5.2 million.</p>

<p>The death of a parent or caregiver can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/epidemics-infectious-disease-polio-flu-vaccine-aftermath-race">harm the long-term health and well-being of children</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/21</em>). “Our findings suggest an urgent need for pandemic responses to prioritize children affected by deaths of parents and caregivers,” the researchers write, with approaches tailored to the age- and circumstance-dependent risks that children face. For example, studies have found that orphaned adolescents are more likely to leave school and report symptoms of depression than those who aren’t orphans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">The COVID-19 pandemic is not an on-off switch</a></h4>

              
                <p>During the winter surge of COVID-19, it felt like the coronavirus was everywhere. Colder weather pushed people inside <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">where the virus can linger in the air</a>, and the surge-dominating omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had the troublesome ability to dodge some immune responses (<em>SN</em>: 5/18/21). That meant that <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status">both vaccinated</a> or previously infected people were more susceptible to getting infected than they were with previous coronavirus variants. Perhaps that shouldn’t have been a surprise given the vaccines’ primary goal is to prevent severe disease and death (not to prevent infection at all, what’s called sterilizing immunity). Still, omicron caught everyone off guard.</p>



<p>Finally, weeks after COVID-19 cases skyrocketed, they continue to trend downward in most parts of the United States and around the world. Every time cases drop, I find myself holding my breath, hoping that signs of a resurgence won’t appear. So far, so good — for now. I might be able to let that breath out soon, for at least a bit. (Although cases in New Jersey, where I live, appear to be plateauing at levels close to the peak of last summer’s delta wave.)</p>



<p>The bulk of the winter COVID-19 cases were caused a subvariant of omicron dubbed BA.1. Researchers are now keeping an eye on its close sibling, an omicron subvariant called BA.2. Even as cases decrease overall, BA.2 is <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">on the rise</a>, accounting for an estimated 4 percent of new cases in the United States for the week ending February 19.</p>

<p>BA.2 concerns researchers because it is slightly more transmissible than BA.1, which could extend the current surge, and it also has some different mutations than BA.1. Both BA.1 and BA.2 can evade immune responses by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">dodging virus-attacking antibodies</a> sparked by vaccination or infection with other variants, and some of BA.2’s differences might mean it could evade antibodies made after a BA.1 infection (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). So far, that’s not what scientists are seeing. Instead, even though these types of reinfections can happen, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.19.22271112v1">they are rare</a>, a team from Europe reports in a preliminary study posted February 22 at medRxiv.org. Reinfections with BA.2, the team found, were most common in young, unvaccinated people who weren’t hospitalized. Time will tell how long this protection holds up and how it might fare against future variants or subvariants.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve worried about reinfections. An eon ago in pandemic time, in early 2021, the emergence of the alpha, beta and gamma variants sparked concerns that more people might soon be faced with a second bout of COVID-19. So in February of last year, I interviewed epidemiologist Aubree Gordon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to hear her thoughts on<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-variants-reinfection-vaccination-efforts"> what variants might mean for the pandemic at large</a> (<em>SN</em>: 2/5/21).</p>



<p>Back then, our understanding of reinfections was in its infancy. Studies hinted that the beta and gamma variants could evade parts of the immune system, making reinfections possible. But we didn’t know how common reinfections were or if a second bout of COVID-19 might be less severe than the first. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout in the United States was inching along, with many people desperately seeking first doses. Last year, Gordon, who has been studying coronavirus reinfections, told me that the new variants might prolong the pandemic. But she was quick to remind me that even in the face of variants, pandemics always end.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to February 2022. Vaccines are more broadly available (although there are still access issues and some people don’t want the shots), and we’re certainly no spring chickens when it comes to face-offs with new variants. But because the pandemic is a time warp, I decided to catch up with Gordon now to see if her thinking has changed since February 2021. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What have we learned about reinfection over the past year? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>One of the things that we’ve learned about reinfection or [vaccine] breakthroughs is that once people have that second exposure — be that their first is vaccination and their second is infection or their first is infection and second is vaccination — people generate “hybrid immunity.” People are generating a broader [immune] response which is going to help protect them against future infections. It’s not going to be sterilizing immunity against all variants that arise, but it’s certainly going to help reduce the probability that people get infected or reinfected with every variant. And when they do get reinfected, they will be more mild infections.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Last year, you said that we may or may not need booster shots. What are your thoughts now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Our perception of boosters has completely changed. It became evident that boosters would help. They would help to curb transmission. They would help to reduce severity for people who do have breakthrough infections. I think it’s generally felt that there’s a need for an omicron-specific booster because getting vaccinated and boosted with the original strain of the virus is not very effective at preventing infections with omicron.</p>



<p>We need to look toward the future. I think one of the big questions with an omicron-specific booster is going to be what effect will that booster have on somebody who’s already been vaccinated or even vaccinated and boosted previously. Is it just boosting immunity to omicron? Or do you see them develop broader immunity? Through boosting with a different variant, you might generate broader immunity to protect not only against omicron but also briefly protect against any future variants that circulate.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: As states drop mask mandates, there&#8217;s talk that we are exiting the pandemic phase of this viral outbreak. Is that true?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think completely letting go of control at this point would be a mistake. We’re not through it, we’re not at the endemic level [when the virus normally circulates at some baseline amount]. But I do think we are in a transition period.</p>



<p>If you look back at flu pandemics, for example, there has been a transition period: The first year or two with a very heavy toll, but then beyond that, [transmission] typically stays higher for a few years. I think at this point, we’re in a stage where most countries — not every single country but in most — a majority of the population has some level of immunity. What the transition period looks like for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, really depends on the severity of infections and how many exposures do we need to get down to whatever an endemic level is. Certainly, one exposure seems to have really reduced severity, but maybe that didn’t get it down to the endemic level where you’ve grown up being exposed to this virus your entire life. The length of that transition period and how painful it is, is really going to depend on the severity of reinfections that occur over time.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What will the endemic phase of the pandemic look like?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Endemic is a period where the virus has hit a “normal level.” You’ve got a high level of population immunity, and [the virus] still causes some specific level of severe disease. We don’t know what that looks like yet. We don’t know if, in the endemic phase, the severity of this virus is going to look like a seasonal coronavirus [that causes a cold] or if it’s going to look more like the severity of influenza [which can kill tens of thousands of people on average per year in the United States] or more severe than influenza. We actually need to get to where it’s at an endemic level before we know all of that.</p>



<p>And the other thing is the rates of infection. We know for seasonal coronaviruses that people get reinfected really often — on average probably about every three years but it can happen as soon as six months after, even in people who’ve been exposed to it throughout their entire lives. At the beginning of the pandemic, the entire population was naïve to this new coronavirus. We’ve been building immunity over time, so transmission stays quite high. That’s going to slow down as people build up immunity, but we’ll see. We may have a need for annual boosters or regular boosters. We might be able to come up with a more broadly protective vaccine that lasts for longer — that would be fantastic.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Do you feel more optimistic or pessimistic than last year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>Honestly, I’m about the same. The only thing that made me a bit pessimistic … was in studies we’ve done in Nicaragua. We got a big wave in 2020, about 60 percent of the population in that study got infected. Then we went forward and had another large wave in 2021, probably of gamma and delta. One thing that made me a little more pessimistic about the situation was that the<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.23.21266767v1"> severity of repeat infections was higher</a> than I expected it to be … but I always thought that people needed at least two exposures [to the virus] before we get anywhere near an endemic level. Maybe even more than two, we don’t really know. We’ve got omicron in Nicaragua now, so we have a large population that has had two or three exposures already because a bunch of them are vaccinated now, too. We’ll see what happens during this omicron wave.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: We all really want this to be over. How will we know?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gordon: </strong>I think people are confused about when a pandemic ends. As I said, it’s a transition period. Instead of thinking of it as a dimmer switch — at the top is pandemic and then you slide down to the bottom which is endemic — people want it to be an off-on switch. Like “oh it’s a pandemic, and now it’s over. We’re in an endemic phase.” But unfortunately, we’re not there yet. We are going to slowly slide toward an endemic phase.</p>

Thus, the elimination of these compounds is an important process. The authors of this study tested tow polymer membranes as an extractive membrane to not only remove, but also recover paracetamol from aquatic solution. They conclude that their process is a clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly method to remove the compound from aquatic environments and recover this high-value substance.</p>

This study investigates how chronotypes, intra-organismal differences in these daily rhythms, are linked to age and cast-associated behavior. Brood-tending nurse ants show a constant activity, whereas forager ants show daily rhythms in activity. These tasks can shift depending on the absence of a brood or other requirements. Investigations into how daily gene expression differences could underlie behavioral plasticity were conducted using time-course behavioral assays and RNA-sequencing of carpenter ants. This study showed that such chronobiological plasticity has evolved to allow for distinct regulatory networks for distinct behavioral roles, while allowing transitions in response to colony demands.</p>

Antimalarial drugs are frequently administered at Ebola Treatment Units and there is some evidence that these are beneficial for patients. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the association between antimalarial treatment and reduced mortality in patients where Ebola virus disease has been confirmed during the 2014-16 Malaria epidemic in West Africa. The study could demonstrate that early oral administration of antimalarial treatment could reduce the mortality of Ebola virus patients significantly.</p>

Furthermore, exercise is widely promoted by medical professionals to aid both physical and emotional well-being. However, the exact mechanisms on how this works are less well understood. This literature review focuses on the positive relationship between exercise and immune activation. Cytokines have been identified to play a crucial role and their activation through exercise could regulate musculoskeletal health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/24/people-in-on-again-off-again-relationships-experience-more-psychological-distress/">People in on-again, off-again relationships experience more psychological distress</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Some romantic relationships slot into place easily: we meet, we get together, and we stay together, at least for a while. Others are far more tumultuous, as we break up and get back together over and over again — often to the frustration and annoyance of those we confide in.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that such relationships can cause us distress, and this is the subject of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/fare.12614">new study</a>, published in <em>Family Relations.</em> It looks at the impact of on-off relationships, finding not only short-term harm but longer-term implications too.</p>



<span id="more-45467"></span>



<p>The team gathered data from 545 participants of various sexualities over the course of 15 months, all of whom were in romantic relationships. In the first wave of the study, participants indicated whether or not they had broken up and got back together with their current partner — and, if so, how many times. At all four waves, participants also reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, and at one or more points completed measures of physical violence within the relationship, how satisfied they were in their relationship, and the extent to which they experienced feelings of uncertainty within the relationship.</p>



<p>Breaking up and getting back together was fairly common: 33.6% of participants reported having done so in their current relationship. Those who experienced more frequent break-ups and reconciliations reported more psychological distress at the start of the study — and a greater <em>increase</em> in distress across the different waves. This remained the case when controlling for other measures such as violence and uncertainty, suggesting a direct link between relationship “cycling” and distress.      </p>



<p>So, not only does relationship cycling seem to be distressing in the short-term, it may also have a longer-term impact. The team suggests that feelings of chaos or turbulence lead to these distressing feelings, increasing a sense of instability that can trigger poor mental health. However, it’s important to note questions of cause and effect: those who felt distressed or chaotic might be re-entering relationships in order to make themselves feel better rather than being distressed by the cycling itself. How mental health or distress affects our decisions in relationships, in other words, is also worth looking at.</p>



<p>There is also evidence that serious issues at the start of relationships can endure, “foreshadowing” later outcomes in the relationship: one study found that premarital relationship cycling could impact on people’s confidence in their choice to get married and on satisfaction within that marriage, as well as making trial separation more likely. Future research could explore the links between relationship cycling and the ultimate outcomes of relationships.</p>



<p>The findings don’t mean that on-again off-again relationships never work out: as lead author Kale Monk <a href="https://education.missouri.edu/2022/01/on-again-off-again-relationships-can-have-a-long-lasting-negative-impact-on-couples-mental-health-mu-research-finds/">puts it</a>: “In some of our <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0265407519883701">other studies</a>, we certainly do hear from partners who report that time apart made them realize how much they valued each other and they were rededicated to making it work.” However, thinking carefully about the links between your mental health and your dating patterns may be a worthwhile part of your wellbeing in relationships.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/computer-science-history-ethics-future-robots-ai">Now that computers connect us all, for better and worse, what’s next?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">This article was written, edited and designed on laptop computers. Such foldable, transportable devices would have astounded computer scientists just a few decades ago, and seemed like sheer magic before that. The machines contain billions of tiny computing elements, running millions of lines of software instructions, collectively written by countless people across the globe. You click or tap or type or speak, and the result seamlessly appears on the screen.</p>



<p>Computers were once so large they filled rooms. Now they’re everywhere and invisible, embedded in watches, car engines, cameras, televisions and toys. They manage electrical grids, analyze scientific data and predict the weather. The modern world would be impossible without them.</p>



<p>Scientists aim to make computers faster and programs more intelligent, while deploying technology in an ethical manner. Their efforts build on more than a century of innovation.</p>



<p>In 1833, English mathematician Charles Babbage conceived a programmable machine that presaged today’s computing architecture, featuring a “store” for holding numbers, a “mill” for operating on them, an instruction reader and a printer. This Analytical Engine also had logical functions like branching (if X, then Y). Babbage constructed only a piece of the machine, but based on its description, his acquaintance Ada Lovelace saw that the numbers it might manipulate could represent anything, even music. “A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis,” she wrote. Lovelace became an expert in the proposed machine’s operation and is often called the first programmer.</p>

<p>In 1936, English mathematician Alan Turing introduced the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mind-math">idea of a computer that could rewrite its own instructions</a>, making it endlessly programmable. His mathematical abstraction could, using a small vocabulary of operations, mimic a machine of any complexity, earning it the name “universal Turing machine.”</p>



<p>The first reliable electronic digital computer, Colossus, was completed in 1943 to help England decipher wartime codes. It used vacuum tubes — devices for controlling the flow of electrons — instead of moving mechanical parts like the Analytical Engine’s cogwheels. This made Colossus fast, but engineers had to manually rewire it every time they wanted to perform a new task.</p>



<p>Perhaps inspired by Turing’s concept of a more easily reprogrammable computer, the team that created the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/adds-15000-second">United States’ first electronic digital computer</a>, ENIAC, drafted a new architecture for its successor, EDVAC. Mathematician John von Neumann, who penned EDVAC’s design in 1945, described a system that could store programs in its memory alongside data and alter the programs, a setup now called the von Neumann architecture. Nearly every computer today follows that paradigm.</p>



<p>In 1947, researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/vacuum-tube-has-rival">invented the transistor</a>, a piece of circuitry in which the application of voltage (electrical pressure) or current controls the flow of electrons between two points. It came to replace the slower and less-efficient vacuum tubes.</p>



<p>In 1958 and 1959, researchers at Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor independently invented integrated circuits, in which transistors and their supporting circuitry were fabricated on a chip in one process.</p>



<p>For a long time, only experts could program computers. Then in 1957, IBM released FORTRAN, a programming language that was much easier to understand. It’s still in use today. In 1981, the company unveiled the IBM PC, and Microsoft released its operating system called MS-DOS, together expanding the reach of computers into homes and offices. Apple further personalized computing with the operating systems for their Lisa, in 1982, and Macintosh, in 1984. Both systems popularized graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, offering users a mouse cursor instead of a command line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, researchers had been working to transform how people communicate with each other. In 1948, U.S. mathematician Claude Shannon published “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6773024">A Mathematical Theory of Communication</a>,” which popularized the word <em>bit</em> (for binary digit) <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/claude-shannon-information-theory-digital-era">and laid the foundation for information theory</a>. His ideas have shaped computation and in particular the sharing of data over wires and through the air. In 1969, the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency created a computer network called ARPANET, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/highways-information">later merged with other networks</a> to form the internet. And in 1990, researchers at CERN — a European laboratory near Geneva — developed rules for transmitting data that would become the foundation of the World Wide Web.</p>



<p>These technological advances have made it possible for people to work, play and connect in ways that continue to change at a dizzying pace. But how much better can the processors get? How smart can algorithms become? And what kinds of benefits and dangers should we expect to see as technology advances? Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who coauthored a popular textbook on artificial intelligence, sees great potential for computers in “expanding artistic creativity, accelerating science, serving as diligent personal assistants, driving cars and — I hope — not killing us.”</p>



<h4>Chasing speed</h4>



<p>Computers, for the most part, speak the language of bits. They store information — whether it’s music, an application or a password — in strings of 1s and 0s. They also process information in a binary fashion, flipping transistors between an “on” and “off” state. The more transistors in a computer, the faster it can process bits, making possible everything from more realistic video games to safer air traffic control.</p>



<p>Combining transistors forms one of the building blocks of a circuit, called a logic gate. An AND logic gate, for example, is on if both inputs are on, while an OR is on if at least one input is on. Together, logic gates compose a complex traffic pattern of electrons, the physical manifestation of computation. A computer chip can contain millions of logic gates.</p>



<p>So the more logic gates, and by extension the more transistors, the more powerful the computer. In 1965, Gordon Moore, a cofounder of Fairchild Semiconductor and later of Intel, wrote a <a href="http://www.computer-architecture.org/textual/Moore-Cramming-More-Components-1965.pdf">paper on the future of chips</a> titled “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits.” From 1959 to 1965, he noted, the number of components (mostly transistors) crammed onto integrated circuits (chips) had doubled every year. He expected the trend to continue.</p>



<p>In a 1975 talk, Moore identified three factors behind this exponential growth: smaller transistors, bigger chips and “device and circuit cleverness,” such as less wasted space. He expected the doubling to occur every two years. It did, and continued doing so for decades. That trend is now called Moore’s law.</p>



<p>Moore’s law was meant as an observation about economics. There will always be incentives to make computers faster and cheaper — but at some point, physics interferes. Chip development can’t keep up with Moore’s law forever, as it becomes more difficult to make transistors tinier. According to what’s jokingly called Moore’s second law, the cost of chip fabrication plants doubles every few years. The semiconductor company TSMC is reportedly considering building a plant that will cost $25 billion.</p>



<p>Today, Moore’s law no longer holds; doubling is happening at a slower rate. We continue to squeeze more transistors onto chips with each generation, but the generations come less frequently. Researchers are looking into several ways forward: better transistors, more specialized chips, new chip concepts and software hacks.</p>



<p>“We’ve squeezed, we believe, everything you can squeeze” out of the current transistor architecture, called FinFET, says Sanjay Natarajan, who leads transistor design at Intel. In the next few years, chip manufacturers will start producing transistors in which a key element resembles a ribbon instead of a fin, making devices faster and requiring less energy and space.</p>



<p>Even if Natarajan is right and transistors are nearing their minimum size limit, computers still have a lot of runway to improve, through Moore’s “device and circuit cleverness.” Today’s electronic devices contain many kinds of accelerators — chips designed for special purposes such as AI, graphics or communication — that can execute intended tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose processing units.</p>

<h3>The slowdown&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Until about 2004, the shrinking of transistors came with improvements in computer performance (black below shows an industry benchmark) and clock frequency — the number of cycles of operations performed per second (green). As this “Dennard scaling” no longer held, shrinking transistors stopped yielding the same benefits.</p>

<p>Some types of accelerators might one day use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computing</a>, which capitalizes on two features of the subatomic realm (<em>SN: 7/8/17 &amp; 7/22/17, p. 28</em>). The first is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quantum-bits">superposition</a>, in which particles can exist not just in one state or another, but in some combination of states until the state is explicitly measured. So a quantum system represents information not as bits <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quarter-century-ago-qubit-was-born">but as qubits</a>, which can preserve the possibility of being either 0 or 1 when measured. The second is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/everyday-entanglement">entanglement</a>, the interdependence between distant quantum elements. Together, these features mean that a system of qubits can represent and evaluate exponentially more possibilities than there are qubits — all combinations of 1s and 0s simultaneously.</p>



<p>Qubits can take many forms, but one of the most popular is as current in superconducting wires. These wires must be kept at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, around –273° Celsius, to prevent hot, jiggling atoms from interfering with the qubits’ delicate superpositions and entanglement. Quantum computers also need many physical qubits to make up one “logical,” or effective, qubit, with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">redundancy acting as error correction</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Quantum computers have several potential applications: machine learning, optimization of things like train scheduling and simulating real-world quantum mechanics, as in chemistry. But they will not likely become general-purpose computers. It’s not clear how you’d use one to, say, run a word processor.</p>



<h4>New chip concepts</h4>



<p>There remain new ways to dramatically speed up not just specialized accelerators but also general-purpose chips. Tom Conte, a computer scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta who leads the IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative, points to two paradigms. The first is superconduction, in which chips run at a temperature low enough to eliminate electrical resistance.</p>



<p>The second paradigm is reversible computing, in which bits are reused instead of expelled as heat. In 1961, IBM <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/quantum-interpretations-feel-heat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physicist Rolf Landauer merged information theory and thermodynamics</a>, the physics of heat. He noted that when a logic gate takes in two bits and outputs one, it destroys a bit, expelling it as entropy, or randomness, in the form of heat. When billions of transistors operate at billions of cycles per second, the wasted heat adds up, and the machine needs more electricity for computing and cooling. Michael Frank, a computer scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque who works on reversible computing, wrote in 2017: “A conventional computer is, essentially, an expensive electric heater that happens to perform a small amount of computation as a side effect.”</p>



<p>But in reversible computing, logic gates have as many outputs as inputs. This means that if you ran the logic gate in reverse, you could use, say, three out-bits to obtain the three in-bits. Some researchers have conceived of reversible logic gates and circuits that could not only save those extra out-bits but also recycle them for other calculations. Physicist Richard Feynman had concluded that, aside from energy loss during data transmission, there’s no theoretical limit to computing efficiency.</p>



<p>Combine reversible and superconducting computing, Conte says, and “you get a double whammy.” Efficient computing allows you to run more operations on the same chip without worrying about power use or heat generation. Conte says that, eventually, one or both of these methods “probably will be the backbone of a lot of computing.”</p>





<h4>Software hacks</h4>



<p>Researchers continue to work on a cornucopia of new technologies for transistors, other computing elements, chip designs and hardware paradigms: photonics, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetic-logic-electron-spins-could-do-cool-calculations">spintronics</a>, biomolecules, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chip-carbon-nanotubes-not-silicon-marks-computing-milestone">carbon nanotubes</a>. But much more can still be eked out of current elements and architectures merely by optimizing code.</p>



<p>In a 2020 paper in <em>Science</em>, for instance, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/eaam9744.full">researchers studied the simple problem of multiplying two matrices</a>, grids of numbers used in mathematics and machine learning. The calculation ran more than 60,000 times faster when the team picked an efficient programming language and optimized the code for the underlying hardware, compared with a standard piece of code in the Python language, which is considered user-friendly and easy to learn.</p>



<p>Neil Thompson, a research scientist at MIT who coauthored the paper in <em>Science</em>, recently coauthored a paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9540991">looking at historical improvements in algorithm</a>s, sets of instructions that make decisions according to rules set by humans, for tasks like sorting data. “For a substantial minority of algorithms,” he says, “their progress has been as fast or faster than Moore’s law.”</p>



<p>People, including Moore, have predicted the end of Moore’s law for decades. Progress may have slowed, but human innovation has kept technology moving at a fast clip.</p>



<h4>Chasing intelligence&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>From the early days of computer science, researchers have aimed to replicate human thought. Alan Turing opened a 1950 paper titled “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>” with: “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ ” He proceeded to outline a test, which he called “the imitation game” (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mind-math">now called the Turing test</a>), in which a human communicating with a computer and another human via written questions had to judge which was which. If the judge failed, the computer could presumably think.</p>



<p>The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in a 1955 proposal for a summer institute at Dartmouth College. “An attempt will be made,” the proposal goes, “to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.” The organizers expected that over two months, the 10 summit attendees would make a “significant advance.”</p>



<p>More than six decades and untold person-hours later, it’s unclear whether the advances live up to what was in mind at that summer summit. Artificial intelligence surrounds us in ways invisible (filtering spam), headline-worthy (self-driving cars, beating us at chess) and in between (letting us chat with our smartphones). But these are all narrow forms of AI, performing one or two tasks well. What Turing and others had in mind is called artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Depending on your definition, it’s a system that can do most of what humans do.</p>

<p>We may never achieve AGI, but the path has led, and will lead, to lots of useful innovations along the way. “I think we’ve made a lot of progress,” says Doina Precup, a computer scientist at McGill University in Montreal and head of the AI company DeepMind’s Montreal research team. “But one of the things that, to me, is still missing right now is more of an understanding of the principles that are fundamental in intelligence.”</p>



<p>AI has made great headway in the last decade, much of it due to machine learning. Previously, computers relied more heavily on symbolic AI, which uses algorithms based on human-set rules. Machine-learning programs, on the other hand, process data to find patterns on their own. One form uses artificial neural networks, software with layers of simple computing elements that together mimic certain principles of biological brains. Neural networks with several, or many more, layers are currently popular and make up a type of machine learning called deep learning.</p>



<p>Deep-learning systems can now play games like chess and Go better than the best human. They can probably identify dog breeds from photos better than you can. They can translate text from one language to another. They can control robots and <a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/artificial-intelligence-musical-creativity/">compose music</a> and predict how proteins will fold.</p>



<p>But they also lack much of what falls under the umbrella term of common sense. They don’t understand fundamental things about how the world works, physically or socially. Slightly changing images in a way that you or I might not notice, for example, can dramatically affect what a computer sees. Researchers found that placing a few innocuous <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/turtle-or-rifle-hackers-easily-fool-ais-seeing-wrong-thing">stickers on a stop sign</a> can lead software to interpret the sign as a speed limit sign, an obvious <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/when-it-comes-self-driving-cars-whats-safe-enough">problem for self-driving cars</a>.</p>

<h4>Types of learning</h4>



<p>How can AI improve? Computer scientists are leveraging multiple forms of machine learning, whether the learning is “deep” or not. One common form is called supervised learning, in which machine-learning systems, or models, are trained by being fed labeled data such as images of dogs and their breed names. But that requires lots of human effort to label them. Another approach is unsupervised or self-supervised learning, in which computers learn without relying on outside labels, the way you or I predict what a chair will look like from different angles as we walk around it.</p>



<p>Another type of machine learning is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ai-learns-playing-video-games-starcraft-minecraft">reinforcement learning</a>, in which a model interacts with an environment, exploring sequences of actions to achieve a goal. Reinforcement learning has allowed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphago-artificial-intelligence-top-science-stories-2016">AI to become an expert at board games like Go</a> and video games like <em>StarCraft II</em>.</p>



<p>To learn efficiently, machines (and people) need to generalize, to draw abstract principles from experiences. “A huge part of intelligence,” says Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, “is being able to take one’s knowledge and apply it in different situations.” Much of her work involves analogies, in rudimentary form: finding similarities between strings of letters. In 2019, AI researcher François Chollet of Google created a kind of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-do-you-test-the-iq-of-ai">IQ test for machines</a> called the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, or ARC, in which computers must complete visual patterns according to principles demonstrated in example patterns. The puzzles are easy for humans, but so far, challenging for machines.</p>



<p>Much of our abstract thought, ironically, may be grounded in our physical experiences. We use conceptual metaphors like important = big, and argument = opposing forces. To realize AGI that can do most of what humans can do may require embodiment, such as operating with a physical robot. Researchers have <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2020/teaching-robots-to-talk">combined language learning and robotics</a> by creating virtual worlds where virtual robots simultaneously learn to follow instructions and to navigate within a house.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is a trained language model released in 2020 by the research lab Open AI that has shown that disembodied language may not be enough. With prompts, it can write humanlike news articles, short stories and poems. But in <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">one demo, it wrote:</a> “It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.”</p>



<p>“I’ve played around a lot with it,” Mitchell says. “It does incredible things. But it can also make some incredibly dumb mistakes.”</p>



<p>AGI might also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/will-to-survive-might-take-artificial-intelligence-next-level">require other aspects of our animal nature, like emotions</a>, especially if humans expect to interact with machines in natural ways<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201501/beyond-happiness-the-upside-feeling-down">. Emotions are not mere irrational reactions</a>. We’ve evolved them to guide our drives and behaviors. According to Ilya Sutskever, a cofounder and the chief scientist at OpenAI, they “give us this extra oomph of wisdom.” Even if AI doesn’t have the same conscious feelings we do, it may have <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-teach-computers-fear-make-them-better-drivers">code that approximates fear</a> or anger. Already, reinforcement learning includes an<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/scientists-imbue-robots-curiosity"> exploratory element akin to curiosity</a>.</p>

<p>Humans aren’t blank slates. We’re born with certain predispositions to recognize faces, learn language and play with objects. Machine-learning systems also require the right kind of innate structure to learn certain things quickly. How much structure, and what kind, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-researchers-are-teaching-ai-learn-child">is a matter of intense debate</a>. Sutskever says building in how we think we think is “intellectually seductive.” However, “we want the best blank slate.”</p>



<p>One general neural-network structure Sutskever likes is called the transformer, a method for paying greater attention to important relationships between elements of an input. It’s behind current language models like GPT-3, and has also been applied to analyzing images, audio and video. “It makes everything better,” he says.</p>



<h4>Thinking about thinking</h4>



<p>AI itself may help us discover new forms of AI. There’s a set of techniques called AutoML, in which algorithms help optimize neural-network architectures or other aspects of AI models. AI also helps chip architects design better integrated circuits. Last year, Google researchers reported in <em>Nature</em> that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w">reinforcement learning performed better than their in-house team</a> at laying out some aspects of an accelerator chip they’d designed.</p>



<p>AGI’s arrival may be decades away. “We don’t understand our own intelligence,” Mitchell says, as much of it is unconscious. “And therefore, we don’t know what’s going to be hard or easy for AI.” What seems hard can be easy and vice versa — a phenomenon known as Moravec’s paradox, after the roboticist Hans Moravec. In 1988, Moravec wrote, “it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance in solving problems on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a 1-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.” Babies are secretly brilliant. In aiming for AGI, Precup says, “we are also understanding more about human intelligence, and about intelligence in general.”</p>



<p>Turing differentiated between general intelligence and humanlike intelligence. In his 1950 paper on the imitation game, he wrote, “May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?” His point: You don’t need to think like a person to have genuine smarts.</p>



<h4>Grappling with ethics</h4>



<p>In the 1942 short story “Runaround,” one of Isaac Asimov’s characters enumerated “the three fundamental Rules of Robotics.” Robots avoided causing or allowing harm to humans, they obeyed orders and they protected themselves, as long as following one rule didn’t conflict with preceding decrees.</p>



<p>We might picture Asimov’s “positronic brains” making autonomous decisions about harm to humans, but that’s not actually how computers affect our well-being every day. Instead of humanoid robots killing people, we have algorithms curating news feeds. As computers further infiltrate our lives, we’ll need to think harder about what kinds of systems to build and how to deploy them, as well as meta-problems like how to decide — and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/who-should-stop-unethical-ai">who should decide</a> — these things.</p>



<p>This is the realm of ethics, which may seem distant from the supposed objectivity of math, science and engineering. But deciding what questions to ask about the world and what tools to build has always depended on our ideals and scruples. Studying an abstruse topic like the innards of atoms, for instance, has clear bearing on both energy and weaponry. “There’s the fundamental fact that computer systems are not value neutral,” says computer scientist Barbara Grosz of Harvard University, “that when you design them, you bring some set of values into that design.”</p>



<p>One topic that has received a lot of attention from scientists and ethicists is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machines-are-getting-schooled-fairness">fairness and bias</a>. Algorithms increasingly inform or even dictate decisions about hiring, college admissions, loans and parole. Even if they discriminate less than people do, they can still treat certain groups unfairly, not by design but often because they are trained on biased data. They might predict a person’s future criminal behavior based on prior arrests, for instance, even though different groups are arrested at different rates for a given amount of crime.</p>



<p>And confusingly, there are multiple definitions of fairness, such as equal false-positive rates between groups or equal false-negative rates between groups. A researcher at one conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqamrPkF5kk">listed 21 definitions</a>. And the definitions often conflict. In one paper, researchers showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807">in most cases it’s mathematically impossible to satisfy three common definitions simultaneously</a>.</p>



<p>Another concern is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smartphones-data-collection-security-privacy">privacy and surveillance</a>, given that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/even-bugs-will-be-bugged/501113/">computers can now gather and sort information on their use in a way previously unimaginable</a>. Data on our online behavior can help predict aspects of our private lives, like sexuality. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201801/all-over-your-face">Facial recognition</a> can also follow us around the real world, helping police or authoritarian governments. And the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-brain-activity-read-change-thoughts-privacy-ethics">emerging field of neurotechnology</a> is already testing ways to connect the brain directly to computers (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 24</em>). Related to privacy is security — hackers can access data that’s locked away, or interfere with pacemakers and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>Computers can also enable deception. AI can generate content that looks real. Language models might be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy">fill the internet with fake news</a> and recruiting material for extremist groups (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 22</em>). Generative adversarial networks, a type of deep learning that can generate realistic content, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-program-generates-eerily-realistic-fake-videos">can assist artists or create deepfakes</a>, images or videos showing people doing things they never did (<em>SN: 9/15/18, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>On social media, we also need to worry about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/popularity-twitter-partisanship-pays">polarization in people’s social, political and other views</a>. Generally, recommendation algorithms optimize engagement (and platforms profit through advertising), not civil discourse. <a href="https://neo.life/2021/07/artificial-intelligence-is-learning-to-manipulate-you/">Algorithms can also manipulate us</a> in other ways. Robo-advisers — <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351703682_We_Need_to_Code_for_Ethics">chatbots for dispensing financial advice or providing customer support</a> — might learn to know what we really need, or to push our buttons and upsell us on extraneous products.</p>



<p>Multiple countries are developing autonomous weapons that have the potential to reduce civilian casualties as well as escalate conflict faster than their minders can react. Putting guns or missiles in the hands of robots raises the sci-fi specter of Terminators attempting to eliminate humankind. They might not even be acting with bad intent, falsely reasoning that they are helping humankind by eliminating human cancer (an example of having no common sense). More near-term, automated systems let loose in the real world have already caused flash crashes in the stock market and sudden <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/04/amazon-flies-24-million/">big leaps in book prices on Amazon</a>. If AIs are charged with making life-and-death decisions, they then face the famous trolley problem, deciding whom or what to sacrifice when not everyone can win. Here we’re entering Asimov territory.</p>



<p>That’s a lot to worry about. Russell, of UC Berkeley, suggests where our priorities should lie: “Lethal autonomous weapons are an urgent issue, because people may have already died, and the way things are going, it’s only a matter of time before there’s a mass attack,” he says. “Bias and social media addiction and polarization are both arguably instances of failure of value alignment between algorithms and society, so they are giving us early warnings of how things can easily go wrong.”</p>



<p>There are also social, political and legal questions about how to manage technology in society. Who should be held accountable when an AI system causes harm? (For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/first-pedestrian-death-self-driving-car-fuels-safety-debate">“confused” self-driving cars have killed people</a>.) How can we ensure more equal access to the tools of AI and their benefits, and make sure they don’t discriminate against groups or individuals? How will continuing automation of jobs affect employment? Can we manage the environmental impact of data centers, which use a lot of electricity? Should we preferentially employ explainable algorithms — rather than the black boxes of many neural networks — for greater trust and debuggability, even if it makes the algorithms poorer at prediction?</p>



<h4>What can be done</h4>



<p>Michael Kearns, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and coauthor of the 2019 book <em>The Ethical Algorithm</em>, puts the problems on a spectrum of manageability. At one end is what’s called differential privacy, the ability to add noise to a dataset of, say, medical records so that it can be shared usefully with researchers without revealing much about the individual records. We can now make mathematical guarantees about exactly how private individuals’ data should remain.</p>



<p>Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum is fairness in machine learning. Researchers have developed methods to increase fairness by removing or altering biased training data, or maximize certain types of equality — in loans, for instance — while minimizing reduction in profit. Still, some types of fairness will forever be in mutual conflict, and math can’t tell us which ones we want.</p>



<p>At the far end is explainability. As opposed to fairness, which can be analyzed mathematically in many ways, the quality of an explanation is hard to describe in mathematical terms. “I feel like I haven’t seen a single good definition yet,” Kearns says. “You could say, ‘Here’s an algorithm that will take a trained neural network and try to explain why it rejected you for a loan,’ but [the explanation] doesn’t feel principled.” Ultimately, if the audience doesn’t understand it, it’s not a good explanation, and measuring its success — however you define success — requires user studies.</p>



<p>Something like Asimov’s three laws won’t save us from robots that hurt us while trying to help us. And even if the list were extended to a million laws, the letter of a law is not identical to its spirit. One possible solution is what’s called inverse reinforcement learning, in which computers might learn to decipher what we really value based on our behavior.</p>

<h4>Engineer, heal thyself</h4>



<p>In the 1950 short story “The Evitable Conflict,” Asimov articulated what became a “zeroth law,” a law to supersede all others: “A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.” It should go without saying that the rule should apply with “roboticist” in place of “robot.” For sure, many computer scientists avoid harming humanity, but many also don’t actively engage with the social implications of their work, effectively allowing humanity to come to harm, says Margaret Mitchell, a computer scientist who co-led Google’s Ethical AI team and now consults with organizations on tech ethics. (She’s no relation to computer scientist Melanie Mitchell.)</p>



<p>One hurdle, according to Grosz, of Harvard, is that too many researchers are not properly trained in ethics. But she hopes to change that. Grosz and philosopher Alison Simmons began a program at Harvard called Embedded EthiCS, in which teaching assistants with training in philosophy are embedded in computer science courses and teach lessons on privacy or discrimination or fake news. The program has spread to MIT, Stanford and the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>“We try to get students to think about values and value trade-offs,” Grosz says. Two things have struck her. The first is the difficulty students have with problems that lack right answers and require arguing for particular choices. The second is, despite their frustration, “how much students care about this set of issues,” Grosz says.</p>



<p>Another way to educate technologists about their influence is to widen collaborations. According to Mitchell, “computer science needs to move from holding math up as the be-all and end-all, to holding up both math and social science, and psychology as well.” Researchers should bring in experts in these topics, she says.</p>



<p>Going the other way, Kearns says, they should also share their own technical expertise with regulators, lawyers and policy makers. Otherwise, policies will be so vague as to be useless. Without specific definitions of privacy or fairness written into law, companies can choose whatever’s most convenient or profitable.</p>



<p>When evaluating how a tool will affect a community, the best experts are often community members themselves. Grosz advocates consulting with diverse populations. Diversity helps in both user studies and technology teams. “If you don’t have people in the room who think differently from you,” Grosz says, “the differences are just not in front of you. If somebody says not every patient has a smartphone, boom, you start thinking differently about what you’re designing.”</p>



<p>According to Margaret Mitchell, “the most pressing problem is the diversity and inclusion of who’s at the table from the start. All the other issues fall out from there.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-oldest-human-dna-mating-long-distance-stone-age">Africa’s oldest human DNA helps unveil an ancient population shift</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient Africans in search of mates traded long-distance travels for regional connections starting about 20,000 years ago, an analysis of ancient and modern DNA suggests.</p>



<p>That shift occurred after treks across much of Africa to find breeding partners had been the norm starting at least 50,000 years ago, the same analysis shows. These new findings — helped by several examples of the oldest human DNA from Africa isolated to date — offer the first genetic support for a previously suspected change in mating patterns around that time.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04430-9">newly identified, long-distance movements of ancient human groups</a> help explain archaeological discoveries of common types of stone and bone toolmaking and other cultural behaviors that increasingly appeared across much of Africa beginning about 50,000 years ago, evolutionary geneticist Mark Lipson of Harvard Medical School and colleagues report February 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Starting around that time, inherited sets of gene variants became increasingly similar in ancient individuals found in central, eastern and southern regions of sub-Saharan Africa, the researchers report. This suggests that this area was a genetic melting pot, in which hunter-gatherers migrated between the three regions, mating with each other along the way.</p>



<p>Comparisons of ancient human DNA to that of present-day hunter-gatherers and herders in the same three parts of Africa indicate that people generally stopped traveling outside their home regions to find mating partners about 20,000 years ago, the team says. People may have stayed closer to home at least partly because the last ice age peaked around that time, reducing the number of areas harboring enough edible plants, animals and other resources needed to survive, says Yale University bioarchaeologist and study coauthor Jessica Thompson.</p>



<p>“As the African tropics came out of the last ice age, the landscape became full of many small groups of people with diverse local cultural traditions,” Thompson says. Culturally distinct groups tended to seek mates from neighboring groups with whom they had more in common than migrants from distant regions, she suspects.</p>



<p>African hunter-gatherers today still follow local cultural practices, speak in regionally distinct tongues and draw mates from nearby groups. Migrations of West African farmers to eastern and southern Africa starting about 2,000 years ago have largely erased ancient ancestry patterns in the DNA of present-day Africans. That makes ancient DNA crucial for unveiling those lost patterns.</p>



<p>In the new study, scientists extracted ancient DNA from the bones of six individuals previously excavated in eastern and south-central Africa. Estimates of when these people lived range from about 18,000 to 5,000 years ago. These new genetic data were studied along with already published DNA evidence for 28 African hunter-gatherers dating to as early as about 8,000 years ago. The researchers were able to retrieve additional DNA for 15 of those individuals.</p>



<p>A big boost to the new investigation came from the inclusion of several examples of the oldest known human DNA from Africa. Even older examples of DNA from <em>Homo sapiens</em> and closely related populations, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-reveals-who-spains-pit-bones-cave">Neandertals from around 430,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/14/16</em>), have been found in Europe and Asia where cold conditions preserve genetic material better than the African tropics do. Only <em>H. sapiens</em> is known to have inhabited Africa during the Stone Age stretch covered in the new study.</p>



<p>Calculations of the genetic variation in three present-day African groups — San hunter-gatherers from southern Africa, Mbuti hunter-gatherers from central Africa and Dinka herders and farmers from northeastern Africa — were used to estimate ancestry patterns reflected in each sample of ancient DNA.</p>



<p>Lipson and colleagues’ findings fit with previous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-kids-dna-reveals-new-insights-how-africa-was-populated">ancient and modern African DNA studies suggesting that mating among widespread human groups began 200,000 years ago or more</a> (<em>SN: 1/22/20</em>), says evolutionary geneticist Carina Schlebusch of the University of Uppsala in Sweden, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Hints of a “ghost” human population unknown from any fossils, but which contributed to the ancestry of ancient eastern Africans, also emerged in the new study, Thompson says. Many more ancient <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-west-africans-may-have-dna-genes-ancient-ghost-hominid">ghost groups once existed in different parts of Africa</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/20</em>), she suspects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killer-asteroid-chicxulub-spring-impact-fossils-fish">The Age of Dinosaurs may have ended in springtime</a></h4>

              
                <p>About 66 million years ago, a 10-kilometer-wide asteroid slammed into Earth and not long afterward, all nonbird dinosaurs, as well as many other species on land and in the sea, perished. Scientists don’t know the exact year of the strike, but researchers now say they have determined the impact’s season — springtime in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>The finding comes from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04446-1">a new analysis of the bones of ancient fish</a> entombed at an extraordinary site dubbed Tanis in southwestern North Dakota, the researchers report February 23 in <em>Nature.</em></p>



<p>Pinning down the season of the impact may help researchers explain the global pattern of survival of birds, small mammals and other creatures following the strike. For example, creatures that spend the winters in burrows underground would have emerged and been active during a Northern Hemisphere spring, rendering them especially vulnerable. By contrast, in a Southern Hemisphere autumn, these creatures probably would have been settling in for a season-long nap and perhaps were more protected.</p>





<p>Discovered in 2008, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossils-north-dakota-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact">sediments at Tanis</a> purportedly capture the flooding of a riverbed and other destruction that happened there in the immediate aftermath of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">the Chicxulub impact</a>, which took place 3,000 kilometers away off the coast of what’s now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula (<em>SN: 4/2/19; SN: 1/25/17</em>). Previous work has also suggested that some of the fossilized Tanis fish have tiny spherules — solidified globs of molten and vaporized rock that had been flung skyward from the asteroid impact — stuck in their gills, a strong sign that the fish were still living and breathing as hell rained down on them.</p>



<p>“These creatures died incredibly close to the moment that debris was coming down,” says Thomas Holtz Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Some fish bones have features that can record seasonal and annual cycles of growth — akin to the growth rings in trees. These features typically include a thick band signifying vigorous bone growth, a thinner band that characterizes slow growth and a feature called a line of arrested growth that can denote wintertime or, sometimes, periods of famine or drought.</p>



<p>To figure out the season of the asteroid strike, Melanie During, a vertebrate paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, and colleagues examined the jawbones of three paddlefish and bony spines from the pectoral fins of three sturgeons. The outermost layers of all six analyzed bones indicate rapid growth that hadn’t yet reached peak growth rates seen during previous years’ growth cycles, During says. That means that the last growth season recorded in the bones hadn’t yet reached its summertime peak at the time these fish died.</p>

<p>The regularity of the lines of arrested growth chronicled in the fish bones strongly suggest that the fish weren’t suffering from drought or famine when they died, During says. “By all indications, these fish were doing fine.” Taking the results together, the team pinpoints spring as the season of the dinosaurs’ demise, as least for Northern Hemisphere dinos.</p>



<p>“I really do think this is a solid story backed by strong evidence,” says Stephen Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study. The asteroid impact “would have turned a season that is normally about growth and flowering and rebirth into a time of unbelievable fire and fury,” he notes.</p>



<p>Despite the passage of more than 66 million years, Holtz says, “it’s pretty amazing that we can look at Earth’s worst day and figure out the time of year it was.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-source-star-cluster-old-globular">A fast radio burst’s unlikely source may be a cluster of old stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a galaxy not so far away, astronomers have located a surprising source of a mysterious, rapid radio signal.</p>



<p>The signal, a repeating fast radio burst, or FRB, was observed over several months in 2021, allowing astronomers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04354-w">to pinpoint its location to a globular cluster</a> — a tight, spherical cluster of stars — in M81, a massive spiral galaxy 12 million light-years away. The findings, published February 23 in <em>Nature</em>, are challenging astronomers’ assumptions of what objects create FRBs.</p>



<p>“This is a very revolutionary discovery,” says Bing Zhang, an astronomer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who was not involved in the study. “It is exciting to see an FRB from a globular cluster. That is not the favorited place people imagined.”</p>





<p>Astronomers have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">puzzling over these mysterious cosmic radio signals</a>, which typically last less than a millisecond, since their discovery in 2007 (<em>SN: 7/25/14</em>). But in 2020, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">an FRB was seen in our own galaxy</a>, helping scientists determine one source must be magnetars — young, highly magnetized neutron stars with magnetic fields a trillion times as strong as Earth’s <em>(SN: 6/4/20).</em></p>



<p>The new findings come as a surprise because globular clusters harbor only old stars — some of the oldest in the universe. Magnetars, on the other hand, are young leftover dense cores typically created from the death of short-lived massive stars. The magnetized cores are thought to lose the energy needed to produce FRBs after about 10,000 years. Globular clusters, whose stars average many billions of years old, are much too elderly to have had a sufficiently recent young stellar death to create this type of magnetar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To pinpoint the FRB, astronomer Franz Kirsten and colleagues used a web of 11 radio telescopes spread across Europe and Asia to catch five bursts from the same source. Combining the radio observations, the astronomers were able to zero in on the signal’s origins, finding it was almost certainly from within a globular cluster.</p>



<p>“This is a very exciting discovery because it was completely unexpected,” says Kirsten, of ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, who is based at the Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden.</p>



<p>The new FRB might still be caused by a magnetar, the team proposes, but one that formed in a different way, such as from old stars common in globular clusters. For example, this magnetar could have been created from a remnant stellar core known as a white dwarf that had gathered too much material from a companion star, causing it to collapse.</p>



<p>“This is a [magnetar] formation channel that has been predicted, but it’s hard to see,” Kirsten says. “Nobody has actually seen such an event.”</p>



<p>Alternatively, the magnetar could have been formed from the merger of two stars — such as a pair of white dwarfs, a pair of neutron stars or one of each — in close orbit around one another, but this scenario is less likely, Kirsten says. It’s also possible the FRB source isn’t a magnetar at all but a very energetic millisecond&nbsp;pulsar, which is also a type of neutron star that could be found in a globular cluster, but one that has a weaker magnetic field.</p>



<p>To date, only a few FRB sources have been precisely pinpointed, and their locations are all in or close to star-forming regions in galaxies. Besides adding a new source for FRBs, the findings suggest that magnetars created from something other than the death of young stars might be more common than expected.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS issued the following press release on February 23, 2022</p>



<p><strong>(San Francisco) &ndash; </strong>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries (CSAL) today announced a three-year Open Access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS&rsquo; suite of journals<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> without incurring Article Processing Charges (APCs). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to grant funds.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are excited about our first deal of this kind with a gold OA publisher which allows the participating institutions to contain their costs without limiting the publishing opportunities for their researchers,&rdquo; said Susanne Aerni, Head Consortial Services, Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The University of Lausanne is delighted to partner with PLOS and participate in these innovative initiatives to advance Open Access in a fair, transparent and affordable way!&rdquo;&nbsp;said Micaela Crespo, Head of Open Access, University of Lausanne.<strong></strong></p>



<p>Participating institutions include, &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Universita della Svizzera italiana, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne with Haute &Eacute;cole P&eacute;dagogique du Canton de Vaud, University of Lucerne with University of Teacher Education Lucerne, Schwyz University of Teacher Education and University of Teacher Education Zug, University of Neuch&acirc;tel and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.</p>



<p>Under the agreement, which began earlier this year, the Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the three-year term, which will be based on prior years&rsquo; publication levels. Consortium institutions will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these three years and will not be charged any APCs. This agreement will further PLOS&rsquo; mission of making Open Access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages, and geographies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The agreement with the <a>Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries </a>is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreements with consortia in the United States,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;CSAL share our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing.&rdquo;</p>

                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Renee Hoch, Senior Editor &amp; Manager of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>Since 2003, PLOS has published nearly 300,000 research articles, contributing a tremendous body of knowledge to the scientific corpus. However, our roles in scientific communications do not end at the time of publication. PLOS, like many other scholarly publishers, has a Publication Ethics team dedicated to addressing ethics and integrity concerns raised about PLOS content, many of which arise after publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS Publication Ethics receives a broad array of inquiries, ranging from correctable reporting errors to more serious issues, including data analysis, data integrity, or reporting concerns, study design flaws, authorship and data ownership disputes, and highly sensitive matters involving research ethics, publication ethics, and potential misconduct. Altogether, PLOS has been notified of post-publication ethics or integrity concerns for &lt;1% of our published research articles, and thus far we have issued 380 retractions (~0.13% of PLOS research articles). We are not alone: the Retraction Watch Database<sup>1</sup> includes over 17,000 retracted research articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="issuesnot-identified"><a href="#issuesnotidentified">Why are these issues not identified before publication</a></h2>



<p>All PLOS research articles are peer-reviewed, but peer review has its limitations. A manuscript is typically evaluated by 2-4 people during pre-publication peer review, whereas after publication it is available to a much broader audience, including collaborators, other researchers, those exploring ethics and integrity in the research literature, and even the press and general public. As open access publications, PLOS articles are freely available for all to read, and each reader views the work through their unique perspective. With many more eyes on the content post-publication, it is perhaps unsurprising that issues may come to light after having slipped unnoticed through peer review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, some issue types (e.g. data ownership concerns) cannot be identified from the article content alone or involve people who would not typically be involved in peer review. We do not expect these types of concern to be detectable pre-publication.</p>



<h2 id="editorial-actions"><a href="#editorialactions">Editorial actions are not indicators of misconduct</a></h2>



<p>While social media and news outlets often highlight egregious cases and/or those involving misconduct, much of what the PLOS Publication Ethics team sees may have arisen due to honest errors. Importantly, it is beyond the journal&rsquo;s or publisher&rsquo;s remit to adjudicate on intent or personal culpability. Regardless of who was responsible, regardless of whether issues arose due to honest errors or deliberate misconduct, and regardless of when issues are noticed, PLOS has a responsibility to take action as needed to ensure the integrity and reliability of our publications. We take this responsibility very seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="whatittakes"><a href="#whatittakes">What it takes to resolve publication ethics cases</a></h2>



<p>Each publication ethics case &ndash; even for seemingly straightforward issues &ndash; takes its own path and involves multiple contributors. This is very demanding work. It involves a bit of sleuthing, rigorous scientific assessment, and sensitive correspondence with researchers, institutions, and readers around the globe. It also requires resilience and tenacity &ndash; and time, as is discussed further in Q2, below. Our Publication Ethics editors abide by the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> guidance and are very careful to provide due respect to all contributors, due process to every case, and due consideration to every editorial decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS often receives questions about why we have taken so long to resolve issues raised to us or noted on Pubpeer a few years back. Many cases we are working through currently are from our ethics case backlog (discussed in Q3, below) which developed before we had a dedicated Publication Ethics team. The time between an initial notification and case resolution also reflects how the case has been prioritized by PLOS and the time required for PLOS and external contributors to complete various steps in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, I expand on some of these points and other frequently asked questions..&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of our Publication Ethics team, I sincerely thank all who support PLOS in our efforts to address ethics and integrity issues, including authors, editors, reviewers, institutions, those who identify concerns and bring them to our attention, and our PLOS colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>If you have a concern about the integrity or reliability of PLOS content, please email the PLOS Publication Ethics team at </em><a href="mailto:pub-ethics@plos.org"><em>pub-ethics@plos.org</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>



<h2 id="howmany"><em><a href="How%20many%20cases%20does%20PLOS%20receive%20vs.%20resolve%20each%20year?%C2%A0">Q1: How many cases does PLOS receive vs. resolve each year?&nbsp;</a></em> </h2>



<p>In 2018-2021, our Publication Ethics team resolved &gt;800 publication ethics cases and received &gt;1100 new ones. Our team expanded in 2021 to address this disparity and create additional capacity for backlog case work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="Whydoes"><em><a href="Why%20does%20it%20take%20so%20long%20to%20resolve%20publication%20ethics%20cases?">Q2: Why does it take so long to resolve publication ethics cases?</a></em>&nbsp; </h2>



<p>The time between when we receive an issue and when we resolve the case reflects both where the case falls on our priority-ranked &lsquo;to-do&rsquo; list, and how much time the case actually requires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we begin working on a post-publication case, it typically takes us ~4-8 months to bring it to resolution, although this varies considerably. This process involves a number of contributors each of whom takes anywhere from one week to multiple months to do their part (see table, below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When thinking about the time required for this work, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that these aren&rsquo;t just cases &ndash; they&rsquo;re people. People whose work is being questioned, sometimes years after it was completed. People who may have retired or left academic research. People who are carving time out of their busy schedules to help PLOS on a volunteer basis. People who may be involved in investigating multiple concurrent integrity cases for an institution. People who are juggling a multitude of responsibilities &ndash; research, teaching, clinical practice, grant writing and review, not to mention family and other personal priorities. Over the last couple years, those involved in these cases have also been coping with the pandemic and the associated institutional closures, illnesses, and lockdown mandates. Although we work to keep cases moving along designated timelines, these personal considerations can impact and extend the process.</p>

<h2 id="ethics-backlog"><a href="Why%20does%20PLOS%20have%20an%20ethics%20case%20backlog,%20and%20what%20are%20we%20doing%20to%20address%20it?"><em>Q3: Why does PLOS have an ethics case backlog, and what are we doing to address it?</em> </a></h2>



<p>PLOS has always addressed concerns raised about our submissions and publications. For several years, these cases trickled in at a relatively low rate and were handled by the journals&rsquo; staff editors and Editorial Services teams, among their many other responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 2014-2016 our case numbers spiked: in addition to the steady stream of varied publication ethics concerns, PLOS received &gt;400 post-publication image integrity cases. Those responding to these inquiries were quickly overwhelmed: the journal&rsquo;s editors worked tirelessly, but could each handle only a couple cases at a time while juggling their other tasks. Hence, an ethics case backlog amassed quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, we didn&rsquo;t know if this was a one-off collection of cases, or if we would continue to receive cases at this unexpectedly high pace. We diverted internal staff resources to help where possible, but in essence PLOS was not yet equipped to respond to publication ethics issues at this scale. We needed more resources. In response, PLOS gradually built up a dedicated Publication Ethics team. This started with a single dedicated <em>PLOS ONE</em> editor in 2017, and has grown to a team of five Senior Editors serving all PLOS journals as a Center of Excellence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2021 the PLOS Publication Ethics team began a multi-year project dedicated to addressing our ethics case backlog, some of which dates back to that 2014-16 surge. This is a large undertaking that we anticipate will require at least two years, but we are committed to ensuring that all issues which have been raised to us receive their due attention.</p>



<h2 id="articles-offline"><em><a href="Why%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20PLOS%20take%20articles%20offline%20or%20post%20interim%20notices%20while%20they%20are%20under%20investigation?">Q4: Why doesn&rsquo;t PLOS take articles offline or post interim notices while they are under investigation?</a> </em> </h2>



<p>We sincerely apologize for how long it is taking us to resolve our ethics case backlog and update the literature accordingly. We appreciate the importance of correcting the published record in a timely manner, and likewise we understand that it can negatively impact researchers and others to have problematic articles or unreliable results remain unmarked and unactioned in the published record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to requests we occasionally receive, we will not simply take an article offline while it is under investigation. Even for online-only publishers, the industry standard is to preserve the integrity and stability of the published record and to remove content only under rare circumstances.<sup>2</sup> (See also <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/corrections-expressions-of-concern-and-retractions#loc-removal-of-plos-content">PLOS policy</a> and <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a> guidance.) PLOS is highly committed to transparency in research communication, and one aspect of this is ensuring an accurate and stable record of an article&rsquo;s publication history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interim notices can benefit readers while journals and/or institutions complete their investigations, but it is important to bear in mind that a substantial fraction of issues raised to PLOS do not ultimately warrant any formal editorial action. For example, concerns may not be verified per our editorial assessments, or may reflect differences of opinion rather than bona fide errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; current standard is to complete our follow-up work on most publication ethics cases before issuing editorial notices (if needed), and publish interim Expressions of Concern only in select circumstances for articles under investigation. However, we are currently considering an expanded framework of interim notice usage wherein we would routinely notify readers of editorially verified issues sooner. Whatever our course, we will continue to assess issues carefully before taking any public editorial action, and will ensure that our actions align with PLOS policies and COPE guidance.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crater-ancient-asteroid-meteorite-impact-earth">An ancient impact on Earth led to a cascade of cratering</a></h4>

              
                <p>A bevy of craters formed by material blasted from the carving of another, larger crater — a process dubbed secondary cratering — have finally been spotted on Earth. Several groupings of craters in southeastern Wyoming, including dozens of pockmarks in all, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/doi/10.1130/B36196.1/611743/Secondary-cratering-on-Earth-The-Wyoming-impact">have the hallmarks of secondary cratering</a>, researchers report February 11 in <em>GSA Bulletin.</em></p>



<p>When an asteroid or another type of space rock smacks into a planet or moon, it blasts material from the surface and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/erosion-has-erased-most-earth-impact-craters-here-are-survivors">creates a crater</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/18</em>). Large blocks of that material can be thrown far from the initial crater and blast out their own holes when they land, explains Thomas Kenkmann, a planetary scientist at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg in Germany. Astronomers have long observed secondary cratering on our moon, Mars and other orbs in the solar system, but never on Earth.</p>



<p>When Kenkmann and his colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31655-4">first investigated a series of craters</a> near Douglas, Wyo., in 2018, they thought the pockmarks were formed by fragments of a large meteorite that had broken up in the atmosphere. But Kenkmann and his team later discovered similar groups of craters of the same age, somewhere around 280 million years old, throughout the region.</p>





<p>Altogether, the team found more than 30 impact craters that range between 10 and 70 meters in diameter at six different locales<em>. </em>Based on subtle but distinct differences in the alignment of elliptical craters in the groups, the researchers suggest that the impactors that blasted each set of craters struck the ground from slightly different directions.</p>



<p>The impactors that created these secondary craters probably ranged between 4 and 8 meters in diameter and struck the ground at speeds between 2,520 and 3,600 kilometers per hour, Kenkmann says. Extrapolating the paths of these impactors back to their presumed sources suggests the original crater from which they flew straddles the Wyoming–Nebraska border northeast of Cheyenne.</p>



<p>The team’s evidence “comes together very well to make a compelling story,” says Gareth Collins, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>The original crater was probably between 50 and 65 kilometers across and was created by an impactor 4 to 5.4 kilometers wide, Kenkmann and the team estimate. The crater is also probably buried under more than 2 kilometers of sediment that accumulated in the 280 million years since it formed. An equivalent amount of sediment eroded away to expose the secondary craters when the Rocky Mountains rose in the meantime.</p>



<p>“What a fortuitous discovery that these folks have made,” says Beau Bierhaus, a planetary scientist at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Littleton, Colo. He likens the short geological interval during which these craters could be discovered to the brief period between the time a fossil is first exposed to the elements and when it is eroded to dust.</p>



<p>Scouring measurements of gravitational and magnetic fields in the region for anomalies could help reveal the buried crater, the researchers note. The team may also look for heavily fractured rock and other evidence of the ancient crater in sediment cores that have been drilled during oil and gas exploration in the region, Kenkmann says.</p>

                <p>Like a phoenix, some stars may burst to life covered in “ash,” rising from the remains of stars that had previously passed on.</p>



<p>Two newfound fireballs that burn hundreds of times as bright as the sun and are covered in carbon and oxygen, ashy byproducts of helium fusion, belong to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/511/1/L66/6527770">a new class of stars</a>, researchers report in the March <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters</em>. Though these blazing orbs are not the first stellar bodies found covered in carbon and oxygen, an analysis of the light emitted by the stars suggests they are the first discovered to also have helium-burning cores.</p>



<p>“That [combination] has never been seen before,” says study coauthor Nicole Reindl, an astrophysicist from the University of Potsdam in Germany. “That tells you the star must have evolved differently.”</p>





<p>The stars may have formed <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slab134/6500207">from the merging of two white dwarfs</a>, the remnant hearts of stars that exhausted their fuel, another team proposes in a companion study. The story goes that one of the two was rich in helium, while the other contained lots of carbon and oxygen.These two white dwarfs had already been orbiting one another, but gradually drew together over time. Eventually the helium-rich white dwarf gobbled its partner, spewing carbon and oxygen all over its surface, just as a messy child might get food all over their face.</p>



<p>Such a merger would have produced a stellar body covered in carbon and oxygen with enough mass to reignite nuclear fusion in its core, causing it to burn hot and glow brilliantly, say Tiara Battich, an astrophysicist from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, and her colleagues.</p>



<p>To test this hypothesis, Battich and her colleagues simulated the evolution, death and eventual merging of two stars. The team found that aggregating a carbon-and-oxygen-rich white dwarf onto a more massive helium one could explain the surface compositions of the two stars observed by Reindl and her colleagues.</p>



<p>“But this should happen very rarely,” Battich says.</p>



<p>In most cases the opposite should occur — the carbon-oxygen white dwarf should cover itself with the helium one. That’s because carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are usually the more massive ones. For the rarer scenario to occur, two stars slightly more massive than the sun must have formed at just the right distance apart from each other. What’s more, they needed to have then exchanged material at just the right time before both running out of nuclear fuel in order to leave behind a helium white dwarf of greater mass than a carbon-and-oxygen counterpart.</p>



<p>The origins story Battich and her colleagues propose demands a very specific and unusual set of circumstances, says Simon Blouin, an astrophysicist from the University of Victoria in Canada, who was not involved with either study. “But in the end, it makes sense.” Stellar mergers are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">dynamic and complicated events</a> that can unfold in many ways, he says (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). “This is just another.”</p>

<p>I am a Canadian Registered Dietitian (RD) with interdisciplinary training in nutrition and dietetics, health administration, and nursing theory. Through my <a href="https://islandscholar.ca/people/shewko">research program</a>, I create new knowledge that empirically defines the characteristics of work settings that facilitate evidence-based, timely use of allied health services while also supporting allied health professional’s (AHPs) innovative behaviors, career satisfaction, and job satisfaction and enhancing retention of these professionals, both in specific specializations and within organizations. It is clear that the actions and leadership skills of middle managers in health care settings are key to optimal workforce outcomes. Key stakeholders for my research include employment policy-makers, health administrators, and front-line supervisors and managers of AHPs. Commonly included in the classification of allied health professions are physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and dietetics.</p>
<blockquote><p>The majority of Canadian RNs and AHPs retire well before the age of 65, and retaining them for even an average of 6 months longer could have significant impacts on the sustainability of the health workforce.</p></blockquote>
<p>To date, the results of my research have been most relevant to Sustainable Development Goals <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5">number 5</a>: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, and <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8">number 8</a>: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. In my doctoral research, I <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-on-aging-la-revue-canadienne-du-vieillissement/article/abs/conceptual-models-of-early-and-involuntary-retirement-among-canadian-registered-nurses-and-allied-health-professionals/DBB001B215A6ED62F27524977B5318A3">explored</a> retirement decision-making among Registered Nurses (RNs) and AHPs. The <a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-019-0381-5">results</a> of this study highlighted the importance of structural supports for caregivers, a key factor contributing to achieving gender equality (target 5.4). Also, having <a href="https://www.longwoods.com/content/26074/retirement-decision-making-among-registered-nurses-and-allied-health-professionals-a-descriptive">broad representation</a> from several female-dominated health professions in my analysis, these findings contribute to support for policy changes that enhance the quality of jobs (for all workers) in the health care sector (target 8.5). The majority of Canadian RNs and AHPs retire well before the age of 65, and retaining them for even an average of 6 months longer could have significant impacts on the sustainability of the health workforce.</p>

<p>Since then, I have focussed my attention on the RD workforce, which is overwhelmingly female. I have completed three studies, <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-06008-5">one</a> identifying reasons for variations in job turnover within clinical settings, a second (in press) exploring RDs’ capacity for and interest in innovation, and a third (submitted) exploring the experience and motivation of RDs working concurrently in health care and as independent sales consultants for network marketing companies. The results of these studies have highlighted how undervalued RDs feel and how few growth opportunities they encounter in their professional work. Such experiences in the health workforce are likely shared across the allied health professions as there are many similarities in the characteristics of employment for AHPs and many allied health professions are female-dominated. Were health administrators to take actions based on my research findings, such as by supporting and providing opportunities for personal growth and development in the workplace and/or by rewarding individual AHP successes, they would be contributing to women’s full and effective participation in the health workforce (target 5.5) and their full and productive employment (target 8.5). The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated existing shortages of health professionals, including AHPs, particularly in rural and underserved areas; taking action to support the retention of health professionals, such as by effectively addressing SDGs 5 and 8, enhances the sustainability of health services.</p>
<p>There are several challenges I have encountered in building my research program. First, because work in health human resources straddles “work” and “health” research, it can be considered too human resource-oriented for funders of health research and too health-oriented for funders of human resources research. I continue to gain skills in grant-writing and to seek out mentors to help me frame my work optimally for funding opportunities. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the capacity for research activities within health care settings. As a result, it has been difficult to pursue plans for on-site interventional research that may provide empirical evidence to support practices identified in survey and qualitative research as facilitating improved AHP job retention, innovativeness, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction. This summer, I look forward to conducting a study exploring the process and rationale supporting RD redeployment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>One of the best-known but also most contentious ideas in psychology has to be that there are &#8220;universal&#8221; expressions of at least some human emotions. According to this idea, which was pioneered by <a href="https://www.paulekman.com/resources/universal-facial-expressions/">Paul Ekman</a>, particular patterns of facial muscular movements are reliable indicators of anger, disgust, fear, surprise, happiness, sadness and contempt, no matter where you are in the world. In other words, these expressions are a fundamental part of being human.</p>



<p>The idea of universal emotional expressions has been challenged, however. Some psychologists argue that even within the US or UK, say, facial movements that we routinely associate with certain emotions — such as a smile with feeling happy — don’t reliably match in that way. Others think that facial &#8220;expressions&#8221; are better understood as social signals. According to this model, when someone smiles, it doesn’t <em>mean</em> that they’re happy but rather that they want to be sociable and cooperative, while a frown doesn’t mean &#8220;I’m angry&#8221; but rather &#8220;I want you to bend to my will&#8221;. Physical social signals, beyond facial movements, have been identified, too. And now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04370-w">new paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> enters this field, with the claim that a downwards head-tilt is a “possibly universal” signal of dominance.</p>



<span id="more-45446"></span>



<p>Zachary Witkower at the University of Toronto and colleagues studied members of a remote community in the forested Bosawas Biosphere Reserve in Mayangna, Nicaragua. Relatively few of the 119 adults (aged 18-75) were fluent in Spanish, most had never seen a US TV programme, their knowledge of global celebrities was paltry, and 94% had never used the internet. So, the team argues, they are unlikely to have learned particular ways of responding or behaving from Western culture.</p>



<p>Each participant was shown two pairs of images. The first pair showed just the eyebrow/eye/nose bridge regions of two computer-generated male heads. These heads, which had neutral facial expressions, were identical, except that one was upright and the other was tilted forwards 10 degrees. An experimenter said: &#8220;Please select the image in which the person is likely to be a leader because he is willing to use aggression and intimidation to get his way&#8221; and the participants made a choice. Then they were shown the same two heads, but in full this time, and were asked the same question.</p>

From <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04370-w">Witkower et al (2022</a>)</center></figcaption></figure>



<p>When American participants were given this task, they tended to choose the head-tilted image. This was true whether they saw the eye region or the full head. And Witkover and colleagues found the same thing for this remote population. When only the facial strip was shown, the head-tilted version was chosen as the likely aggressive leader 72% of the time. When full faces were shown, the head-tilted version was chosen 84% of the time. A forwards head tilt was clearly associated with dominance/aggression.</p>



<p>As the effect was stronger for full faces, it might be that the whole face gives more anger/dominance information than the eye region alone. However, as the researchers note, because the full-face pair always followed the eye-region pair, participants might just have become more confident in their perceptions of anger/dominance on the second viewing.</p>



<p>A big question is: what explains the finding?</p>



<p>The researchers argue that when the head is tilted down a little, this gives the illusion that the brow has been lowered. Numerous studies have linked a lowered, frowning brow with anger, dominance and threat. This new research “provides the first evidence to suggest that humans across highly diverse cultural contexts perceive dominance from a downwards head tilt alone,” the team writes. And because they think it’s due to the illusion that the brow has been lowered, signalling anger/threat, they argue that “this visual illusion might therefore be a universal feature of human cognition”.</p>



<p>Why <em>should</em> a lowered brow signal threat/anger? The team suggests that we evolved to automatically associate angles in our environment with threat and danger. According to this idea, sharp, angular things (like rocks) would generally have been dangerous — and the angular V-shape that forms when the brow is lowered might have come to signify threat, too.</p>



<p>But there are other potential explanations for their findings. Their theory could even be flipped on its head. Picture someone about to run at you, to attack. Their head will be tilted forwards, not straight upright. So a downward tilted head could itself be a signal of threat. And a frown may give the illusion that this is happening — rather than a downward head tilt giving the illusion of a scowl.</p>



<p>Claims of human &#8220;universals&#8221; are always subject to strong scrutiny. The team’s claims will be no different. It will take more research, especially on more non-WEIRD populations, to rule out other possibilities and firm up their ideas.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04370-w">Is a downwards head tilt a cross-cultural signal of dominance? Evidence for a universal visual illusion</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crocodile-ancestor-ate-dinosaur-fossil-stomach">Fossils show a crocodile ancestor dined on a young dinosaur</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, scientists have found indisputable evidence that an ancient crocodile ancestor chowed down on a dinosaur.</p>



<p>Preserved within a fossilized crocodyliform, a member of a newfound species dubbed<em> Confractosuchus sauroktonos,</em> are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2022.01.016">the partially digested remains of a juvenile bipedal ornithopod</a>, paleontologist Matt White of the University of New England in Australia and colleagues report February 10 in <em>Gondwana Research.</em></p>



<p>Crocodyliforms include modern species like crocodiles and alligators as well as their ancestors. Those ancestors lived alongside dinosaurs for millions of years, and previous evidence, such as bite marks on fossilized dinosaur bones, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-indicate-wow-what-croc">hinted that croc ancestors dined on dinosaurs</a> when the opportunity arose (<em>SN: 10/24/01</em>). But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ichthyosaur-died-eating-long-creature">fossils with actual preserved stomach contents</a> are extremely rare (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). In fact, <em>C. sauroktonos </em>is only the second extinct crocodyliform fossil with identifiable stomach contents — and the first to reveal a meal of dinosaur.</p>





<p><em>C. sauroktonos</em> was about 2.5 meters long — slightly smaller than an adult female American alligator — and lived between 104 million and 92.5 million years ago in what is now Queensland, Australia. Similarities between the creature’s skull features and those of living and extinct crocodyliforms suggest that it didn’t just eat dinos. <em>C. sauroktonos</em> probably cast a wide net when it came to seeking out prey.</p>



<p>As for the grisly contents of its gut — including a few ribs and bits of leg and arm bone — they represent the first ornithopod ever found in Queensland’s Winton rock formation. The herbivorous dino may also be a new species, although it’s difficult to tell from these few pieces, the team says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>On some days, waking up and engaging in healthy behaviours is easy — you get up, hit the gym, drink enough water and spend time with friends. On others, even getting out of bed seems like too much effort.</p>



<p>Knowing <em>how</em> to encourage healthy behaviours is therefore pretty useful, and much research has been done on what makes them stick, whether that’s <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/22/your-perfect-new-excuse-for-ordering-unhealthy-food-and-drink-altruistic-indulgence/">avoiding indulgent friends</a> or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/03/people-will-pay-money-to-avoid-having-to-exert-self-control/">paying to remove temptation</a>. And a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-021-09924-z">new study</a> from a Kent State University team, published in <em>Motivation and Emotion</em>, finds that positive mood can also encourage healthy behaviour — at least in the short term.</p>



<span id="more-45438"></span>



<p>Over the course of ten days, participants responded to questionnaires administered by email five times a day at random times. First, they rated their current emotional state (e.g. scared, guilty, distressed, happy, or satisfied) using a seven point scale; these ratings were combined to produce overall positive and negative mood scores. Participants also reported whether they had engaged in four healthy behaviours: exercising, spending time with someone supportive, taking part in a hobby, and relaxation or meditation.</p>



<p>As the team anticipated, participants who generally felt more positive mood were likely to engage in healthy behaviours, while those who felt more negative mood were less likely to engage in these behaviours. And momentary changes in mood contributed to such behaviours <em>within</em> participants as well. When participants reported more positive mood at one questionnaire, they tended to report engaging in more healthy behaviours at the next one. (Changes in negative mood, however, had no effect).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the impact of a good mood didn’t seem to last. Over time, the impact of positive affect on health behaviour started to weaken — in fact, good mood only seemed to have an impact within a day, not across days.</p>



<p>Of course, engaging in healthy behaviours can also increase positive affect: quite obviously, spending time with someone supportive or relaxing in a way you enjoy is likely to make you feel good. But these results suggest a more complex two-way relationship.</p>



<p>Sleep may play a part here: the team suggests that our moods may be &#8220;reset&#8221; with sleep. Indeed, many of us will have experienced going to bed in a bad mood and feeling a lot better in the morning. Quality of sleep is also relevant: even the best mood can be knocked by a terrible night’s sleep. Exploring the impact of sleep on the longevity of moods and their relationship with healthy behaviours could provide some further insight.</p>



<p>The findings could be helpful in actively encouraging healthy behaviours — if someone finds it difficult to motivate themselves to engage in such activities, encouraging them to do so when they feel content could be a good start. It could also, potentially, reinforce the two-way relationship between positive affect and healthy behaviour — encouraging people to engage in healthy behaviours, boosting their mood and thus encouraging more. For those who struggle with low mood, the team suggests introducing lower-demand activities such as listening to music before working up to exercise or meditation.</p>

                Finding papers produced by paper mills has become a major headache for many of the world&#8217;s largest publishers over the past year, and they&#8217;re largely playing catch-up since sleuths began identifying them a few years ago.

<p>Read on to learn more about the published research, which factors were important when selecting&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></strong>, and the overall experience.</p>
        </div>

<p><strong>Tell us a little about your research.</strong></p>



<p>In the past few years, my work has focused on TB/HIV. In general, I enjoy exploring various global health topics, with a focus on equity and neglected populations. I like delving into the intersection of social and environmental influences and public health.</p>



<p><strong>What are the important factors that you look for when selecting a journal for your research?</strong></p>



<p>When selecting a journal for my research, I look to see if the journal aims align with my interests. I also look to see if there is flexibility when it comes to submission guidelines, such as manuscript format and word count. Finally, I generally like open access journals for a wider reach of audience.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to publish with <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>?</strong></p>



<p>My manuscript could be considered more of a narrative review backed with multiple peer-reviewed journal articles and other respected sources of guidance documents. I had multiple colleagues recommend <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> when they reviewed my manuscript, which encouraged me to explore this new journal since both quantitative and qualitative work were considered. Additionally, I felt that <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> was the best avenue to publish, since our manuscript spanned a variety of diseases (i.e. TB, NTDs, HIV) and touches upon different aspects of global health, including burden of disease, development, politics, and funding.</p>



<p><strong>What was your experience of the<em> PLOS Global Public Health</em> publishing process?</strong></p>



<p>The publishing process was easy and smooth. I was on maternity leave and juggling life with a newborn (and a toddler!) and I was not at all stressed since <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> was communicative and transparent. The timeline was fairly quick and the online centralized submission system was easy to navigate.</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to other authors considering publishing with <em>PLO</em>S Global Public Health?</strong></p>



<p>My advice is to not shy away from qualitative work or work that is at the intersection of diseases or topics. So much of public health is siloed, including work published by journals. If we want to make true positive incremental change, it is to address the multiple aspects of a disease since everything is connected.</p>



<p><strong>Would you publish with PLOS again? Why?</strong></p>



<p>I would happily publish with PLOS again. The process was transparent and the turnaround time was quick. I like that the journal has a wide scope and even wider audience reach.</p>

                <p>The historic Apollo moon missions are often associated with high-visibility test flights, dazzling launches and spectacular feats of engineering. But intricate, challenging handiwork — comparable to weaving — was just as essential to putting men on the moon. Beyond Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and a handful of other names that we remember were hundreds of thousands of men and women who contributed to Apollo over a decade. Among them: the Navajo women who assembled state-of-the-art integrated circuits for the Apollo Guidance Computer and the women employees of Raytheon who wove the computer’s core memory.</p>



<p>In 1962, when President John F. Kennedy <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/fly-me-to-the-moon">declared</a> that putting Americans on the moon should be the top priority for NASA, computers were large mainframes; they occupied entire rooms. And so one of the most daunting yet crucial challenges was developing a highly stable, reliable and portable computer to control and navigate the spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA chose to use cutting-edge integrated circuits in the Apollo Guidance Computer. These commercial circuits had been introduced only recently. Also known as microchips, they were revolutionizing electronics and computing, contributing to the gradual miniaturization of computers from mainframes to today’s smartphones. NASA sourced the circuits from the original Silicon Valley start-up, Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild was also leading the way in the practice known as outsourcing; the company opened a factory in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, which by 1966 employed 5,000 people, compared with Fairchild’s 3,000 California employees.</p>



<p>At the same time, Fairchild sought low-cost labor within the United States. Lured by tax incentives and the promise of a labor force with almost no other employment options, Fairchild opened a plant in Shiprock, N.M., within the Navajo reservation, in 1965. The Fairchild factory operated until 1975 and employed more than 1,000 individuals at its peak, most of them Navajo women manufacturing integrated circuits.</p>



<p>It was challenging work. Electrical components had to be placed on tiny chips made of a semiconductor such as silicon and connected by wires in precise locations, creating complex and varying patterns of lines and geometric shapes. The <a href="https://lnakamur.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/indigenous-circuits-nakamura-aq.pdf">Navajo women’s work</a> “was performed using a microscope and required painstaking attention to detail, excellent eyesight, high standards of quality and intense focus,” writes digital media scholar Lisa Nakamura.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/01/102770254-05-01-acc.pdf">brochure commemorating the dedication of the Shiprock plant</a>, Fairchild directly compared the assembly of integrated circuits with what the company portrayed as the traditional, feminine, Indigenous craft of rug-weaving. The Shiprock brochure juxtaposed a photo of a microchip with one of a geometric-patterned rug, and another of a woman weaving such a rug. That portrayal, Nakamura argues, reinforced racial and gender stereotypes. The work was dismissed as “women’s work,” depriving the Navajo women of appropriate recognition and commensurate compensation. &nbsp;Journalists and Fairchild employees also “depict[ed] electronics manufacture as a high-tech version of blanket weaving performed by willing and skillful Indigenous women,” Nakamura notes, yet “the women who performed this labor did so for the same reason that women have performed factory labor for centuries — to survive.”</p>



<p>Far from the Shiprock desert, outside of Boston, women employees at Raytheon assembled the Apollo Guidance Computer’s core memory with a process that in this case directly mimicked weaving. Again, the moon missions demanded a stable and compact way of storing Apollo’s computing instructions. Core memory used metal wires threaded through tiny doughnut-shaped ferrite rings, or “cores,” to represent 1s and 0s. All of this core memory was <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/4/">woven by hand</a>, with women sitting on opposite sides of a panel passing a wire-threaded needle back and forth to create a particular pattern. (In some cases, a woman worked alone, passing the needle through the panel to herself.)</p>

<p>Apollo engineers referred to this process of building memory as the “LOL,” or “Little Old Ladies,” method. Yet this work was so mission critical that it was tested and inspected multiple times. Mary Lou Rogers, who worked on Apollo, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8148730.stm">recalled</a>, “[Each component] had to be looked at by three of four people before it was stamped off. We had a group of inspectors come in for the federal government to check our work all the time.”</p>



<p>The core memory was also known as rope memory, and those who supervised its development were “rope mothers.” We know a great deal about one rope mother — Margaret Hamilton. She has been recognized with the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/11/22/celebrating-presidential-medal-freedom-winners-science-and-tech-garwin-hopper-and">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, among other awards, and is now remembered as the woman who oversaw most of the Apollo software. But her efforts were unrecognized by many at the time. Hamilton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/13/margaret-hamilton-computer-scientist-interview-software-apollo-missions-1969-moon-landing-nasa-women">recalled</a>, “At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal. But then they began to realize how much they were relying on it…. Astronauts‘ lives were at stake. Our software needed to be ultrareliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the hardware.” Yet, little is known about the thousands of others who performed this mission-critical work of weaving integrated circuits and core memory.</p>

<p>At the time, Fairchild’s representation of the Navajo women’s work as a feminine craft differentiated it from the high-status and masculine work of engineering. As Nakamura has <a href="https://lnakamur.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/indigenous-circuits-nakamura-aq.pdf">written</a>, the work “came to be understood as affective labor, or a ‘labor of love.’” Similarly, the work performed at Raytheon was described by Eldon Hall, who led the Apollo Guidance Computer’s hardware design, as “<a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/4/">tender loving care</a>.” Journalists and even a Raytheon manager presented this work as requiring no thinking and no skill.</p>



<p>Recently, the communications scholar Samantha Shorey, engineer Daniela Rosner, technologist Brock Craft and quilt artist Helen Remick firmly overturned the notion that weaving core memory was a “no-brainer” with their <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf">Making Core Memory</a> project. In nine workshops, they invited participants to weave core memory “patches” using metal matrices, beads and conductive threads, showcasing the deep focus and meticulous attention to detail required. The patches were then assembled in an electronic quilt that played aloud accounts from 1960s Apollo engineers and Raytheon managers. The Making Core Memory collaboration challenged the dichotomy of masculine, high-status, well-paid science and engineering cognitive labor versus feminine, low-status, low-paid, manual labor.</p>



<p>A 1975 NASA report that summarized the Apollo missions spoke glowingly of the Apollo computing systems — but mentioned none of the Navajo or Raytheon women. “<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/apsr/Apollopt3-1.pdf">The performance of the computer was flawless</a>,” the report declared. “Perhaps the most significant accomplishment during Apollo pertaining to guidance, navigation, and control was the demonstration of the versatility and adaptability of the computer software.” </p>



<p>That computer, and that software, relied on the skilled, technical, embodied expertise and labor of thousands of women, including women of color. They were indubitably women of science, and their untold stories call us to reconsider <em>who</em> does science, and what counts as scientific expertise.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Social distancing has been a key part of the pandemic response: we all know that our chance of infection is reduced if we minimise the contact we have with others. Yet there are countless stories of people covertly meeting up with friends and family even at the height of lockdown.</p>



<p>Clearly many of those who disregarded the rules did so because of a desire for social interaction and support. But a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01052-4">new study</a> in <em>Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications</em> suggests there may be another reason too: we simply underestimate the risk of contracting Covid-19 from friends.</p>



<span id="more-45413"></span>



<p>Across a series of five studies, Tobias Schlager from the University of Lausanne and Ashley V Whillans from Harvard Business School found that people consistently feel that friends are less of a Covid risk than strangers.</p>



<p>In the first study, participants assessed the likelihood of catching Covid from a friend, family member, stranger, work colleague, or acquaintance, rating the risk of each “compared to any other person”. The team found that participants actually believed most of these people posed lower risk than the average person, but crucially they rated friends the lowest risk and strangers the highest.</p>



<p>If participants had been around strangers more than friends during the pandemic, it would make sense that they’d rate strangers as higher risk. So in the next study the team asked participants to imagine they had gone to the supermarket and met a friend, family member, cashier, stranger, and colleague. They rated the likelihood of contracting Covid from each of these people using the same scale as before, and also indicated how long they’d expect to talk to them.</p>



<p>Participants rated friends and family as posing significantly lower risk than the average person. They also rated the cashier as significantly higher risk than the average person, followed by the stranger. These results held even when the team controlled for the expected length of time interacting with each person, so it wasn&#8217;t simply that participants saw strangers as a higher risk due to spending more time around  them.</p>



<p>In another experiment, participants imagined they were out to dinner and were approached either by a friend they hadn’t seen in a while or a stranger, who invited the participant to join them. People were more likely to say they’d join a friend’s table than a stranger’s. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team&#8217;s analysis showed that this was partly because participants were more interested in having dinner with the friend, and also because they thought the friend more likely to follow social distancing rules. But there was another reason too: participants rated the stranger as a greater Covid threat (believing they were more likely to be infected, for example), and this belief also contributed to their decision.</p>



<p>Finally, the team also found some evidence that people may physically distance themselves more from strangers than friends. Participants positioned a figure on their screen to indicate how close they would stand next to someone else in a park; those who read they were meeting a friend placed the figures closer than those who read they were meeting a distant colleague. However, participants who were also reminded about the dangers associated with spending time in close proximity to others put a greater distance between themselves and the friend.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the work provides quite convincing evidence that people underestimate the risk posed by friends. And yet, the authors note, close contacts actually play a key role in spreading the disease. Counteracting the perception that our friends are less of a risk to us could therefore be an important part of pandemic communication strategies.</p>



<p>The results are consistent with other work finding that familiarity and trust is related to reduced perceptions of risk, the team notes. They are also reminiscent of the illusory superiority bias, in which we think of ourselves as “better than average” <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/23/most-of-us-think-were-more-environmentally-friendly-than-our-peers/">in various</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">ways</a>. Some work has found that we also believe that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">our friends or partners are superior to other peers</a> — so perhaps this is a similar effect, where we see our friends as “better” than average at not spreading disease.</p>



<p>There are some limitations. In particular, all of the studies are based on self-report data and imaginary scenarios. The authors note that in the middle of the pandemic it would not have been possible to conduct a real-world experiment; still, it would be interesting to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">use other methods such as virtual reality</a> to look at how people behave towards friends and strangers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">The world’s oldest pants stitched together cultures from across Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>What little rain that falls on a gravelly desert located in western China’s Tarim Basin evaporates as it hits the blistering turf. Here, in this parched wasteland, lie the ancient remains of people who made one of the biggest fashion splashes of all time.</p>



<p>Herders and horse riders who buried their dead in the Tarim Basin’s Yanghai graveyard pioneered pants making between roughly 3,200 and 3,000 years ago. Their deft combination of weaving techniques and decorative patterns — displaying influences from societies across Eurasia — yielded a pair of stylish yet durable trousers now recognized as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pants-worn-horse-riders-3000-years-ago">the oldest such garment known in the world</a> (<em>SN: 5/30/14</em>).</p>



<p>Now, an international team of archaeologists, fashion designers, geoscientists, chemists and conservators <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352226721000908">has untangled how those trousers were made</a> and painstakingly created a modern replica. The vintage slacks weave a tale not only of textile innovation but also of how cultural practices fanned out across Asia, the researchers report in the March <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>.</p>



<p>“A diversity of textile techniques and patterns of different local origins, traditions and times merged into something new in this garment,” says archaeologist and project director Mayke Wagner of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. “Eastern Central Asia was a laboratory where people, plants, animals, knowledge and experiences from different directions and sources came … and were transformed.”</p>





<h4>Fashion icon</h4>



<p>One man brought the pants to scientists’ attention without uttering a word. His naturally mummified body, as well as the preserved bodies of more than 500 others, was uncovered during excavations conducted by Chinese archaeologists since the early 1970s at the Yanghai cemetery.</p>



<p>He sported an outfit that consisted of the trousers, a poncho belted at the waist, one pair of braided bands to fasten the trouser legs below the knees, another pair to fasten soft leather boots at the ankles and a wool headband with four bronze disks and two seashells sewn on it. A leather bridle, wooden horse bit and battle-ax that had been placed in his grave indicated he had been a horse-riding warrior.</p>

<p>Researchers now call him Turfan Man because the Yanghai site lies about 43 kilometers southeast of the Chinese city of Turfan.</p>



<p>Of all of Turfan Man’s garments, his trousers stood out as truly special. Not only were they older by at least several centuries than any other examples of such gear, but the Yanghai pants also boasted a sophisticated, modern look. The pants feature two leg pieces that gradually widen at the top, connected by a crotch piece that widens and bunches in the middle to increase leg mobility.</p>



<p>Within a few hundred years, mobile groups across Eurasia began wearing pants like those at Yanghai, other archaeological finds have shown. Woven leg covers connected by a flexible crotch piece eased the strain of riding horses bareback over long distances. Not surprisingly, mounted armies debuted around that time.</p>



<p>Today, people everywhere don denim jeans and dress slacks that incorporate the design and production principles of the ancient Yanghai trousers.</p>



<p>In short, Turfan Man was the ultimate trendsetter.</p>



<h4>Fancy pants</h4>



<p>Despite being so fashion-forward, the ancient Yanghai horseman left researchers wondering how his remarkable pants had been made. No traces of cutting appeared on the fabric, so Wagner’s team suspected that the garment had been woven to fit its wearer.</p>



<p>Close examination of Turfan Man’s trousers revealed a combination of three weaving techniques, the scientists report in the new study. A re-created version of the find — fashioned by an expert weaver from the yarn of coarse-wooled sheep similar to those whose wool was used by ancient Yanghai weavers — confirmed that observation.</p>



<p>Much of the garment consists of twill weave, a major innovation in the history of textiles.</p>



<p>Twill changes the character of woven wool from firm to elastic, providing enough “give” to let a person move freely in a pair of tight-fitting pants. The fabric is created by using rods on a loom to weave a pattern of parallel, diagonal lines. Lengthwise warp threads are held in place so that a row of weft threads can be passed over and under them at regular intervals. The starting point of this weaving pattern shifts slightly to the right or left for each ensuing row so that a diagonal line forms.</p>

Tibbitts</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Variations in the number and color of weft threads in the twill weave on Turfan Man’s trousers were used to create pairs of brown stripes running up the off-white crotch piece, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Textile archaeologist Karina Grömer of the Natural History Museum Vienna says she recognized twill weave on Turfan Man’s trousers when she examined them around five years ago. Grömer had previously reported that pieces of woven fabric found in Austria’s Hallstatt salt mine, where such delicate textiles preserve well, displayed the oldest known twill weave. Radiocarbon dating places the Hallstatt textiles between around 3,500 and 3,200 years old — roughly 200 years before Turfan man sported his britches.</p>



<p>People in Europe and Central Asia may have independently invented twill weaving, says Grömer, who did not participate in the new study. But at the Yanghai site, weavers combined twill with other weaving techniques and innovative designs to create high-quality riding pants.</p>



<p>“This is not a beginner’s item,” Grömer says. “It’s like the Rolls-Royce of trousers.”</p>



<p>Consider the ancient trousers’ knee sections. A technique now known as tapestry weaving produced a thicker, more protective fabric at these joints, the researchers found. A third weaving method was used on the upper border of the pants to create a thick waistband.</p>



<p>Other features of the trousers involved an unusual twining method, in which two differently colored weft threads were twisted around each other by hand and laced through warp threads, creating a decorative, geometric pattern across the knees that resembles interlocking T’s leaning to the side. The same twining method produced zigzag stripes at the trousers’ ankles and calves.</p>



<p>Wagner’s team could find only a few historical examples of such twining, including borders on cloaks of the Maori people, an Indigenous group in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Yanghai artisans also showed their ingenuity in designing a formfitting crotch piece that was wider at its center than at its ends, Grömer says. Trousers dating to a few hundred years later than the Yanghai find, found in several parts of Asia, often consist of woven legs connected by square fabric crotch pieces that resulted in a less comfortable and flexible fit. In tests with a man riding a horse bareback while wearing a re-created version of Turfan Man’s entire outfit, the trousers fit snugly yet allowed the legs to clamp firmly around the horse.</p>



<p>Today’s denim jeans are made from one piece of twill material following some of the same design principles as those favored by Yanghai pants makers three millennia ago.</p>

<h4>Clothes connections</h4>



<p>Perhaps most striking, Turfan Man’s trousers tell a story of how ancient herding groups carried their cultural practices and knowledge across Asia, spreading seeds of innovation.</p>



<p>For instance, the interlocking T pattern decorating the ancient horseman’s pants at the knees appears on bronze vessels found in what’s now China from around the same time, roughly 3,300 years ago, Wagner’s team says. The nearly simultaneous adoption of this geometric form in Central and East Asia coincides with the arrival in those regions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia">herders from West Eurasian grasslands riding horses that they domesticated 4,200 years ago or more</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/21</em>).</p>



<p>Pottery found at those horse riders’ home sites in western Siberia and Kazakhstan displays interlocking T’s as well. Any deeper meaning this pattern held aside from its artistic appeal remains unknown. But West Eurasian horse breeders probably spread the interlocking T design across much of ancient Asia, Wagner and her colleagues suspect.</p>



<p>Similarly, a stepped pyramid pattern woven into the Yanghai pants appears on pottery from Central Asia’s Petrovka culture, which dates to between around 3,900 and 3,750 years ago. The same pattern resembles architectural designs that are more than 4,000 years old from western and southwestern Asian and Middle Eastern societies, including Mesopotamian stepped pyramids, the researchers say. Tapestry weaving such as that observed on Turfan Man’s trousers also originated in those societies.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that cultural influences from throughout Asia affected ancient people in the Tarim Basin, says anthropologist Michael Frachetti of Washington University in St. Louis. Yanghai people inhabited a region at a crossroads of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-nomadic-herders-beat-path-silk-road">seasonal migration routes followed by herding groups starting more than 4,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/17</em>). Those routes ran from the Altai Mountains in Central and East Asia to Southwest Asia where Iran is located today. Excavations at sites along those routes indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bronze-age-herders-spread-farming-around-asia">herders spread crops across much of Asia</a> too (<em>SN: 4/2/14</em>).</p>



<p>Cultural transitions in the Tarim Basin may have started even earlier. Ancient DNA suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">western Asian herders in oxen-pulled wagons moved through much of Europe and Asia around 5,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>).</p>



<p>By around 2,000 years ago, herders’ migration paths formed part of a trade and travel network running from China to Europe that became known as the Silk Road. Cultural mixing and mingling intensified as thousands of local routes throughout Eurasia formed a massive network.</p>



<p>Turfan Man’s multicultural riding pants show that even in the Silk Road’s early stages, migrating herders carried new ideas and practices to distant communities. “The Yanghai pants are an entry point for examining how the Silk Road transformed the world,” Frachetti says.</p>





<h4>Looming questions</h4>



<p>A more basic question concerns how exactly Yanghai clothes makers transformed yarn spun from sheep’s wool into Turfan Man’s trousers. Even after making a replica of those pants on a modern loom, Wagner’s team is unsure what an ancient Yanghai loom looked like. No remnants of those devices have been found.</p>



<p>The researchers suspect a loom constructed to be operated from a sitting position would have made it possible to create intricate, twined patterns. Experiments with different weaving devices are the next step in untangling how Turfan Man’s trousers were made, Wagner says.</p>



<p>It’s clear, though, that the makers of these ancient pants blended several complex techniques into a revolutionary piece of apparel, says archaeologist and linguist Elizabeth Barber of Occidental College in Los Angeles. Barber has studied the origins and development of cloth and clothing in West Asia.</p>



<p>“We truly know so little about how clever the ancient weavers were,” Barber says.</p>



<p>Turfan Man may not have had time to ponder his clothes makers’ prowess. With a pair of pants like that, he was ready to ride.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/17/new-arxiv-articles-are-now-automatically-assigned-dois/">New arXiv articles are now automatically assigned DOIs</a></h4>

              
                <p>New articles submitted to arXiv are now automatically assigned DOIs that align with their arXiv ID. This makes research articles more discoverable across search engines because associated metadata is made available to the community in a reusable format.</p>
<p>DOIs (digital object identifiers) are unique and unchanging, just like the original arXiv ID number already assigned to every arXiv article. However, because DOIs are used across many different platforms, they enable greater interoperability with other services.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1165 size-full" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2022/02/DOI-Screen-Shot-v2.png" alt="arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite is 10.48550" width="251" height="144" />“Sure, the arXiv papers have had a persistent identifier for years, the arXiv identifier, and that&#8217;s a very good thing not only for citability. But with the assignment of DOIs, arXiv now becomes even more visible as an important element of the publication ecosystem,” said Dr. Irina Sens, Deputy Director and Head of Library Operations at the Technische Informationsbibliothek in Germany, which organizes arXiv’s largest member consortium. “The DataCite metadata schema enables connections to other persistent identifiers, for example researchers’ ORCIDs and institutional RORs, and other content like associated research data – and offers easy tracking of research outputs through simple user interfaces. That’s a huge step forward.”</p>
<h4>DOIs align with arXiv IDs</h4>
<p>An author can determine their article’s DOI by using the DOI prefix https://doi.org/10.48550/ followed by the arXiv ID (replacing the colon with a period). For example, the arXiv ID <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01037">arXiv:2202.01037</a> will translate to the DOI link <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037</a></p>
<p>Adopting DOIs helps arXiv meet the ‘<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’</a> that intend to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital material.</p>
<p>DOI registration of arXiv articles began on January 1, 2022 with <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, and arXiv will soon begin registering DOIs for the entire corpus. The process is expected to be complete for all records by the end of 2022.</p>

<h3>FAQ: DOIs with DataCite</h3>
<p>Starting in January 2022, arXiv began registering DOIs and submitting associated article metadata to <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> on behalf of (and at no cost to) arXiv authors. The first articles to receive DOIs are those with 2201.NNNNN identifiers, with all new articles receiving DOIs going forward. Following the successful launch, we will begin minting “arXiv DOIs” for the approximately 2M articles in arXiv’s corpus published between 1991 and 2021. The article abstract (/abs) pages are also now updated to display the arXiv DOIs following the registrations.</p>
<p><b>Why add DOIs when there are arXiv identifiers? Are arXiv identifiers going away?</b></p>
<p>The arXiv identifier has existed for more than 30 years; we will continue supporting it and you may use it in your citations as an alternative to the arXiv DOI. We are issuing DOIs for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Making article metadata available in <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/doi.org?query=client.uid%3Aarxiv.content">DataCite&#8217;s centralized location </a>allows research outputs to be more discoverable and harvestable.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Some funding agencies require DOIs for the research they are supporting.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Will I still be able to provide an external DOI and/or journal reference with my article?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we will continue to support the existing journal reference and DOI metadata fields for linking to versions of an article outside arXiv, and we strongly encourage authors to provide them when they become available.</p>
<p><b>When will the arXiv DOI for my new article become available?</b></p>
<p>If you have submitted an article from January 2022 onwards, we expect new articles to receive a DOI within 24 hours of them being announced on arXiv.</p>
<p><b>When will the arXiv DOI for my older (2021 and earlier) article become available?</b></p>
<p>We do not have an exact timeline for backfilling DOIs for older articles, but we will start with articles from 2021 and go back in time. We will periodically provide updates as we complete batches of registrations.</p>
<p><b>Where will the arXiv DOI for my article link to?</b></p>
<p>The arXiv DOI will link to the arXiv abstract (/abs) using the canonical form of the arXiv identifier, so it will always point to the latest version of the article, e.g. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.NNNNN → https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.NNNNN</p>
<p><b>What is arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite?</b></p>
<p>10.48550</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-anime-convention-nyc-superspreader-event">An anime convention in November was not an omicron superspreader event</a></h4>

              
                <p>A large anime fan convention held in New York City last November was not an omicron superspreading event despite cases of the highly contagious variant linked to the gathering, researchers report in two studies in the Feb. 18 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Vaccination and masking requirements, social distancing and improved ventilation at the event venue probably reduced transmission, the researchers say. The event also benefitted from timing, as it occurred at the very beginning of the city’s omicron wave when community transmission was low.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In early December, the Minnesota public health department sounded the alarm about <a href="https://animenyc.com/">Anime NYC</a>, a convention celebrating Japanese comics and cartoons that drew attendees from across the United States and 30 other countries. The state agency had identified that Peter McGinn, a Minnesota resident, had attended the event while infected with omicron.</p>





<p>This was only the second omicron case identified in the United States — and media reports labeled the 53,000-person convention <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/health/cdc-omicron-study-anime-convention-bn/index.html">as a potential superspreader</a> event when several of McGinn’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/world/omicron-anime-convention-nyc.html">friends, who had also attended the convention, tested positive</a>.</p>



<p>But two parallel investigations into the convention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a4.htm?s_cid=mm7107a4_w">failed to find any omicron transmission outside of this group</a>. Contact tracers interviewed McGinn as well as 22 of the 29 friends in his convention group and their household contacts. Meanwhile, a second group of researchers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a3.htm?s_cid=mm7107a3_w">used data from convention organizers to search state and local health databases</a> for positive coronavirus tests among event attendees. The search turned up 4,560 results, 119 (or 2.6 percent) of which were positive.</p>



<p>Among those 119 attendees, only 16 cases were tied to McGinn and his friends. Five of the 16 cases were sequenced, and all were identified as omicron. Outside of that cluster, 15 other sequenced cases were identified as delta.</p>





<p>Because fewer than 1 in 5 positive test specimens tied to the convention were sequenced, additional positive results could have been omicron, besides the five identified ones. But the event did not spur widespread omicron transmission, the researchers found; the test positivity rate among attendees was similar to the rate in New York City as a whole in the week after the convention, about 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s nice to confirm that the event wasn’t a spreader event,” McGinn said in an e-mail. “It makes me more comfortable in the future going to these types of events as long as mask and vax requirements are in place.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found that attendees who tested positive for any version of the coronavirus were more likely to have socialized outside the convention itself. For instance, 18.8 percent of positive attendees had attended karaoke venues in the city, compared with 2.4 percent of attendees who tested negative.</p>

<p>Omicron has spread readily at <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3158545/norway-christmas-party-largest-omicron-superspreader-outside">holiday parties</a>, <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/doctor-who-caught-omicron-at-super-spreader-event-says-pandemic-isnt-just-due-to-the-unvaccinated">weddings</a> and even <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/2/21-2422_article">between rooms in a hotel used for coronavirus quarantines</a>. The researchers attribute the lack of spread at the anime convention to layers of safety measures, including a vaccination requirement (at least one dose) for attendees, required masks and improved ventilation. The Javits Center, where the event took place, has installed HEPA air filters across the building, <a href="https://www.javitscenter.com/reopening-together">among other safety measures</a>; at previous points in the pandemic, it was used as a COVID-19 hospital and mass vaccination site.</p>



<p>But the new reports include limited detail about the impact that these filters had on actual air quality at the venue, says Krystal Pollitt, an epidemiologist and environmental health expert at Yale University. Without specific airflow measurements, she says, “it’s hard to know how much difference” the filters made.</p>



<p>Additionally, Anime NYC had “a fortunate coincidence” in its timing, says Ayman El-Mohandes, an epidemiologist and dean of the public health school at the City University of New York. Omicron was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a5.htm?s_cid=mm7103a5_w">first identified in New York City wastewater samples</a> on November 21, the final day of the convention — placing this event at the very beginning of the city’s outbreak, when community transmission was low.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had this same event happened two weeks later, it would’ve been disastrous,” El-Mohandes says. Future large events should add additional layers of safety measures, he says, such as requiring that attendees be fully vaccinated — not just one dose — and test negative prior to the event.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizard-tail-detach-fall-off-structure-micropillar-nanopore">How lizards keep detachable tails from falling off</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lizards are famous for losing their tails, but perhaps the bigger question should be: How do their tails stay on? The answer may lie in <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh1614?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D10961430194665737653988427142427029551%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1645113274&amp;_ga=2.77920528.527777432.1645022303-1147326194.1643224741">the appendage’s internal design</a>. A structure of prongs, micropillars and nanopores holds a lizard’s tail on tight enough to handle most jarring while remaining primed to drop the tail in case of emergency, researchers report in the Feb. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Self-amputation, or autotomy, of a limb is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">a common defense strategy</a> in the animal kingdom, including for many lizard species (<em>SN: 3/8/21</em>). But it’s a risky plan: A detachable limb brings with it increased risk of accidental loss from small bumps and snags. “It has to find the just right amount of attachment, so it doesn&#8217;t come off easily. But it should also come off whenever it&#8217;s needed,” says Yong-Ak Song, a bioengineer at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. “It’s a fine balance.”</p>



<p>A lizard’s tail consists of a series of segments that connect in a row like plugs into sockets. The tail can break off along any of these points, called fracture planes, depending on how much of the tail the lizard needs to sacrifice. Between each segment, the prongs — eight cone-shaped bundles of muscles arranged in a circle — fit neatly into corresponding sockets, consisting of relatively smooth walls. Each prong is in turn covered in a forest of protrusions, or micropillars, that resemble tiny mushrooms.</p>

<p>To uncover the function of this structure, Song and colleagues first amputated tails from three species of lizards with a gentle tug and then analyzed the broken appendages under a scanning electron microscope. Zooming in on the mushroom-like protuberances revealed that each one is pockmarked with holes, or nanopores.</p>

<p>The researchers also noticed slight imprints in the interior walls of the socket left behind by the prong’s micropillars, like fingers pressed lightly into clay. This came as a surprise: They expected that the micropillars would fully interlock within the socket, more like Velcro. Instead, the pockmarked micropillars weren’t providing any extra grip that would secure the tail to its owner.</p>



<p>Suspecting that the nanopore-speckled micropillars must play another role, the team built a replica lizard tail from polydimethylsiloxane, a rubbery, fleshlike material, to mimic the separation of tail from body. This allowed the researchers to examine the forces at work during a tail amputation. They found that the deep crevasses between micropillars, along with the smaller potholes on the micropillars’ surfaces, slow the spread of an initial fracture.</p>

<p>“If there&#8217;s a crack coming in and meets a pore, which is a void, then the crack is stopped, and then it loses energy to propagate,” Song says. In other words, the beginning of a fracture can be stopped in its tracks. Every indent and groove helps: The micropillars with nanopores enhanced adhesion 15 times more than smooth prongs without micropillars, and slightly more than micropillars without nanopores. The hierarchical structure of prong, pillar and pore achieves a balance that Song describes as a beautiful example of the Goldilocks principle: not too tight, not too loose.</p>



<p>This adaptation is important for lizards to optimize their survival. While autotomy helps keep a lizard from becoming lunch, it’s a costly defense mechanism that affects a lizard’s ability to run, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/measuring-leap-lizard">leap</a>, mate and escape future predators (<em>SN: 1/5/12</em>). So, it’s important that the lizard abandons its limb only when necessary.</p>



<p>This intricately designed system is a perfect example of how evolution can continually work on something to make it more effective, says Bill Bateman, a behavioral ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, who was not part of the research. “It just blows me away.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-lost-books-archaeology-statistics">A technique borrowed from ecology hints at hundreds of lost medieval legends</a></h4>

              
                <p>King Arthur’s lasting renown is one for the books. But a statistical spotlight now shines on medieval European literature’s round table of lost and forgotten stories.</p>



<p>An international team used a mathematical formula borrowed from ecology to estimate the extent to which medieval adventure and romance tales, and documents on which they were written, have been lost over the years. Only about 9 percent of these documents <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7655">may have survived till modern times</a>, the researchers found.</p>



<p>These findings indicate that simple statistical principles can be used to gauge losses of a range of past cultural items, such as specific types of stone tools or ancient coins, literature professor Mike Kestemont of the University of Antwerp in Belgium and his colleagues report in the Feb. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Their approach represents a simple but powerful tool for studying culture, says anthropologist Alex Bentley of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who did not participate in the study. “It’s like walking into an abandoned Amazon book warehouse decades later and estimating the total number of book titles based on the numbers of surviving single and double copies that you find.”</p>





<p>Much medieval European literature, which dates to between roughly the years 600 and 1450, has been lost, and many surviving manuscripts are fragmentary. Durable parchment documents were often recycled as small boxes or for other practical uses. That has left researchers unsure about whether surviving tales and documents are representative of what once existed.</p>



<p>Kestemont’s team turned to a formula developed by environmental statistician and study coauthor Anne Chao of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. Chao’s statistical technique accounts for species that go undetected by researchers in field surveys of biological diversity. More generally, her approach can be used to estimate the number of unobserved events of any type that accompany relatively frequent observed events of the same type.</p>



<p>So, for example, this formula might be used to estimate the number of undiscovered archaeological sites in an early state society where the biggest settlements have been easier to find than smaller ones.</p>

<p>In the new study, medieval literary stories from Europe were treated as species and surviving manuscript copies of those tales were treated as sightings of a species. Counts of literary works with either one copy or two copies — the equivalent of toting up species sighted either once or twice in a survey — enabled the researchers to estimate how many literary stories have been lost because none of the documents that preserved them have survived. This method also estimated how many documents originally existed for stories that have surviving manuscripts.</p>



<p>Kestemont’s group estimates that about 799 literary tales survive today out of what would have been an original total of around 1,170 stories, at least for the six languages that were studied. The 3,648 surviving written accounts of those tales come from an estimated original total of around 40,614 documents, the researchers say.</p>



<p>More than three-quarters of medieval literary stories in German, Irish and Icelandic have survived in at least one written document, the team suggests. That figure fell to about half for Dutch and French tales and around 38 percent for English works.</p>



<p>Handwritten versions of those medieval adventure and romance stories — often created by individuals in the general population who avidly consumed fictional literature — have fared poorly across the board. Survival rates of those documents range from an estimated 4.9 percent for English yarns to 19.2 percent for Irish tales, the researchers report.</p>



<p>Literary documents on the islands of Ireland and Iceland survived relatively well at least partly because there were enough written copies of different stories, the team says. That made it harder for disasters, such as library fires, to wipe out all copies of specific stories. In contrast, copies of many medieval French stories were rare and thus more susceptible to disappearing over time.</p>



<p>French-speaking Normans conquered England in 1066, which may have led to greater neglect and recycling of manuscripts written in English, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Chao’s method may help to unveil cultural diversity in past societies, Bentley says. For instance, approximately 7,000-year-old villages in part of Germany have yielded about 40 different pottery styles. An analysis of the number of styles found on one and two pots, respectively, could be used to estimate the total number of pottery styles that once circulated in that region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-einstein-foundation-berlin-award/">PLOS partners with Einstein Foundation Berlin on Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are delighted to announce a brand new partnership with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS is a <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">longtime advocate for quality in research</a>. However, like the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Berlin</a>, PLOS has always sought to ensure that the definition of quality is extended beyond more reductive measures &ndash; such as venue of publication and the Journal Impact Factor &ndash; to signals and behaviors that reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are well known for developing policies (e.g. our <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Availability Policy</a>), adopting standards (e.g. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/credit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRediT</a>), rolling out new features (e.g. <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protocols</a>), and encouraging behaviors (e.g. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preprinting</a>) that support a more rigorous open research ecosystem. But it is always a worthwhile reminder that these activities are never openness for openness&rsquo; sake, but are ways to enhance the <strong>quality </strong>and <strong>reliability </strong>of research, and, consequently, <strong><a href="https://plos.org/event/trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust</a> </strong>in research.</p>



<p>By establishing a global award to honor individual researchers, as well as collaborations, institutions, and organizations, Einstein Foundation Berlin is making an important statement that rigor, reliability, and transparency are to be recognized and rewarded as they directly influence increased quality in research.</p>



<p>We are excited to contribute to global awareness of this award, and encourage all interested parties to nominate and/or apply in the relevant categories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation award website</a> contains all the details, including the criteria, categories, eligibility, and a list of the jury and prior winners. The deadline for applications and nominations is <strong>April 30th, 2022</strong> at <strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>. Winners will be announced in December, 2022.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-creativity-art-computer-program">Artificial intelligence challenges what it means to be creative</a></h4>

              
                <p>When British artist Harold Cohen met his first computer in 1968, he wondered if the machine might help solve a mystery that had long puzzled him: How can we look at a drawing, a few little scribbles, and see a face? Five years later, he devised a robotic artist called <a href="http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html">AARON</a> to explore this idea. He equipped it with basic rules for painting and for how body parts are represented in portraiture — and then set it loose making art.</p>



<p>Not far behind was the composer <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/">David Cope</a>, who coined the phrase “musical intelligence” to describe his experiments with artificial intelligence–powered composition. Cope <a href="https://newatlas.com/creative-artificial-intelligence-computer-algorithmic-music/35764/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body">once told me</a> that as early as the 1960s, it seemed to him “perfectly logical to do creative things with algorithms” rather than to painstakingly draw by hand every word of a story, note of a musical composition or brush stroke of a painting. He initially tinkered with algorithms on paper, then in 1981 moved to computers to help solve a case of composer’s block.</p>

<p>Cohen and Cope were among a handful of eccentrics pushing computers to go against their nature as cold, calculating things. The still-nascent field of AI had its focus set squarely on solid concepts like reasoning and planning, or on tasks like playing chess and checkers or solving mathematical problems. Most AI researchers balked at the notion of creative machines.</p>



<p>Slowly, however, as Cohen and Cope cranked out a stream of academic papers and books about their work, a field emerged around them: computational creativity. It included the study and development of autonomous creative systems, interactive tools that support human creativity and mathematical approaches to modeling human creativity. In the late 1990s, computational creativity became a formalized area of study with a growing cohort of researchers and eventually its own <a href="https://jcc.computationalcreativity.net/">journal</a> and <a href="https://computationalcreativity.net">annual event</a>.</p>

<p>Soon enough — thanks to new techniques rooted in machine learning and artificial neural networks, in which connected computing nodes attempt to mirror the workings of the brain — creative AIs could absorb and internalize real-world data and identify patterns and rules that they could apply to their creations.</p>



<p>Computer scientist Simon Colton, then at Imperial College London and now at Queen Mary University of London and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent much of the 2000s building the <a href="http://www.thepaintingfool.com/">Painting Fool</a>. The computer program analyzed the text of news articles and other written works to determine the sentiment and extract keywords. It then combined that analysis with an automated search of the photography website Flickr to help it generate painterly collages in the mood of the original article. Later the Painting Fool learned to paint portraits in real time of people it met through an attached camera, again applying its “mood” to the style of the portrait (or in some cases refusing to paint anything because it was in a bad mood).</p>

<p>Similarly, in the early 2010s, computational creativity turned to gaming. AI researcher and game designer Michael Cook dedicated his Ph.D. thesis and early research associate work at Goldsmiths, University of London to creating <a href="https://gamesbyangelina.itch.io/">ANGELINA</a> — which made simple games based on news articles from <em>The Guardian</em>, combining current affairs text analysis with hard-coded design and programming techniques.</p>



<p>During this era, Colton says, AIs began to look like creative artists in their own right — incorporating elements of creativity such as intentionality, skill, appreciation and imagination. But what followed was a focus on mimicry, along with controversy over what it means to be creative.</p>



<p>New techniques that excelled at classifying data to high degrees of precision through repeated analysis helped AI master existing creative styles. AI could now create works like those of classical composers, famous painters, novelists and more.</p>



<p>One AI-authored painting modeled on thousands of portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx">sold</a> for $432,500 at auction. In another case, study participants struggled <a href="https://www.donyaquick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dissertation.pdf">to differentiate the musical phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach from those</a> created by <a href="https://www.donyaquick.com/kulitta/">a computer program called Kulitta</a> that had been trained on Bach’s compositions. Even IBM got in on the fun, tasking its Watson AI system with <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/how-ibm-chef-watson-works">analyzing 9,000 recipes</a> to devise its own cuisine ideas.</p>



<p>But many in the field, as well as onlookers, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-and-creativity/">wondered if these AIs really showed creativity</a>. Though sophisticated in their mimicry, these creative AIs seemed incapable of true innovation because they lacked the capacity to incorporate new influences from their environment. Colton and a colleague described them as <a href="http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc20/papers/164-iccc20.pdf">requiring “much human intervention, supervision, and highly technical knowledge”</a> in producing creative results. Overall, as composer and computer music researcher Palle Dahlstedt puts it, these AIs converged toward the mean, creating something typical of what is already out there, whereas creativity is supposed to diverge away from the typical.</p>





<p>In order to make the step to true creativity, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/abs/big-data-and-creativity/E604C40A897436521970E110F8E1FBBA">Dahlstedt suggested</a>, AI “would have to model the causes of the music, the conditions for its coming into being — not the results.”</p>



<p>True creativity is a quest for originality. It is a recombination of disparate ideas in new ways. It is unexpected solutions. It might be music or painting or dance, but also the flash of inspiration that helps lead to advances on the order of light bulbs and airplanes and the periodic table. In the view of many in the computational creativity field, it is not yet attainable by machines.</p>



<p>In just the past few years, creative AIs have expanded into style invention — into authorship that is individualized rather than imitative and that projects meaning and intentionality, even if none exists. For Colton, this element of intentionality — a focus on the process, more so than the final output — is key to achieving creativity. But <a href="https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/simon-colton/">he wonders</a> whether meaning and authenticity are also essential, as the same poem could lead to vastly different interpretations if the reader knows it was written by a man versus a woman versus a machine.</p>



<p>If an AI lacks the self-awareness to reflect on its actions and experiences, and to communicate its creative intent, then is it truly creative? Or is the creativity still with the author who fed it data and directed it to act?</p>



<p>Ultimately, moving from an attempt at thinking machines to an attempt at creative machines may transform our understanding of ourselves. Seventy years ago Alan Turing — sometimes described as the father of artificial intelligence — devised a test he called “the imitation game” to measure a machine’s intelligence against our own. “Turing’s greatest insight,” <a href="https://core.ac.uk/display/326027014">writes</a> philosopher of technology Joel Parthemore of the University of Skövde in Sweden, “lie in seeing digital computers as a mirror by which the human mind could consider itself in ways that previously were not possible.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p><em>We all know a chronic apologiser (maybe you are one).</em> So begins a fascinating <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211065286">new paper</a> that explores how we judge frequent vs rare apologisers — and how this affects the way that we react to their apologies.</p>



<p>An abundance of work has shown that an apology for bad behaviour makes a big difference to the recipient. “Indeed, some scholars even imbue apologies with transformative and miraculous healing qualities,” note Karina Schumann at the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. However, most research in this field has explored the impact of apologies in isolation. This takes no account of a person’s general tendency to apologise. But as we all know, some people apologise readily and frequently, while others don&#8217;t.</p>



<span id="more-45403"></span>



<p>To explore how people judge frequent and infrequent apologisers, the team focused on perceptions of &#8220;communion&#8221; and &#8220;agency&#8221;. Someone high in communion strives for harmony in relationships; they show warmth and a sense of morality, and a care for the interests of others. Agency is more about the individual. A high-agency person is in control of their life; they are seen as being more dominant, powerful, competent and autonomous.</p>



<p>In an initial online study, 406 adults read one of two stories about a fictional character’s typical week. Both stories featured 12 &#8220;apology situations&#8221;, which were set at work, in a restaurant, with a friend, and so on. In six of these situations, the character had done something that clearly warranted an apology; in the other six, while an apology wasn’t unreasonable, it wasn’t necessary (apologising after interrupting the boss’s workday to ask a question, for example).</p>



<p>In one version of the story, the character apologised in all 12 instances. In the other, they didn’t apologise at all. And the results were clear: the frequent apologiser was judged to be more communal but less agentic than the non-apologiser. Frequent apologising entailed a trade-off, then — but as communion is more important for judgements of what someone else is &#8220;like&#8221;, it could be worth giving up some perceived agency to get a communion boost.</p>



<p>In a second online study, 300 people who had been in a romantic relationship for at least six months reported on how frequently their partner apologised, and also how sincere and considered their partner’s apologies tended to be. Then they rated their partners for communion and agency. As in the first study, frequent apologisers were seen as being more communal. But this time, they were only rated as being lower in agency <em>if </em>their apologies were typically poor.</p>



<p>Why do frequent but good apologisers avoid taking a hit to their perceived agency? Although accepting a personal wrongdoing carries a cost, giving an excellent, thoughtful apology could also signal that you are skilled at interacting with others — and so competent and in control. Together, these two findings suggest that people should bear in mind both the frequency and quality of their apologies, the researchers note.</p>



<p>The second study also had another component: the participants were asked to imagine that their partner had ridiculed their personal beliefs about a sensitive topic behind their back to a group of friends. They then received one of three fictional responses from their partner. One was unapologetic (&#8220;It was no big deal&#8221;). Another contained a weak apology (&#8220;I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to&#8221;). In the third, the apology was thoughtful, extensive and expressed sincere regret. The team found that, as might be expected, the high-quality apologies were received best: they resulted in higher scores for feelings of being cared for and for relationship satisfaction. However, a weak apology from a partner who routinely gave strong apologies wasn’t received as badly as the same apology from a partner who was typically bad at apologising. So someone who is generally good at apologising may get the odd free pass.</p>



<p>One notable additional finding from the studies was that whether the apologiser was male or female made no difference to the communion and agency ratings that they received. “Recent media reports suggest that women should refrain from apologising frequently because it undermines their competence,” the team observes. However, this new work suggests that men and women are equally affected in this way. Still, as they also note, &#8220;typical women&#8221; are judged to be higher in communion and lower in agency than men. So a woman who apologises often might take more of an agency &#8220;hit&#8221; than a man who does the same. This could be more of an issue in the workplace, perhaps — and this clearly needs investigating. It would also be interesting to know how we judge people who apologise for all kinds of things that aren’t their fault — such as when someone else bumps into them in the street.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that few people either apologise all the time or never, as in the first study. And the fictional misdeed in the second study was pretty serious. So the team’s findings might not apply in most everyday scenarios. Still, they feel that the key takeaway message is this: “Apologizing frequently… seems to be beneficial on the whole, and the observed cost to agency appears to be avoidable if one consistently crafts high-quality apologies.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunlight-oil-spills-clean-up-ocean-solar-radiation-deepwater-horizon">Sunlight helps clean up oil spills in the ocean more than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sunlight may have helped remove as much as 17 percent of the oil slicking the surface of the Gulf of Mexico following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. That means that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl7605">sunlight plays a bigger role</a> in cleaning up such spills than previously thought, researchers suggest February 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>When sunlight shines on spilled oil in the sea, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunshine-making-deepwater-horizon-oil-stick-around">can kick off a chain of chemical reactions</a>, transforming the oil into new compounds (<em>SN: 6/12/18</em>). Some of these reactions can increase how easily the oil dissolves in water, called photodissolution. But there has been little data on how much of the oil becomes water-soluble.</p>



<p>To assess this, environmental chemists Danielle Haas Freeman and Collin Ward, both of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, placed samples of the Macondo oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill on glass disks and irradiated them with light using LEDs that emit wavelengths found in sunlight. The duo then chemically analyzed the irradiated oil to see how much was transformed into dissolved organic carbon.</p>



<p>The most important factors in photodissolution, the researchers found, were the thickness of the slick and the wavelengths of light. Longer wavelengths (toward the red end of the spectrum) dissolved less oil, possibly because they are more easily scattered by water, than shorter wavelengths. How long the oil was exposed to light was not as important.</p>



<p>Though the team didn’t specifically test for seasonal or latitude differences, computer simulations based on the lab data suggested that those factors, as well as the oil’s chemical makeup, also matter.</p>



<p>The researchers estimate irradiation helped dissolve from 3 to 17 percent of surface oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, comparable to processes such as evaporation and stranding on coastlines. What impact the sunlight-produced compounds might have on marine ecosystems, however, isn’t yet known.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent BMC article “<a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01505-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Seek COVER: using a disease proxy to rapidly develop and validate a personalized risk calculator for COVID-19 outcomes in an international network</a>” introduces a novel approach to this challenge, the use of Influenza data. There was substantial existing data on outcomes from influenza at the beginning of the pandemic. With SARS-CoV-2 also being a respiratory pathogen, could there be insights from influenza cases that would prove useful for COVID-19?</p>
<p>The study by Williams and co-authors uses an eclectic combination of claims and clinical databases from multiple countries collected from 2006-2020. Over 7 million primarily outpatient influenza cases were assembled in a common dataset. It is recognized that the quality and consistency of these electronic data is very variable. Some of the databases used lacked any variables except age and sex whilst others did not consistently record outcomes.</p>
<p>The cases selected for initial model development, however, were a random selection of 150,000 cases drawn from 2,082,077 adult outpatients with a new influenza diagnosis and a follow up of 365 days. A smaller cohort of 44,507 patients treated from January 1 to April 27 of 2020 with a diagnostic code for COVID-19 were used for one of multiple external validations.</p>
<p>The modeling effort began as a data driven regression effort resulting in 31,917 potential predictors. Acknowledging the complexity of using a model with so many predictors the investigators had clinicians examine the distribution of variables for cases with and without the three outcomes they sought to predict. These were being hospitalized with pneumonia (COVER-H), being hospitalized with pneumonia and requiring intensive care services or dying (COVER-I) or death within 30 days after initial diagnosis regardless of the intensity of treatment (COVER-F). The reduced regression models still had hundreds of predictors. So, two simplified models were created. One had age and sex, whilst the other combined age and sex with seven common co-morbid conditions such as cancer or heart disease. The latter was converted into an easy-to-use calculator for the probability of outcomes.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this extraordinary compilation of cases and ambitious modeling efforts?  First the results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is much more dangerous than Influenza. When the COVER modeling efforts were validated, discrimination varied greatly across datasets and countries, and most models were not well calibrated. This was true with their COVID-19 database, and especially within the one dataset containing hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>An editorial by Peterson, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30577-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">COVID-19 is Not Influenza</a>”, discussed the comparison of nearly 90,000 confirmed COVID-19 patients to approximately 45,000 with influenza. They found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30527-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">dramatic differences</a> in outcomes with COVID-19 being substantially more lethal.  As the COVER authors acknowledge this means their models would need to be re-calibrated by country for the increased risk that COVID-19 presents over contracting influenza.</p>
<p>Second, the well acknowledged major vulnerabilities of age and existing comorbidities that are prominent in most COVID-19 models were also identified as important risk factors in COVER. In the well-received <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3731?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">QCOVID 1 model</a> based on the U.K.’s QResearch 10.5 million population registry, age and co-morbid conditions along with a measure of economic deprivation produced accurate risk stratification for the likelihood of catching COVID-19 and then having a severe outcome (hospital admission or death) in the initial two stages of the pandemic within that country.</p>
<p>Both models also illustrate that when a very large outpatient (COVER) or population-based registry (QCOVID 1) are used for modeling, the absolute risk of severe outcomes for an individual is low. The COVER models frequently produce probabilities of serious complications between 0.01%-1%. QCOVID 1 model risk levels for contracting COVID-19 and then having a severe outcome are higher, 0.1-2%. Unfortunately, as has been tragically demonstrated, when even these small risks occur in hundreds of millions of people, hospitalizations and deaths also number in the millions.</p>
<p>The developers of the COVER models emphasize that their overall goal was to illustrate a methods development process as opposed to a model for immediate clinical impact. At the beginning of the pandemic this was an appropriate effort. They should be commended for assembling a very large common dataset, for convening a worldwide collection of investigators, and creating a clinically plausible influenza model.</p>
<p>But a large well-maintained population data registry like QResearch and modeling conducted by an established New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) in the U.K. describe an alternative approach. We may be coming to the realization that replicating these two resources now in other countries could be the most appropriate response to this pandemic, and a path to being much better prepared for the next one.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudge-theory-behavioral-science-psychology-structural-change">Nudge theory’s popularity may block insights into improving society</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine removing a branch of the U.S. government, say the Supreme Court. What are the myriad ways that such an upheaval might reshape people’s lives?</p>



<p>Policy makers and researchers probably would want to have an idea of what those effects might be before erasing the highest court in the land. But “you can’t test deep structural changes like that in an experiment” first, says behavioral decision–making expert David Gal of the University of Illinois Chicago.</p>

<p>Likewise, less wildly hypothetical but perhaps still far-reaching changes to society, such as expanding Social Security or providing universal parental leave, can’t be tested with conventional experiments that include control and experimental groups. As a result, many behavioral scientists today have instead turned to researching “nudges” — smaller interventions that operate within existing policies. Nudges can influence human behavior, research suggests, and can be readily tested using experiments before being applied.</p>



<p>But this recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00002-2">overreliance on nudges has stifled broader behavioral science research</a> and insights into how to create a better society, Gal and marketing expert Derek Rucker of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., contend January 12 in a commentary in <em>Nature Reviews Psychology</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Nudges exploded in popularity in 2008 when economist Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago and law professor Cass Sunstein of Harvard University published a book on the topic. That research <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/richard-thaler-nobel-economic-sciences">netted Thaler a Nobel Prize</a> in Economic Sciences and inspired governments worldwide to set up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudging-people-make-good-choices-can-backfire">nudge units</a> to modify or create public policies (<em>SN: 10/9/17</em>; <em>SN:</em><em> 3/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>Examples of nudges include offering small cash rewards to encourage people to get a new vaccine or sending text reminders about a looming deadline. For instance, researchers recently revamped a court summons form and sent text reminders to get more people to attend mandatory court appointments in New York City. The intervention <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudge-behavior-easy-interventions-help-people-show-up-court">increased court attendance</a> by roughly 20 percent over previous years, the researchers estimate (<em>SN: 10/08/20</em>).</p>





<p>But such nudges ignore thornier societal problems, such as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abc2495">over-policing in low-income neighborhoods</a> where these summons are typically issued, lawyer and sociologist Issa Kohler-Hausmann of Yale University wrote in a perspective piece that accompanied the research.</p>



<p>“Changing the approach to penal and welfare policy in our country will require interventions that are much more radical than cost-neutral behavioral nudges that everyone can agree on,” Kohler-Hausmann wrote.</p>



<p>Policy makers love nudges, Gal argues. “They don’t have to change anything fundamental.”</p>

<p>As for behavioral scientists, Gal and Rucker attribute nudges’ popularity to the scientists’ desire to mimic the precision of researchers in other fields. Medical researchers, for instance, can test pharmaceutical drugs using randomized controlled trials. With that scientific gold standard, researchers compare outcomes among patients receiving the drugs versus a placebo. Nudge researchers can likewise generate a small change — the drug — and compare outcomes among those who experience the change with those who do not.</p>



<p>“We value experiments because they give us statistically precise estimates,” Gal says.</p>



<p>But nudges that work in academic studies often fail in the real world, the authors note. One analysis of 74 nudge experiments involving roughly half a million participants showed that nudges increased the desired behavior by an average of 8.7 percentage points, researchers reported in a 2020 working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research. But an analysis of of 243 real-world studies of nudges affecting over 23 million people showed that nudges increased the desired behavior by an average of just <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27594/w27594.pdf">1.4 percentage points</a>.</p>



<p>Rather than chasing statistical precision, Gal would like to see behavioral scientists generate overarching theories that apply beyond a single narrow context. For instance, in the U.S. legal system, juries must reach a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant. But research into conformity suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/children-may-be-especially-vulnerable-peer-pressure-robots">people copy others</a> as a result of social pressure (<em>SN: </em><em>8/15/18</em>). Unlike nudges, that research can generate insights into how human behavior interfaces with existing practices, Gal says, and raise crucial questions. In this case, is the push for unanimity preventing jurors from raising valid concerns during deliberations? “Even one dissenter can really reshape the debate and stop this tendency toward conformity,” Gal says.</p>



<p>There’s room for both theoretical and applied behavioral scientists in the field, counters data scientist Kevin Wilson of the Policy Lab, a policy research institute at Brown University in Providence, R.I. “We need people who think about theory, who are really synthesizing these lessons and, as they put it, extrapolating insights. But we also need people who are going to … utilize these insights.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, nudges are hogging all the attention, Kohler-Hausmann says. Like policy makers, funding agencies and research journal editors seem to prefer the quantifiable results that nudges offer, she says, and that near singular focus has hindered transformational change. “The cost of a narrowly defined intervention is ruling out the study of more compound, complex interventions.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Stavros Anagnou will talk about a paper
&quot;Spurious Normativity Enhances Learning of Compliance and Enforcement Behavior
in Artificial Agents&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>How do societies learn and maintain social norms? Here we use multiagent
reinforcement learning to investigate the learning dynamics of enforcement and
compliance behaviors. Artificial agents populate a foraging environment and
need to learn to avoid a poisonous berry. Agents learn to avoid eating
poisonous berries better when doing so is taboo, meaning the behavior is
punished by other agents. The taboo helps overcome a credit assignment problem
in discovering delayed health effects. Critically, introducing an additional
taboo, which results in punishment for eating a harmless berry, further
improves overall returns. This &quot;silly rule&quot; counterintuitively has a positive
effect because it gives agents more practice in learning rule enforcement. By
probing what individual agents have learned, we demonstrate that normative
behavior relies on a sequence of learned skills. Learning rule compliance
builds upon prior learning of rule enforcement by other agents. Our results
highlight the benefit of employing a multiagent reinforcement learning
computational model focused on learning to implement complex actions.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Therapeutic interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy or dialectical behavioural therapy often focus on the development of skills, such as ways to identify and actively challenge particular patterns of thought, feeling or behaviour. Indeed, research into CBT has found that the development of such skills can lead to fewer and less distressing symptoms and a reduced risk of relapse.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.23302">new study</a> looks at what happens when these interventions are explicitly framed around our strengths or weaknesses. Writing in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>, the team from Ohio State University finds that focusing on skills that are particular strengths can help people recover from sad moods faster.</p>



<span id="more-45383"></span>



<p>Participants first answered questions about their cognitive behavioural skills and were told they would receive feedback on their strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<p>They were then told they had been assigned a useful skill to learn about and were encouraged to write notes on how it could be used in daily life. In one condition, participants read about cognitive reappraisal — identifying and reevaluating negative thoughts — while in the other they read about mindfulness — awareness and acceptance of one’s thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, some participants were told they had been assigned the skill as it was their strongest skill based on initial measures, while others were told it was their weakest.</p>



<p>After rating their mood, participants took part in a mood induction procedure, imagining someone they cared about dying and reflecting on how it made them feel, while listening to a piece of moving classical music. Immediately after this procedure, they were told use their assigned skill to regulate their emotions, while repeatedly indicating how they felt. Finally, they reported how useful they thought the skill would be.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering the subject matter, mood indeed dropped during the mood induction: 81% of participants felt worse immediately after the task. However, as participants utilised their skills their mood improved, with 25% returning to their initial mood. Importantly, participants who had read that their skill was a strength of theirs tended to show a more rapid mood recovery than those who had read it was a weakness, suggesting that this framing had an impact on the success of the skill.</p>



<p>Future research could explore why a focus on particular individual strengths leads to a faster recovery of mood — participants didn’t <em>expect </em>a focus on strengths to be any more effective than a focus on weakness, suggesting that the result wasn’t simply due to participants’ expectations. It’s also important to note that the effects were small. Further research would also need to include people with a diagnosis of anxiety or depression and look at effects over a longer period of time. Adding in a neutral condition, where skills are framed neither around strengths nor weakness, could also provide insight. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/15/arxiv-adds-new-logo-to-the-website/">arXiv adds new logo to the website</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are pleased to share the news that arXiv recently added its new logo to the website.</p>
<p>This new logo began its incremental rollout in 2021 in our communications documents, 30th anniversary materials, and other channels. That process continues in 2022 with the rollout of the new logo on the website. Though in one light it is a small change, it is also major a milestone for protecting arXiv&#8217;s identity and we are pretty excited.</p>
<h3>Why change the logo?</h3>
<p>arXiv’s long-time logo was found, through a legal review in 2020, to have no legal defensibility. In order to protect arXiv’s unique and incredible service we needed a legally defensible identity. Starting in 2020, and involving a diverse team of researchers and design experts, we completed a branding process culminating in a new logo.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-948 aligncenter" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png" alt="arXiv's logo" width="217" height="98" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png 1024w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-768x346.png 768w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></p>
<p>arXiv&#8217;s new logo embodies our core identity, with the two arms of the arXiv chi intertwine into a united symbol of <b>arXiv as a place of connection</b> and a hub of the research ecosystem. Our mark, vetted and approved by Cornell University, achieves the <b>legibility, memorability, and legal defensibility</b> arXiv needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We are excited about the meaning and hard work behind the new logo, and to share it with the community on a platform as important as the arXiv website.</p>
<h3>What is next?</h3>
<p>arXiv has more design goals for the website, including making it fully accessible, increased usability for mobile, and improved efficiency for submitters and readers alike. We will continue to listen to our communities and learn what will make arXiv a more useful tool. We welcome and value your experience, and invite you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing">join the arXiv user testing group here</a> if you would like to take part in future surveys or rounds of feedback.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-water-publishes-first-papers/">PLOS Water publishes first papers</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS published the following press release on February 15, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that <em>PLOS Water</em> has published its initial cohort of papers. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to connect researchers across the hydrology, water resources, and water, sanitation and hygiene communities, amplifying a diverse set of voices to influence the global discourse around water. The journal has so far received more than 60 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a vitally important area of research. While the amount of water on earth is essentially fixed, demand for water continues to rise with population growth and increasing living standards,&rdquo; said Jenna Davis, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Water</em>. &ldquo;It has never been more important to connect scholars and practitioners working to close the gap in access to water and sanitation services with those focused on managing freshwater resources in a changing climate.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are confident that our broad scope will integrate water sciences and water practices, bringing together in one place research of the highest methodological and ethical standards, from all continents and global regions,&rdquo; said Pierre Horwitz, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Water</em>.</p>



<p>PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and <em>PLOS Water</em> now joins these journals with papers ready for publication. The journal is underpinned by PLOS&rsquo; new<a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/"> </a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a> designed to remove financial barriers for researchers and institutions across all geographies and funding backgrounds to participate in Open Access and Open Science at PLOS. PLOS is partnering with institutions in this modelto provide unlimited publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is based on each institution&rsquo;s historical research output in the field and is reflective of their regional economy according to their country&rsquo;s World Bank lending tier. PLOS&rsquo; existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our journal&rsquo;s Open Science policies will help establish preprinting and sharing of data and code in water research communities. Early, unrestricted access to vetted data and papers will empower researchers, local and Indigenous communities, water professionals, and organizations from across the globe to take evidence-based action to address some of the most pressing issues our planet faces,&rdquo; said Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS.</p>



<p>The current Editorial Board is comprised of more than 70 Academic Editors and 19 Section Editors representing more than 32 countries. Submissions have been received from researchers in Chile, Uganda, Switzerland, Australia, Eswatini, the US, and 10 other countries, marking the global reach of <em>PLOS Water</em>.</p>
