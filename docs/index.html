<p>U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch appears to have borrowed material from multiple authors in his 2006 book, according to a new analysis by Politico. This week, U.S. lawmakers are going head-to-head over the nomination of Gorsuch to the highest court in the land. Although the book is only one snippet of Gorsuch’s vast portfolio […]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, USA, 5 March 2017– </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s leading marketplace for outsourced research and development, today announced a strategic partnership with </span><a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (YC). YC-backed companies will now have exclusive access to the Science Exchange-powered YC marketplace, where they can instantly order experimental services from a network of over 2,500 qualified scientific service providers, all with pre-established contracts that protect companies’ IP and confidentiality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC, best known for its investments in tech giants including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe, began investing in life sciences companies in 2014 as the need and opportunity to fund early stage companies in this space became increasingly apparent. The Science Exchange partnership addresses the unique needs of these R&amp;D-focused companies, enabling them to compete on an equal footing with Science Exchange’s established global pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients by readily accessing the expertise and infrastructure housed in the Science Exchange network of service providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Science Exchange marketplace will help YC companies:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><span style="color: #338dc8;">Expand access to qualified service providers.</span><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life science and biotech entrepreneurs must balance the need to access new, innovative service providers with the time-consuming process required to vet each potential service provider for quality and capability. Science Exchange streamlines this process with a network of over 2,500 service providers that have been pre-qualified through a stringent, ISO 9001-certified evaluation process that includes metrics tied to performance on past projects. Science Exchange additionally supports researchers with an expert Sourcing Team that can recommend the best service providers for each scope of work, further minimizing the risks inherent in outsourcing.<p></p>
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #338dc8;"><b>Eliminate administrative overhead.</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Each service provider relationship typically requires a standalone contract that may take months to negotiate and implement. Under the partnership, all service providers on the YC-Science Exchange network are available under a single contract that protects IP and confidentiality.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange also eliminates the need for YC-funded companies to conduct costly and time-consuming regulatory audits of service providers. Science Exchange’s in-house audit team conducts on-site inspections of service providers and facilities to ensure regulatory compliance, ensuring that contracted service providers possess necessary certifications, licenses, informed consent of subjects, and data security.<p></p>
<p></p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><span style="color: #338dc8;">Save money.</span><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Science Exchange-powered YC marketplace enables companies to quickly identify cost-competitive options and provides access to special offers exclusive to YC-funded companies.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC is the latest organization to choose to partner with Science Exchange, and joins over 30 enterprise clients using Science Exchange-powered marketplaces to manage their outsourced R&amp;D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the last decade, the landscape for biotech firms has changed dramatically,” said Michael Seibel, CEO of Y Combinator. “Bringing a drug to market, which once took millions of dollars and several years of work because of infrastructure costs involved in building a lab, can now happen in a fraction of the time and funding required because of the ability to outsource R&amp;D. YC invested in Science Exchange years ago because we saw the promise of what they were doing to help companies innovate faster, get important products to market quickly, and reduce the friction inherent in starting a business. Now we are excited to offer these benefits to our companies who have brilliant ideas and are meeting urgent market demands, but need the administrative and cost barriers removed so they can focus on their innovations.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Science Exchange platform solves the challenge of R&amp;D outsourcing: we provide scientists with efficient access to a network of highly qualified service providers,” said Dr. Elizabeth Iorns, Founder &amp; CEO of Science Exchange. “We believe, like Y Combinator, that key to advancing groundbreaking research is eliminating the barriers to innovation, and we are thrilled to help YC-funded companies bring potentially life-saving products to market faster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="color: #338dc8;"><b>About Science Exchange</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p>A high-profile pediatric oncologist quietly left his former institution in 2015 after it concluded his clinical trials had been affected by significant “administrative problems.” But now the results of the university’s investigations and what followed have become public, after a paper in Belgium published a series of news reports last month. We’re still hazy on some details […]</p>

<p>Biologists have their fruit flies and rats, psychologists have students. An overwhelming amount of behavioral science is conducted with young people at universities on the assumption that it’s safe to generalise from this species of human to people more generally. There are some common-sense reasons for thinking this might be a problem and also some more specific issues, which we’ve documented before, such as that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/06/10/how-burnt-out-students-could-be-skewing-psychology-research/">burnt out students could be skewing the findings</a>.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168354">recent study</a> in <em>PLOS One</em> shows that the ways students differ from the public is different depending on which country you’re in, meaning it’s extra complicated to figure out if and when it’s appropriate to extrapolate student-based findings to people as a whole.</p>
<p><span id="more-22127"></span></p>
<p>The researchers Paul Hanel and Katia Vione at Cardiff University used data collected from over 86,000 people (including 6,352 students) in 59 countries as part of the World Values Survey.  They wanted to see if students differed from the general population on various measures, such as personality and trust in strangers, and if so, whether this was fairly constant across countries or varied according to whether a country was more individualistic or collectivist (either of which would make it easier to anticipate and account any for student-public differences when conducting research).</p>
<p>The researchers indeed found some notable differences between students and the general public, but perplexingly these differences often varied between countries and they weren’t explained by the key country characteristic of being individualistic vs. collectivist.</p>
<p>For instance, in Colombia students tended to score higher on Conscientiousness than the public, but in Brazil, the reverse was true. On the trait of Openness to Experience, students in China scored higher than the public, but in Pakistan students scored lower. The picture was similarly complex with people’s personal values and attitudes. For example, in New Zealand students showed heightened respect for the elderly compared with the public, but in Australia the opposite was found.</p>
<p>Hanel and Vione said their results “further support the claim that generalizing from students to the general public within personal and social psychology is problematic, at least while we do not know what predicts those differences.”</p>
<p>These new findings are somewhat disconcerting, but studies of this kind are also very welcome given that psychology’s dependence on student samples is unlikely to end any time soon. Crucially, the more we know about how students tend to differ from the public, the better placed we will be to interpret new student-based findings in an informed and considered way.</p>

I've since discovered additional problems with this journal.

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxvi-is-optimization-a-good-metaphor-of-evolution/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXVI) Is optimization a good metaphor of evolution?</a></h4>

<p>Is the brain the result of optimization, and if so, what is the optimization criterion? The popular argument in favor of the optimization view goes as follows. The brain is the result of Darwinian evolution, and therefore is optimally adapted to its environment, ensuring maximum survival and reproduction rates. In this view, to understand the brain is primarily to understand what “adapted” means for a brain, that is, what is the criterion to be optimized.</p>
<p>Previously, <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxiii-on-optimality-principles-in-neuroscience/">I have pointed out a few difficulties in optimality arguments</a> used in neuroscience, in particular the problem of specification (what is being optimized) and the fact that evolution is a history-dependent process, unlike a global optimization procedure. An example of this history dependence is the fascinating case of <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/feed/mitochondria">mitochondria</a>. Mitochondria are organelles in all eukaryotes cells that produce most of the cellular energy in the form of ATP. At this date, the main view is that these organelles are a case of symbiosis: mitochondria were once prokaryote cells that have been captured and farmed. This symbiosis has been selected and conserved through evolution, but optimization does not seem to be the most appropriate metaphor in this case.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the optimization metaphor can be useful when applied to circumscribed problems that a biological organism might face, for example the energy consumption of action potential propagation. We can claim for example that, everything else being equal, an efficient axon is better than an inefficient one (with the caveat that in practice, not everything else can be made equal). But when applied at the scale of an entire organism, the optimization metaphor starts facing more serious difficulties, which I will discuss now.</p>
<p>When considering an entire organism, or perhaps an organ like the brain, then what criterion can we possibly choose? Recently, I started reading “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guitar-Zero-Musician-Science-Learning/dp/B006ZGO09U">Guitar Zero</a>” by Gary Marcus. The author points out that learning music is difficult, and argues that the brain has evolved for language, not music. This statement is deeply problematic. What does it mean that the brain has evolved <em>for</em> language? Language does not preexist to speakers, so it cannot be that language was an evolutionary (“optimization”) criterion for the brain, unless we have a more religious view of evolution. Rather, evolutionary change can create opportunities, which might be beneficial for the survival of the species, but there is no predetermined optimization criterion.</p>
<p>Another example is the color visual system of bees (see for example <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~kathleea/colour/docs/Ways%20of%20Colouring.pdf">Ways of coloring</a> by Thompson et al.). A case can be made that the visual system of bees is adapted to the color of flowers they are interested in. But conversely, the color of flowers is adapted to the visual system of bees. This is a case of co-evolution, where the “optimization criterion” changes during the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Thus, the optimization criterion does not preexist to the optimization process, and this makes the optimization metaphor weak.</p>
<p>A possible objection is that there is a preexisting optimization criterion, which is survival or reproduction rate. While this might be correct, it makes the optimization metaphor not very useful. In particular, it applies equally to all living species. The point is, there are species and they are different even though the optimization criterion is the same. Not all have a brain. Thus, optimization does not explain why we have a brain. Species that have a brain have different brains. The nervous system of a nematode is not the same as that of a human, even though they are all equally well adapted, and have evolved for exactly the same amount of time. Therefore, the optimization view does not explain why we speak and nematodes don’t, for example.</p>
<p>The problem is that “fitness” is a completely contextual notion, which depends both on the environment and on the species itself. In a previous post where I discussed an <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/outline-of-an-existentialist-theory-of-evolution/">“existentialist” view of evolution</a>, I proposed the following thought experiment. Imagine a very ancient Earth with a bunch of living organisms that do not reproduce but can survive for an indefinite amount of time. By definition, they are adapted since they exist. Then at some point, an accident occurs such that one organism starts multiplying. It multiplies until it occupies the entire Earth and resources become scarce. At this point of saturation, organisms start dying. The probability of dying being the same for both non-reproducing organisms and reproducing ones, at some point there will be only reproducing organisms. Thus in this new environment, reproducing organisms are adapted, whereas non-reproducing ones are not. If we look at the history of evolution, we note that the world of species constantly changes. Species do not appear to converge to some optimal state, because as they evolve, the environment changes and so does the notion of fitness.</p>
<p>In summary, the optimization criterion does not preexist to the optimization process, unless we consider a broad existentialist criterion such as survival, but then the optimization metaphor loses its usefulness.</p>

<p>In this era of “fake news” and rising populism, encountering conspiracy theories is becoming a daily phenomenon. Some people usually shrug them off – they find them too simplistic, biased or far-fetched – but others are taken in. And if a person believes one kind of conspiracy theory, they usually believe others.</p>
<p>Psychologists are very interested in why some people are more inclined to believe in conspiracy theories, especially since the consequences can be harmful: for example, by avoiding getting their kids vaccinated, believers in vaccination conspiracies can harm wider public health; in other cases, a belief in a conspiracy against one’s own ethnic or religious group can foment radicalism.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between conspiracy believers and nonbelievers that’s cropped up in multiple studies is that nonbelievers tend to be more highly educated. For a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3301/abstract?campaign=woletoc">new study</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, Jan-Willem Van Prooijen at VU Amsterdam has conducted two large surveys to try to dig into just what it is about being more educated that seems to inoculate against belief in conspiracy.</p>
<p><span id="more-22052"></span></p>
<p>For the first survey, Van Prooijen recruited over 4000 readers of a popular science journal in the Netherlands, with an average age of 32. He asked them about their formal education level and their belief in various well-known conspiracy theories, such as that the moon landings were hoax; he tested their feelings of powerlessness; their subjective sense of their social class (they located their position on a social ladder); and their belief in simple solutions, such as that “most problems in society are easy to solve”.</p>
<p>The more highly educated a participant, the less likely they were to endorse the conspiracy theories. Importantly, several of the other measures were linked to education and contributed to the association between education and less belief in conspiracy: feeling less powerlessness (or more in control), feelings of higher social status, and being sceptical of simple solutions.</p>
<p>A second survey was similar, but this time Van Prooijen quizzed nearly 1000 participants, average age 50, selected to be representative of the wider Dutch population. Also, there were two phases: for the first, participants answered questions about their education level; feelings of power; subjective social class; belief in simple solutions; and they took some basic tests of their analytical thinking skills. Then two weeks later, the participants rated their belief in various conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Once again, more education was associated with less belief in conspiracy theories, and this seemed to be explained in part by more educated participants feeling more in control, having less belief in simple solutions, and having stronger analytical skills. Subjective social class wasn’t relevant in this survey.</p>
<p>Taken together, Van Prooijen said the results suggest that “the relationship between education and belief in conspiracy theories cannot be reduced to a single psychological mechanism but is the product of the complex interplay of multiple psychological processes.”</p>
<p>The nature of his study means we can’t infer that education or the related factors he measured actually cause less belief in conspiracies. But it makes theoretical sense that they might be involved: for example, more education usually increases people’s sense of control over their lives (though there are exceptions, for instance among people from marginalized groups), while it is feelings of powerlessness that is one of the things that often attracts people to conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Importantly, Van Prooijen said his findings help make sense of why education can contribute to “a less paranoid society” even when conspiracy theories are not explicitly challenged. “By teaching children analytic thinking skills along with the insight that societal problems often have no simple solutions, by stimulating a sense of control, and by promoting a sense that one is a valued member of society, education is likely to install the mental tools that are needed to approach far-fetched conspiracy theories with a healthy dose of skepticism.”</p>

I enjoyed this fun forum organized by David Poeppel and Mike Gazzaniga. The format included three pairs of speakers on the topics of memory, language, and action/motor who “consider[ed] some major challenges and cutting-edge advances, from molecular mechanisms to decoding approaches to network computations.”<br /><br />Co-host Marcus Raichle recalled his inspiration for the symposium: a similar Big Ideas session at the Society for Neuroscience meeting. But human neuroscience was absent from all SFN Big Ideas, so Dr. Raichle contacted Dr. Gazzaniga, who “made it happen” (along with Dr. Poeppel). The popular event was standing room only, and many couldn't even get into the Bayview Room (which was too small a venue). More context:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“Recent discussions in the neurosciences have been relentlessly reductionist. The guiding principle of this symposium is that there is no privileged level of analysis that can yield special explanatory insight into the mind/brain on its own, so ideas and techniques across levels will be necessary.”</blockquote><br />The two hour symposium was a welcome addition to hundreds of posters and talks on highly specific empirical findings. Sometimes we must take a step back and look at the big picture. But since I'm The Neurocritic, I'll start out with some modest suggestions for next time.<br /><br /><ul><li>There was no time for questions or discussion.</li><li>There were too many talks.</li><li>It would be nice for all speakers to try to bridge different levels of analysis.</li><li>This is a small point, but ironically the first two speakers (Gallistel, Ryan) did not talk about human neuroscience.</li></ul><br />So my idea is to have four speakers on one topic (memory, let's say) with two at the level of Gallistel and Ryan<sup><b><span style="color: purple;">1</span></b></sup>, and two who approach human neuroscience using different techniques. Talks are strictly limited to 20 minutes. Then there is a 20 minute panel discussion where everyone tries to consider the implications of the other levels for their own work. Then (ideally) there is time for 20 minutes of questions from the audience. However, since I'm not an expert in organizing such events, allotting 20 minutes for the audience could be excessive. So the timing could be restructured to 25 min for talks, 10-15 min panel, 5-10 min audience. Or combine the round table with audience participation.<br /><br />Last year, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160611055236/http://www.cogneurosociety.org/mycns/?page=symposium_sessions#7" target="_blank">Symposium Session 7</a> on Human Intracranial Electrophysiology (which included the <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/04/dont-lose-your-head-over-tdcs.html" target="_blank" title="Studies of transcranial electrical stimulation in human cadaver heads showed a 90% loss of current when delivered through the skin">incendiary tDCS challenge</a> by György Buzsáki) had a round table discussion as Talk 5, which I thought was very successful.<br /><br />Video of the Big Ideas symposium is now available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFDiU2PVB8DQ1Qf7cGNvRV2HSMOWUBMf" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but in case you don't want to watch the entire two hours, I'll present a brief summary below.<br /><br /><br /><b>Big Box Neuroscience</b><br /><br />Here's an idiosyncratic distillation of some major points from the symposium.<br /><br /><ul><li>The brain is an information processing device in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" target="_blank" title="'information' is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error">Shannon information theory</a>.</li><li>The brain does <b><i>not</i></b> use Shannon information.</li><li>Memories (”engrams”) are not stored at synapses.</li><li>We learn entirely through spike trains.</li><li>The engram is inter-spike interval.</li><li>The engram is an emergent property.</li><li>Emergent properties are for losers.</li><li>Language is genetically predetermined.</li><li>There is something called mirror neural ensembles.</li><li>Recursion is big.</li><li>Architectures are important.</li><li>Build a bridge from networks to models of behavior.</li><li>Use generative models to construct theories.</li><li>Machine learning will save us.</li><li>Go back to behavioral neuroscience.</li></ul><br />Maybe I'll explain what this all means in the next post.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Mkq1NH1zoK4/nature22035">Structural basis for selectivity and diversity in angiotensin II receptors</a></h4>

<p>
 The angiotensin II receptors AT1R and AT2R serve as key components of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. AT1R has a central role in the regulation of blood pressure, but the function of AT2R is unclear and it has a variety of reported effects. To identify the mechanisms that underlie the differences in function and ligand selectivity between these receptors, here we report crystal structures of human AT2R bound to an AT2R-selective ligand and to an AT1R/AT2R dual ligand, capturing the receptor in an active-like conformation. Unexpectedly, helix VIII was found in a non-canonical position, stabilizing the active-like state, but at the same time preventing the recruitment of G proteins or β-arrestins, in agreement with the lack of signalling responses in standard cellular assays. Structure–activity relationship, docking and mutagenesis studies revealed the crucial interactions for ligand binding and selectivity. Our results thus provide insights into the structural basis of the distinct functions of the angiotensin receptors, and may guide the design of new selective ligands.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/mCeeGGkKGmA/nature22033">The crown-of-thorns starfish genome as a guide for biocontrol of this coral reef pest</a></h4>

<p>
 The crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS, the Acanthaster planci species group) is a highly fecund predator of reef-building corals throughout the Indo-Pacific region. COTS population outbreaks cause substantial loss of coral cover, diminishing the integrity and resilience of reef ecosystems. Here we sequenced genomes of COTS from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and Okinawa, Japan to identify gene products that underlie species-specific communication and could potentially be used in biocontrol strategies. We focused on water-borne chemical plumes released from aggregating COTS, which make the normally sedentary starfish become highly active. Peptide sequences detected in these plumes by mass spectrometry are encoded in the COTS genome and expressed in external tissues. The exoproteome released by aggregating COTS consists largely of signalling factors and hydrolytic enzymes, and includes an expanded and rapidly evolving set of starfish-specific ependymin-related proteins. These secreted proteins may be detected by members of a large family of olfactory-receptor-like G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed externally, sometimes in a sex-specific manner. This study provides insights into COTS-specific communication that may guide the generation of peptide mimetics for use on reefs with COTS outbreaks.

<p>
 Growth in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP)—the amount of carbon dioxide that is ‘fixed’ into organic material through the photosynthesis of land plants—may provide a negative feedback for climate change. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent biogeochemical processes can suppress global GPP growth. As a consequence, modelling estimates of terrestrial carbon storage, and of feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate, remain poorly constrained. Here we present a global, measurement-based estimate of GPP growth during the twentieth century that is based on long-term atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) records, derived from ice-core, firn and ambient air samples. We interpret these records using a model that simulates changes in COS concentration according to changes in its sources and sinks—including a large sink that is related to GPP. We find that the observation-based COS record is most consistent with simulations of climate and the carbon cycle that assume large GPP growth during the twentieth century (31% ± 5% growth; mean ± 95% confidence interval). Although this COS analysis does not directly constrain models of future GPP growth, it does provide a global-scale benchmark for historical carbon-cycle simulations.

<p>Normal differentiation and induced reprogramming require the activation of target cell programs and silencing of donor cell programs. In reprogramming, the same factors are often used to reprogram many different donor cell types. As most developmental repressors, such as RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and Groucho (also known as TLE), are considered lineage-specific repressors, it remains unclear how identical combinations of transcription factors can silence so many different donor programs. Distinct lineage repressors would have to be induced in different donor cell types. Here, by studying the reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neurons, we found that the pan neuron-specific transcription factor Myt1-like (Myt1l) exerts its pro-neuronal function by direct repression of many different somatic lineage programs except the neuronal program. The repressive function of Myt1l is mediated via recruitment of a complex containing Sin3b by binding to a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain. In agreement with its repressive function, the genomic binding sites of Myt1l are similar in neurons and fibroblasts and are preferentially in an open chromatin configuration. The Notch signalling pathway is repressed by Myt1l through silencing of several members, including Hes1. Acute knockdown of Myt1l in the developing mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting that Myt1l allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Depletion of Myt1l in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function, indicating that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. It is now tempting to speculate that similar ‘many-but-one’ lineage repressors exist for other cell fates; such repressors, in combination with lineage-specific activators, would be prime candidates for use in reprogramming additional cell types.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21722">doi: 10.1038/nature21722</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/aM5Xj0YQYIk" width="1" />

<p>
 Animals constantly assess the reliability of learned information to optimize their behaviour. On retrieval, consolidated long-term memory can be neutralized by extinction if the learned prediction was inaccurate. Alternatively, retrieved memory can be maintained, following a period of reconsolidation during which it is labile. Although extinction and reconsolidation provide opportunities to alleviate problematic human memories, we lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of memory updating. Here we identify neural operations underpinning the re-evaluation of memory in Drosophila. Reactivation of reward-reinforced olfactory memory can lead to either extinction or reconsolidation, depending on prediction accuracy. Each process recruits activity in specific parts of the mushroom body output network and distinct subsets of reinforcing dopaminergic neurons. Memory extinction requires output neurons with dendrites in the α and α′ lobes of the mushroom body, which drive negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons that innervate neighbouring zones. The aversive valence of these new extinction memories neutralizes previously learned odour preference. Memory reconsolidation requires the γ2α′1 mushroom body output neurons. This pathway recruits negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons innervating the same compartment and re-engages positively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons to reconsolidate the original reward memory. These data establish that recurrent and hierarchical connectivity between mushroom body output neurons and dopaminergic neurons enables memory re-evaluation driven by reward-prediction error.

<p>
 Chromatin and metabolic states both influence lifespan, but how they interact in lifespan regulation is largely unknown. The COMPASS chromatin complex, which trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), regulates lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the mechanism by which H3K4me3 modifiers affect longevity, and whether this mechanism involves metabolic changes, remain unclear. Here we show that a deficiency in H3K4me3 methyltransferase, which extends lifespan, promotes fat accumulation in worms with a specific enrichment of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). This fat metabolism switch in H3K4me3 methyltransferase-deficient worms is mediated at least in part by the downregulation of germline targets, including S6 kinase, and by the activation of an intestinal transcriptional network that upregulates delta-9 fatty acid desaturases. Notably, the accumulation of MUFAs is necessary for the lifespan extension of H3K4me3 methyltransferase-deficient worms, and dietary MUFAs are sufficient to extend lifespan. Given the conservation of lipid metabolism, dietary or endogenous MUFAs could extend lifespan and healthspan in other species, including mammals.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/4f1A5xUoxx4/">Protocols.io Tools for PLOS Authors: Reproducibility and Recognition</a></h4>

<img alt="Protocol.io_opt2" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/Protocol.io_opt2-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Solutions to the challenges of reproducibility in experimental science should be as diverse as the challenges themselves. Inconsistent reagents, barriers to the open sharing of supporting data, experimental variation that goes unrecorded and researcher’s concerns for lack of recognition and credit for novel and meticulously created experimental methods all contribute to the challenges of reproducibility in biomedical research.</p>
<p>PLOS now partners directly with <strong><a href="https://www.protocols.io/" target="_blank">protocols.io</a></strong> to provide authors better ways to share methodological details about their work, practical tools to reduce wasted research efforts and persistent, citable identifiers for laboratory methods. For PLOS, this is a step forward on commitments to address reproducibility and provide improved recognition and credit for all contributions to a work.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are delighted to be associated with a like-minded partner such as PLOS,” says protocols.io CEO Lenny Teytelman. “We are aligned in our Open Access ethos, and we strive to facilitate the communication of research in an effective, accessible and reusable way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This new offering complements PLOS’ already robust <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank">data availability policy</a></strong>, requiring that data underlying the conclusions of an article be made available at the time of publication. Since the strengthening of this policy in 2014, about 60,000 articles have been published that contain a Data Availability Statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are excited to engage with protocols.io,” says PLOS Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer. “This is another step towards <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/11/a-plos-response-to-open-in-action-with-open-science/" target="_blank">Open Science</a></strong>, facilitating access not only to the data but now also to the laboratory methodology that generated these data.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>Researchers are encouraged, at their discretion, to deposit their laboratory protocols on the protocols.io site, obtain a unique DOI and link directly to these from the Methods section of their articles. The unique link allows reviewers and editors access to the protocols during peer review. At the time of publication, the partnership between PLOS and protocols.io ensures that links to and from the published article are established and protocols are automatically made publicly available under a CC BY license for anyone to access, use and cite.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_7492" style="width: 202px;"><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002538" target="_blank"><img alt="protocol.io_app" class="wp-image-7492" height="396" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/protocol.io_app-153x300.png" title="DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002538" width="202" /></a>DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002538</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Archived and linked permanently to and from the article, protocols become part of the scientific record. The <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002538" target="_blank">protocols.io application</a></strong> allows scientists to create, copy, modify and evolve laboratory protocols, describing the critical details of experimental procedures that are often overlooked in articles Methods sections. While detailed steps in a protocol may evolve and improve over time, the version that relates to the published article remains accessible to help explain experimental nuances.</p>
<h5>“Methods sections that describe laboratory experiments are narratives that tend to omit subtle variations that may affect the experiments,” says Kiermer. “I hope that scientists will take up the opportunity to describe their methods in a way that is much more useful to others.”</h5>
<p>Nuanced methodological details can be shared in new ways, that in time can integrate seamlessly into the research cycle, from bench to publication and back. “It is not merely a tool for publication,” says Teytelman, “it can be useful as a lab tool, at the bench, for record keeping and for sharing expertise within and outside a laboratory.”</p>
<p>Engaged <strong><a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/diatom-transformation-via-bacterial-conjugation-hgpb3vn?comments" target="_blank">commenting</a></strong> on the protocols.io website allows interested readers to clarify and discuss deeper with others using an article’s methodology. “This partnership will improve reproducibility of published research while fostering scientists’ collaborative engagement with our content,” adds Kiermer.</p>
<p><strong>A DOI for methods, citable by others, provides more <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" target="_blank">granular credit</a></strong> to those individuals contributing to methodological development.</strong> It also enables researchers to compare methodological details between laboratories pursuing similar approaches or between published experimental methods and those subtly revised by users. In this respect, protocols.io helps bridge an information gap between published experimental methods and methods refined over time.</p>
<p>PLOS looks forward to authors’ participation in this novel approach to enhancing Methods sections—an Open Access tool to record and share detailed protocols.

<p>The field of Learning Analytics is beginning to gain traction in educational institutions, with perhaps the main driver being the prediction of student outcomes in order to identify students at risk.  This is not just key to improving the student experience, but critical to institutional budgets, where student withdrawals can cause significant damage to revenue streams.  However, the identification of students at risk is only useful when positive and successful interventions are made.  Currently, institutional interventions are ad-hoc and usually based upon the experience and style/approach of the individual tutor or course leader, with supporting institutional processes arguably focussed upon protecting the establishment.  An emerging area is that of using intelligent techniques to provide evidential input and specific intelligent support to the intervention process itself.  In addition to describing the relevant issues and methods I will describe the approach taken by the Open University, a leader in the field.</p>

<p>Already substantial evidence suggests that <em>feeling</em> lonely – regardless of whether we actually are socially isolated based on our number of relationships – is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">bad for our health</a>, affecting our odds of developing heart disease and other chronic conditions. A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14291-001/">new study</a> in <em>Health Psychology</em> extends this literature by showing that feelings of loneliness, but not levels of social isolation, seem to increase the toll of acute illness, in this case by worsening the subjective experience of having a cold.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by Angie LeRoy at the University of Houston and Rice University, said their findings could be useful for helping doctors understand their patients’ different experiences of short-term illnesses. It also provides yet more evidence for why interventions aimed at reducing loneliness need to focus on quality not quantity of social interaction – after all, it’s perfectly possible to feel intensely alone in a crowded room.</p>
<p><span id="more-21936"></span></p>
<p>This isn’t the kind of study you’d consider volunteering for lightly: the researchers used viral nasal drops to try to infect 159 healthy US participants, average age 30, with a cold (75 per cent became infected) and then they holed them up in quarantine in a hotel for five days. Thankfully for the participants, they received just over $1000 in compensation.</p>
<p>Each day, the participants answered questions about their mood and the severity of eight different cold symptoms, from congestion to chills. They also filled out a loneliness questionnaire at the start, which tapped their subjective sense of loneliness (typical items included “In general, how often do you feel left out?”), and an objective measure of their social isolation based on the number of people they had contact with every two weeks.</p>
<p>Feeling lonely didn’t affect risk of infection by the cold virus, but of the participants who were infected, the more lonely they said they felt, the worse they reported their cold symptoms to be. This remained true when factoring out the influence of negative mood, which was also associated with experiencing more severe symptoms. Social isolation, measured objectively, was not associated with the subjective severity of cold symptoms. “Put simply,” the researchers said, “lonelier people feel worse when they are sick than less lonely people”.</p>

<p>There are some study limitations to be aware of: for instance, loneliness was only measured once, rather than as a dynamic state; deliberate infection isn’t exactly the same process as being infected in everyday life; and we can’t tell from these findings that loneliness causes worse subjective symptoms: some other unmeasured factor, such as lack of sleep, might be the key causal factor (loneliness tends to lead to sleep disruption).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the results hint at how subjective feelings of loneliness can become self-fulfilling through increasing the sense of feeling unwell after catching a cold, thus driving yet further social withdrawal. This form of negative spiral is in addition to <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/08/lonely-peoples-brains-work-differently.html">self-perpetuating psychological processes</a> identified by prior research, such as the increased sensitivity lonely people have for social threat. The good news is that by becoming aware of these self-perpetuating mechanisms we can hopefully intervene more effectively and with greater understanding, either to help ourselves or others who  feel alone.</p>

<img alt="Old Man Time Kahl Care Dementia Tree Clock Age" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Old-Man-Time-Kahl-Care-Dementia-Tree-Clock-Age-97986-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been characterized as a “<a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.145.6.760" target="_blank">complete loss of self</a>.” Early on when memory begins to fade, the victim has difficulty recalling names, their grocery list or where they put their keys. As the disease progresses, they have trouble staying focused, planning and performing basic daily activities. From the exterior, dementia appears to ravage one’s intellect and personality; yet as mere observers, it’s impossible to ascertain how consciousness of the self and environment is transformed by dementia. The celebrated late neurologist Oliver Sacks once suggested that, “Style, neurologically, is the deepest part of one’s being and may be preserved, almost to the last, in dementia.” Is this remaining neurological “style” sufficient to preserve consciousness? Is the AD patient aware of their deteriorating cognition, retaining a sense of identity or morality, or can they still connect with friends and loved ones? Emerging advances in neuroscience have enabled researchers to more precisely probe the AD brain, suggesting that although some aspects of consciousness are compromised by dementia, others are remarkably spared.</p>
<p><strong>Manifestations of consciousness</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are beginning to piece together how the selective loss of some functions, but the preservation of others, alters consciousness in AD. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11696024" target="_blank">recent study</a> found that the severity of cognitive impairment strongly relates to “meta-cognition” (reflecting on one’s own condition), moral judgments and thinking about the future, whereas basic personal identity and body awareness remain. Perhaps the most widely observed deficit in consciousness is “anosognosia,” impaired awareness of one’s own illness; whereas individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; considered a precursor to full AD) are aware of their declining memory, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15802909" target="_blank">AD patients may be unaware of their impairments</a>. These behavioral signs suggest that only some aspects of consciousness and self-awareness are truly lost in AD.</p>
<p>Although basic perceptual, sensory, and communication skills are relatively spared, the defining feature of AD is memory loss. The unique nature of these memory deficits provides clues to why sub-components of consciousness deteriorate in dementia. Memory for experiences (episodic memory; e.g., <em>I went for a walk in the park yesterday</em>) and recollection of their associated details are impaired, while memory for facts and meaning (semantic memory; e.g., <em>Paris is the capital of France</em>) is preserved. Recollection of episodic memories demands that the rememberer engage with the memory, searching for context and reflecting upon the memory after it’s recalled. In contrast, semantic memory can be automatic and doesn’t require this level of attention or personal involvement. Impairment in personal meta-cognition may lie at the heart of these memory deficits. For instance, AD patients can accurately predict how well they’ll later <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1355617700001375" target="_blank">recall semantic information</a>, but cannot predict how they’ll <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12417467" target="_blank">recall episodic memory</a>, pointing to a specific impairment in <em>awareness</em> of their personal memories. Perhaps then, loss of consciousness in AD stems from impaired control over attention to memory. Indeed, AD has been considered a disorder of “impaired attention to life.” This is supported by reports that the feelings surrounding a memory and re-experiencing an episode during recollection are absent in AD. Unable to engage with a memory, the individual loses their conscious awareness of the experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/how-mind-works" target="_blank">Steven Pinker</a> defines consciousness as the sum of sentience, access to information, and self-knowledge. While the first two are relatively intact in AD, episodic memories are heavily dependent on the last. In addition to problems with episodic memory, some AD patients have difficulty remembering semantic information when it’s personal, suggesting that hindered access to personal details of a memory may, to some extent, account for impairments in consciousness. As dementia often warps one’s sense of time continuity, this temporal disconnect could further degrade one’s ability to accurately place themself in the context of past and future.</p>
<p><strong>Neural underpinnings of altered consciousness</strong></p>
<p>The unique pattern of brain pathology in AD might explain the resulting partial loss of consciousness in its victims. Since consciousness requires the coordination of distributed brain networks that support sensation, memory, attention and emotion, dysfunction of this system could lead to changes in cognition and awareness. In AD, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904350/" target="_blank">brain atrophy</a> begins in the medial temporal lobe, followed by lateral temporal, parietal and frontal areas. These regions may engender consciousness by supporting recall of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12372291" target="_blank">source of a memory</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15784441" target="_blank">self-referential processing</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11459919" target="_blank">self-identification</a>. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002987" target="_blank">Metabolism is reduced</a> in temporal and parietal regions, and these changes are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16189724" target="_blank">associated with the severity of cognitive impairment</a> and changes in awareness. Furthermore, in line with the finding that AD patients have trouble understanding another’s personality, <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/3/550.short" target="_blank">stimulating the temporoparietal junction</a> can induce an “out-of-body experience,” where the person perceives themself as someone else.</p>
<p>Deficits in meta-cognitive ability could further stem from <em>disconnect</em> among key brain hubs. The pathways connecting the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices, which integrate information across the brain, become compromised in AD. Although these widespread brain networks aren’t affected until late in the disease, the earliest target of AD-related neurodegeneration, the medial temporal lobe, lies at the core of this system. In the medial temporal lobe, the hippocampus binds contextual information about an experience into memory, but must communicate across the brain to store these details into long-term memory. Therefore, early damage to the medial temporal lobe might be a first step towards a disrupted sense of awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Preserving consciousness</strong></p>
<p>This research linking the select deficits in self-awareness and meta-cognition with the characteristic pattern of neurodegeneration in AD is invaluable for informing about the neurobiological origins of consciousness. Perhaps more importantly, understanding which aspects of consciousness go awry in AD could theoretically promote the development of more effective treatment strategies. If attention to one’s inner mental landscape, and awareness of one’s personal state, are targets of AD, there’s hope that training these skills could confer resilience against the neuropathology degrading these functions. Although in its infancy, studies testing this possibility have shown promise. Older adults who are experienced mediators were more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17655980" target="_blank">resilient to the detrimental effects of age</a> on cognitive function than non-meditators, and an intervention of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164557" target="_blank">eight weeks of meditation training</a> increased brain blood flow and improved cognitive function in individuals with MCI and AD.</p>
<p>Although it’s tempting to attribute changes in awareness to strictly biological aberrations, we cannot overlook the physical and social interactions that mold our mental state. Being labeled “demented”, infantilized or treated as incapable, as can be done to AD victims, would be damaging to anyone’s self-esteem and sense of dignity. Perhaps then, by nurturing the AD mind by reinforcing their human worth, we could dampen the pathological fire working to degrade their personhood.</p>

<p>There could be an Arctic blizzard blowing outside for all little Mary cares. The fact is, she’s hot from running around indoors, and no matter how much you try to explain to Mary that her future self – the one that’s about to go walking in the cold – would really appreciate that she put her coat on, Mary, like most kids aged under five, finds it very difficult to step outside of the present and consider her future needs.</p>
<p>While psychologists have already spent a lot of time demonstrating <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/09/when-anticipating-their-future-needs-children-cant-see-past-their-current-state/">the limitations of young children’s ability to plan for the future</a>, until now they’ve not looked much at whether it’s possible to target these “prospective abilities”. However, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2017-09886-001">a new study</a> in <em>Developmental Psychology</em> has done that, showing that a mere five-minute chat about their recent past or future selves seems to help preschoolers remember to do things in the future, and to “time travel” mentally, so that they make better decisions about their forthcoming needs.</p>
<p><span id="more-21849"></span></p>
<p>Nadia Chernyak at Boston University and her colleagues allocated 81 children, aged three to five, to one of four training conditions. Each child spent five minutes alone with a researcher talking and thinking about either: their self in the near past (for example, what they’d been doing earlier that day, and drawing a picture of themselves going to bed the previous night); their near future (such as what they would be doing later that day; drawing a picture of themselves going to bed that night); their distant future (such as in the coming weeks, and even when they are adult); or, finally, the present (including drawing a picture of what they were doing “right now”).</p>
<p>After they’d finished their training phase, a different researcher tested each child on their ability to make future-related decisions. Importantly, this researcher didn’t know which training condition each child had completed.</p>
<p>There were several tests, including a “prospective memory” challenge, which involved remembering to remind the researcher to open a box at the end of the tests; a “mental time travel” test that involved selecting appropriate items to take on a trek through the forest or snow; a “temporal discounting task” that gave the opportunity to forego a sticker “right now”, for the chance to have two at the end of the day; and a “saving task” that involved showing patience and waiting for a better play opportunity.</p>
<p>The children who’d spent time thinking about their near-past or future outperformed the others (the children in the distant future and present training conditions) on the prospective memory task and on the mental time travel task. There were no group differences in performance on the temporal discounting task or saving task, perhaps because improvement in these skills takes practice as well as progress in conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>The children in the near-past or future conditions had used more personal pronouns when chatting compared with the other children, and Chernyak and her colleagues think this offers a clue to why these conditions were apparently more beneficial to prospective memory and mental time travel. “Our work suggests that experience communicating and thinking about one’s extended self promotes the ability to make decisions on behalf of the extended self,” the researchers said. They added that children in the distant future condition may have found distant events and talk of their distant selves less self-relevant and more abstract (just as adults do).</p>
<p>It’s not clear how long the apparent benefits of the near-past and future training conditions would last; ideally future studies would also provide some kind of before and after comparison of abilities rather than simply looking for between-group differences in ability after training. Nonetheless, the researchers believe they’ve highlighted an important principle:</p>
<p>“These results have implications for caregivers’ day-to-day interactions with preschoolers,” they concluded, “because even brief conversations with adults can help scaffold, shape, and activate concepts about one’s extended self. Critically engaging young children in conversations where they are provided with opportunities to cognitize, remember, and discuss their extended selves may ultimately help them make future-oriented decisions that benefit those extended selves.”</p>

Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425" target="_blank">mild cognitive impairment</a> (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/" target="_blank" title="Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?">prodromal states</a> have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.<br /><br />In one study, <strike>Frazier</strike> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520" target="_blank">Fraser et al. (2015)</a> applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the <a href="http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/" target="_blank">DementiaBank</a> database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes. Another limitation was the relatively short length of the speech samples.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> <br /><br />Using factor analysis, the researchers found that <a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/" target="_blank">four dimensions of speech</a><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>3 </sup></b></span>were most indicative of dementia: <br /><ul><li>Semantic impairment<span class="_Tgc"> – </span>using overly simple words</li><li>Acoustic impairment <span class="_Tgc">– </span>e.g., speaking more  slowly </li><li>Syntactic impairment  <span class="_Tgc">– </span>using less complex grammar </li><li>Information impairment <span class="_Tgc">– </span>not clearly identifying the main aspects  of a picture they were told to describe</li></ul><br />Public figures who give repeated interviews leave a searchable record of spontaneous speech that can be analyzed for changes over time. Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673" target="_blank">Berisha et al. (2015)</a> examined <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">transcripts</a> from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office.

Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.<br /><br /><br /><b>President Donald Trump</b><br /><br />After his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference" target="_blank">Feb. 16 press conference</a>, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder" target="_blank">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a> (NPD), as speculated in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a> and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his <i>actual</i> grandiose status as POTUS): <br /><ol><li>Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others</li><li>Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.</li><li>Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions</li><li>Needing constant admiration from others</li><li>Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others</li><li>Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain</li><li>Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs</li><li>Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them</li><li>Pompous and arrogant demeanor</li></ol>And we can call him <b>narcissistic</b> in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html" target="_blank"><i>NY Times</i> letter</a> signed by 35 mental health professionals?<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>4</sup></b></span> <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).<br /><br />In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.</blockquote><br />Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0" target="_blank">forcefully argued</a> that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).</blockquote><br /><b>Discourse Analysis</b><br /><br />Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This is probably my favorite part so far <a href="https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN">pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN</a></div>— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) <a href="https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664">February 16, 2017</a></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this <span style="color: red;"><b>thing</b></span> called nuclear weapons  and other <span style="color: red;"><b>things</b></span>.  <span style="color: red;"><b>Like</b></span>, lots of <span style="color: red;"><b>things</b></span> are <span style="color: red;"><b>done</b></span> with uranium,  including some bad <span style="color: red;"><b>things</b></span>.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't <span style="color: red;"><b>do</b></span> <span style="color: red;"><b> anything</b></span> for Russia.  I've <span style="color: red;"><b>done</b></span> <b><span style="color: red;">nothing</span></b> for Russia.”</blockquote><br />This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM" target="_blank">train wreck</a>. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.<br /><br /><b>Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!</b> But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.<br /><br />I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump" target="_blank">many</a> of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below). Letterman has aged too, so you might as well analyze his speech as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> The authors performed... <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">...a 10-fold cross-validation procedure in which a unique 10% of the data (i.e., the ‘test set’) are used in each iteration for evaluation, and the remaining 90% (i.e., the ‘training set’) are used to select the most useful features (of the 370 available as described in “Features” above) and construct our models.

<p>In advance of the third <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/ecr-travel-awards" target="_blank">Early Career Researcher Travel Award Program</a></strong> launching today, PLOS reached out to recipients of Forbes 30 Under 30 in <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2017/healthcare/#16f55d454f78" target="_blank">Healthcare</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2017/science/#8e5684927fa6" target="_blank">Science</a></strong> who were also PLOS authors at the time of the awards (scroll down on the Forbes pages to see individual honorees). Five leading Early Career Researchers (ECRs) working in genetics, pathogens, virology and the intersection of medicine and policy shared their views with PLOS on Open Access, open data and communicating scientific results. Below are their responses that we hope will inspire and motivate ECRs in all disciplines. At the end of this post, <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Medicine</em></a></strong> Chief Editor Larry Peiperl specifically responds to the importance of data sharing and publishing all valid results.</p>
<h4>When asked, “Do you and your colleagues discuss publishing in Open Access journals, or making data openly available?” these stellar scientists replied:</h4>

But I think we need to go even a step forward, and make all parts of publications, including the code and pipelines, easily available as well. I have been actively involved in discussions about why and how to do this. Luckily, I think the field of human genomics has been quite pioneering in moving toward a more “open” culture. Among my colleagues, it is just assumed that everyone puts their papers on preprint servers as soon as they’re submitted. We give people a hard time if their data is not available. Increasingly, software is getting <strong><a href="https://github.com/mgymrek" target="_blank">posted on github</a></strong> or similar repositories. Unfortunately, this is not the case in every field. —Melissa Gymrek, Assistant Professor, UC San Diego.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>It’s incredibly important for data to be shared in a way that promotes collaboration and the advancement of knowledge.</strong> I think in general the more diverse ways you can examine a problem, or a data set, the more likely you are to reach surprising and meaningful conclusions. As biomedical researchers, our major goal should always be to improve human health, and open access seems to be an essential part of that effort. —Carrie Cowardin, Postdoctoral fellow, Washington University. Read Cowardin’s work in <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004820" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em></a></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Making data openly available is an approach we highlight and discuss in our recent analysis of alternative mechanisms of research and development on our Re:route microsite.</strong> Open data platforms are one way we can make biomedical R&amp;D help more people, by increasing scientific discovery output, sharing negative results, increasing competition and decreasing the cost of medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. This model is already being used to some extent by <strong><a href="https://www.dndi.org/" target="_blank">Drugs for Neglected Diseases <em>initiative</em></a></strong> (DND<em>i</em>) and <strong><a href="https://www.mmv.org/" target="_blank">Medicines for Malaria Venture</a></strong> (MMV), among others. But it is not enough. This has to be implemented more broadly. —Gloria Tavera, President of the board, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines.

<h4>When asked, as one of the new generation of influencers in their respective fields, what changes do they foresee or would like to see related to the way research findings make their way to the greater scientific community, these innovators described preprints, linked data and code, the role of politics in the direction of scientific research and new forms of media as communication tools.</h4>

<p><strong>One of the many things I’d like to see in the future is to get the science spread to the general public more often.</strong> As a scientist, we’ve more often just focused on exchanging our ideas or findings within our close circle, while the general public have little idea of what we are doing. I think it will be really great for the next generation of scientists to become better communicators, and try to bridge what we know to the others, and with the use of new forms of media, I am pretty sure there will be many endeavors taken pretty soon. —Jiang He, Postdoctoral fellow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<p><strong>If current trends continue, the most recent scientific developments will continue to be communicated to the greater scientific community digitally, through many different open access platforms. </strong>The advantage is that this information can reach a wider audience than we could have ever imagined. However, we need to make sure that this dissemination mitigates sensationalism and only communicates good, accurate science. We will need well-trained science journalists and editors to lead these changes. —Srilakshmi Raj, Postdoctoral fellow, Cornell University. Read Raj’s work <strong><a href="http://plos.io/2okMrQp" target="_blank">published in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Preprints and open access will become the norm.</strong>…I am particularly inspired by the <strong><a href="https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/PubPolicy" target="_blank">ATGU’s eloquent publication policy</a></strong>. They sum it up: “We believe that it is only a matter of time before the concept of restricted access to the products of scientific research becomes an anachronism.” …In principle, a publication should include everything needed to reproduce the main findings of the study. That has to include software as well! I am frustrated with how many times I have to reinvent the wheel by redoing an analysis that was already done in another paper. My dream is that every figure, table, and result in a paper will be linked directly to the code and data used to produce them. —Melissa</p>
<p><strong>We live in an interconnected world, and as technology advances, it becomes ever more pressing to share data openly and in an expedient way.</strong> The methods put in place by the WHO for sharing data on Zika virus come to mind. It’s incredibly important to maintain the quality of work we do while improving our ability to share it with others, and part of that means timely publication of results. I also hope for more acceptance of negative data, which can be just as important to be aware of as interesting positive results. Better communication and recognition of negative results would make current research much more efficient and productive. —Carrie</p>
<blockquote><p><em>PLOS Medicine</em> Chief Editor Larry Pieperl responds:</p>
<p>Encouraging data sharing became a priority for many during the West Africa Ebola outbreak 2-3 years ago. WHO called a consultation on data sharing and invited several journal editors to join the researchers and funding agencies for discussions in Geneva. The evidence presented there included an analysis that showed most of the <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000272" target="_blank">research from the 2003 SARS outbreaks</a></strong> were not even submitted for publication until after the crisis was over.</p>
<p>I think some people had the idea that editors presented a barrier by refusing to publish research if the data had been previously shared, and wanted us to account for ourselves. What happened may have surprised them: journal editors had no problem <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001949" target="_blank">endorsing data sharing in public health emergencies</a></strong>. This statement of editorial policy turned out to be timely, as the first studies on Zika came soon after, and data sharing quickly became an expectation. Of course, many of us believe that data sharing shouldn’t require an international emergency. Requirements by major funding agencies that researchers share data as a condition of their grant award are an interesting recent development.</p>
<p>Regarding negative results, they may not win awards, but their publication is unquestionably a contribution to the research community. Think of a forest where a few well-known paths appear on a published map, but most paths are not marked at all, even though some of them have already been explored for long distances only to find they lead nowhere. Surely a signpost should be added to keep others from wasting time and resources. In clinical research, a conclusive negative result can have the immediate benefit of <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000152" target="_blank">preventing futile, costly or hazardous interventions</a></strong> in subsequent patients.</p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/aHBpNlZqXOM/nature21724">Mutual regulation of tumour vessel normalization and immunostimulatory reprogramming</a></h4>

<p>
 Blockade of angiogenesis can retard tumour growth, but may also paradoxically increase metastasis. This paradox may be resolved by vessel normalization, which involves increased pericyte coverage, improved tumour vessel perfusion, reduced vascular permeability, and consequently mitigated hypoxia. Although these processes alter tumour progression, their regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that type 1 T helper (TH1) cells play a crucial role in vessel normalization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene expression features related to vessel normalization correlate with immunostimulatory pathways, especially T lymphocyte infiltration or activity. To delineate the causal relationship, we used various mouse models with vessel normalization or T lymphocyte deficiencies. Although disruption of vessel normalization reduced T lymphocyte infiltration as expected, reciprocal depletion or inactivation of CD4+ T lymphocytes decreased vessel normalization, indicating a mutually regulatory loop. In addition, activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by immune checkpoint blockade increased vessel normalization. TH1 cells that secrete interferon-γ are a major population of cells associated with vessel normalization. Patient-derived xenograft tumours growing in immunodeficient mice exhibited enhanced hypoxia compared to the original tumours in immunocompetent humans, and hypoxia was reduced by adoptive TH1 transfer. Our findings elucidate an unexpected role of TH1 cells in vasculature and immune reprogramming. TH1 cells may be a marker and a determinant of both immune checkpoint blockade and anti-angiogenesis efficacy.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>It’s really awkward when you’re chatting to someone whose sense of appropriate interpersonal space is way too close. There’s the option of performing a subtle backward shuffle, but what if they simply close the gap again?</p>
<p>Our judgments about such things obviously vary with individual personality – people with more social anxiety tend to prefer a greater distance – and also on the nature of the relationship we have with the other person. But culture must surely play a part too.</p>
<p>To find out how preferred interpersonal distances vary across the world, the authors of a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022117698039">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</em> approached – not too close, presumably – nearly 9,000 participants in 42 countries and asked them to indicate on a simple graphic how close another person – either a stranger, friend or more intimate relation – could get to them during a conversation for things to remain comfortable.</p>
<p><span id="more-21711"></span></p>
<p>The three countries where participants’ preferred minimal distance from a stranger was largest were Romania (approximately 140cm), Hungary and Saudi Arabia; conversely the three countries where participants were happiest being most up close with a stranger were Argentina (80cm), Peru and Bulgaria. The UK was represented by England, with participants here coming out near the middle (approximately 1 metre) in terms of the spread of international preferences for when talking with a stranger.</p>
<p>The averaged preferred minimal distances from a friend or acquaintance during conversation were smaller, as you’d expect, but the rank order across countries was fairly similar to the order for stranger distance. So, in countries where people tended to prefer a greater distance from strangers during conversation, they also tended to prefer a greater distance from friends.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, this wasn’t so much the case for preferred minimal distance when conversing with a close or more intimate other person. For instance, Romanians, who you remember liked the largest distance from a stranger, actually came out as having among the smallest preferred minimal distances from an intimate relation (about 50cm). Likewise, Norwegians came out near the middle in the distribution of preferred minimal distances from a stranger, but were happy with the smallest amount of physical distance (approx 40cm) from a close other.</p>
<p>Lead author Agnieszka Sorokowska and her dozens of colleagues around the world also looked to see if international differences in climate and vulnerability to parasites might correlate with preferred interpersonal differences. The parasite measure wasn’t relevant, but average temperature was: in warmer countries, participants tended to be happier with smaller distances when chatting to strangers, perhaps because <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/10/23/a-warm-room-makes-people-feel-socially-closer/">people feel socially closer in warmer climes</a>, the researchers speculated; in contrast, when it came to intimate relationships, it was colder countries that were happier with smaller distances, perhaps as a way to stay cosy!</p>
<p>Across countries, women tended to prefer greater distances from the other person, as did older participants. An obvious limitation of the study is that it was based on participants’ judgments of the interpersonal distances they think they would prefer, not on actual observations of their behaviour. Still, the researchers collected an impressive amount of data from a huge range of countries, providing a fascinating global perspective on an everyday personal experience: just how close is too close when you’re chatting to another person?</p>

<p>Research on psychiatric disorders has gradually shifted its focus from complex clinical phenotypes towards the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypic measures. Computational approaches have gained significantly more attention over the last years, and this has led to the emergence of 'Computational Psychiatry' as an independent discipline. Computational modelling of biomarkers promises to more readily shed light on the mechanisms underlying disorders and to facilitate the discovery of novel medications [1].</p>
<p>However, in order to develop a computational model, scientists need to have an in-depth understanding of the current, relevant experimental data, the current state of computational modeling and the state-of-the-art of statistical testing. Based on this knowledge, they have to choose the appropriate criteria with which the model predictions and experimental observations will be compared [2]. In a field where both the number of experimental and computational studies grows rapidly, as is the case for psychiatry, this becomes more and more impracticable. Omar et al. therefore proposed a framework for automated validation of scientific models, SciUnit [3].</p>
<p>Here, we propose to adopt this framework for the computational psychiatry community and to collaboratively build common repositories of experimental observations, computational models, test suites and tools. As a case in point, we have implemented test suites for auditory steady-state response deficits in schizophrenic patients, which are based on observations from several experimental studies [4,5,6], and we demonstrate how existing computational models [6,7] can be validated against these observations and compared against each other. We have included sets of observations from three experimental studies, which concur on most findings but also disagree on some. This allows us to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in highlighting and clarifying existing, potentially conflicting, experimental data. We have included computational models that not only comprise biophysically detailed as well as abstract models, but that also differ in implementation (native Python vs. Genesis vs NeuroML2), in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach. Furthermore, this additionally allows us to showcase the ability of the framework to compare models against each other based on a set of experimental observations. Furthermore, our approach enables us to assess the variability of the produced model output, and therefore the robustness of the findings, by generating a distribution of model instances where certain parameters, such as the precise timing of noise inputs (however, not the strength and type of noise) or the precise connectivity (however, not the underlying distribution of connections) vary, which then are used to produce a distribution of model outputs. This can inform on the robustness of the findings and can also be compared against the variability of experimental observations.</p>

<p>In the TV series <em>Better Call Saul</em>, Saul’s brother Chuck believes that electromagnetic signals from mobile phones and other devices make him seriously ill. He lives as a recluse and uses a foil blanket to protect himself. By some estimates, millions of people – around 5 per cent of the population – believe that they too suffer from “electrosensitivity” or “electromagnetic hypersensitivity”. Though they may not suffer as much as Chuck, these individuals claim that wi-fi and other signals make them ill, triggering headaches and other symptoms.</p>
<p>The medical consensus based on <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7546/886.full">double-blind trials</a> (in which neither researcher nor test subject knows when a test device is real or pretend) is that while the experience of electrosensitivity-related symptoms may be real, they are not caused by electromagnetic fields. More likely is that the symptoms arise from a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo">nocebebo effect</a>” – a strong belief that the fields are harmful.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359105317699681">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Health Psychology</em> sheds new light on electrosensitivity by suggesting that it is people who feel especially connected to nature – normally considered a positive trait – who may be particularly likely to suffer from electrosensitivity, probably because their love of nature is accompanied by a heightened negative attitude to anything they consider artificial.</p>
<p>Zsuzsanna Dömötör and her colleagues surveyed 510 people online, 74 of whom described themselves as electrosensitive. The electrosensitive participants tended to score higher than the others on modern health worries in general (related to things like pollution and tainted food), on sensitivity to bodily symptoms, and nature relatedness (measured by agreement with items like “I always think about how my actions affect the environment” and “My ideal vacation spot would be a remote, wilderness area”). What’s more, nature connectedness interacted with the other variables: people prone to modern health worries were especially likely to complain of electrosensitivity if they also felt a connection with nature.</p>

<p>The human mind has been so successful in transforming the material world that it is easy to forget that it too is subject to its own constraints. From biases in our judgment to the imperfection of our memory, psychology has done useful work mapping out many of these limits, yet when it comes to the human imagination, most of us still like to see it as something boundless. But <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717300367">new research</a> in the journal <em>Cognition</em>, on the capacity of our visual imagination, suggests that we soon hit its limits.</p>
<p><span id="more-21595"></span></p>
<p>Rebecca Keogh and Joel Pearson from the University of New South Wales conducted a series of tightly controlled experiments involving 72 participants, mostly students from the university. In every experiment, participants donned special glasses and sat before a computer screen to view dozens or hundreds of trials each composed of two phases.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the screen was lit up with dotted outlines marking out “imagination spaces”. The participants had to mentally “fill-in” between one and seven of these spaces with a simple pattern, either red with horizontal stripes or green with vertical stripes (similar to those pictured below). Cues in the dotted outlines indicated which pattern to visualize in which space. Participants attempted to keep the imagination spaces appropriately coloured in their minds for six seconds.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2017-03-29 at 09.43.15" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21608" data-attachment-id="21608" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2017-03-29 at 09.43.15" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-29-at-09-43-15.png?w=845?w=789" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-29-at-09-43-15.png?w=845?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-29-at-09-43-15.png?w=845" data-orig-size="789,390" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/03/29/a-scientific-measure-of-our-visual-imagination-shows-it-is-surprisingly-limited/screen-shot-2017-03-29-at-09-43-15/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-29-at-09-43-15.png?w=845" /></p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, the second phase of each trial determined how successfully the participants had pictured the patterns, and this is where the glasses came into play. They beamed the red pattern into one eye, and the green into the other. When faced with two competing images presented to each eye in this way, the human mind quickly settles on just one image, banishing the other from conscious awareness in a well-known phenomenon called “binocular rivalry”. All things being equal, the battle between competing images is random: half the time one will dominate our perception, half the time the other.</p>
<p>But crucially, the outcome of this process can be influenced by the content of our imagination, especially when the real and imagined share the same location. The researchers took advantage of this and, each trial, always targeted the real images at one of the imagination spaces that had been triggered in the first phase, to see whether the mental pattern in that location was strong enough to tip the binocular battle one way or the other.</p>
<p>When participants only had to fill one imagination space, and the two rival real patterns were beamed to this location, the mental image there strongly influenced the rivalry phase: participants were swayed towards seeing whichever real pattern corresponded with the imagined pattern seventy per cent of the time (fifty per cent would mean no influence).</p>
<p>But once participants were tasked with filling two imagination spaces, the biasing effect of beaming the real patterns onto either one of those imagined patterns dropped to sixty per cent. Imagining three or more patterns led to a further drop-off in the influence of imagined patterns on the process of binocular rivalry. In fact, the experimenters quickly adjusted their design to avoid trials with six or more imagination spaces as it was clear participants couldn’t handle it.</p>
<p>Doubling the imagination phase duration to 12 seconds didn’t improve success for multiple imagination spaces, ruling out the possibility that more imagining just takes more time to get going. Further experiments revealed how the mind deals with greater demands on the imagination: trying to fill more imagination spaces led to rougher mental images at every location, rather than a few filled vividly with others more or less abandoned. This tallies with participants’ descriptions: they said vividness of the imagined patterns suffered as demand increased. This quantity-quality trade-off suggests some kind of resolution issue: think of limited pixels on a screen, or the space available on an artist’s canvas. These two-dimensional examples may be more than an analogy, as visual brain areas have limited anatomical space to represent information, and often do so across two-dimensional maps.</p>
<p>Keogh and Pearson said their results are beginning to map out the “severe capacity limits” of internal representation, and demonstrate how much the architecture of thought depends on the foundations of perception. This is truly important work in understanding the mind, and how much of the world we can truly grasp. Yet, contrasting the effortful yet arbitrary visualisation investigated in this study with the rich, spontaneously arising visions I’ve personally experienced during meditation – or the overwhelming sense of reality we’ve all experienced in dreams – I’m left wondering how these limits may vary according to our states and motivations. That’s worthy of future research, because feeling out the firmament of the imagination is a most worthwhile goal.</p>
