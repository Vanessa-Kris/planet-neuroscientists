              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smoke-australia-fires-ozone-layer-damage-chemistry-climate">Smoke from Australia’s intense fires in 2019 and 2020 damaged the ozone layer</a></h4>

              
                <p>Towers of smoke that rose high into the stratosphere during Australia’s “black summer” fires in 2019 and 2020 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm5611">destroyed some of Earth’s protective ozone layer</a>, researchers report in the March 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Chemist Peter Bernath of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and his colleagues analyzed data collected in the lower stratosphere during 2020 by a satellite instrument called the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment. It measures how different particles in the atmosphere absorb light at different wavelengths. Such absorption patterns are like fingerprints, identifying what molecules are present in the particles.</p>



<p>The team’s analyses revealed that the particles of smoke, shot into the stratosphere by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/willdfire-thunder-pyro-clouds-aerosols-volcanic-eruptions">fire-fueled thunderstorms called pyrocumulonimbus clouds</a>, contained a variety of mischief-making organic molecules (<em>SN: 12/15/20</em>). The molecules, the team reports, kicked off a series of chemical reactions that altered the balances of gases in Earth’s stratosphere to a degree never before observed in 15 years of satellite measurements. That shuffle included boosting levels of chlorine-containing molecules that ultimately ate away at the ozone.</p>





<p>Ozone concentrations in the stratosphere initially increased from January to March 2020, due to similar chemical reactions — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-toxic-ozone-urban-air-pollution-cities">sometimes with the contribution of wildfire smoke</a> — that produce ozone &nbsp;pollution at ground level (<em>SN: 12/8/21</em>). But from April to December 2020, the ozone levels not only fell, but sank below the average ozone concentration from 2005 to 2019.</p>



<p>Earth’s ozone layer shields the planet from much of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Once depleted by human emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-damaging substances, the layer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drop-cfc-emissions-hole-ozone-layer-back-on-track-closing">has been showing signs of recovery</a> thanks to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to reduce the atmospheric concentrations of those substances (<em>SN: 2/10/21</em>).</p>



<p>But the increasing frequency of large <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">wildfires due to climate change</a> — and their ozone-destroying potential — could become a setback for that rare climate success story, the researchers say (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-light-axion-particle-search-event-horizon">How light from black holes is narrowing the search for axions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The search for a hypothetical subatomic particle that could signal new physics just narrowed a bit — thanks to the light swirling around a gargantuan black hole in another galaxy.</p>



<p>The lightweight particle — dubbed the axion — has been proposed as a solution to the mystery of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particles-axions-how-matter-conquered-universe">why the universe has so little antimatter</a> and as a candidate for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-have-narrowed-the-mass-range-for-hypothetical-dark-matter-axions">elusive dark matter</a> that fills the cosmos (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>;<em> SN: 3/6/20</em>). The twisting and chaotic environs of galaxy M87’s central black hole, the first black hole to have its picture taken, are thought to encode information about such particles.</p>



<p>Now, the particulars of how light around M87’s black hole is oriented could <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01620-3">rule out the likelihood of axion particles in a specific mass range</a>, researchers report March 17 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. This study also shows that scientists could use a similar method in upcoming astrophysical observations to search for these particles in an assortment of masses.</p>





<p>“It’s a very exciting idea,” says physicist Benjamin Safdi of the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with this study. “They&#8217;ve come up with a new method, and they&#8217;ve shown that this method could in principle work.”</p>



<p>First proposed in the late 1970s, axions have yet to be found in experiments. Theoretical work since that initial proposal has shown an extended family of axions could exist, each variety having a different mass but all interacting weakly with ordinary matter. In 2020, physicist Yifan Chen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues described a way to look for axions <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.061102">using observations of the light surrounding black holes</a>.</p>



<p>According to theory, a rapidly spinning black hole can build up a dense clumping of axion particles in the immediate surrounding area. Precisely which types of axions get built up depends on the width of the black hole. And the supermassive black hole in M87 has the right size for brewing a stew of ultralightweight axionlike particles. If this black hole indeed kicked up such a cloud, that would change the orientation, or polarization, of the light coming from that region. In particular, the polarization would wobble over time.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no one had any images of polarized light from a black hole to examine — until last year. That’s when the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, an Earth-spanning network of radio telescopes, revealed its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">image of the polarized light</a> around the supermassive black hole at the center of M87 (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>This “is precisely the information that we need in order to carry out this theoretical proposal,” says particle physicist Yue Zhao of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “We have a very extreme condition that can produce a huge amount of axions, and we have the right tool to study the signature of the axion.”</p>



<p>So Zhao, Chen and colleagues examined the EHT data for a time-varying change in the polarization’s direction. While a cloud of axions would alter the direction, so too will the active and turbulent region around the black hole. This is a “kind of unavoidable background that we have to deal with,” Zhao says. Once they removed that from the total signal, they found that there is not enough of an additional wobble to say any signal could have come from the axion cloud. They ruled out the existence of ultralightweight axions with a mass of about 10 billionths of a billionth of a billionth of an electron’s mass.</p>



<p>But the same technique could be used to hunt for other axionlike particles. “The larger black hole you have, the lighter is your mass,” Zhao says. The physicists hope to use the EHT’s future observations of other black holes to look for axions of different masses. One black hole on EHT’s radar is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/accretion-disk-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole">the behemoth at the center of our own galaxy</a>, Zhao notes, which is about one-thousandth the mass of M87’s (<em>SN: 6/5/19</em>). If our galaxy’s monster black hole has a cloud of axions, those would be heavier particles.</p>



<p>“This idea of looking for these axionlike particles, is, in my opinion, the most exciting thing happening in particle physics at the moment,” says Safdi.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780374110376">The Brain in Search of Itself</a><br><em>Benjamin Ehrlich</em><br><em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $35</em></p>



<p>Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal is known as the father of modern neuroscience. Cajal was the first to see that the brain is built of discrete cells, the “butterflies of the soul,” as he put it, that hold our memories, thoughts and emotions.</p>



<p>With the same unflinching scrutiny that Cajal applied to cells, biographer Benjamin Ehrlich examines Cajal’s life. In <em>The Brain in Search of Itself</em>, Ehrlich sketches Cajal as he moved through his life, capturing moments both mundane and extraordinary.</p>





<p>Some of the portraits show Cajal as a young boy in the mid-19th century. He was born in the mountains of Spain. As a child, he yearned to be an artist despite his disapproving and domineering father. Other portraits show him as a barber-surgeon’s apprentice, a deeply insecure bodybuilder, a writer of romance stories, a photographer and a military physician suffering from malaria in Cuba.</p>



<p>The book is meticulously researched and utterly comprehensive, covering the time before Cajal’s birth to after his death in 1934 at age 82. Ehrlich pulls out significant moments that bring readers inside Cajal’s mind through his own writings in journals and books. These glimpses help situate Cajal’s scientific discoveries within the broader context of his life.</p>





<p>Arriving in a new town as a child, for instance, the young Cajal wore the wrong clothes and spoke the wrong dialect. Embarrassed, the sensitive child began to act out, fighting and bragging and skipping school. Around this time, Cajal developed an insatiable impulse to draw. “He scribbled constantly on every surface he could find — on scraps of paper and school textbooks, on gates, walls and doors — scrounging money to spend on paper and pencils, pausing on his jaunts through the countryside to sit on a hillside and sketch the scenery,” Ehrlich writes.</p>



<p>Cajal was always a deep observer, whether the subject was the stone wall in front of a church, an ant trying to make its way home or dazzlingly complicated brain tissue. He saw details that other people missed. This talent is what ultimately propelled him in the 1880s to his big discovery.</p>



<p>At the time, a prevailing concept of the brain, called the reticular theory, held that the tangle of brain fibers was one unitary whole organ, indivisible. Peering into a microscope at all sorts of nerve cells from all sorts of creatures, Cajal saw over and over again that these cells in fact had space between them, “free endings,” as he put it. “Independent nerve cells were everywhere,” Ehrlich writes. The brain, therefore, was made of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/see-these-first-kind-views-living-human-nerve-cells">many discrete cells, all with their own different shapes</a> and jobs (<em>SN: 11/25/17, p. 32</em>).</p>



<p>Cajal’s observations ultimately gained traction with other scientists and earned him the 1906 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. He shared the prize with Camillo Golgi, the Italian physician who developed a stain that marked cells, called the black reaction. Golgi was a staunch proponent of the reticular theory, putting him at odds with Cajal, who used the black reaction to show discrete cells’ endings. The two men had not met before their trip to Stockholm to attend the awards ceremony.</p>

<p>Cajal and Golgi’s irreconcilable ideas — and their hostility toward each other — came through clearly from speeches they gave after their prizes were awarded. “Whoever believed in the ‘so-called’ independence of nerve cells, [Golgi] sneered, had not observed the evidence closely enough,” Ehrlich writes. The next day, Cajal countered with a precise, forceful rebuttal, detailing his work on “nearly all the organs of the nervous system and on a large number of zoological species.” He added, “I have never [encountered] a single observed fact contrary to these assertions.”</p>



<p>Cajal’s fiercely defended insights came from careful observations, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/famous-brain-sketches-cajal-come-life-again-embroideries">his intuitive drawings of nerve cells</a> did much to convince others that he was right (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 32</em>). But as the book makes clear, Cajal was not a mere automaton who copied exactly the object in front of him. Like any artist, he saw through the extraneous details of his subjects and captured their essence. “He did not copy images — he <em>created</em> them,” Ehrlich writes. Cajal’s insights “bear the unique stamp of his mind and his experience of the world in which he lived.”</p>



<p>This biography draws a vivid picture of that world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-sea-ocean-new-maps">Even the sea has light pollution. These new maps show its extent</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first global atlas of ocean light pollution shows that large swaths of the sea are squinting in the glare of humans’ artificial lights at night.</p>



<p>From urbanized coastlines along the Persian Gulf to offshore oil complexes in the North Sea, humans’ afterglow is powerful enough <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2021.00049">to penetrate deep into many coastal waters,</a> potentially changing the behaviors of creatures that live there, researchers report December 13 in <em>Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene</em>. Regional and seasonal differences — such as phytoplankton blooms or sediment from rivers — also affect the depth to which light penetrates.</p>



<p>Artificial lights are known to affect land dwellers, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weather-radar-grasshopper-swarm-las-vegas-night-artificial-light">such as by swelling</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">shrinking certain insect populations</a>, or by making it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-prolong-risk-sparrows-passing-along-west-nile-virus">harder for sparrows to fight off West Nile virus</a> (<em>SN: 3/30/21; SN: 8/31/21; SN: 1/19/18</em>). But the bright lights of coastal cities, oil rigs and other offshore structures can also create a powerful glow in the sky over the sea.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>All lit up</h3>



<p>The waters of the Persian Gulf&nbsp;(upper right)&nbsp;are heavily light-polluted, due to extensive offshore development and — to a lesser extent — its populous coastal cities.&nbsp;Light pollution near Jeddah, on the western coast of Saudi Arabia, also extends deep into the waters of the Red Sea (at left).&nbsp;These effects combine to send biologically significant levels of light down as far as 50 meters in some parts of the water.</p>

<p>To assess where this glow is strongest, marine biogeochemist Tim Smyth of Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England and colleagues combined a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/third-population-cant-see-milky-way-night">world atlas of artificial night sky brightness</a> created in 2016 with ocean and atmosphere data (<em>SN: 6/10/16</em>). Those data include shipboard measurements of artificial light, satellite data collected monthly from 1998 to 2017 to estimate the prevalence of light-scattering phytoplankton and sediment, and computer simulations of how different wavelengths of light move through the water.</p>



<p>Not all species are equally sensitive to light, so to assess impact, the team focused on copepods, ubiquitous shrimplike creatures that are a key part of many ocean food webs. Like other tiny zooplankton, copepods use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/moon-drives-migration-arctic-zooplankton">the sun or the winter moon as a cue</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/masses-shrimp-and-krill-may-play-huge-role-mixing-oceans">plunge en masse</a> to the dark deep, seeking safety from surface predators (<em>SN: 1/11/16</em>; <em>SN: 4/18/18</em>).</p>



<p>Humans’ nighttime light has the most impact in the top meter of the water, the team found. Here, artificial light is intense enough to cause a biological response across nearly 2 million square kilometers of ocean, an area roughly that of Mexico. Twenty meters down, the total affected area shrinks by more than half to 840,000 square kilometers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sacred-pool-ancient-seafarers-phoenicians-largest-mediterranean">Ancient seafarers built the Mediterranean’s largest known sacred pool</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a tiny island off Sicily’s west coast, a huge pool long ago displayed the star-studded reflections of the gods.</p>



<p>Scientists have long thought that an ancient rectangular basin, on the island of Motya, served as an artificial inner harbor, or perhaps a dry dock, for Phoenician mariners roughly 2,550 years ago. Instead, the water-filled structure is the largest known sacred pool from the ancient Mediterranean world, says archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro of Sapienza University of Rome.</p>



<p>Phoenicians, who adopted cultural influences from many Mediterranean societies on their sea travels, put the pool <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2022.8">at the center of a religious compound</a> in a port city also dubbed Motya, Nigro reports in the April <em>Antiquity</em>.</p>





<p>The pool and three nearby temples were aligned with the positions of specific stars and constellations on key days of the year, such as the summer and winter solstices, Nigro found. Each of those celestial bodies was associated with a particular Phoenician god.</p>



<p>At night, the reflecting surface of the pool, which was slightly longer and wider than an Olympic-sized swimming pool, was used to make astronomical observations by marking stars’ positions with poles, Nigro suspects. Discoveries of a navigation instrument’s pointer in one temple and the worn statue of an Egyptian god associated with astronomy found in a corner of the pool support that possibility.</p>



<p>It was an archaeologist who explored Motya around a century ago who first described the large pool as a harbor that connected to the sea by a channel. A similar harbor had previously been discovered at Carthage, a Phoenician city on North Africa’s coast.</p>



<p>But excavations and radiocarbon dating conducted at Motya since 2002 by Nigro, working with the Superintendence of Trapani in Sicily and the G. Whitaker Foundation in Palermo, have overturned that view.</p>



<p>“The pool could not have served as a harbor, as it was not connected to the sea,” Nigro says. He and his team temporarily drained the basin, showing that it is instead fed by natural springs. Only after Greek invaders conquered Motya in a battle that ended in 396 B.C. was a channel dug from the pool to a nearby lagoon, Nigro’s group found.</p>



<p>Phoenicians settled on Motya between 800 B.C. and 750 B.C. The sacred pool, including a pedestal in the center that originally supported a statue of the Phoenician god Ba’al, was built between 550 B.C. and 520 B.C., Nigro says. Two clues suggested that the pedestal had once held a statue of Ba’al. First, after draining the pool, Nigro’s team found a stone block with the remnants of a large, sculpted foot at the basin’s edge. And an inscription in a small pit at one corner of the pool includes a dedication to Ba’al, a primary Phoenician god.</p>

<p>Gods worshipped by Phoenicians at Motya and elsewhere were closely identified with gods of other Mediterranean societies. For instance, Ba’al was a close counterpart of the divine hero Hercules in Greek mythology.</p>



<p>An ability to incorporate other people’s deities into their own religion “was probably one of the keys to Phoenicians’ success throughout the Mediterranean,” says archaeologist Susan Sherratt of the University of Sheffield in England, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/charting-past-surveys-map-two-lost-harbors-phoenicia">Seafaring traders now called Phoenicians </a>lived in eastern Mediterranean cities founded more than 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/25/06</em>). Phoenicians established settlements from Cyprus to Spain’s Atlantic coast. Some researchers suspect that <a href="https://www.asor.org/anetoday/2018/07/Were-There-Phoenicians">Phoenicians lacked a unifying cultural or ethnic identity.</a></p>



<p>Nigro disagrees. Phoenicians developed an influential writing system and spoke a common Semitic language, key markers of a common eastern Mediterranean culture, he contends. As these seafarers settled islands and coastal regions stretching west across the Mediterranean, they created hybrid cultures with native groups, Nigro suspects.</p>



<p>Motya excavations indicate that Phoenician newcomers created a distinctive West Phoenician culture via interactions with people already living there. Pottery and other artifacts indicate that groups from Greece, Crete and other Mediterranean regions periodically settled on the island starting as early as around 4,000 years ago. Metal objects and other cultural remains from various stages of Motya’s development display influences from all corners of the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>Though much remains unknown about political and social life at Motya, its Phoenician founders oversaw an experiment in cultural tolerance that lasted at least 400 years, Nigro says.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Uncovering the Topology of Time-Varying fMRI Data Using Cubical Persistence&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology
for gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed
from fMRI measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over
time. However, analysing such data presents a challenge due to the
large degree of noise and person-to-person variation in how
information is represented in the brain. To address this challenge, we
present a novel topological approach that encodes each time point in
an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features,
i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation
naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust
to noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be
clustered to find meaningful groupings between participants, and that
they are also useful in studying within-subject brain state
trajectories of subjects performing a particular task. Here, we apply
both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to a group of
participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We observe
significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall
topological activity between adults and children watching the same
movie.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-hemophilia-clotting-blood-clot-protein">A gene therapy for hemophilia boosts levels of a crucial clotting protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>A gene-based therapy is potentially a step closer to becoming a one-time treatment for men with hemophilia. The life-threatening genetic disorder hinders the body’s ability to form blood clots.</p>



<p>In hemophilia A, the most common type, the gene responsible for a blood clotting protein called factor VIII has errors, leading the body to produce an insufficient amount of the protein. A new study describes how 132 men with a severe form of the disease who received <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2113708">one infusion of the gene therapy</a> fared. A year later, 88 percent of them had factor VIII levels high enough to have either a mild form or no disease, researchers report March 16 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Hemophilia A is an inherited disorder. The gene that provides instructions for making factor VIII is found on the X chromosome, so the condition more typically affects males than females. In the United States, there are 12 hemophilia A cases per 100,000 males.</p>





<p>The severity of hemophilia is classified by the amount of factor VIII that the body manages to produce. People with mild disease, who have 5 to 40 percent of typical factor VIII levels, are most likely to have excessive bleeding only after injury or surgery. Moderate hemophilia, with levels 1 to 5 percent of the usual amount, can also include bleeding that occurs spontaneously, without a clear cause. People with severe hemophilia have next to no factor VIII and, without treatment, face frequent, spur-of-the-moment bleeding internally that can damage their joints or brain.</p>



<p>But thanks to the treatment options available, hemophilia patients “now have a normal life expectancy and are encouraged to live normal lives,” says director of the Washington Center for Bleeding Disorders and hematologist Rebecca Kruse-Jarres of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the gene therapy study.</p>



<p>The standard treatment to prevent bleeding is a replacement infusion of factor VIII, which is needed every 2 to 3 days. That means a person with hemophilia A could face more than 150 of these treatments a year. More recently, a monoclonal antibody that mimics the action of factor VIII has become available, giving adults and children with the disease a once-weekly treatment option.</p>



<p>The gene therapy, called valoctocogene roxaparvovec, consists of a one-time infusion containing genetic instructions for producing factor VIII, delivered by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-gene-therapy-techniques-show-potential">an adeno-associated virus</a>, which does not cause disease (<em>SN: 10/28/02</em>). The virus is taken up by many different cells, but only liver cells can use the instructions to make the clotting protein.</p>



<p>While most of the study participants saw an improvement in their factor VIII levels, the therapy did not work for a small percentage. And most participants also experienced a concerning side effect — elevated levels of a liver enzyme that can be sign of inflammation or potential damage to the organ, which required treatment with immunosuppressants.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear how long the effects of the treatment will last. The researchers report that in 17 participants followed for two years, the clotting protein levels achieved in the first year decreased in the second year. The gene therapy can only be given once because a person would have an immune response to a second dose. More research is needed to understand the long-term durability of the treatment and the best way to manage the increased liver enzyme levels, says study coauthor and hematologist Margareth Ozelo of the University of Campinas in São Paulo.</p>



<p>“This will be not a treatment for all patients,” Ozelo says, but “will benefit a group of patients in the hemophilia community.” With more work, it may be possible to determine which patients are more likely to respond well to the gene therapy, she says.</p>



<p>Gene therapy could be a wonderful option, because it would almost eliminate the burden of treatments, says Kruse-Jarres. But when considering gene therapy, “a lot of unknowns come into play,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fabric-hear-heartbeat-fiber-vibration-voltage-sound-material">This fabric can hear your heartbeat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Someday our clothing may eavesdrop on the soundtrack of our lives, capturing the noises around and inside us.</p>



<p>A new fiber acts as a microphone — picking up speech, rustling leaves and chirping birds — and turns those acoustic signals into electrical ones. Woven into a fabric, the material <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04476-9">can even hear handclaps and faint sounds</a>, such as its wearer’s heartbeat, researchers report March 16 in <em>Nature</em>. Such fabrics could provide a comfortable, nonintrusive — even fashionable — way to monitor body functions or aid with hearing.</p>



<p>Acoustic fabrics have existed for perhaps hundreds of years, but they’re used to dampen sound, says Wei Yan, a materials scientist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Fabric as a microphone is “totally a different concept,” says Yan, who worked on the fabric while at MIT.</p>





<p>Yan and his colleagues were inspired by the human eardrum. Sound waves cause vibrations in the eardrum, which are converted to electrical signals by the cochlea. “It turns out that this eardrum is made of fibers,” says Yoel Fink, a materials scientist at MIT. In the eardrum’s inner layers, collagen fibers radiate from the center, while others form concentric rings. The crisscrossing fibers play a role in hearing and look similar to the fabrics people weave, Fink says.</p>



<p>Analogous to what’s happening in an eardrum, sound vibrates fabric at the nanoscale. In the new fabric, cotton fibers and others of a somewhat stiff material called Twaron efficiently convert incoming sound to vibrations. Woven together with these threads is a single fiber that contains a blend of piezoelectric materials, which produce a voltage <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-antennas-are-hundredth-size-todays-devices">when pressed or bent</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/17</em>). The buckling and bending of the piezoelectric-containing fiber create electrical signals that can be sent through a tiny circuit board to a device that reads and records the voltage.</p>



<p>The fabric microphone is sensitive to a range of noise levels, from a quiet library to heavy traffic, the team reports, although it is continuing to investigate what signal processing is needed to detangle target sounds from ambient noise. Integrated into clothing, this sound-sensing fabric feels like regular fabric, Yan says. And it continued to work as a microphone after washing it 10 times.</p>

<p>Piezoelectric materials have “huge potential” for applications from observing the function of bodies to monitoring the integrity of aircraft materials, says Vijay Thakur, a materials scientist at Scotland&#8217;s Rural College in Edinburgh who was not part of this work. They’ve even been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nanogenerators-harvest-bodys-energy-power-devices">proposed for energy generation</a>, but, he says, many uses have been limited by the tiny voltages they produce (<em>SN: 10/1/15</em>). The way the fibers are made in this fabric — sandwiching a blend of piezoelectric materials between other components, including a flexible, stretchy outer material — concentrates the energy from the vibrations into the piezoelectric layer, enhancing the signal it produces.</p>



<p>As a proof of concept, the team incorporated the fabric into a shirt, which could hear its wearer’s heart like a stethoscope does. Used this way, the fabric microphone could listen for murmurs and may someday be able to provide information similar to an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart, Thakur says. If it proves effective as a monitoring and diagnostic tool, placing such microphones into clothing may someday make it easier for doctors to track heart conditions in young children, who have trouble keeping still, he says.</p>



<p>The team also anticipates that fabric microphones could aid hearing and communication. Another shirt the team created had two piezoelectric fibers spaced apart on the shirt’s back. Based on when each fiber picked up the sound, this shirt can be used to detect the direction a clap came from. And when hooked up to a power source, the fabric microphones can project sound as a speaker.</p>



<p>“For the past 20 years, we’ve been trying to introduce a new way of thinking about fabrics,” Fink says. Beyond providing beauty and warmth, fabrics may help solve technological problems. And perhaps, Fink says, they can beautify technology too.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-raindrops-car-windows-gravity-wind">Physicists explain the mesmerizing movements of raindrops on car windshields</a></h4>

              
                <p>Staring at raindrops on a car windshield is more than just a way to get in touch with your emo side. You might also learn some physics.</p>



<p>As a car speeds along in the rain, some water droplets slide up the windshield, others slide down, and some seem stuck in place. “It’s very hypnotizing, isn’t it?” says fluid mechanics researcher Sungyon Lee of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.</p>



<p>Lee and Alireza Hooshanginejad, a fluid mechanics researcher at Cornell University, used mathematical equations to describe the forces on the raindrops. That work <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.033601">revealed several factors</a> that determine a droplet’s behavior, the pair reports March 4 in <em>Physical Review Fluids</em>.</p>





<p>Raindrops on a moving car’s angled windshield simultaneously experience forces from gravity and from the wind that speeds over the car. The direction that a raindrop moves depends on its size, Lee and Hooshanginejad say.</p>



<p>For larger raindrops, gravity wins, pulling the droplets down. For smaller raindrops, wind prevails, pushing them up the slope. For medium-sized raindrops, the forces balance out and the droplets sit still. The tiniest raindrops also stay put, because the wind doesn’t provide enough oomph to overcome water&#8217;s tendency to adhere to the glass.</p>



<p>Other factors affect the raindrops&#8217; behavior, too. As the car’s speed, and therefore wind speed, increases, larger raindrops get pushed up the windshield. Decreasing the car’s speed has the opposite effect. And if the car moves slowly enough, there won’t be enough wind to coax any raindrops to move upward. Meanwhile, windshields that are more steeply angled allow smaller raindrops to succumb to gravity than shallower windshields do, the results suggest.</p>



<p>To simplify the calculations, the researchers studied an idealized version of raindrops, based on only two dimensions. That means that the results won’t translate perfectly to real-world raindrops, Lee says, but can still give a sense of why water droplets do what they do.</p>

<hr />
<p>I am an Egyptian Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. I work as a consultant of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a University Hospital, one of the largest maternity hospitals in the Middle East and Africa, with more than 16,500 births per year. A decade ago, I established the Egyptian Center of Evidence-Based Medicine (ECEBM) to produce and disseminate high quality synthesis of research evidence, to support guideline development, and to strengthen research capacity in developing countries. I am a Senior Editorial Board Member of <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of the editorial board to help the research community and to learn from them. I have particular interest in research related to high-risk pregnancy, preterm birth, and reproductive health. I contribute as a member of Guideline Development Groups of several international organizations to produce synthesized evidence and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Recently I contributed as a regional coordinator for the WHO Global Maternal Sepsis Study. Currently, I contribute as a principal investigator to an international multi-country multi-center randomized trial for women with severe pre-eclampsia. Further, I lead a group of research fellows at the ECEBM in collaboration with the WHO in multiple research projects related to women’s reproductive span, maternal age at first and last birth, and finally the indicators of fertility care. Recently, we have <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-021-01495-y">published</a> a synthesis of research evidence regarding the effects of self-administered versus healthcare provider-administered subcutaneous medroxy progesterone for improving continuation of contraceptive use. We have shown that self-administration, compared to provider-administration, increased continuation of contraceptive use. Self-injection appears to be making more of an impact on continuation for younger compared to older women and on women living in low- and middle-income compared to high-income countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>Self-care contributes to reproductive healthcare by enhancing health literacy, empowering women and lowering pressure on health systems.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Link to the SDGs</strong></h3>
<p>Our recent published evidence synthesis and current work are directly related to at least two SDG goals, namely Goals 3 (Good health and wellbeing) and 5 (Gender equality). The work will help to reduce maternal mortality, to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.</p>
<p>Self-care refers to the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider. Self-care contributes to reproductive healthcare by enhancing health literacy, empowering women and lowering pressure on health systems. The value of self-care goes beyond its impact on resource constraints. Self-care interventions give women greater choice, access, control, satisfaction and affordable options to manage their reproductive health needs. This will help achieve health-related SDGs and cost savings to health systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the unique and critical role that self-care interventions have played in mitigating disease and saving lives through personal self-care actions such as wearing masks and physical distancing, and prioritization at national levels of self-care interventions such as smoking cessation, exercise, healthy diet, personal hygiene, etc., that people can use during period of lockdown.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenges and future directions</strong></h3>
<p>We need to work together to reduce research waste. Each step in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical studies must be rigorous to avoid misleading results and wasting valuable resources. We need to mandate the public availability of a detailed written protocol with each manuscript submitted for publication. Several challenges exist globally. These include failure to involve knowledgeable methodologists from the outset and failure to train clinical researchers, who are usually overwhelmed by their clinical workload and duties. More attention is mandatory to the issue of research reproducibility. Finally, reward systems incentivize quantity more than quality, and novelty more than reliability, leading to a flood of publications that might be methodologically flawed, misleading, or at the very least decent but not useful. This needs to be rectified if we care to reduce research waste.</p>

<p>We must make scientific research FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). The first step in (re)using research data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Once we find the required data, we need to know how they can be accessed. The data need to inter-operate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. The goal is to optimize the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined using different methods of evidence synthesis.</p>
<p>We need to expand our implementation research that addresses implementation bottlenecks, identifies optimal approaches for a particular setting, and promotes the uptake of research findings. It is critical for obstetricians to understand the most effective pathways from research to practical application. Implementation research, being systematic, multidisciplinary, contextual, and complex, is essential in obstetrics and gynecology because it addresses the challenges of the know-do gap in real-world settings and the practicalities of achieving national and global health goals.</p>
<p>In short, I believe we need better research, not only more research.</p>

<p>Lithium, used in lightweight, rechargeable batteries for electric cars, smartphones and other items, is expected to play a major role in helping fight climate change. Within the next decade or so, global demand for the metal is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">estimated to quadruple</a> (<em>SN</em>:<em> 5/</em>7<em>/19</em>). The new finding highlights that the quest for lithium is not without drawbacks, fitting into a growing body of research revealing lithium mining’s adverse impacts on ecosystems.</p>



<p>One of the world’s richest deposits of lithium spans parts of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina, an area sometimes referred to as the “lithium triangle.” The region is also home to the Atacama Desert plateau, one of the driest places on Earth, and hosts a series of shallow, salt flat lake ecosystems that depend on the limited water supply. These ecologically sensitive “salares” nourish cyanobacteria and diatom algae, which in turn are eaten by three types of flamingos, half of the world’s flamingo species.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This fragile ecosystem is now in an existential conflict because lithium refinement ponds and other industrial mining processes use a massive amount of water — an estimated 400,000 liters per ton of lithium, says Nathan Senner, a population ecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there’s only so much water to go around. “This is literally the driest desert in the world,” Senner says. “Much of that [mining] water has to come from groundwater.”</p>



<p>Senner —&nbsp;with ecologist Jorge Gutiérrez of the University of Extremadura in Spain and bird ecologist Juan Navedo of the Austral University of Chile in Valdivia and others — gathered over 30 years’ worth of flamingo surveys. The researchers also examined satellite imagery tracking water surface area changes in five salt flats in the Chilean portion of the lithium triangle.&nbsp;And the team tracked cyanobacteria levels using satellite data, along with climatic factors that could influence the salt flats’ water levels, such as precipitation and temperature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Senner and his colleagues found that since 1984, the five salares have each shrunk by at least 30 percent in surface area, partially due to increased evaporation, which is influenced by climatic factors like wind, humidity and temperature. &nbsp;The team also found that there’s a great deal of variability in water level between years. And those fluctuations appear to strongly dictate the number of flamingos in a given year by determining the availability of the birds’ food.</p>



<p>Flamingo counts “can change by literally thousands of individuals across just a couple of years,” Senner says.</p>



<p>The long-term drying trend from climate change, which may reduce overall availability of food for flamingos, is being exacerbated by ever-thirsty lithium mining, the team says. And it’s leaving a mark on two of the flamingo species: the Andean (<em>Phoenicoparrus andinus</em>) and the James’ (<em>P. jamesi</em>) flamingos, whose populations declined 12 percent and 10 percent over 11 years, respectively, in Chile’s Salar de Atacama. This is a loss of hundreds of birds.</p>



<p>The team ties this decline directly to lithium mining. As the mining ponds grew in the Salar, nearby James’ and Andean flamingo populations dwindled in tight correlation. Water loss from new mining activity may be a major culprit. Between 1986 and 2018, the groundwater pumping for lithium production increased from zero to 1.8 cubic meters per second. Simultaneously, the Salar lost about five football fields’ worth of surface area every year.</p>

<p>Though the declines didn’t occur over the entire region, the findings are especially concerning for these two species because they don’t live anyplace else in the world. “They are entirely wedded to these saline lakes,” Senner says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flamingo declines and salar drying could have reverberating effects on people too since the popular, flamingo-based ecotourism in the region would probably suffer, the team says.</p>



<p>“Science-based conservation management guidelines might still allow future preservation of some key hypersaline systems in the region,” says Mattia Saccò, an ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, who was not involved with the research. </p>



<p>As the need for lithium is set to rise for use in technologies like electric vehicles, the threat to the flamingos may only increase.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a real conundrum because obviously no one is going to argue that climate change is not this monster that we need to contend with,” Senner says.&nbsp;Still, as this study suggests, the technologies that could help humankind combat climate change may have their own suite of negative ecological effects. Being aware of those consequences is going to be crucial to weighing the costs and benefits of such solutions, Senner says.</p>



<p>Finding ways to reduce those ecological costs could be one helpful way forward, he says, particularly by making lithium mining more water efficient or improving the ability to recycle lithium from used batteries.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-mask-mandate-coronavirus-transmission-covid">School mask mandates in the U.S. reduced coronavirus transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>The verdict is, once again, in: Masking in schools is effective.</p>



<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic’s delta variant wave, schools that required masking had approximately <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2022-056687/185379/School-Masking-Policies-and-Secondary-SARS-CoV-2">one-fourth the rates</a> of in-school coronavirus transmission than schools with optional or partial masking policies, researchers report online March 9 in <em>Pediatrics</em>.</p>



<p>While the findings reinforce past research on masking efficacy, this is the first study to focus on secondary transmissions, or transmissions that happen at school, and how the rate is impacted by vaccination, community spread and district size, says study coauthor Danny Benjamin, an epidemiologist at Duke University. The team found that schools play a small role in terms of transmission in a community, accounting for less than 10 percent of total cases in the study. But masks are what help keep that number low.</p>

<p>To conduct a wide-reaching study, the researchers reached out to every kindergarten through 12th grade public school district in the United States — more than 13,800 of them — to track their case numbers and origins from July to December 2021. The 61 districts that answered the call consisted of more than 1 million students and nearly 160,000 staff across nine states.</p>



<p>Now that vaccines are available for kids ages 5 to 11, the researchers are collecting more data from schools. Masking has continued to work during the omicron variant surge, but even short intervals of mask removal, such as at lunchtime, result in much higher transmission than during the delta wave, Benjamin says.</p>



<p>As state mask mandates lift, the onus for mask requirements in schools falls to the school districts. To help school administrators decide if and when students need to mask, Benjamin and colleagues developed the <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiY2EwMWM5MWYtYjFlMS00ZDhjLTllZWItMWEyZWNhZGQ3NjFhIiwidCI6ImNiNzJjNTRlLTRhMzEtNGQ5ZS1iMTRhLTFlYTM2ZGZhYzk0YyIsImMiOjF9">Masking and Mitigation Considerations Calculator</a>. The tool allows administrators to input their community COVID-19 rates and determine how masking decisions in schools will affect case numbers.</p>



<p>“This is a very granular and local and nuanced decision,” Benjamin says. Right now, as the omicron surge recedes in some parts of the country, “it’s a reasonable discussion to be having.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/15/a-mothers-early-life-experiences-of-adversity-can-influence-her-babys-sensitivity-to-stress/">A mother’s early life experiences of adversity can influence her baby’s sensitivity to stress</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Over the past few decades, it’s become clear that experiences even before birth influence later psychological wellbeing. A mother’s stress levels during pregnancy have emerged as a key influence. Greater stress seems to programme her child to &#8220;expect&#8221; a difficult environment, and so to be more sensitive to potential threats — and more vulnerable to developing an anxiety disorder. It’s uncertain, though, whether adversity earlier in life affects stress levels during pregnancy, and so might impact the child’s sensitivity to stress. So Cassandra L. Hendrix at New York University and colleagues set out to investigate.</p>



<span id="more-45267"></span>



<p>For <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-30396-001">their study</a>, reported in the <em>Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, </em>the team recruited 217 Black American mother-infant pairs from two hospitals in the Atlanta, Georgia area. To try to ensure a socioeconomically diverse sample, one hospital was public and the other private.</p>



<p>At around the end of the first trimester, each woman reported on their perceived stress, anxiety and depression. The team combined their answers to generate single individual scores of early pregnancy prenatal distress. The women also reported on their lifetime experience of race-based discrimination, and on any traumas, such as abuse or divorce, during their childhood. When they were in their third trimester, they completed the stress, anxiety and depression questionnaires again, generating late pregnancy distress scores.</p>



<p>After their babies were born, the team measured the infants’ stress sensitivity in two ways.</p>



<p>Firstly, they used a behavioural measure, called the NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale. For this, a trained examiner induces mild stress, and monitors the infant’s responses. This was done when the babies were just two weeks old.</p>



<p>The second measure was hormonal. The team measured levels of cortisol (which is produced as part of the stress response) in saliva samples gathered from a subset of the babies when they were aged between three and six months.</p>



<p>Their analysis of all the data led to a few main findings.</p>



<p>Greater maternal distress in late pregnancy, specifically, was linked to poorer scores on one component of the behavioural measure: attention. This was a measure of the infant’s ability to respond to, attend to, and track objects in the environment. Earlier work has found that newborns with poorer scores on this grow into toddlers who are less able to regulate their emotions — which makes them more reactive to potentially stressful experiences. (In line with these findings, the researchers found that lower attention at two weeks was linked to greater cortisol responsivity at 3-6 months).</p>



<p>The researchers also found that women who’d experienced more race-based discrimination during their lives also reported higher levels of late pregnancy distress. Greater experience of race-based discrimination was, then, indirectly linked to lower newborn attention scores</p>



<p>“This pattern of results highlights late gestation as a sensitive period for the intergenerational effects of stress exposure on developing attentional abilities,” the team writes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the team also found that, even when prenatal distress scores were taken into account, those who’d reported more race-based discrimination before pregnancy and/or more childhood trauma were more likely to have babies with atypical cortisol levels.</p>



<p>This suggests that however stressed a pregnant woman feels, stressful experiences from <em>before</em> her pregnancy can also have their own impact on her child’s sensitivity to stress. This might happen through changes to the way particular genes are expressed in the mother, affecting her own cortisol levels and then influencing her foetus as it develops.</p>



<p>It isn’t easy to draw very firm conclusions from this kind of research. That’s because it’s hard to control for every possible factor that might influence a child’s stress sensitivity. For example, a woman who is stressed late in pregnancy is likely to still be stressed after her baby is born — and this will affect the infant, too. It’s also certainly worth pointing out that the link reported between maternal distress in late pregnancy and poorer scores on attention was only marginally statistically significant.</p>



<p>However, the team is far from alone in finding that stress has a &#8220;cascading&#8221; impact across generations. And as they write, work that enhances our understanding of the specific contributors to this process “is integral in illuminating how adversity becomes biologically embedded and ultimately increases psychological risk across generations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saber-toothed-mammal-hypercarnivore-fossil">A new saber-toothed mammal was among the first hypercarnivores</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 42 million years ago, a fearsome bobcat-sized creature prowled the forests of what is now San Diego. Unlike most animals at the time, it was a hypercarnivore, built to eat meat and almost only meat.</p>



<p>Meet <em>Diegoaelurus vanvalkenburghae — </em>a newly identified species of the mysterious and now-extinct Machaeroidine family, thought to be the first mammals with saberlike fangs and sharp slicing teeth.</p>



<p>Until now, only about a dozen other Machaeroidine fossils have been described, most from Wyoming but a few from Asia. Paleontologists identified <a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13032">this new </a><a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13032">predator</a>, described March 15 in <em>PeerJ</em>, thanks to a 71-millimeter-long lower jawbone with teeth that was originally found in a San Diego County fossil bed.</p>



<p>The fossil gives away that the creature had long saberlike canine teeth because the bony chin is downturned, to protect the fangs, and there is a gap in the lower teeth to fit them, says Ashley Poust, a paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. The canines themselves weren’t recovered.<a></a></p>

<p>“Those big fangs were either used to bite into the throat of the prey or were used to rip and tear the flesh,” Poust says. “This fossil, in particular, helps us understand what the whole food web would&#8217;ve looked like.… Now we know that there might have been this crazy saber-toothed animal stalking primates in the branches or maybe stalking the tapirs in the leaves below.”</p>



<p>Today’s hypercarnivores range from massive polar bears and fierce tigers to your cuddly (or not) housecat. But that lifestyle was uncommon for predators of the Eocene Epoch, which ended around 34 million years ago, and there aren&#8217;t a lot of these carnivores known from that time.</p>



<p>So <em>D. vanvalkenburghae</em> provides an early glimpse into how animals independently evolved the ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-reveal-saber-toothed-cats-may-have-pierced-rivals-skulls">slice flesh with ease</a> (<em>SN: 5/31/19</em>). Such daggerlike fangs have turned up in a wide range of ancient animals from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saber-toothed-anchovy-relatives-hunted-sea-50-million-years-ago">anchovies</a> to the much more recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saber-toothed-cats-smilodon">saber-toothed cats</a> such as&nbsp;<em>Smilodon, w</em>hich appeared on Earth millions of years after <em>D. vanvalkenburghae</em> went extinct (<em>SN: 5/18/20; SN: 3/24/19</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/murder-hornet-asian-giant-trap-sex-pheromone">How to make irresistible traps for Asian giant hornets using sex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Male Asian giant hornets captivated by the chemical signals of a ready-to-mate queen could one day find themselves stuck in a trap instead.</p>



<p>In a new study, scientists identified three chemicals in the sex pheromone of Asian giant hornet queens. When traps with those chemicals were placed near the hornets’ nests in China — part of their native range — <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.01.065">the traps ensnared thousands of males but no other insects</a>, researchers report March 14 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The finding is a step toward designing pheromone traps, a common tool to monitor or control insect populations, for these hornets, says James Nieh, a behavioral ecologist at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Starting in 2019, nests housing Asian giant hornets (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>) — nicknamed “murder hornets” for their habit of feasting on honeybees — have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada">popped up in a few places</a> in western North America (<em>SN: 5/29/20</em>). Studies hint that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornets-new-map-habitat-united-states">the insects could spread</a> across eastern Washington, Oregon and British Columbia in Canada, and scientists have launched efforts to control the invasion (<em>SN:</em> <em>10/1/20</em>). The Washington State Department of Agriculture even <a href="https://agr.wa.gov/departments/insects-pests-and-weeds/insects/hornets/trapping">encourages state residents to help trap the hornets</a> using plastic bottles, orange juice and rice cooking wine. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But potent insect traps should provide “something that would ideally be irresistible,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, Nieh and colleagues identified hexanoic acid, octanoic acid and decanoic acid as key components of a queen’s sex pheromone. In the lab, male hornet antennae reacted — a sign of attraction — to each of the pure compounds as well as a mixture of the three. The team then crafted traps using a sticky board, a dummy male hornet and a vial filled with each of the individual pure acids, a mix of the three or extracts from the pheromone-secreting glands from a queen.</p>





<p>The male hornets had a clear preference for the queen extracts, though the isolated chemicals as well as mixes of the three trapped many hornets as well. In one test, for example, extracts from just one gland trapped about 500 male hornets — more than twice the number trapped by full concentrations of the three-chemical cocktail, which itself performed on par with two of the undiluted isolated chemicals. Control traps lacking the extracts or pure chemicals, meanwhile, attracted few males.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because male Asian giant hornets were most attracted to the pheromone gland chemicals compared with the individual acids or the mix, that means there are probably other compounds in the pheromone that could make traps even more effective, Nieh says.</p>





<p>It’s unclear whether the traps work over longer distances. But hornet queens’ sex pheromones probably lure males from farther away to avoid “incestuous interbreeding,” Nieh says. The traps could be most useful in late fall during the hornets’ mating season.</p>



<p>The finding is “important work,” says Timothy Lawrence, an apiculturist at Washington State University in Coupeville, who wasn’t involved with the study. Finding a way to attract worker hornets, not just males in search of a mate, would be great, but the results are still a “major step forward,” he says. “The sooner we find a reliable way to attract males and find nests, the better.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-coronal-loop-illusion-atmosphere-plasma-astronomy">Some of the sun’s iconic coronal loops may be illusions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coronal loops, well-defined hot strands of plasma that arch out into the sun’s atmosphere, are iconic to the sun’s imagery. But many of the supposed coronal loops we see might not be there at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some coronal loops might be an illusion created by “wrinkles” of greater density in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3df9">curtain of plasma dubbed the coronal veil</a>, researchers propose March 2 in <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. If true, the finding, sparked by unexpected plasma structures seen in computer simulations of the sun’s atmosphere, may change how scientists go about measuring some properties of our star.</p>



<p>“It’s kind of inspiring to see these detailed structures,” says Markus Aschwanden, an astrophysicist at Lockheed Martin’s Solar &amp; Astrophysics Lab in Palo Alto, Calif., who was not involved in the study. “They are so different than what we anticipated.”</p>





<p>Scientists have begun to develop a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-corona-outer-atmosphere-complex">better understanding of the sun’s complex atmosphere</a>, or corona, only in the last few years (<em>SN: 12/19/17</em>). Coronal loops have been used to measure many properties of the corona, including temperature and density, and they may be key to figuring out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">why the sun’s atmosphere is so much hotter than its surface</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). But astronomers have long wondered just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-solar-loops">how the loops appear to be so orderly</a> when they originate in the sun’s turbulent surface (<em>SN: 8/17/17</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So solar physicist Anna Malanushenko and her colleagues attempted to isolate individual coronal loops in 3-D computer simulations originally developed to simulate the life cycle of a solar flare. The team expected to see neatly oriented strands of plasma, because coronal loops appear to align themselves to the sun’s magnetic field, like metal shavings around a bar magnet.</p>



<p>Instead, the plasma appeared as a curtainlike structure winding out from the sun’s surface that folded in on itself like a wrinkled sheet. In the simulation, many of the supposed coronal loops turned out to not be real objects. While there were structures along the magnetic fields, they were neither thin nor compact as expected. They more closely resembled clouds of smoke. As the team changed the point of view from which they looked at these wrinkles in the veil in the simulation, their shape and orientation changed. And from certain viewing angles, the wrinkles resembled coronal loops.</p>



<p>The observations were mind-blowing, says Malanushenko, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. “The traditional thought was that if we see this arching coronal loop that there is a garden hose–like strand of plasma.” The structure in the simulation was much more complex and displayed complicated boundaries and a raggedy structure.</p>



<p>Still, not all coronal loops are necessarily illusions within a coronal veil. “We don’t know which ones are real and which ones are not,” Malanushenko says. “And we absolutely need to be able to tell to study the solar atmosphere.”</p>



<p>It’s also not clear how the purported coronal veil might impact previous analyses of the solar atmosphere. “On one hand, this is depressing,” Malanushenko says of the way the new findings cast doubt on previous understandings. On the other hand, she finds the uncertainty exciting.&nbsp;Astronomers will need to develop a way to observe the veil and confirm its existence. “Whenever we develop new methods, we open the door for new knowledge.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>In 2020, we looked at the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/13/how-well-do-you-know-yourself-research-on-self-insight-digested/">mistakes we make in seeing ourselves psychologically</a>. But how well do you know what you <em>physically </em>look like? Given that you probably see yourself in a mirror every day, you might imagine that your judgements about your face and body should be pretty accurate. But it turns out that we make some often surprising mistakes about our physical appearance, too.</p>



<span id="more-45721"></span>



<p><strong>Facial errors</strong></p>



<p>Most of us are incredibly familiar with the sight of our own faces. But that doesn’t stop us from making errors. If you become close friends with someone, you might well find it <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/08/close-friends-become-absorbed-into-our-self-concept-affecting-our-ability-to-distinguish-their-faces-from-our-own/">harder to tell apart their face from your own</a>. The researchers behind this study suspect that this is because close friends become partially absorbed into our self-concept. A clever study published earlier this year also found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/14/our-mental-self-portraits-contain-clues-about-our-personalities/">our perceptions of our own personalities affect how we see our face in our mind’s eye</a>. For a self-reported extravert, say, their mental image of their own face had exaggerated facial features known to relate to extraversion. It seems, then, that there are clear links between how we see ourselves psychology and physically. And this holds not just for the face but the body, too…</p>



<p><strong>Distorted bodies</strong></p>



<p>The team behind the face and personality research also asked 39 young female students to produce a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211018618">body shape self-portrait</a>. They were terrible at it. In fact, there was a “negligible” relationship between the two main measures that the team analysed: perceived and actual hip width. In this study, levels of self-esteem were linked with these misperceptions — the lower a person’s self-esteem, the more likely they were to exaggerate their own hip size, and the slimmer they considered a &#8220;typical&#8221; woman to be.</p>



<p>We make all kinds of other body-related mistakes, too. For example, when people feel powerful, they’re more likely to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120116154024.htm">think they are taller than they actually are</a>. Also, typical <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/07/first-study-of-its-kind-finds-healthy-people-have-a-distorted-sense-of-their-body-volume/">healthy people have a distorted sense of their body volume and length</a>, according to a paper in <em>Cortex</em> in 2019. The 40 young adults involved in this study tended to overestimate the length of various body parts (such as their hands and legs) but underestimate the volume of those parts. These findings add to growing evidence that, contrary to previous assumptions, healthy adults don’t in fact have a highly accurate understanding of their own body size, the team writes.</p>



<p><strong>Strange body changes</strong></p>



<p>You might not have a great grasp of your physical body, but you probably think of it as being pretty stable. Yet it’s surprisingly easy to make people feel as though they are drastically changing. The &#8220;<a href="https://magicshoes.es/the-team/">magic shoes</a>&#8221; experiments led by Ana Tajadura-Jimenez are a great example. Study participants wore sandals fitted with microphones that transmitted, via headphones, only the higher-pitched portion of their walking sounds. This had the effect of making the wearer feel physically lighter. Why? The team thinks it’s because higher-pitched walking sounds are generally made by small animals — so in an attempt to resolve the mismatch, participants’ brains reduced their perceived size.</p>



<p>Tajadura-Jimenez has also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/19/this-weird-sound-induced-illusion-makes-you-feel-that-your-finger-has-grown-longer/">recently explored the &#8220;auditory Pinocchio illusion&#8221; </a>: if adults pull up on their index finger while listening to brief sounds of rising pitch, they have the feeling that their finger is getting longer. Young children don’t succumb to this, however, so it’s likely to be something that we learn. Other research has found that we associate a “high” pitch with a high position in physical space. And so, Tajadura-Jiménez suspects, as we learn this link, it starts to influence perceptions more generally.</p>



<p><strong>Third arm, anyone?</strong></p>



<p>Feeling that we’re suddenly a bit lighter, or that one of our fingers is growing, is one thing. But we are vulnerable to even more extreme bodily illusions. While the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15709864/">&#8220;rubber hand illusion&#8221;</a> is a classic, and the &#8220;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017208">three-arm illusion</a>&#8221; is pretty cool, my own personal favourite is the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020195">Barbie illusion</a>, in which people are made to feel that they are the size of a small doll. The participants in this study wore headsets that displayed a video feed of what the doll would see if it were able to look down at its body. Then the researchers repeatedly touched both the doll and the participant on the leg, in the same place, at the same time. The illusion worked because (as also shown in the Magic Shoes studies) our brains use input from our senses to build and update a mental representation of our &#8220;self&#8221; — and if the input changes, that representation does, too.   </p>



<p><strong>Body-hopping</strong></p>



<p>Very similar techniques can also lead people to flip into feeling that another person’s face, hand, or even entire body has become their own. And when we take on someone else’s body, we change in other ways, too. Psychologists have made people feel that they were <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00917/full">inhabiting the body of Einstein </a>(increasing cognitive performance for some) and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep13899">also Freud</a> (improving the quality of advice that they were able to offer themselves). As work published in 2021 revealed (again using similar techniques), it’s also possible to make people <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/12/audio-technique-makes-people-feel-that-their-doppelganger-is-in-the-room-with-them/">feel as though they have been duplicated</a>, and that another version of themselves is in the same room.</p>



<p>Body-swapping experiments with pairs of friends have produced some fascinating results, too. Relating back to the findings on facial mental images and personality, Pawel Tacikowski at the Karolinksa Institute, Sweden and colleagues used the Barbie illusion procedure to lead one friend to &#8220;inhabit&#8221; the body of the other, and found that they <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101429">took on some of their friend’s psychological attributes, too</a>. So if they rated their friend as being really talkative and confident, for example, their self-reported scores on those traits became higher after the body swap. This is further evidence that our bodily and psychological self-representations are linked in our sense of who we &#8220;are&#8221;.</p>



<p><strong>Voice</strong></p>



<p>There’s another aspect of our physical selves that we often have trouble with: our voices. Many of us will have had the experience of hearing our voice in a recording for the first time — and hating the sound of it. This phenomenon of &#8220;voice confrontation&#8221; was documented by psychologists back in 1966. It’s thought to happen because when we talk, inner transmission of the sound through bone provides us with more low-frequency sounds than we get when hearing a voice only through air. So in a recording, our voice sounds higher-pitched than we’re used to, and that’s unsettling because it makes us question our self-concept.</p>



<p>However, there are also times when your voice is likely to actually <em>be</em> higher-pitched. A study in <em>PLOSOne</em> found that we tend to talk to high status people (bosses, high-achievers, and so on) <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179407">with a higher pitch</a>. Higher-pitched voices are perceived to be less dominant, so this could be a signal of subservience, which, depending on the circumstances, might be practically useful to you, or not — but either way, it’s worth knowing about. </p>



<p><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder</strong></p>



<p>Some physical misconceptions are more extreme than others. Though healthy people do make mistakes, someone who becomes obsessed with a perceived flaw in their physical appearance — a flaw that either doesn’t exist, or that is over-exaggerated in their minds — suffers from body dysmorphic disorder. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2010.12.2/abjornsson">This is thought to affect up to about 1 in 50 people</a>, and there are fears that selfie filters designed to &#8220;fix&#8221; imperfections <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1001/jamafacial.2018.0486">actively encourage it</a>. For some patients, their physical misperceptions relate to their body shape — they believe that it is either thinner and less muscular, or that they carry more weight, than they do in reality. This can have serious implications, as poor body image judgements are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40519-020-01018-y">thought to play a part in various eating disorders,</a> including anorexia.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>What all this work shows is though we might imagine that we have a clear picture of our physical selves, the reality is very different. Not only are we vulnerable to misperceptions in just about every aspect of what we look like, our mental grip on our bodily self is pretty tenuous, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/686106698/0/oupblogpsychology/">Managing the power of music to foster safety and avoid harm</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/managing-the-power-of-music-to-foster-safety-and-avoid-harm/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Managing-the-power-of-music-to-foster-safety-Blog-Post-Image-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Pulitzer Prize recipient and American playwright Lynn Nottage shared in a recent interview, &#8220;What music can do is get to the emotion with incredible economy and efficiency.&#8221; This capacity that music holds to reach in and connect to the wide range of emotions we experience as human beings can be a wonderful asset as it accesses those feelings we want to revisit and are ready to express. This becomes challenging and potentially harmful when it relates to unexpressed or unresolved emotions and experiences. The potency of music can reach within us and connect to emotions and experiences we are not prepared or ready to feel, experience, or revisit.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of trauma-informed care has evolved over the past three decades and is being applied in a wide range of community and clinical-based settings with students and clients of all ages. Trauma-informed care encourages teachers, healthcare professionals, and care providers to recognize and understand the role that trauma and the lingering effects of traumatic stress can play in the lives of the individuals they serve. Next, providers discover the steps and practices to implement to avoid adding new stress, triggering, or inadvertently re-traumatizing the client.&nbsp;</p><p>While music holds a potency to connect to our emotions, it has many characteristics that can be utilized to address different needs. As a result, it is important to explore with the client healthy uses of music versus unhealthy uses of music. This can help to ensure that the client can make informed decisions about using music in ways that support their health and well-being. This can also help them recognize when they may be using music in unhealthy ways, such as listening to a song repeatedly that keeps them fixated or stuck in a negative mood state.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to determine the client’s needs, how they prefer and feel comfortable engaging with music, their desire to explore new ways of engaging with music, and when they want or need to use music in their day-to-day life. While we can listen, sing, play, improvise, and compose music, in a trauma-informed care approach, it is important to begin where a client feels safe. The client may be ready to move into other types of music experiences in time, but it is important to determine a starting place with music that does not cause the client to experience additional stress.&nbsp;</p><h2>Listening to music</h2><p>Listening to music can help to manage stress and foster relaxation. These capacities innate in music are well suited to address the principles of trauma-informed care. Designing and structuring relaxation experiences with slow tempo music (60-80 beats per minute) that is preferred by the client, can help to slow down the heart and breathing rates and foster an overall relaxation response. Listening to music at these slower tempos allows the rhythms of the body to slow down, fostering a relaxation response. This in turn can help a client feel a greater sense of safety. Additionally, working with the client to identify their preferred music gives them the power of choice and helps them to feel more empowered in making decisions for their well-being.&nbsp;</p><h2>Developing playlists</h2><p>Developing playlists of music that are calming, supportive, or empowering can give the client tools to use and easily access in their everyday life. Working collaboratively with the client in this process can foster a sense of mutuality that helps them in building their knowledge and skills to create their playlists in time. Through this process, they discover what helps them to feel safe, develop a sense of trust as co-creators in the process, and feel empowered as they communicate their preferences, and make choices and decisions about the music. They can create playlists to address a wide array of needs including shifting or elevating their mood, fostering relaxation, providing distraction, or supporting sleep.&nbsp;<em>Wellness Well Played: The Power of a Playlist&nbsp;</em>by music therapist Jennifer Buchanan is a book dedicated to exploring the use of playlists and provides suggestions for creating them to support various aspects of health and wellbeing.</p><h2>Creating music</h2><p>Singing and playing music may be a familiar experience for some clients and very unfamiliar for others. If a client is interested and ready to create music it is important to understand where they feel ready to begin. Do they need something simple? Such as chanting words on a mantra that fosters a sense of safety. Is there a favorite song they want to sing or play that fosters their confidence and helps them feel strong and empowered? Will they feel grounded playing a slow heartbeat rhythm to a relaxing piece of music? The level of simplicity and complexity of the experience can be tailored to meet the needs of the client. Additionally, this type of active engagement with music can be adapted over time as the client is ready to explore engaging in the music in new or more complex ways.&nbsp;</p><h2>Composing</h2><p>Composing a song or music may feel like a daunting task to some clients. Maybe they have a favorite song or a song that inspires or motivates them? The song can be personalized by rewriting segments of or all lyrics, so the song expresses or communicates the client&#8217;s feelings or experiences. Maybe the client is interested in writing a mantra and the melody to chant it to? Supporting the client in using their voice to express what they want to say and/or hear can help them to discover how they can create their sense of safety and can discover a sense of empowerment as they sing and hear their own words in a song.&nbsp;</p><h2>Improvising</h2><p>Improvising music may feel overwhelming to some clients as they may experience it as a lack of structure, which may leave them feeling vulnerable and exposed. If a client is interested and ready to explore improvisation, it will be important to determine the level of structure and support they need to feel safe and to be able to trust their co-creator(s) in the experience. The level of structure can be altered and changed when the client is ready, but it is important to explore this with the client so they are not caught off guard and feel unsafe in the music experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Music holds a great capacity to connect to our emotions and experiences, positive, challenging, and negative experiences. Integrating a trauma-informed care approach when using music and in music therapy helps to ensure that clients feel safe, secure, and are not triggered or inadvertently harmed. A vital element of trauma-informed practice is understanding how to use music and its elements to safely address the client’s needs. Clients may not always have an awareness that they have experienced trauma, so infusing a trauma-informed care approach in everyday practice is an important safety measure.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by Vinzent Weinbeer on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/music-headphones-volume-to-play-5190768/">Pixabay</a></sub></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/686106698/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/686106698/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f02%2fManaging-the-power-of-music-to-foster-safety-Blog-Post-Image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/tawnie-olson-re-imagining-the-magnificat/">Tawnie Olson: re-imagining the Magnificat</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/covid-19-and-mental-health-where-do-we-go-from-here-podcast/">COVID-19 and mental health: where do we go from here?

                <p><em>This blog is part of a series exploring our APC-alternative models from Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships at PLOS</em>.&nbsp;<em>Read our previous post&nbsp;</em><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Different approaches, one goal: universal Open Access</strong></p>



<p>Many research <a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy">funders</a>, institutions, and <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands">governments </a>now <em>require </em>research to be made available under Open Access licensing and provide funds that can be applied to authors&rsquo; Open Access publication costs. But the ways in which Open Access is supported varies across different fields and <a href="https://council.science/current/blog/plan-s-and-open-access-interview-with-dominique-babini/">global regions</a>. There are gaps that leave many researchers who want to publish in Open Access journals without funding for APCs</p>



<p>Given the unequal circumstances, how can publishers fairly close gaps for researchers and provide fair and easy alternatives to APCs that work for all of its stakeholders?</p>



<p>At PLOS we are committed to co-creating pathways to Open Access and Open Science as we carry our mission forward. A piece of that is ensuring our approach to Open Access solutions are not one-size-fits-all. It&rsquo;s the reason we don&rsquo;t have just one institutional partnership model for all of our journals, but several that cater to the needs of the journal research communities, and the bodies who financially support researchers&rsquo; work.</p>



<p>Previously in this series we&rsquo;ve written about our other models that target specific challenges in the Open Access ecosystem&mdash;keeping costs low for selective journals through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">CAP</a>, reflecting regional economic differences through <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>. Our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee</a> model similarly aims to make Open Access publishing easier and more accessible for researchers while being flexible and granular enough to suit many different communities.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility and Simplicity through Flat Fees</strong></p>



<p>The solutions we create for researchers have to work within the boundaries of their research space, and the stakeholders that support them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flat Fee agreements at PLOS do that by offering institutions greater efficiency in how they provide broad Open Access support. Institutions pay one annual fee for unlimited publishing for their researchers across six PLOS journals&mdash;including <em>PLOS ONE</em> which alone publishes in more than 200 subject areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, researchers&rsquo; publication expenses are completely covered by their institution through a Flat Fee agreement with PLOS (as they are in our <a href="https://plos.org/publish/community-action-publishing-for-authors/">CAP </a>and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity</a> models). However, the Flat Fee agreement also leaves room for institutions to balance their Open Access support with the authors&rsquo; grant funding streams. This balances the payment ecosystem in disciplines and regions where grant funding for Open Access is already strong. It also gives institutions with limited budgets a way to support (or transition to supporting) Open Access publication.</p>



<p><strong>So, does Open Access need APCs?</strong></p>



<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along in this series you know the answer is no! Fee-free publishing for authors is both possible and sustainable and we are so excited to be pioneering these new models alongside <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=library-partnerships">institutions</a> who are ready for change. These new approaches help level the playing field so that any researcher can easily publish in the Open Access journal of their choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is still a lot of work to do before fee-free publishing is a reality for all authors, but new models are a step towards real progress. If you would like to encourage your institution to join PLOS and eliminate author fees, please consider contacting your librarian directly.

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/11/we-try-to-avoid-people-with-these-stereotypically-boring-traits/">We try to avoid people with these stereotypically boring traits</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Picture a boring person in your mind. What are they like? If you’re imagining someone who loves watching TV, has no sense of humour, and works in finance, your stereotype of a boring person is similar to those described in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221079104">recent study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. But whether or not these kinds of stereotypes are accurate, the researchers behind the paper find that they can have damaging social implications: people have a low opinion of those with “boring” traits, and will try to actively avoid them.</p>



<span id="more-45676"></span>



<p>The researchers, led by Wijnand A. P. van Tilburg from the University of Essex, began by asking online participants to note down “typical features” of a boring person, as well as occupations and hobbies they associated with being boring. They then grouped responses into categories: 45 pertaining to personal characteristics (e.g. “no sense of humour”); 19 relating to hobbies (e.g. “collecting”); and 28 relating to occupations (e.g.&nbsp;“banking and finance”).</p>



<p>Three further groups of participants then rated <em>how </em>boring a person with each of these characteristics, hobbies, or jobs seemed. The features most stereotypical of boring people included “not interesting”, “dull”, and “no opinions”. Occupations most associated with boring people included “data analysis”, &#8220;accounting”, and “tax/insurance”, while hobbies included “sleeping”, “religion”, and “watching TV”.</p>



<p>The researchers then turned to people’s perceptions of, and behaviour towards, people with these traits. Participants read vignettes about three people. One was given characteristics, hobbies, and a job that had all been rated as stereotypical of boring people in the previous experiment; one had traits that were rated the least stereotypically boring; and one was somewhere in the middle. (None of these fictional people was described as boring, as the researchers were interested in perceptions of people with these traits, rather than people explicitly labelled as boring).</p>



<p>Participants rated how competent (e.g. skilled or hard-working) and warm (e.g. friendly or caring) each person was. And the team found that those with highly and moderately boring traits were viewed as both less warm and less competent than those with the least boring traits.</p>



<p>The next study used the same methodology, except participants rated the extent to which they would avoid or spend time with each person. The researchers found that participants wanted to avoid the person with the most boring traits significantly more than the person with moderately boring traits, who in turn was avoided more than the person with the least boring traits. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a final study, participants indicated how much money they would need to receive in order to spend a given length of time with each person, ranging from one to seven days. The results showed that the more boring traits someone had, the more money participants needed to be paid in order to spend time with them. This was true regardless of the length of time they had to spend together.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the paper shows that people who hold stereotypically boring traits are judged negatively, and actively avoided. And although the results may not seem that surprising, it’s interesting to see a formal investigation into something many of us may have assumed.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that the work can’t say whether or not these stereotypes are accurate. Although we may <em>think</em> that accountants who like to sleep are boring, that doesn’t mean they are. So it’d be interesting to know more about where these stereotypes come from. The team suggests that some people may in fact use such stereotypes to seem more interesting or unique by comparison — particularly if they feel that they are being judged as boring themselves.</p>



<p>These studies were all conducted with participants in the US or UK, and there are likely cultural differences in who we perceive as boring — so these stereotypes may not generalise more broadly. It’s also clear that even within a culture, people’s perceptions of boring people vary. Some people in the first study felt that boring people liked sports and reading, for instance, and that actors and journalists tended to be boring. Although other participants didn’t rate these traits as particularly boring, this shows how varied people’s views can be. Future work could look at individual differences in these perceptions.</p>



<p>Still, the authors point out that regardless of <em>who </em>we see as boring, our negative perceptions of them may be similar. And these stereotypes could lead to harm, placing people judged to be boring at risk of loneliness and isolation. “Rather than perceiving them as performing a social ‘crime’”, the researchers write, “perhaps those seen as boring should receive some sympathy and support instead.”</p>

<p>In spite of the age-old yearning for the Fountain of Youth, there is a marked lack of research toward retaining vitality in later years. Nonetheless … [researchers] have found they can reverse transient memory loss — or senility — in older patients by giving them periodic oxygen treatments in a hyperbaric chamber.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Studies still only hint that exposing patients to 100 percent oxygen at high pressures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hyperbaric-oxygen-bounces-back">might give cognitive abilities a boost</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/85, p. 236</em>). For instance, people with persistent symptoms after mild head trauma who underwent hyperbaric oxygen treatment <a href="https://www.medgasres.com/article.asp?issn=2045-9912;year=2020;volume=10;issue=1;spage=8;epage=20;aulast=Harch">outperformed untreated individuals on memory tests</a> at least two months after the treatments, researchers reported in 2020. Exposure to high amounts of oxygen also has been shown to improve short-term memory in people who have had strokes and those with <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/203485/pdf">Alzheimer’s disease</a>. The treatments seem to work by dampening inflammation in the brain. The jury is still out on whether the method has a lasting effect on memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-nearest-black-hole-star-system-binary-space">Earth’s purported ‘nearest black hole’ isn’t a black hole</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nearest black hole to Earth isn’t a black hole at all. Instead, what scientists thought was a stellar triplet — two stars and a black hole — is actually a pair of stars caught in a unique stage of evolution.</p>



<p>In May 2020, a team of astronomers reported that the star system HR 6819 was probably made up of a bright, massive star locked in a tight, 40-day orbit with a nonfeeding, invisible black hole plus a second star orbiting farther away. At about 1,000 light-years from Earth, that would make this black hole <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-closest-earth-may-have-been-spotted">the nearest to us</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/20</em>). But over the following months, other teams analyzed the same data and came to a different conclusion: The system hosts <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/09/aa38682-20/aa38682-20.html">only two stars and no black hole</a>.</p>



<p>Now, the original team and one of the follow-up teams have joined forces and looked at HR 6819 with more powerful telescopes that collect a different type of data. The new data can make out finer details on the sky, allowing the astronomers <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/03/aa43004-21/aa43004-21.html">to definitively see how many objects are in the system and what type of objects they are</a>, the teams report in the March <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em>.</p>





<p>“Ultimately, it was the binary system that best explains everything,” says astronomer Abigail Frost of KU Leuven in Belgium.</p>



<p>Previous observations of HR 6819 showed it as a unit, so astronomers couldn’t differentiate the objects in the system nor their masses. To nail down HR 6819’s true nature, Frost and colleagues turned to the Very Large Telescope Array, a network of four interconnected telescopes in Chile that can essentially see the separate stars.</p>



<p>“It allowed us to disentangle that original signal definitively, which is really important to determine how many stars were in it, and whether one of them was a black hole,” Frost says.</p>



<p>The scientists think one of the stars is a massive bright blue star that has been siphoning material from its companion star’s bloated atmosphere. That companion star now has little gaseous atmosphere left. “It&#8217;s already gone through its main life, but because the outside has been stripped off, and you only see the exposed core, it has similar temperature and luminosity and radius to a young star,” says Kareem El-Badry, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. El-Badry was not involved in the new study, but he <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/502/3/3436/6127309">suggested in 2021 that HR 6819 is a binary system</a>.</p>



<p>This siphoned star’s core color and brightness could fool astronomers looking at the older data into thinking it was a young star with 10 times as much mass. It originally appeared as though this star was orbiting something massive but invisible — a black hole.</p>



<p>Once the researchers unraveled the system’s details, they realized this system is a unique one, showing astronomers a phase not seen before among systems with massive stars. “It is a missing link in binary star evolution,” says astrophysicist Maxwell Moe of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was also not part of the new study.</p>



<p>Astronomers for years have seen binary systems where one star is actively pulling gas off the other, and they’ve seen systems where the donor star is just a naked stellar core. But in HR 6819, the donor star has stopped giving mass to the other. “It still has a little bit of envelope left but is quickly contracting, evolving to become a remnant core,” Moe says.</p>



<p>Frost and her colleagues are using the Very Large Telescope Array to monitor HR 6819 over a year to track precisely how the stars are moving. “We want to really understand how the individual stars in the system are ticking,” she says. The team will then use that information in computer simulations of binary star evolution. “[It’s] exciting to now have a system that we can use as kind of a cornerstone to investigate this in more detail,” Frost says.</p>



<p>Even though HR 6819 doesn’t have the nearest black hole to Earth, it appears to have something more useful to astronomers.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Even in a world increasingly battered by weather extremes, the summer 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest stood out. For several days in late June, cities such as Vancouver, Portland and Seattle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know">baked in record temperatures</a> that killed hundreds of people. On June 29, Lytton, a village in British Columbia, set an all-time heat record for Canada, at 121° Fahrenheit (49.6° Celsius); the next day, the village was incinerated by a wildfire.</p>



<p>Within a week, an international group of scientists had analyzed this extreme heat and concluded it would have been virtually impossible without climate change caused by humans. The planet’s average surface temperature has risen by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius since preindustrial levels of 1850–1900. The reason: People are loading the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases produced during the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, and from cutting down forests.</p>

<p>A little over 1 degree of warming may not sound like a lot. But it has already been enough to fundamentally transform how energy flows around the planet. The pace of change is accelerating, and the consequences are everywhere. Ice sheets in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change">Greenland</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-practically-irreversible-antarctic-melting">Antarctica </a>are melting, raising sea levels and flooding low-lying island nations and coastal cities. Drought is parching farmlands and the rivers that feed them. Wildfires are raging. Rains are becoming more intense, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">weather patterns are shifting</a>.</p>



<p>The roots of understanding this climate emergency trace back more than a century and a half. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that scientists began the detailed measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide that would prove how much carbon is pouring from human activities. Beginning in the 1960s, researchers started developing comprehensive computer models that now illuminate the severity of the changes ahead.</p>



<p>Today we know that climate change and its consequences are real, and we are responsible. The emissions that people have been putting into the air for centuries — the emissions that made long-distance travel, economic growth and our material lives possible — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">have put us squarely on a warming trajectory</a>. Only drastic cuts in carbon emissions, backed by collective global will, can make a significant difference.</p>



<p>“What’s happening to the planet is not routine,” says Ralph Keeling, a geochemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. “We’re in a planetary crisis.”</p>

<h4>Setting the stage</h4>



<p>One day in the 1850s, Eunice Newton Foote, an amateur scientist and a women’s rights activist living in upstate New York, put two glass jars in sunlight. One contained regular air — a mix of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases including carbon dioxide — while the other contained just carbon dioxide. Both had thermometers in them. As the sun’s rays beat down, Foote observed that the jar of CO<sub>2</sub> alone heated up more quickly, and was slower to cool down, than the one containing plain air.</p>



<p>The results prompted Foote to muse on the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub>, the planet and heat. “An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature,” she wrote in an <a href="https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002152491/page/383/mode/2up?view=theater">1856 paper summarizing her findings</a>.</p>

<p>Three years later, working independently and apparently unaware of Foote’s discovery, Irish physicist John Tyndall showed the same basic idea in more detail. With a set of pipes and devices to study the transmission of heat, he found that CO<sub>2</sub> gas, as well as water vapor, absorbed more heat than air alone. He argued that such gases would trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere, much as panes of glass trap heat in a greenhouse, and thus modulate climate.</p>



<p>Today Tyndall is widely credited with the discovery of how what we now call greenhouse gases heat the planet, earning him a prominent place in the history of climate science. Foote faded into relative obscurity — partly because of her gender, partly because her measurements were less sensitive. Yet their findings helped kick off broader scientific exploration of how the composition of gases in Earth’s atmosphere affects global temperatures.</p>

<h3>Heat-trapping gases&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In 1859, John Tyndall used this apparatus to study how various gases trap heat. He sent infrared radiation through a tube filled with gas and measured the resulting temperature changes. Carbon dioxide and water vapor, he showed, absorb more heat than air does.</p>

<h4>Carbon floods in</h4>



<p>Humans began substantially affecting the atmosphere around the turn of the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution took off in Britain. Factories burned tons of coal; fueled by fossil fuels, the steam engine revolutionized transportation and other industries. Since then, fossil fuels including oil and natural gas have been harnessed to drive a global economy. All these activities belch gases into the air.</p>



<p>Yet Swedish physical chemist Svante Arrhenius wasn’t worried about the Industrial Revolution when he began thinking in the late 1800s about changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. He was instead curious about ice ages — including whether a decrease in volcanic eruptions, which can put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, would lead to a future ice age. Bored and lonely in the wake of a divorce, Arrhenius set himself to months of laborious calculations involving moisture and heat transport in the atmosphere at different zones of latitude. <a href="https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf">In 1896, he reported that halving the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere could indeed bring about an ice age</a> — and that doubling CO<sub>2</sub> would raise global temperatures by around 5 to 6 degrees C.</p>



<p>It was a remarkably prescient finding for work that, out of necessity, had simplified Earth’s complex climate system down to just a few variables. But Arrhenius’ findings didn’t gain much traction with other scientists at the time. The climate system seemed too large, complex and inert to change in any meaningful way on a timescale that would be relevant to human society. Geologic evidence showed, for instance, that ice ages took thousands of years to start and end. What was there to worry about?</p>





<p>One researcher, though, thought the idea was worth pursuing. Guy Stewart Callendar, a British engineer and amateur meteorologist, had tallied weather records over time, obsessively enough to determine that average temperatures were increasing at 147 weather stations around the globe. In a 1938 paper in a Royal Meteorological Society journal, he <a href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49706427503">linked this temperature rise to the burning of fossil fuels</a>. Callendar estimated that fossil fuel burning had put around 150 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere since the late 19th century.</p>



<p>Like many of his day, Callendar didn’t see global warming as a problem. Extra CO<sub>2</sub> would surely stimulate plants to grow and allow crops to be farmed in new regions. “In any case the return of the deadly glaciers should be delayed indefinitely,” he wrote. But his work revived discussions tracing back to Tyndall and Arrhenius about how the planetary system responds to changing levels of gases in the atmosphere. And it began steering the conversation toward how human activities might drive those changes.</p>



<p>When World War II broke out the following year, the global conflict redrew the landscape for scientific research. Hugely important wartime technologies, such as radar and the atomic bomb, set the stage for “big science” studies that brought nations together to tackle high-stakes questions of global reach. And that allowed modern climate science to emerge.</p>



<h4>The Keeling curve</h4>



<p>One major effort was the International Geophysical Year, or IGY, an 18-month push in 1957–1958 that involved a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/igy-brings-many-discoveries">wide array of scientific field campaigns</a> including exploration in the Arctic and Antarctica. Climate change wasn’t a high research priority during the IGY, but some scientists in California, led by Roger Revelle of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, used the funding influx to begin a project they’d long wanted to do. The goal was to measure CO<sub>2</sub> levels at different locations around the world, accurately and consistently.</p>



<p>The job fell to geochemist Charles David Keeling, who put ultraprecise CO<sub>2</sub> monitors in Antarctica and on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Loa. Funds soon ran out to maintain the Antarctic record, but the Mauna Loa measurements continued. Thus was born one of the most iconic datasets in all of science — the “Keeling curve,” which tracks the rise of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>When Keeling began his measurements in 1958, CO<sub>2</sub> made up 315 parts per million of the global atmosphere. Within just a few years it became clear that the number was increasing year by year. Because plants take up CO<sub>2</sub> as they grow in spring and summer and release it as they decompose in fall and winter, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations rose and fell each year in a sawtooth pattern. But superimposed on that pattern was a steady march upward.</p>



<p>“The graph got flashed all over the place — it was just such a striking image,” says Ralph Keeling, who is Keeling’s son. Over the years, as the curve marched higher, “it had a really important role historically in waking people up to the problem of climate change.” The Keeling curve has been featured in countless earth science textbooks, congressional hearings and in Al Gore’s 2006 documentary on climate change, <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>.</p>



<p>Each year the curve keeps going up: In 2016, it passed 400 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere as measured during its typical annual minimum in September. Today it is at 413 ppm. (Before the Industrial Revolution, CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere had been stable for centuries at around 280 ppm.)</p>



<p>Around the time that Keeling’s measurements were kicking off, Revelle also helped develop an important argument that the CO<sub>2</sub> from human activities was building up in Earth’s atmosphere. In 1957, he and Hans Suess, also at Scripps at the time, published a paper that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1957.tb01849.x">traced the flow of radioactive carbon through the oceans and the atmosphere</a>. They showed that the oceans were not capable of taking up as much CO<sub>2</sub> as previously thought; the implication was that much of the gas must be going into the atmosphere instead.</p>

<p>Known as the Keeling curve, this chart shows the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> levels as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii due to human activities. The visible sawtooth pattern is due to seasonal plant growth: Plants take up CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; in the growing seasons, then release it as they decompose in fall and winter.</p>

<p>“Human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future,” Revelle and Suess wrote in the paper. It’s one of the most famous sentences in earth science history.</p>



<p>Here was the insight underlying modern climate science: Atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing, and humans are causing the buildup. Revelle and Suess became the final piece in a puzzle dating back to Svante Arrhenius and John Tyndall. “I tell my students that to understand the basics of climate change, you need to have the cutting-edge science of the 1860s, the cutting-edge math of the 1890s and the cutting-edge chemistry of the 1950s,” says Joshua Howe, an environmental historian at Reed College in Portland, Ore.</p>



<h4>Evidence piles up</h4>



<p>Observational data collected throughout the second half of the 20th century helped researchers gradually build their understanding of how human activities were transforming the planet.</p>



<p>Ice cores pulled from ice sheets, such as that atop Greenland, offer some of the most telling insights for understanding past climate change. Each year, snow falls atop the ice and compresses into a fresh layer of ice representing climate conditions at the time it formed. The abundance of certain forms, or isotopes, of oxygen and hydrogen in the ice allows scientists to calculate the temperature at which it formed, and air bubbles trapped within the ice reveal how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were in the atmosphere at that time. So drilling down into an ice sheet is like reading the pages of a history book that go back in time the deeper you go.</p>

<p>Scientists began reading these pages in the early 1960s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-cores-clues-past-climates">using ice cores drilled at a U.S. military base in northwest Greenland</a>. Contrary to expectations that past climates were stable, the cores hinted that abrupt climate shifts had happened over the last 100,000 years. By 1979, an international group of researchers was pulling another deep ice core from a second location in Greenland — and it, too, showed that abrupt climate change had occurred in the past. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/tales-ice-time">a pair of European- and U.S.-led drilling projects</a> retrieved even deeper cores from near the top of the ice sheet, pushing the record of past temperatures back a quarter of a million years.</p>



<p>Together with other sources of information, such as sediment cores drilled from the seafloor and molecules preserved in ancient rocks, the ice cores allowed scientists to reconstruct past temperature changes in extraordinary detail. Many of those changes happened alarmingly fast. For instance, the climate in Greenland <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ancient-ice-reveals-wild-climate-shifts">warmed abruptly more than 20 times in the last 80,000 years</a>, with the changes occurring in a matter of decades. More recently, a cold spell that set in around 13,000 years ago suddenly came to an end around 11,500 years ago — and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-core-shows-speedy-climate-change">temperatures in Greenland rose 10 degrees C in a decade.</a></p>



<p>Evidence for such dramatic climate shifts laid to rest any lingering ideas that global climate change would be slow and unlikely to occur on a timescale that humans should worry about. “It’s an important reminder of how ‘tippy’ things can be,” says Jessica Tierney, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>More evidence of global change came from Earth-observing satellites, which brought a new planet-wide perspective on global warming beginning in the 1960s. From their viewpoint in the sky, satellites have measured the rise in global sea level — currently 3.4 millimeters per year and accelerating, as warming water expands and as ice sheets melt — as well as the rapid decline in ice left floating on the Arctic Ocean each summer at the end of the melt season. Gravity-sensing satellites have “weighed” the Antarctic and Greenlandic ice sheets from above since 2002, reporting that more than 400 billion metric tons of ice are lost each year.</p>



<p>Temperature observations taken at weather stations around the world also confirm that we are living in the hottest years on record. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hottest-year-record-temperature-2020-2016-nasa-noaa">10 warmest years since record keeping began in 1880 have all occurred since 2005</a>. And nine of those 10 have come since 2010.</p>

<h4>Worrisome predictions</h4>



<p>By the 1960s, there was no denying that the planet was warming. But understanding the consequences of those changes — including the threat to human health and well-being — would require more than observational data. Looking to the future depended on computer simulations: complex calculations of how energy flows through the planetary system.</p>



<p>A first step in building such climate models was to connect everyday observations of weather to the concept of forecasting future climate. During World War I, British mathematician Lewis Fry Richardson imagined tens of thousands of meteorologists, each calculating conditions for a small part of the atmosphere but collectively piecing together a global forecast.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t until after World War II that computational power turned Richardson’s dream into reality. In the wake of the Allied victory, which relied on accurate weather forecasts for everything from planning D-Day to figuring out when and where to drop the atomic bombs, leading U.S. mathematicians acquired funding from the federal government to improve predictions. In 1950, a team led by Jule Charney, a meteorologist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., used the ENIAC, the first U.S. programmable, electronic computer, to produce <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/machine-predicts-weather">the first computer-driven regional weather forecast</a>. The forecasting was slow and rudimentary, but it built on Richardson’s ideas of dividing the atmosphere into squares, or cells, and computing the weather for each of those. The work set the stage for decades of climate modeling to follow.</p>



<p>By 1956, Norman Phillips, a member of Charney’s team, had produced the world’s first general circulation model, which captured how energy flows between the oceans, atmosphere and land. The field of climate modeling was born.</p>



<p>The work was basic at first because early computers simply didn’t have much computational power to simulate all aspects of the planetary system.</p>



<p>An important breakthrough came in 1967, when meteorologists Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald — both at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, a lab born from Charney’s group — published a paper in the <em>Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences</em> that modeled connections between Earth’s surface and atmosphere and calculated how changes in CO<sub>2</sub> would affect the planet’s temperature. Manabe and Wetherald were the first to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/computing-link-between-sea-and-air">build a computer model that captured the relevant processes that drive climate</a>, and to accurately simulate how the Earth responds to those processes.</p>



<p>The rise of climate modeling allowed scientists to more accurately envision the impacts of global warming. In 1979, Charney and other experts met in Woods Hole, Mass., to try to put together a scientific consensus on what increasing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> would mean for the planet. The resulting “Charney report” concluded that rising CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere would lead to additional and significant climate change.</p>



<p>In the decades since, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">climate modeling has gotten increasingly sophisticated</a>. And as climate science firmed up, climate change became a political issue.</p>

<h4>Backlash</h4>



<p>The rising public awareness of climate change, and battles over what to do about it, emerged alongside awareness of other environmental issues in the 1960s and ’70s. Rachel Carson’s 1962&nbsp;book <em>Silent Spring</em>, which condemned the pesticide DDT for its ecological impacts, catalyzed environmental activism in the United States and led to the first Earth Day in 1970.</p>



<p>In 1974, scientists discovered another major global environmental threat — the Antarctic ozone hole, which had some important parallels to and differences from the climate change story. Chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, of the University of California, Irvine, reported that chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, used in products such as spray cans and refrigerants, caused a chain of reactions that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/freon-destroying-ozone-layer">gnawed away at the atmosphere’s protective ozone layer</a>. The resulting ozone hole, which forms over Antarctica every spring, allows more ultraviolet radiation from the sun to make it through Earth’s atmosphere and reach the surface, where it can cause skin cancer and eye damage.</p>



<p>Governments worked under the auspices of the United Nations to craft the 1987 Montreal Protocol, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ozone-accord-draws-praise-and-concern">which strictly limited the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons</a>. In the years following, the ozone hole began to heal. But fighting climate change is proving to be far more challenging. Transforming entire energy sectors to reduce or eliminate carbon emissions is much more difficult than replacing a set of industrial chemicals.</p>



<p>In 1980, though, researchers took an important step toward banding together to synthesize the scientific understanding of climate change and bring it to the attention of international policy makers. It started at a small scientific conference in Villach, Austria, on the seriousness of climate change. On the train ride home from the meeting, Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin talked with other participants about how a broader, deeper and more international analysis was needed. In 1988, a United Nations body called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, was born. Bolin was its first chairperson.</p>



<p>The IPCC became a highly influential and unique body. It performs no original scientific research; instead, it synthesizes and summarizes the vast literature of climate science for policy makers to consider — primarily through massive reports issued every couple of years. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/global-warming-politics-muddle-policy">The first IPCC report, in 1990</a>, predicted that the planet’s global mean temperature would rise more quickly in the following century than at any point in the last 10,000 years, due to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>IPCC reports have played a key role in providing scientific information for nations discussing how to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations. This process started with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/rio-summit-launches-two-earth-treaties">Rio Earth Summit in 1992</a>, which resulted in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Annual U.N. meetings to tackle climate change led to the first international commitments to reduce emissions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nations-draft-kyoto-climate-treaty">the Kyoto Protocol of 1997</a>. Under it, developed countries committed to reduce emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases. By 2007, the IPCC declared <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bad-worse-earths-warming-accelerate">the reality of climate warming is “unequivocal.”</a> The group received the Nobel Peace Prize that year, along with Al Gore, for their work on climate change.</p>



<p>The IPCC process ensured that policy makers had the best science at hand when they came to the table to discuss cutting emissions. Of course, nations did not have to abide by that science — and they often didn’t. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, international climate meetings discussed less hard-core science and more issues of equity. Countries such as China and India pointed out that they needed energy to develop their economies and that nations responsible for the bulk of emissions through history, such as the United States, needed to lead the way in cutting greenhouse gases.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, residents of some of the most vulnerable nations, such as low-lying islands that are threatened by sea level rise, gained visibility and clout at international negotiating forums. “The issues around equity have always been very uniquely challenging in this collective action problem,” says Rachel Cleetus, a climate policy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>By 2015, the world’s nations had made some progress on the emissions cuts laid out in the Kyoto Protocol, but it was still not enough to achieve substantial global reductions. That year, a key U.N. climate conference in Paris produced an international agreement to try to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">limit global warming to 2 degrees C, and preferably 1.5 degrees C</a>, above preindustrial levels.</p>



<p>Every country has its own approach to the challenge of addressing climate change. In the United States, which gets approximately 80 percent of its energy from fossil fuels, sophisticated efforts to downplay and critique the science led to major delays in climate action. For decades, U.S. fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil worked to influence politicians to take as little action on emissions reductions as possible.</p>

<p>Such tactics undoubtedly succeeded in feeding politicians’ delay on climate action in the United States, most of it from Republicans. President George W. Bush <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-accord-reached">withdrew the country from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001</a>; Donald Trump similarly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/trump-us-withdrawal-paris-climate-pact">rejected the Paris accord in 2017</a>. As late as 2015, the chair of the Senate’s environment committee, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, brought a snowball into Congress on a cold winter’s day to argue that human-caused global warming is a “hoax.”</p>



<p>In Australia, a similar mix of right-wing denialism and fossil fuel interests has kept climate change commitments in flux, as prime ministers are voted in and out over fierce debates about how the nation should act on climate.</p>



<p>Yet other nations have moved forward. Some European countries such as Germany aggressively pursued renewable energies, including wind and solar, while activists such as Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/students-worldwide-are-striking-demand-action-climate-change">the vanguard of a youth-action movement</a> — pressured their governments for more.</p>



<p>In recent years, the developing economies of China and India have taken center stage in discussions about climate action. China, which is now the world’s largest carbon emitter, declared several moderate steps in 2021 to reduce emissions, including that it would stop building coal-burning power plants overseas. India announced it would aim for net-zero emissions by 2070, the first time it has set a date for this goal.</p>



<p>Yet such pledges continue to be criticized. At the 2021 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, India was globally criticized for not committing to a complete phaseout of coal — although the two top emitters, China and the United States, have not themselves committed to phasing out coal. “There is no equity in this,” says Aayushi Awasthy, an energy economist at the University of East Anglia in England.</p>

<h3>Past and future&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Various scenarios for how greenhouse gas emissions might change going forward help scientists predict future climate change. This graph shows the simulated historical temperature trend along with future projections of rising temperatures based on five scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Temperature change is the difference from the 1850–1900 average.</p>

<h4>Facing the future</h4>



<p>In many cases, changes are coming faster than scientists had envisioned a few decades ago. The oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, harming tiny marine organisms that build protective calcium carbonate shells and are the base of the marine food web. Warmer waters are bleaching coral reefs. Higher temperatures are driving animal and plant species into areas in which they previously did not live, increasing the risk of extinction for many.</p>



<p>No place on the planet is unaffected. In many areas, higher temperatures have led to major droughts, which dry out vegetation and provide additional fuel for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">wildfires such as those that have devastated Australia</a>, the Mediterranean and western North America in recent years.</p>



<p>Then there’s the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at more than twice the global average and communities are at the forefront of change. Permafrost is thawing, destabilizing buildings, pipelines and roads. Caribou and reindeer herders worry about the increased risk of parasites for the health of their animals. With less sea ice available to buffer the coast from storm erosion, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/collapsing-coastlines">the Inupiat village of Shishmaref, Alaska, risks crumbling into the sea</a>. It will need to move from its sand-barrier island to the mainland.</p>

<p>“We know these changes are happening and that the Titanic is sinking,” says Louise Farquharson, a geomorphologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who monitors permafrost and coastal change around Alaska. All around the planet, those who depend on intact ecosystems for their survival face the greatest threat from climate change. And those with the least resources to adapt to climate change are the ones who feel it first.</p>



<p>“We are going to warm,” says Claudia Tebaldi, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. “There is no question about it. The only thing that we can hope to do is to warm a little more slowly.”</p>



<p>That’s one reason why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the IPCC report released in 2021 focuses on anticipated levels of global warming</a>. There is a big difference between the planet warming 1.5 degrees versus 2 degrees or 2.5 degrees. Each fraction of a degree of warming increases the risk of extreme events such as heat waves and heavy rains, leading to greater global devastation.</p>



<p>The future rests on how much nations are willing to commit to cutting emissions and whether they will stick to those commitments. It’s a geopolitical balancing act the likes of which the world has never seen.</p>

<p>Science can and must play a role going forward. Improved climate models will illuminate what changes are expected at the regional scale, helping officials prepare. Governments and industry have crucial parts to play as well. They can invest in technologies, such as carbon sequestration, to help decarbonize the economy and shift society toward more renewable sources of energy.</p>



<p>Huge questions remain. Do voters have the will to demand significant energy transitions from their governments? How can business and military leaders play a bigger role in driving climate action? What should be the role of low-carbon energy sources that come with downsides, such as nuclear energy? How can developing nations achieve a better standard of living for their people while not becoming big greenhouse gas emitters? How can we keep the most vulnerable from being disproportionately harmed during extreme events, and incorporate environmental and social justice into our future?</p>



<p>These questions become more pressing each year, as carbon dioxideaccumulates in our atmosphere. The planet is now at higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> than at any time in the last 3&nbsp;million years.</p>



<p>At the U.N. climate meeting in Glasgow in 2021, diplomats from around the world agreed to work more urgently to shift away from using fossil fuels. They did not, however, adopt targets strict enough to keep the world below a warming of 1.5 degrees.</p>



<p>It’s been well over a century since chemist Svante Arrhenius recognized the consequences of putting extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Yet the world has not pulled together to avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change.</p>



<p>Time is running out.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spongy-moth-new-name-replaces-ethnic-slur">The spongy moth’s new name replaces an ethnic slur</a></h4>

              
                <p>A menacing pest just became a bit less problematic, at least socially, after getting an update to its common name. <em>Lymantria dispar </em>is an invasive insect previously known as the gypsy moth — a label that contains an ethnic slur. On March 2, the Entomological Society of America renamed <em>L. dispar </em>the spongy moth.</p>



<p>The updated term is a nod to the moth’s porous egg casing. It was selected through ESA’s <a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">Better Common Names P</a><a href="https://www.entsoc.org/better-common-names-project">roject</a>, after hundreds of new name suggestions for <em>L. dispar </em>poured in from the public after the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">society retired the old name last July</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/21)</em>. ESA elected the moth for a rebrand primarily due to its frequent presence in conversation. Now, entomologists and gardeners alike can discuss the pervasive pest without using pejorative language. It’s one action in a larger mission to decolonize science, which aims, in part, to create a more diverse and inclusive atmosphere in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Decolonizing science is actually a really broad process,” says Jessica Ware, the president of ESA and an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History. “Addressing common names is just one piece of that.”</p>



<p>This is the first rebranding that the project has tackled. It will continue to gather input on insect names that perpetuate stereotypes or contain insulting references. Ware says dozens of species are waiting to be addressed, such as the Asian giant hornet (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>). And insects aren’t the only offenders: Birds, mammals and plants often have names referencing racial or ethnic slurs or white colonizers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-culture-creativity-africa-asia-stone-age">Ancient Homo sapiens took a talent for cultural creativity from Africa to Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Creativity runs deep in human evolution. Stone Age people steered their cultures through some inventive twists and turns as far-flung groups of <em>Homo sapiens</em> independently learned to cope with harsh African environments and unfamiliar Asian settings, two new reports suggest.</p>



<p>Southern African hunter-gatherers who inhabited an arid, inland landscape between around 92,000 and 80,000 years ago survived thanks to techniques and behaviors that they formulated on their own. Those ancient innovations owed nothing to seaside communities known to have influenced how many southern African groups made stone tools starting several thousand years later, say archaeologist Alex Mackay of the University of Wollongong in Australia and his colleagues.</p>



<p>And in what is now northern China, <em>H. sapiens</em> who reached the region by around 40,000 years ago also concocted novel tools and were the first in that region to grind up pigments for decorative or symbolic purposes, say archaeologist Fa-Gang Wang of the Hebei Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in China and colleagues.</p>





<p>Together, the studies suggest Stone Age culture was more innovative than previously thought.</p>



<p>Previous studies in Africa suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-innovation-out-africa">distinctive toolmaking methods</a> at coastal sites spread across much of the southern part of the continent from at least around 72,000 years ago until roughly 59,000 years ago (<em>SN: 10/30/08</em>). But human innovations represented by finds at a rock-shelter about 44 kilometers from southern Africa’s Atlantic coast, called Varsche Rivier 003 (or VR003), <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01667-5">challenge a popular idea</a> that developments in toolmaking and other cultural behaviors originated only in seaside, resource-rich locales where neighboring human groups could have regularly shared information, Mackay and colleagues report February 28 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>The stone tools and other artifacts found at Varsche Rivier also don’t appear at sites of comparable age situated 100 kilometers to the south. That suggests ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> at VR003 were no copycats, Mackay says. “By 92,000 years ago, humans — even those likely living in low-density populations — were more than capable of generating new ideas when left to their own devices.”</p>



<p>That doesn’t surprise archaeologist Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg. <em>H. sapiens</em> in southern Africa 100,000 years ago or more developed a range of hunting tools most likely tailored to different environments, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379121002286">lightweight stone-tipped spears akin to iron-tipped javelins</a> now favored by Indigenous African hunters.</p>



<p>At that time, “<em>H. sapiens</em> populations had the necessary [mental] understanding to apply high levels of technical adaptability and creative expression wherever and whenever they needed or chose to,” says Lombard, who did not participate in either of the new studies.</p>



<p>One creative innovation at VR003 advanced stone-tool making. Stone Age people at the site slowly heated pieces of silcrete rock in open hearths, causing the chunks to shatter into small, angular fragments. Tiny, sharp-edged tools, most no longer than a paper clip, were struck off silcrete fragments. Finished products were probably used for a variety of cutting tasks and possibly hunting. Experiments with silcrete from sources near VR003 helped the researchers identify signature changes to the surfaces of heat-shattered rocks and damage produced when toolmakers struck thin flakes off those rocks.</p>



<p>Mackay’s group also unearthed 26 fragments of mollusk shells, mostly from aquatic snails called limpets. Evidence of long-distance transport of edible shellfish at the time of VR003’s occupation is rare but has been found at two other sites in arid parts of southern Africa. No evidence of interaction with coastal groups has turned up at those sites either.</p>



<p>Finally, 21 ostrich eggshell fragments uncovered at the site appear to have come from intact shells that were used as &nbsp;water vessels. Curved edges of these fragments once formed holes that were chiseled out of eggshells so that they could hold liquid, the scientists suspect.</p>



<p>People may have made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-culture-africa-inland-coasts-crystals-tools">water containers out of ostrich eggshells</a> as early as around 105,000 years ago at another inland southern African site (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>).</p>



<p>More than a continent away, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04445-2"><em>H. sapiens</em> again got creative after reaching northern China’s Nihewan Basin</a> around 40,000 years ago, Wang and colleagues report March 2 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Excavations at a site called Xiamabei revealed a patch of red-stained sediment, and the researchers found two pigment pieces with different mineral compositions and a pigment-stained limestone slab. The findings indicate that Xiamabei&#8217;s residents ground up colored pigment chunks roughly 9,000 years before the earliest previous evidence of pigment use in East Asia.</p>

<p>Nearly 400 stone artifacts found at Xiamabei include bladelike tools, many about the size of tiny tools at VR003. Those finds stand out as novel for northern China around 40,000 years ago, the scientists say. Seven tools displayed signs of having been attached to handles and used for tasks such as hide scraping and cutting plants or animal tissue.</p>



<p>Although no hominid fossils have been found at Xiamabei, fossils unearthed elsewhere in northern China indicate that <em>H. sapiens</em> reached the area around 40,000 years ago. Denisovans and Neandertals also inhabited northern China at that time. It’s uncertain which population — or possibly a group with mixed ancestry or cultural influences — left its mark at Xiamabei.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, a longstanding assumption that a single set of cultural innovations carried by <em>H. sapiens</em> from Africa — including beads, pendants and techniques for making tiny stone blades — swept across Asia starting perhaps 35,000 years ago appears increasingly unlikely, says archaeologist and study coauthor Shi-Xia Yang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiawatha-crater-greenland-age-younger-dryas">The mysterious Hiawatha crater in Greenland is 58 million years old</a></h4>

              
                <p>The powerful impact that created a mysterious crater at the northwestern edge of Greenland’s ice sheet happened <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2434">about 58 million years ago</a>, researchers report March 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That timing, confirmed by two separate dating methods, means that the asteroid or comet or meteorite that carved the depression struck long before the Younger Dryas cold snap about 13,000 years ago. Some researchers have suggested the cold spell was caused by such an impact.</p>





<p>Scientists spotted the crater in 2015 during a scan by NASA’s Operation IceBridge, which used airborne radar to measure the ice sheet’s thickness. Those and other data revealed that the crater, dubbed Hiawatha, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impact-crater-greenland-asteroid-younger-dryas">a round depression that spans 31 kilometers</a> and is buried beneath a kilometer of ice (<em>SN: 11/14/18</em>).</p>





<p>The next step was to determine how old the Hiawatha crater might be. Though the depression itself is unreachable, meltwater at the ice’s base had ported out pebbles and other sediments bearing telltale signs of alteration by an impact, including sand from partially melted rocks and pebbles containing intensely deformed, or “shocked,” zircon crystals.</p>

<p>Geochemist Gavin Kenny of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm and colleagues dated these alterations using two methods based on the radioactive decay of isotopes, or different forms of elements. For the zircons, the team measured the decay of uranium to lead, and in the sand, the researchers compared the abundances of radioactive argon isotopes with stable ones. Both methods suggest that the impact occurred about 57.99 million years ago.</p>



<p>That makes the crater far too old to be the smoking gun long sought by proponents of the controversial <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/younger-dryas-comet-impact-cold-snap">Younger Dryas impact hypothesis</a> (<em>SN: 6/26/18</em>). The timing also isn’t quite right to link it to a warm period called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glass-bits-charcoal-hint-56-million-year-old-space-rock-impact">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>, which began around 56 million years ago (<em>SN: 9/28/16</em>). For now, the researchers say, what impact this space punch may have had on Earth&#8217;s global climate remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetically-modified-mosquito-test-california-epa-oxitec">Genetically modified mosquitoes could be tested in California soon</a></h4>

              
                <p>Genetically modified mosquitoes might soon be whining on both U.S. coasts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2019-0274-0470">approved two more years</a> of testing Oxitec’s genetically modified mosquitoes as living pest controls, continuing a pilot program started in 2021 in the Florida Keys and expanding it to up to four counties in California. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now the Florida and California state governments will consider whether to grant permission.</p>



<p>The male mosquitoes, OX5034 <em>Aedes aegypti</em> engineered by the biotech company Oxitec, carry daughter-killing genes that get passed generation to generation. When these males mate with local females outside a lab, only the sons should survive. Those inheriting the sabotage gene will grow up to mate with normal females, dooming their daughters too.</p>





<p>The wild <em>A. aegypti</em> species, an invader in North America, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquitoes-florida-now-spreading-zika-virus-health-officials-warn">can spread dengue, Zika, yellow fever and other diseases</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/16</em>). California first reported the invader in 2013, and by February 2022 had found it in 22 counties. The EPA permission, issued March 7, will now allow testing of the GM mosquitoes, if desired, in Stanislaus, Fresno, Tulare and San Bernadino counties.</p>



<p>In Florida, the permit covers just one county, Monroe, which stretches down the Keys. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">2021 mosquito releases</a> there came after more than a decade of heated debate (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). Despite approval of the previous tests, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services needs to vote again on the new plans. The last time, the group voted at its next board meeting after EPA announced its decision, but “we are not sure that will happen this time around,” says Chad Huff of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District.</p>



<p>If approved and fulfilled to the EPA-set limits in both locations, nearly 2.5 billion of these GM mosquitoes could be released before permission expires April 30, 2024. Fortunately, male mosquitoes, GM or otherwise, don’t bite.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-de-extinct-christmas-rat-species-gene-editing">An extinct rat shows CRISPR’s limits for resurrecting species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Before the early 1900s, if it walked like a Christmas Island rat and talked like a Christmas Island rat, it probably was a Christmas Island rat. But if one of these now-extinct rats ever walks the Earth again, it will actually be a genetically modified Norway brown rat. And the rodent won’t be as similar to the Christmas Island rat as some would hope, a new study finds.</p>



<p>With the advent of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gene-editing technology such as CRISPR</a>, scientists have shifted from cloning to genetic engineering as the most promising method for “de-extinction,” or the resurrection of species that have died out (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>). But unlike cloning, genetic engineering wouldn’t create an exact replica of an extinct species. Instead, the technique would edit an existing animal’s genome so that it resembles that of the desired extinct animal. The challenge is making that proxy as similar to the extinct species as possible.</p>



<p>To explore the limits of this method, researchers attempted to recover the genome of the Christmas Island rat. By comparing fragments of the extinct rat’s genetic instruction book with the genome of a living relative, the Norway brown rat, the team was able to recover about 95 percent of the extinct genome. That sounds like a lot, but it means that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00249-4">5 percent of the genome was still missing</a>, including some regions that were important to smell and the immune system, scientists report in the April 11 <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“You can only bring back what you can find. And our point is we can’t find everything,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>To get the extinct rat’s genome, Gilbert and his colleagues took ancient DNA from two preserved skin samples of the Christmas Island rat. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reviving-extinct-dna">Ancient DNA</a>, extracted from specimens that died anywhere from a few decades to thousands of years ago, is far from perfect (<em>SN: 5/19/08</em>). Gilbert describes an extinct species’ genome as a book that has been shredded. One way to reconstruct this shredded book is to scan the fragments and compare them with a reference.</p>



<p>With an intact copy of the original book, someone could theoretically reconstruct the book perfectly. When identifying a reference genome, researchers look for a species that diverged evolutionarily from the extinct species fairly recently —&nbsp;in other words, a very similar book. The genomes will match closely, but not perfectly.</p>



<p>For that reason, the Christmas Island rat (<em>Rattus macleari</em>) was an obvious choice for analysis for the scientists. It diverged from its closest relative, the Norway brown rat (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>), only around 2.6 million years ago.</p>



<p>The team found that the Christmas Island rat genome mapped to about 95 percent of the Norway brown rat genome. Further analyses showed that the roughly 5 percent that was missing could not be explained solely by a flaw in the technique or an inadequate reference genome. Rather, because of evolutionary divergence between the two species, most of that genetic information was simply lost.</p>



<p>What’s more, that missing information wasn’t random. Genes that were partially or completely missing tended to fall within two main regions that controlled the rat’s immune responses and sense of smell. So, if a Norway brown rat’s genome was edited to resemble the Christmas Island rat, the new critter would smell in a different way than its prototype did. This could hinder a proxy Christmas Island rat’s chance at survival if it were released into its former habitat.</p>

<p>Gilbert doesn’t think it’s likely that anyone will try to de-extinct a rat. But he says that what the team has demonstrated could prove useful for people working on even more ambitious projects, like bringing back the woolly mammoth. The divergence between the Norway brown rat and the extinct Christmas Island rat, for example, is similar to that between the Asian elephant and woolly mammoth.</p>



<p>“By doing these kinds of analyses, which is not hard to do, you can at least come up with the what will you get, what will you not get, and you can use that to decide is it worth doing,” Gilbert says.</p>



<p>Despite the hurdles, using the technology to bring back species is still worth doing, says Ben Novak, lead scientist at Revive &amp; Restore, a nonprofit that uses genetic engineering for conservation projects. He plans to apply Gilbert and colleagues’ analysis to his own work on the passenger pigeon, which went extinct in 1914. There are possible solutions for how to capture some of the missing data, he says, but the fact that some data will always be missing is a limitation that de-extinction scientists have already come to terms with.</p>



<p>“The reference assembly problem will always be a barrier to de-extinction,” Novak says. “Anyone pursuing de-extinction has to settle on the fact that we want to get as close as we can to something that fools the environment.”</p>



<p>In other words, a de-extinct mammoth created using gene editing, if such a thing ever comes to be, won’t exactly be a mammoth; it will be closer to a hairy Asian elephant adapted to live in the cold. And the new analysis suggests that the proxy animal version will probably have enough differences that would make it difficult for the creature to refill its previous ecological niche. For some, that might be enough to defeat the purpose of the exercise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As a science, it&#8217;s awesome,” Gilbert says. But “is this the best use of the money in a world where we can&#8217;t keep our rhinos alive?”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>After finding out details about a stranger, we mistakenly think that they also know about us. As a result, we act more honestly around them, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04452-3">recent study</a> in <em>Nature</em>. And this can have a real-world impact: the team finds that after residents are given biographical information about neighbourhood police officers, the crime rate in nearby areas reduces.</p>



<span id="more-45666"></span>



<p>Past research has found that we tend to assume social relationships are reciprocal. Most of the time, this assumption is accurate: someone you think of as a friend will usually consider you a friend too, for instance. But sometimes our social ties are more one-sided: for example, you might learn something about a stranger who doesn’t know you at all. Anuj K. Shah from the University of Chicago and Michael LaForest from Pennsylvania State University wondered whether, in this situation, our tendency to believe that social ties are symmetrical could lead us to mistakenly feel that a stranger does actually know us.</p>



<p>In a series of lab-based studies, this is exactly what the researchers found. In each experiment, online participants were ostensibly paired with another participant (in reality, this partner didn’t exist). Some participants were given information about their partner while others were not, before rating how well this stranger knew them.</p>



<p>In one set of studies, participants answered three multiple-choice questions about their lives; half then saw their partner’s responses to the same questions and half did not. All participants were then told that their partner was trying to guess their own answers. Participants who saw their partner’s responses believed that this stranger understood them better than those who did not.</p>



<p>In further experiments, participants wrote down four true statements and one lie about themselves. Some participants also saw statements supposedly written by a partner. Again, this group believed that the partner would be more likely to guess which of their own statements was a lie than those who didn’t read their partner’s statements. And in another study, the team found that people were more likely to give honest answers to a question if they had read information about their partner — and this effect seemed at least partly driven by the fact that these participants felt their partner knew them better.</p>



<p>These studies all suggested that when we know about strangers, we erroneously think they also know about us. But the really interesting finding came when the researchers stepped out of the lab, to conduct a field experiment in collaboration with the New York City Police Department and Housing Authority. The team developed leaflets containing fairly mundane information about local community police officers, such as their favourite food, hobbies, or reasons for joining the police force. They then sent out these leaflets to every apartment in a number of housing developments in disadvantaged areas. The officers themselves also dropped off cards to local residents containing similar information.</p>



<p>Two months later, the researchers surveyed residents at these housing developments as well as control areas that did not receive leaflets or outreach cards. Residents imagined they had committed a crime that they could be fined for, and were asked how likely it would be that local officers would find out about it. They also rated how well the officers in the area knew them.</p>



<p>The team found that residents of the developments that had received the intervention believed it more likely that local officers would find out about illegal activity than residents of the control areas (though there was no significant effect on residents’ perceptions of how well police officers knew them). Even more strikingly, the team found that immediately after the intervention, there were fewer criminal complaints and arrests in the areas around the developments that had received the intervention than around the control developments.</p>



<p>Giving people information about local police therefore seems to reduce their own sense of anonymity, and by doing so may even reduce crime rates. It’s worth noting that the reduction in crime was only seen in the first three months after the information was sent out, so this may not be a long-term solution. And, as the authors acknowledge, increasing trust in the police requires much broader reforms and changes at a societal level.</p>



<p>Still, the reduction in crime in this study was comparable to the reduction seen when police forces increase their presence in crime hotspots. This suggests that giving people more information about their local officers could be a straightforward method to achieve similar results, “without increasing the number of potentially fraught officer–citizen interactions”, the researchers conclude.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirror-beetle-shiny-camouflage-ecology">Mirror beetles’ shiny bodies may not act as camouflage after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is a story about camouflage, but forget mud-blob brown, mealy beige and somber green.&nbsp; Here scientists study mirror glitz and the paradoxical notion that there’s a shiny side to camo.</p>



<p>Mirrorlike surfaces have evolved in open-ocean fishes as well as in spiders, butterfly chrysalises and most branches of the vast diversity of beetles, says visual ecologist Amanda Franklin of the University of Melbourne. One popular idea proposes that these living mirrors might confound predators by reflecting water, leaves, twigs or whatever.</p>

<p>For a test of dry-land mirrors, Franklin and her colleagues turned to a showy group of about 40 species of scarab beetles, some with a natural gleam. In golds, bronzes, greens and blues, they climb into eucalyptus trees to flirt and mate during their native Australia’s high summer in December. “People love Christmas beetles,” Franklin says.</p>



<p>To see if good reflection gives protection, Franklin set out to create nubs of clay roughly the shape of two greenish Christmas beetles, one with a mirror finish and one matte like their real-life counterparts, <em>Anoplognathus parvulus</em> (shiny) and <em>A. prasinus</em> (dull).</p>







<p>Creating a “brushed-metal” look was easy, but she needed fake beetles with a full muscle car metal shine. Also she needed something fast to make. “If you have to sand it all day, you’re not going to be able to make a thousand,&#8221; Franklin says.</p>



<p>But prototype after prototype failed to shine. After about six weeks of frustration, “we probably had hundreds in the throw-out bin.” Working with a specialist in a hobby shop where her father for years bought supplies for making model World War II planes finally cracked the mirror mystery.</p>



<p>The trick to beetle-grade reflectivity turned out to be finding just the right super-smooth resin to coat the models before spray-painting. Then just a bit of sanding the shiny models approximated the relative difference between the mirror species and its drabber relative.</p>

<p>Franklin and her colleagues then set out more than a thousand models for six days in two regions of Australia and in both leafy and open areas. In areas with such beetle eaters as butcherbirds and cuckoo-shrikes, the researchers checked for beak marks indicating bird attacks. The mirror finish, however, <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.13963">didn’t show a clear benefit</a>, Franklin and colleagues reported in the January 2022 <em>Functional Ecology</em>. The soft “bodies” of the glossy fakes had just about as many gashes and dings from bird strikes as the matte finish models did.</p>



<p>A test with people as pretend predators wearing eye-tracker rigs also failed to show that shiny things were harder to find than the scuffed, duller beetles. All faux beetles at least avoided being hungrily speared once spotted. “The benefit is that you can tell a human what to do,” Franklin says.</p>



<p>Mirror camo might still work in some predicaments, but Franklin is now wondering if the big advantage of mirror bodies perhaps has little to do with their looks. The complicated microstructures that create the mirrors might, for instance, reduce the danger of cracks or fungal cooties. <em>Homo sapiens</em> fixates on looks, but maybe the visual thrill of a Christmas beetle’s mirror is just a holiday bonus.</p>
