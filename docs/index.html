<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/8935858-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The Polio Eradication Programme in Nigeria is making positive strides towards interruption of wild poliovirus (WPV). The past two decades were marked with surges in WPV cases that saw Nigeria accounting for almost half of the global burden of WPV in 2005. During 2003-2013, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) faced a serious challenge with resurgence of polio virus originating from Nigeria in twenty-six previously polio-free countries in sub Saharan Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>WPV cases increased from 202 in 2002 to a peak of 1,122 in 2006 following suspension of immunization campaigns in northern Nigeria due to unfounded rumors of oral polio vaccine (OPV) safety. Through an aggressive effort, the suspension was lifted and the campaigns reinstated.</p>
<p>Another surge in WPV cases was recorded in 2012 with 122 cases, up from 63 cases in 2011. In 2012, the Nigerian government launched the national polio eradication emergency plan (NPEEP) to intensify efforts to interrupt WPV transmission. A progressive decline in WPV1 cases was thereafter achieved from 122 in 2012 to 0 in 2015.</p>
<p>The strong leadership of the program by the Government of Nigeria at Federal and State level, the engagement of the traditional institutions, establishment of an Incident Management System through Emergency Operation Centres (EOC) to coordinate all efforts of government and partners at Federal level and in high risk states, and the localized innovative strategies to address the outbreak were some of the major contributing factors to the progress registered.</p>
<p>The program came close to marking two years without WPV1 in 2016. After twenty-three months without detection of WPV1, four cases were detected from areas that had not been accessible to the program for over three years due to insecurity in Borno state, north eastern Nigeria. Genetic sequencing of the viruses revealed the closest known link to a virus last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating prolonged undetected circulation for over four years.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time of publishing this supplement in 2018, the country has marked just over two years without WPV1.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the resurgence of WPV1 in 2016 paused a major setback to the country and regional progress, it provided an opportunity for the program to stretch its innovative capacity to mount a response in a complex environment. The outbreak in Borno demonstrated the necessity of ensuring accessibility, particularly for surveillance to rule out any undetected presence of the virus.</p>
<p>Innovative strategies for surveillance and vaccination, and strengthening of partnerships with non-traditional actors have been instrumental to the progress registered so far in the response to the 2016 outbreak. At the time of publishing this supplement in 2018, the country has marked just over two years without WPV1. However, an estimated 70,000 under-five children remain trapped in insecure areas of Borno state, and therefore the progress is acknowledged with caution. Nigeria still remains among the three WPV endemic countries globally, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>This supplement presents some of the innovations, lessons learned and best practices that the Nigerian government and its polio partners implemented during 2014-2016 towards interruption of WPV transmission. The programmatic interventions described here include innovative strategies such as directly observed vaccination (DOPV), addressing unmet needs of non-compliant households, use of mobile hard-to-reach teams, focus on nomadic groups and engagement of security personnel to interrupt polio virus transmission in polio sanctuaries in northern Nigeria, along rivers of interest and security compromised areas respectively.</p>
<p>Ensuring sensitive and quality surveillance to detect any suspect viruses is a key aspect of the NPEEP. Initiatives to intensify surveillance at field level, evaluate the quality of documentation and profile of polio compatible cases have been implemented in Nigeria. Furthermore, innovations such as Auto-Visual AFP Detection and Reporting (AVADAR), and use of mobile technology for monitoring program performance have facilitated reporting in real-time for decision making and timely action.</p>
<p>In line with the strategic focus of the Global Polio End Game Strategy and Plan, the switch from tOPV to bOPV was successfully implemented in April 2016 and some lessons from the field have been documented. In addition, laboratory containment activities, in conformity with the Global Action Plan III, were implemented.</p>
<p>We believe that these public health interventions, among other activities, have contributed to the progress registered for far in the polio eradication program in Nigeria and will further enable Nigeria achieve and sustain polio-free status. The ongoing effort to utilize the lessons learned and assets available to improve routine immunization, integrated disease surveillance and response, and primary health care will be maximized to ensure a smooth transition towards certification of polio eradication. It is our hope that these interventions and experiences will be of interest to public health and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When’s the best time of day to give someone bad news? First thing in the morning or early evening? Yes, if it’s in the morning, they have longer to work out what to do about it, but you might be better off plumping for the evening because according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/npr2.12042">new study</a>, published open-access in <i>Neuropsychopharmacology,</i> they’re likely to suffer less of a physiological stress response at this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35610"></span></p>
<p>If a threat – whether physical or psychological – doesn’t quickly vanish, communication between a trio of brain regions – the hypothalamus, the pituitary glands and the adrenal cortex (known collectively as the HPA axis) – causes, among other things, an increase in levels of the hormone cortisol, which triggers the release of glucose, for energy, into the bloodstream. This stress response effectively provides our muscles with extra fuel to fight or flee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, there’s also a daily pattern to our baseline levels of cortisol production – healthy people typically experience a spike around waking, and a steady decrease in levels throughout the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All kinds of other factors also influence an individual’s cortisol levels at any given time, including age, sex, sleep/wake time preferences, exercise patterns and general stress levels. This raises the possibility that how we respond physically to stress might vary depending on the time of day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To find out, Yujiro Yamanaka at Hokkaido University and colleagues recruited 20 male and 7 female healthy young subjects with similar typical sleep durations and average wake/sleep times (in other words, they were not “larks” or “owls”); also none of them had a history of hormonal, psychiatric or sleep problems. The participants first gave saliva samples every two hours for one day, so their typical daily cortisol levels could be assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They were then randomised to undergo a stressful experience either two hours after they typically woke up, or ten hours afterwards. For the stress experience, the researchers used the widely-used Trier Social Stress test, which requires people to give a presentation and perform mental arithmetic in front of interviewers, while being videoed. Saliva samples were collected from all the participants before their test, immediately afterwards and then every ten minutes for half an hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that the group that were stressed in the morning showed a statistically significant increase in their cortisol levels after the test, compared with before (a sign of a large stress response). In contrast, the cortisol increase in the evening group was smaller and did not reach statistical significance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers said it seems that the HPA axis “has a powerful response to acute psychological stress in the morning rather than in the evening”. Animal research suggests that this might be because the adrenal cortex typically becomes less sensitive to ACTH, the hormone produced by the pituitary gland that triggers the release of cortisol, as the day wears on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What are the implications of all this?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given all the factors that affect an individual’s cortisol levels and their response to stress, the real-world impact of experiencing morning vs. evening stress is far from clear. There’s another complication – the researchers explained that if stress in the evening doesn’t significantly hike cortisol levels, and so does not increase glucose availability, we might in fact be <i>more</i> vulnerable to any threat, because we might find it harder to mount a useful response. On the other hand, if that stressor is something we can’t immediately combat, and we’re frequently stressed, arguably it might be better to have a lower cortisol response, because chronically elevated levels of cortisol are associated with ill health. In other words, the short answer to the question of whether to share bad news in the morning or evening is: “it depends!”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for other researchers interested in stress, these new results (while they need replicating with larger samples) also have implications: the time of day of experiments investigating stress could, it seems, affect the results in important ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/epistemologie-politique-i-introduction/">Epistémologie politique (I) Introduction</a></h4>

<p>Dans cette série, je m’intéresse à l’épistémologie de la pensée politique. J’entends ici par épistémologie la théorie de la connaissance de manière générale, c’est-à-dire pas seulement la connaissance scientifique mais la connaissance du monde, plus généralement. Dans la pensée politique, il y a bien sûr un aspect normatif (comment la société devrait être organisée et dans quel but) mais cette normativité prend toujours appui sur une théorie du monde : comment fonctionnent la société, l’économie, les structures de pouvoir. Elle inclut également toujours un certain nombre de présupposés sur la psychologie humaine. Par exemple, selon une théorie typiquement associée à la droite conservatrice, l’homme est un loup pour l’homme (Hobbes) ; il s’ensuit que des institutions doivent être créées pour protéger l’homme de ses congénères. Une variante (droite libérale) est que l’homme cherche avant tout à maximiser à son intérêt personnel ; il s’ensuit que les institutions sociales doivent être organisées de façon à ce que l’intérêt personnel coïncide avec l’intérêt collectif. Selon une autre théorie ancrée à gauche, l’homme est naturellement altruiste (Rousseau) ; il s’ensuit que la société doit être organisée pour faciliter la coopération entre les hommes (avec bien sûr de nombreuses variantes ; anarchismes, communismes, etc).</p>
<p>Ainsi les doctrines politiques sont en grande partie déterminées par des théories sous-jacentes de l’homme et du monde. Par conséquent, les désaccords politiques sont très souvent liés à des désaccords sur ces théories et se manifestent donc sur le plan épistémologique. Par exemple, les discours de droite tendent à se présenter comme « réalistes » ; la droite libérale comme « rationnelle » ; par opposition à une gauche qui serait « utopiste ». En utilisant ces mots, on se place non sur le plan de la finalité politique mais sur celui de la connaissance : on admet que la finalité des systèmes politiques critiqués est louable, mais on prétend qu’ils reposent sur une vision fausse de la façon dont le monde fonctionne. C’est donc réellement sur la connaissance que porte le jugement, sur la validité empirique des théories sous-jacentes.</p>
<p>Le système politique néolibéral, par exemple (habituellement classé au centre droit), refuse généralement l’appellation « néolibéral », pourquoi ? Parce que ses partisans ne pensent pas suivre une doctrine particulière, mais simplement exprimer ce qui est rationnel, « logique ». D’un point de vue épistémologique, cette posture est critiquable, puisque la logique s’exprime dans un cadre formel, et donc dans un modèle particulier. Autrement dit, la rationalité s’exerce au sein d’une théorie particulière du monde, ce qui fait que deux discours contradictoires peuvent être rationnels, mais relatifs à des théories différentes. Par exemple, les discours Keynésiens et néoclassiques sont deux discours rationnels contradictoires, parce qu’ils reposent sur des modèles différents. Conformément à cette posture rationaliste, la pensée néolibérale ou néoclassique repose largement sur une connaissance mathématisée, c’est-à-dire dont les questions portent sur des aspects formels plutôt que sur la validité empirique du modèle sous-jacent (comme le concept de l’agent rationnel). La théorie tend par conséquent à ignorer les champs du savoir permettant de questionner empiriquement les modèles socio-économiques, tels que l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie. On peut donc formuler une critique épistémologique de cette pensée politique.</p>
<p>De manière symétrique, le discours de gauche tend à dépeindre la pensée politique de droite comme la manifestation sournoise de mauvaises intentions. Par exemple, le discours économique de droite tend à promouvoir la réduction de l’impôt, en particulier sur les plus riches. Ceci est vu par la critique de gauche comme la défense des intérêts d’une classe dominante. Pourquoi ? Encore une fois, on peut analyser la question sous l’angle épistémologique. Selon les théories de gauche, l’impôt est ce qui permet de répartir équitablement les richesses. Par conséquent, une mesure tendant à réduire l’impôt favorise les classes riches de la population. Il s’ensuit qu’un système politique qui promeut cette mesure doit avoir pour but de favoriser ces classes. Il s’agit encore une fois de la simple expression de la rationalité au sein d’un cadre théorique. On a donc dans le discours néolibéral et dans sa critique deux discours rationnels au sein de cadres théoriques différents.</p>
<p>Ce dernier exemple soulève un autre point épistémologique intéressant, qui est la façon dont les partisans d’une théorie jugent ceux d’une autre théorie. On voit dans cet exemple l’opposition de deux mépris : le néolibéral considère son critique comme idiot (irrationnel) ; le critique considère le néolibéral comme égoïste et de mauvaise foi. Dans les deux cas, le partisan juge son adversaire en utilisant son propre cadre théorique, c’est-à-dire comme si l’adversaire utilisait le même cadre théorique. En effet, le néolibéral juge son critique idiot, parce que ce critique serait effectivement idiot s’il adoptait le cadre théorique néolibéral mais n’en tirait pas les conclusions logiques (d’où le discours récurrent des gouvernants face à leur opposition qu’il faut « faire de la pédagogie », ce qui est perçu à juste titre comme du mépris). De même, l’opposant juge le néolibéral de mauvaise foi, c’est-à-dire qu’il considère que celui-ci est tout à fait conscient que ses propositions politiques favorisent la classe dominante. Or ceci suppose qu’il a adopté le cadre théorique alternatif de l’opposant. Dans les deux cas donc, chacun semble négliger la possibilité que son propre cadre de pensée est une théorie dont il est convaincu, et non une vérité évidente et universelle. Il en résulte une critique relativement stérile, en cela qu’elle ne porte pas sur les fondements (notamment empiriques) des théories en compétition mais sur les supposées compétences des interlocuteurs d’un côté (arguments d’autorité) et sur les intérêts personnels ou de classe de l’autre (invectives).</p>
<p>On touche ici à deux points distincts. D’une part, au statut épistémologique des théories (est-ce qu’elles se valent toutes et ne sont que des points de vue ? ou peut-on les juger empiriquement ou théoriquement ?). Sur ce point, on peut s’appuyer sur une riche littérature en philosophie des sciences. D’autre part, à la psychologie des croyances : qu’est-ce qui fait que l’on croit à certaines théories plutôt qu’à d’autres, et qu’éventuellement on change d’avis ? Sur ce deuxième point, on peut s’appuyer également sur une riche littérature en psychologie sociale, comme la <a href="https://www.psychologie-sociale.com/index.php/fr/theories/influence/6-la-theorie-de-la-dissonance-cognitive">théorie de la dissonance cognitive</a> dont je parlerai dans un prochain texte. Celle-ci propose que l’on cherche à rendre nos actes et nos croyances cohérents non seulement en agissant conformément à nos croyances, mais également dans de nombreux cas en adaptant nos croyances à nos actes (entre autres). Par exemple, une personne qui gagne beaucoup d’argent peut se convaincre qu’un système politique qui favorise l’inégalité est plus efficace. Ceci explique l’alignement entre catégories sociologiques et croyances politiques, qui est plus satisfaisante que la théorie de la mauvaise foi. Ce n’est effectivement pas un hasard si les classes supérieures tendent à adopter une théorie qui justifie leur position sociale (e.g. la théorie néolibérale), mais cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que cette adoption est cynique. Au contraire, ces croyances sont sincères. Simplement, différentes catégories sociologiques et culturelles sont plus ou moins susceptibles d’adopter différentes croyances.</p>
<p>Dans cette série, je compte donc développer une critique épistémologique du discours politique.</p>

<p>In this paper we introduce three methods for re-scaling data sets aiming at improving the likelihood of clustering validity indexes to return the true number of spherical Gaussian clusters with additional noise features. Our method obtains feature re-scaling factors taking into account the structure of a given data set and the intuitive idea that different features may have different degrees of relevance at different clusters. We experiment with the Silhouette (using squared Euclidean, Manhattan, and the pth power of the Minkowski distance), Dunn’s, Calinski–Harabasz and Hartigan indexes on data sets with spherical Gaussian clusters with and without noise features. We conclude that our methods indeed increase the chances of estimating the true number of clusters in a data set.</p>

<p>The issue of determining “the right number of clusters” in K-Means has attracted considerable interest, especially in the recent years. Cluster intermix appears to be a factor most affecting the clustering results. This paper proposes an experimental setting for comparison of different approaches at data generated from Gaussian clusters with the controlled parameters of between- and within-cluster spread to model cluster intermix. The setting allows for evaluating the centroid recovery on par with conventional evaluation of the cluster recovery. The subjects of our interest are two versions of the “intelligent” K-Means method, ik-Means, that find the “right” number of clusters by extracting “anomalous patterns” from the data one-by-one. We compare them with seven other methods, including Hartigan’s rule, averaged Silhouette width and Gap statistic, under different between- and within-cluster spread-shape conditions. There are several consistent patterns in the results of our experiments, such as that the right K is reproduced best by Hartigan’s rule – but not clusters or their centroids. This leads us to propose an adjusted version of iK-Means, which performs well in the current experiment setting.</p>

<p>“Learning styles” – there can be few ideas that have created such a stark disconnect between the experts on the ground and the evidence published in scholarly journals. Endorsed by the overwhelming majority of teachers, yet dismissed by most psychologists and educational neuroscientists as a “neuromyth”, the basis of learning styles is that people learn better when taught via their preferred learning modality, usually (but not always) described as either visual, auditory or kinaesthetic.</p>
<p>Many studies have already uncovered <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/">serious problems with the learning styles concept</a>, such as that measures of learning styles are invalid and that students do not in fact learn better via their preferred modality. Now further evidence against learning styles comes from Greece, in one of the first investigations on the topic to involve primary school pupils.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00105/full">Writing in <em>Frontiers in Education</em></a>, Marietta Papadatou-Pastou and her colleagues report that teachers and pupils did not agree on the pupils’ preferred learning modality – a significant blow for the learning styles concept since “teachers typically adopt learning styles within a classroom context by relying on their own assessment of students’ learning styles.”</p>
<p><span id="more-35587"></span></p>
<p>The study was simple enough – nearly 200 fifth- and sixth-grade pupils (average age 11 years) from five schools chose which was their preferred learning style out of visual, auditory or kinaesthetic. They also completed a short IQ test (the Raven’s matrices). Next, their teachers – 19 took part – first provided an open-ended answer to the question “Does teaching that is tailor-made to the students’ learning style reinforce the students’ performance?”, then they were asked to identify each of their pupils’ favoured style (such that each child was rated by one teacher).</p>
<p>All of the participating teachers endorsed the concept of learning styles. However, there was not a statistically significant correlation between the teachers’ judgments of their pupils’ favoured learning style and the pupils’ own declaration of their preference. “We posit that identifying preferred learning style can be a hit-and-miss process, with no agreement between the assessment made by teachers and students,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>There was also no association between the teachers’ judgments of pupils’ learning style and the pupils’ IQ, suggesting the teachers were not using IQ as a proxy for learning style.</p>
<p>A weakness of the study was that the teachers were not asked specifically about the kind of learning styles approach they used or favoured, so it’s possible they were not familiar with the visual, auditory, kinaesthetic breakdown, though this seems unlikely since this so-called VARK model is the most popular.</p>
<p>Papadatou-Pastou and her team concluded that “… if the identification of learning styles … is unreliable, as evidence by the findings of the present study, this should constitute an additional reason why teachers should abandon the use of learning styles in instruction.”</p>

Recently, we wrote in STAT about the “research integrity czars” that some journals are hiring to catch misconduct and errors. But are there other ways that journals could ensure the integrity of the scientific record? Tom Jefferson, a physician, methods researcher, and campaigner for open clinical trial data, has a suggestion, which he explores in … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/11/its-time-to-get-serious-about-decreasing-bias-in-the-clinical-literature-heres-one-way-to-do-that/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">It’s time to get serious about decreasing bias in the clinical literature.

Also contentious is its demand that all research papers funded by cOAlition S members must be published under the most liberal Creative Commons licence (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a></span> or equivalent). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>While cOAlition S <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/feedback/">subsequently announced</a></span> that hybrid OA will get a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/plan-s-three-year-transition-period-hybrid-journals">three-year stay of execution</a></span>, <i>Nature </i><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">calculates</a></span> that banning hybrid OA means that European researchers will be unable to publish in 85% of the journals they currently submit too. Rather they will need to publish in “pure” gold OA journals, which in most cases will require paying article-processing charges (APCs). In addition, the ban has raised concerns about academic freedom. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>And although cOAlition S insists that green OA (self-archiving) will remain an option for researchers, the strict compliance rules it has set (and the technical requirements demanded of repositories) would seem to mean that in most cases green OA will be <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/12/07/plan-s-a-mandate-for-gold-oa-with-lots-of-strings-attached/">practically impossible</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Plan S is the most ambitious OA initiative yet mooted by any public research funder and has caused hand-wringing even amongst OA advocates.

To add to the concern, earlier this year it was <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/news/20180309booksellerinterviewhill/196071">announced</a> that to be eligible for the 2027 REF long-form scholarly works and monographs will have to be published OA.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>We make all kinds of snap decisions about a person based on their facial appearance. How trustworthy we think they are is one of the most important, as it can have many social and financial consequences, from influencing our decisions about whether to lend someone money to <a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/1019689/volumes/v43/NA-43">which Airbnb property to book</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12357">new study</a>, published in the <i>British Journal of Psychology</i>, note, “Although facial impressions of trustworthiness are formed automatically, they are not especially accurate predictors of trustworthy behaviour.” People who are less susceptible to forming these impressions could, then, be at an advantage. And, as Jasmine Hooper at the University of Western of Australia and colleagues now report, men with high levels of autistic traits fall into this category.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35584"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361314559431">Earlier work</a> (involving two authors of the new study) already hinted that autism might have a bearing on whether people act on first impressions in a typical way. The researchers found that when they prompted boys diagnosed with autism to judge trustworthiness from photographs, they formed the same kinds of impressions as non-autistic boys, but unlike them, they did not use these judgments in their decision-making in an economic trust game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To explore whether higher levels of autistic-like traits, such as increased attention to detail, might also affect the use of first impressions even among the general population, the researchers recruited 46 men without autism, who completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (a symptom-based scale which is typically used by clinicians to diagnose autism) and a facial trustworthiness impressions task. The researchers found that, as they predicted, when prompted to make trustworthiness judgements from faces, people with high or low levels of autistic traits made similar judgements. But the next phase of the study showed some important differences between the two groups.</p>
<p>All the participants also took part in an adult version of the economic trust game used in the earlier research with boys, in which they interacted with virtual “partners”, who had been independently rated as looking either trustworthy or untrustworthy. Over a series of trials, these partners were consistently fair or selfish, and crucially this behaviour pattern was <i>not</i> related to their facial appearance. Therefore the best strategy for predicting future behaviour – and making money, because participants could keep their winnings – was for the participants to ignore appearances and focus solely on their partner’s behaviour in previous money allocation trials.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Again as the researchers predicted, the men with relatively low levels of autistic traits were influenced by how trustworthy or not the partners looked. The men who scored relatively high on the AQ scale were influenced too, but to a significantly lesser extent – they were more influenced by their partners’ actual behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Only between 1 and 1.5 per cent of people in the UK are thought to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. However, many other people do not meet the diagnostic criteria for autism but do have relatively high levels of autistic traits – there may therefore be a sizeable subset of people who are able to form trustworthiness judgements based on people’s faces when prompted, but who don’t do this automatically, and also aren’t so inclined to use these judgments in their social decisions (and so are less swayed by potentially misleading facial impressions than the rest of the population).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers note, “If facial impressions are not especially accurate predictions of actual trustworthiness, failure to use them to guide trust decisions may actually represent highly rational social behaviour.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>A drop in the number of medical students entering the field of obstetrics and gynecology in the United States led to teaching institutions making a number of changes. It was hoped that the changes would encourage students to enter the field and now, nearly 15 years later that strategy appears to have worked.</p>
<p>In a recent publication by <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1362-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Isabel C. Green and colleagues</a>, the authors looked into which factors were the most important in determining students’ choice of an OB GYN career. Through interviews with students who had chosen to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology, Green et al. discovered which aspects of teaching and which pre-medical school experiences were most likely to lead to an interest in the field.</p>

The trial will be using an internet-based support program to help survivors meet recommended guidelines for activity.</p>
<p>Improving physical activity levels for those who have completed cancer treatment has been shown to help the overall wellbeing of survivors and raise their quality of life. If the PABLO trial can show that this approach can help cancer survivors in real terms and is cost-effective, it may become a part of standard care.</p>

<p>As winter approaches, the public is often encouraged to seek influenza vaccination, especially for young children and the elderly. However, another high risk population which can be overlooked is health professionals. Health professionals are exposed to unique risk factors and so ensuring that they are vaccinated is especially important.</p>

<p>As physicians we’re often confronted with different issues of ethics and human rights at different levels. Physicians can on the one hand be involved in the treatment of injuries related to war, but also in different forms of human rights violations.</p>
<p>Salvador Allende and Che Guevara were physicians seen as heroes and social reformers by many, even outside of their respective countries: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991268,00.html">Time magazine</a> claimed Guevara to be one of most influential personalities of the 20th century. On the other hand there have been physicians like Mengele or Illig working actively and by their own free decision without regard for medical ethics in the German and Austrian National Socialist regime performing dubious “research” in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26749461">spirit of that ideology</a>.</p>
<p>Physicians can also be convinced to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15776476">violate ethical standards</a> in a situation of “<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h589.long">dual obligations</a>”, common in situations such as prisons. Dr. Wendy Orr, a former District Surgeon in Port Elizabeth in South Africa, wrote in her foreword to the British Medical Association’s handbook on medicine and human rights, about her work with detainees during the <a href="https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1733645&amp;blobtype=pdf">apartheid regime</a>. She describes how she became aware of the systematic abuse of detainees by the security forces and the silence and complicity of her medical colleagues. She recounts her growing moral disorientation as she realized she was expected to declare patients “fit” for corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Similar situations have recently been reported in asylum cases even in countries with better earlier human rights track records. US physicians and psychologists have further been involved in planning and observation of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001027">torturing prisoners in Guantanamo</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Upholding human rights</strong></h3>
<p>Human rights systems such as the universal prohibition of torture, outlined in <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cat.aspx">UN Convention against Torture</a> are so fundamental that they cannot be suspended under any circumstances, they are “non-derogable”, and their violation can and must be investigated and prosecuted. Physicians should have a special positive role in this process.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10509518">Istanbul Protocol</a>” supported equally by the UN, and the World Medical Association, is an interdisciplinary standard that guides physicians and legal professionals to collaborate in ethical and humanitarian standards, forensic documentation, reporting, and investigation of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001027">alleged torture</a>. It can also contribute to new strategies in the <a href="https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/28748402">protection of survivors</a> applying for asylum and for <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-72914-5.pdf">prosecution of perpetrators</a>.</p>
<p>Physicians can put themselves at risk for upholding these legal and ethical standards. For instance, it’s been <a href="http://persian2english.com/?p=16713">reported</a> that those who have witnessed torture in Kahrizak prison in Iran have been killed.</p>

<p>An Iranian physician, Ahmadreza Jalali, has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/iranian-scholar-sentenced-to-death-1.22875">sentenced to death</a> in Iran because of allegations of spying for other countries. Up to now none of international protests and activities for his unconditional release have proven to lead to any significant positive development.</p>
<p>All over the world health professionals put themselves in danger by being involved in activities to maintain human rights through organizations such as Physician for Human Rights, Physicians without Borders, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Survivors. Without involvement of these organizations many areas of the world crisis regions would have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5950640/">no access to medical care</a>.</p>
<p>The basic background of these activities are international standards and treaties along with ethical guidelines of the medical profession. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights already mentions <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166259">health as part of the right to an adequate standard of living</a> (art. 25). The right to health was again recognized as a human right in the 1966 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559680">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. There are international instances of shortage of access to medical services, because of military conflicts or secondary to sanctions against a country.</p>
<h3><strong>New challenges to ethics</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, the practice of medicine has been subject to several transformations with unprecedented ethical challenges. One is the exponential increase in the sophistication and reach of medical technology. From genetic manipulation to in-vitro fertilization, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727252/">data</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106632">confidentiality protection</a> to the ethical risks enclosed at times in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25951678">enormous advances</a> in life-saving research and treatment, medicine has given rise to moral challenges of huge social significance that medicine itself, and the Hippocratic tradition, have on their own not sufficiently responded to. Instead medicine has formed a fertile relationship with other disciplines, such as moral philosophy and medical law, to seek philosophically coherent and socially and legally <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23093515">acceptable responses to these questions</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the most serious threats to medical impartiality have come largely from interference by governmental agencies, but also by excessively powerful commercial companies or political groups, a critical aspect of medical impartiality is the doctors’ ability to <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-24">speak out about health-related aspects of conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>Where, for example, doctors are seeing patients who have sustained injuries as a result of state responses to civil unrest, the documentation and reporting of those injuries is a core part of the medical response. If doctors cannot speak out, if they cannot draw attention to the health-related impacts of conflicts, they risk the loss of their professional independence.</p>
<p>If they voluntarily violate fundamental standards, they should not be permitted to practice and medical associations and governments should take care to take all necessary steps to ensure this principle, while on the other hand <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3517401">supporting human rights defenders</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, also a physician, was against any restriction of personal or political freedom and emphasizes in the following poem in a way that could be extrapolated to the duties of physicians that we should focus our work on the needs of our patients:</p>
<p>Live with your century;</p>
<p>but do not be its creature.</p>
<p>Work for your contemporaries;</p>
<p>but create what they need,</p>
<p>not what they praise</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, some psychologists have understood that their field has an issue with WEIRDness. That is, psychology experiments disproportionately involve participants who are Western, Educated, and hail from Industrialised, Rich Democracies, which means many findings may not generalise to other populations, such as, say, rural Samoan villagers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/45/11401">new paper</a> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PNAS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a team of researchers led by Mostafa Salari Rad decided to zoom in on a leading psychology journal to better understand the field’s WEIRD problem, evaluate whether things are improving, and come up with some possible changes in practice that could help spur things along.</span><span id="more-35572"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their paper, nicely titled, </span><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/45/11401"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toward a psychology of Homo sapiens: Making psychological science more representative of the human population,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rad and his colleagues pulled two samples of articles published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychological Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: all articles published in 2014, and the last three issues from 2017. Unfortunately for the field of psychology, they found little evidence to suggest that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychological Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published by the US-based Association for Psychological Science, has addressed the WEIRD problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the participant groups in the subset of the 2014 articles in which authors included demographic information, “57.76% were drawn from the US, 71.25% were drawn from English-speaking countries (including the US and UK), and 94.15% … sampled Western countries (including English-speaking countries, Europe, and Israel).” The 2017 numbers weren’t much better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there’s clearly a problem. But, Rad’s team added, “[p]erhaps the most disturbing aspect of our analysis was the lack of information given about WEIRDness of samples, and the lack of consideration given to issues of cultural diversity in bounding the conclusions”. That is, the articles they examined all too often omitted information that could help other researchers note WEIRDness when it occurs, and all too often explicitly over-extrapolated findings drawn from WEIRD samples. Summing up these problems in the 2014 sample, Rad and his colleagues said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 72% of abstracts contained no information about the population sampled, 83% of studies did not report analysis of any effects of the diversity of their sample (e.g., gender effects), over 85% of studies neglected to discuss the possible effects of culture and context on their findings, and 84% failed to simply recommend studying the phenomena concerned in other cultures, implying that the results indicated something generalizable to humans outside specific cultural contexts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors don’t just grumble about the problem – they offer some concrete potential fixes based on their findings:</span></p>
<p><b>“Required Reporting of Sample Characteristics”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — It’s already the norm to report the gender breakdowns of experimental samples; Rad and his colleagues think that authors should be “required to report [other characteristics including] age, SES, ethnicity, religion, and nationality,” when it is practical and realistic to do so.</span></p>
<p><b>“Explicitly Tie Findings to Populations” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Less “We discovered X about people”, and more “We discovered X about a small group of undergraduates with the following demographic characteristics in New Haven, Connecticut.” </span></p>
<p><b>“Justify the Sampled Population” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Authors should have to explain why they chose the population they chose – and sometimes, as Rad et al note, yes, the answer will be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">convenience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s fine, within reason: The problem isn’t that college students are studied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s that they’re studied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">far too often</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>“Discuss generalisability of the Finding” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Similar to the point about populations above, the idea is simply that authors should explicitly discuss whether they expect a given finding will generalise beyond the experimented-upon population, and why.</span></p>
<p><b>“Analytical Investigation of Existing Diversity” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Even WEIRD samples often have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> degree of diversity to them along certain dimensions, so here Rad and his colleagues are suggesting that authors check for the presence of diversity-related moderators, both gender (which is already reported, usually) and other characteristics like race (which often aren’t). In other words, even if your experimental sample is mostly WEIRD, it could be informative to check whether, for example, the small handful of black participants produced different data than the rest of the group.</span></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for editors and reviewers</b></p>
<p><b>“Non-WEIRD = Novel and Important”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – “Journal editors should instruct reviewers to treat non-WEIRDness as a marker of the interest and importance of a paper.”</span></p>
<p><b>“Diversity Badges” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Some journals already award “badges” when authors pre-register or engage in other open-science best-practices. Badges for research centered on under-studied populations could be a nice little incentive-nudge.</span></p>
<p><b>“Diversity Targets” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– It would be reasonable, argue the authors, to have at least 50 per cent of published papers analyse non-WEIRD populations. Ideally, it would be higher, but as the numbers above show the situation at the moment is pretty dire, 50 per cent would be a major improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above suggestions provide a solid jumping-off-point for solving the WEIRD problem: Any one of them could be debated, discussed, and potentially modified or implemented. The next step, then, will be to see whether journals – the most important deciders when it comes scientific standard – will take up the mantle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the risk of getting overly meta-psychological – discussing the psychological science of how psychological science is conducted – a great deal of human behaviour can be boiled down to the path of least resistance and to incentives. Often it’s not a deep-seated bias or a lack of concern about other groups that causes researchers to overlook non-WEIRD samples (though I’m sure both are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> factors), but rather it’s because college students are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right there</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As in, literally in the same buildings as the ones where most psych researchers work. You can just put up some flyers, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">boom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have a group you can experiment on! It’s all too tempting. And it’ll take some incentive-shifting – shifts to editors’ behaviour, or the possibility of earning badges, or whatever else – to get researchers out of their WEIRD rut.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9783">The Psychology of Memory and the 2016 Election</a></h4>

An intriguing new study uses the 2016 US Presidential election as a tool to examine the organization of human memory.

The results show that events that occur around the same time are linked in memory. Remembering one past event tends to trigger the recall of other memories from that time. This chronological clustering makes intuitive sense, but it's a theory that's been debated in psychology for a while, under the name of the temporal-contiguity effect (TCE).

<p>It is better to ask a student to see if they can explain something to themselves, than for a teacher or book to always explain it to them. That’s according to a new meta-analysis of the findings from 64 prior studies involving nearly 6000 participants that compared learning outcomes from prompted self-explanation compared to instructor explanation, or compared to time spent using other study techniques such as taking notes, summarising, thinking out loud (without the reflection and elaboration involved in self-explanation), or solving more problems.</p>
<p>The authors of the meta-analysis, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-018-9434-x">published recently in </a><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-018-9434-x"><em>Educational Psychology Review</em></a>, say that self-explanation is a powerful learning strategy because learners “generate inferences about causal connections and conceptual relationships that enhance understanding”. The process of self-explanation also helps the learner realise what they don’t know, “to fill in missing information, monitor understanding, and modify fusions of new information with prior knowledge when discrepancies or deficiencies are detected”.</p>
<p><span id="more-35529"></span></p>
<p>Past research already established that more effective learners are more inclined to self-explain spontaneously. The meta-analysis confirms that, importantly, prompted self-explanation is also beneficial. Overall, Kiran Bisra and her team at Simon Fraser University found that when students are prompted to self-explain (usually this is in written form, though a few studies involved spoken self-explanation) this improves their learning outcomes with an average effect size of 0.55 (using Hedge’s g), which in a learning context is impressive – “a potentially powerful” intervention in the authors’ words, similar in effectiveness to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a>” and “peer tutoring”.</p>
<p>Self-explanation was more effective than instructor explanation (explanation given by a teacher or teaching materials), but instructor explanation was better than no explanation, which suggests that part of the benefit of self-explanation comes from the content (which could be provided elsewhere) while a second aspect comes from the unique process of generating an explanation oneself (prompting the student to recognise links between the knowledge or skills they’ve learned, and allowing them to identity and address gaps in their understanding).</p>
<p>The researchers checked and the benefits of self-explanation are not due to the technique simply leading to more time being spent in study, though the researchers said more investigations do need to do a better job of controlling for this confound.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked to see if any particular aspects of the practice of self-explanation make a difference to its effectiveness. They found some limited evidence that a multiple-choice format (in which the student chooses a range of explanations from a list) to be the least effective, perhaps because it lacks the self-generated elaboration that is usually involved in more open-ended self-explanation.</p>
<p>On this last point, the researchers suggested that the ideal degree of guidance and prompting (such as whether learners are cued to self-explain specific concepts or left to choose) may depend on their proficiency: as students develop their knowledge and skill, the more freedom to choose what and how they self-explain, the better.</p>
<p>Regarding other factors – such as, the timing of the self-explanation in the learning process; the kind of self-explanation that was elicited (such as justifying an argument or explaining a concept); the nature of the to-be-learned material; the subject matter; and how knowledge was subsequently tested – the researchers found little evidence that any of this made much difference to the benefit of self-explanation. One exception was that it was generally less effective when students were asked to self-explain their own state of knowledge and understanding (a form of so-called “meta-cognitive explanation”), which is logical because this would not involve the student elaborating on and forming connections among the to-be-learned material.</p>
<p>Bisra and her colleagues said that a “major implication” of their findings was that “…beneficial effects of inducing self-explanation seem to be available for most subject areas studied in school, and for both conceptual (declarative) and procedural knowledge.”</p>
<p>The results of this meta-analysis provide an encouraging and straightforward take-away for learners and teachers alike. Just one gripe: I would have liked to see more detailed discussion of the exact kinds of other study technique that self-explanation was compared against, to better identify any unique “ingredients” that make self-explanation apparently so effective. In fairness, Bisra and her colleagues recognise this knowledge gap, concluding: “There is now a need for clearer mapping of the unique cognitive benefits self-explanation may promote, the specific effects of different types of self-explanations and prompts, and how self-explanation might be optimally combined and sequenced with other instructional features such as extended practice, explanation modeling, and inquiry-based learning.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1TrU_KhUgDU/">PLOS Authors Say “Yes” to Preprints</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve surpassed 1,300 preprint posts to bioRxiv!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an incredible milestone for us and for all of our authors who chose to opt-in to our preprint service since we </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/power-to-the-preprint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">our partnership with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s bioRxiv six months ago. We wanted to bring an easy preprint-posting option directly to the submission process for our authors and are thoroughly excited with the results we’ve seen so far. </span></p>
<h3>The road to preprints</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we began this journey, about 4% of our authors reported that they had posted their submission to a preprint server. While this base remains consistent, our preprint-posting service has built upon it to offer authors more choices. In the past six months we’ve seen an additional 14% opt-in to have PLOS post a preprint on their behalf, indicating that 18% of our authors want to use preprints to share their research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the opt-in rate varies by discipline. On </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Computational Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">46% of our authors choose to make a preprint of their manuscript available, with half of those posting before submission and the other half requesting PLOS post to bioRxiv on their behalf. In biology in general, the adoption is high. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which joined the service later, is already showing a promising trend towards preprints by 39% of our authors (23% of which elect to have PLOS post on their behalf). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every opt-in we get is screened by editorial staff before posting to ensure the article fits bioRxiv’s scope and that no sensitive information is accidentally shared. We have also taken a conservative approach and avoided posting research that could have an impact on human health before the claims have been peer reviewed, which is why we do not yet offer to post preprints for <em>PLOS Medicine</em> authors. We’re working in partnership with bioRxiv to refine the posting criteria as we learn more about the needs for early sharing in different communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the openness to new research outputs we’ve seen among our community of authors is inspiring and we hope to see preprint adoption grow even more over the coming year.  </span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Author choice</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like preprints because they put </span><b>your</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research first. We’re making it easier for you to choose preprints as a way to rapidly disseminate your research results, establish priority, accumulate citations for your work, and receive input from your community that may help shape the future of your research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, preprints aren’t for everyone or for every paper which is why authors choose when and how their work becomes available. We’re also listening to our community’s feedback to make our service as inclusive as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our authors still prefer to wait for peer review before making their results public. However, about a fifth of the authors who responded to a survey about why they had opted out said they are unfamiliar with preprints. We’re hoping to change that by offering everything you need to know at </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plos.org/preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More information about preprints is available on </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along with their posting guidelines. ASAPbio also offers very useful guidance for preprints, including </span><a href="http://asapbio.org/journal-policies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at other journals which may help clarify any concerns you have about submitting a manuscript after you’ve posted a preprint. </span></p>
<h3>Where we go from here</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll continue learning from our community and sharing more information that helps you make the right decision for your paper. We’re also encouraging other preprint options to authors in areas that don’t fall under bioRxiv’s scope. Both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Genetics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have dedicated Preprint Editors to solicit submissions from various preprint servers and we’re looking at more opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking of posting a preprint for the first time, take advantage of this </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprint-checklist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checklist </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to get started and review all the </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preprints could have for your work.</span></p>

<p>While there’s still a debate about whether we <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21507740.2018.1425756">have free will or not</a>, most researchers at least agree that we feel as if we do. That perception is often considered to have two elements: a sense of having decided to act – called “volition”; and feeling that that decision was our own – having “agency”.</p>
<p>Now in a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/42/10792">paper</a> in <i>PNAS, </i>Ryan Darby at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and colleagues have used a new technique – lesion network mapping – to identify for the first time the brain networks that underlie our feelings of volition and for agency. “Together, these networks may underlie our perception of free will, with implications for neuropsychiatric diseases in which these processes are impaired,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35526"></span></p>
<p>Darby and his colleagues first mapped the locations of lesions (brain damage) in 28 people with impaired volition (including people with akinetic mutism, for example, who seem to have lost the motivation to move or speak) and in 50 people with an impaired sense of agency (such as people with so-called “alien-hand syndrome” who feel that they are not in control of their own limb movements).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Then they looked at which other regions in the brain these various damaged locations typically communicate with (for this they referred to a connectivity map based on scans of 1000 healthy people), to investigate whether or not they all form part of the same network.</p>
<p>For the patients with disordered volition, while their lesions were in different locations in the brain, all 28 were part of a single brain network that connected to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a part of the brain already understood by neuroscientists to be involved in the motivation, planning and control of voluntary movements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the people whose brain lesions were causing disordered agency, again, “while the lesions themselves were spatially diverse, mapping showed that… 90 per cent fell within a single brain network defined by functional connectivity to the precuneus cortex,” the researchers write. The precuneus has previously been shown to play a role in having a sense of agency.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also looked at lesion connectivity in people with partial paralysis but who retained a sense of volition, and people who made involuntary movements but who continued to feel that they were responsible for these movements (so who had a sense of agency). And they considered the results of studies that have found free will perception can be altered by either electrical or magnetic brain stimulation to particular regions. The results of both types of study supported their identification of the ACC-connected network and the precuneus-connected network as being related to volition and to agency, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers looked at brain imaging studies of people with psychiatric disorders that have been conceptualised – at least by some researchers – as disorders of free will (affecting volition, agency or both). This includes patients with catatonia, who don’t move or respond though they look to be awake, and cases of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), which resemble epileptic seizures, but which do not involve the characteristic electrical discharges in the brain. Though these patients did not have specific brain lesions, the researchers looked for any brain regions where there was reduced function and in 85 per cent of cases these were part of the volition and/or agency networks.</p>
<p>So, perhaps damage to a node on the agency or volition network affects the functioning of the precuneus or the ACC, the researchers write – or perhaps volition and agency depend on all nodes in their networks working well. Either, or both, could be the case, and could help guide future investigations, diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are some important caveats in relation to this research, however. One of the biggest questions has to be around the interpretation of some of the neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, it’s unclear exactly what’s going wrong in people with akinetic mutism and catatonia. Have they really lost the will to move or speak – their “volition”, as the researchers interpreted it – or is it rather the case that they experience problems with initiating a movement that they actually want to make? In which case, perhaps what the researchers have identified as a “volition network” is actually more about movement execution than volition (this would be consistent with prior research that’s found the ACC – which remember is a key part of the purported “volition network” – is involved in the planning and control of movements as well as the motivation to make them).</p>
<p>Also, as the researchers note, even if they have identified a volition network, it may not relate to free will as it’s commonly understood – in terms of social, legal and moral responsibility for decisions. “It remains unknown whether the network of brain regions we identify as related to free will for movements is the same as that important for moral decision making, as prior studies have suggested important differences.”</p>
<p>Scholarly debate about free will has been raging for at least a few thousand years. It’s certainly not over yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Too many scientists defend the practice of not probing for loading controls for each protein gel. They say a "library" method perfectly suffices, when one separate loading control gel is run once for reference. Such sloppiness can sometimes be a hint of even worse practices taking place.

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been a long and bumpy road for the implicit association test (IAT), the reaction-time-based psychological instrument whose co-creators, Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald — among others in their orbit — claimed measures test-takers’ levels of unconscious social biases</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their propensity to act in a biased and discriminatory manner, be that via racism, sexism, ageism, or some other category, depending on the context. The test’s advocates claimed this was a revelatory development, not least because the IAT supposedly measures aspects of an individual’s bias even beyond what that individual was consciously aware of themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I explained in a</span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lengthy feature published on New York Magazine’s website last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many doubts have emerged about these claims, ranging from the question of what the IAT is really measuring (as in, can a reaction-time difference measured in milliseconds really be considered, on its face, evidence of real-world-relevant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bias</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?) to the algorithms used to generate scores to, perhaps most importantly (given that the IAT has become a mainstay of a wide variety of diversity training and educational programmes), whether the test really does predict real-world behaviour.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that last key point, there is surprising agreement. In 2015 </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25402677"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwald, Banaji, and their coauthor Brian Nosek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that the psychometric issues associated with various IATs “render them problematic to use to classify persons as likely to engage in discrimination”. Indeed, these days IAT evangelist and critic alike mostly agree that the test is too noisy to usefully and accurately gauge people’s likelihood of engaging in discrimination — a finding supported by a series of meta-analyses showing unimpressive correlations between IAT scores and behavioral outcomes (mostly in labs). Race IAT scores appear to account for only about 1 per cent of the variance in measured behavioural outcomes, </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308926636_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Change_in_Implicit_Bias"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports an important meta-analysis available in preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-authored by Nosek. (That meta-analysis also looked at IAT-based interventions, finding that while implicit bias as measured by the IAT “is malleable… changing implicit bias does not necessarily lead to changes in explicit bias or behavior.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So where does this leave the IAT? In a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721418797309"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new paper in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Directions in Psychological Science</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">called “The IAT Is Dead, Long Live The Iat: Context-Sensitive Measures of Implicit Attitudes Are Indispensable to Social and Political Psychology”, John Jost, a social psychologist at New York University and a leading IAT researcher, seeks to draw a clear line between the “dead” diagnostic-version of the IAT, and what he sees as the test’s real-world version – a sensitive, context-specific measure that shouldn’t be used for diagnostic purposes, but which has potential in various research and educational contexts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this represent a constructive manifesto for the future of this controversial psychological tool? Unfortunately, I don’t think it does – rather, it contains many confusions, false claims, and strawman arguments (as well as a misrepresentation of my own work). Perhaps most frustrating, Jost joins a lengthening line of IAT researchers who, when faced with the fact that the IAT appears to have been overhyped for a long time by its creators, most enthusiastic proponents, and by journalists, responds with an endless variety of counterclaims that don’t quite address the core issue itself, or which pretend those initial claims were never made in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35513"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take this section, in which, referencing a number of papers, Jost writes that, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often claimed that the IAT simply measures familiarity with or awareness of cultural stereotypes rather than personal animus… [T]he question of whether implicit attitudes reflect personal preferences as opposed to social and cultural processes is ill-posed. (We also know from decades of research on the “mere-exposure effect” that familiarity breeds liking, so there is no reason to assume that familiarity and attitudinal evaluation should be unrelated.)</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is such a confusing paragraph that it’s hard to know where to start. Jost seems to be arguing that the “mere exposure effect”, the general principle that people like familiar things and people more than unfamiliar things and people, should be applied to the critique that the IAT might be measuring familiarity with stereotypes rather than endorsement of them. By his (apparent) logic, because of the mere exposure effect, people who are more familiar with stereotypes are more likely to endorse them, so it doesn’t matter if the IAT is really “just” measuring familiarity – idea-familiarity and idea-endorsement are inextricably bound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, if social psychologists really believed this, they would seek to halt educational programmes that teach children about ugly racial stereotypes out of a fear that the children will, on average, become more racist as a result of this exposure. Luckily, in the real world, the evidence suggests this is a rather radical overstretching of the idea of the mere exposure effect. To take one of countless examples, in the US, Democrats are exceedingly aware of the fact that some Republicans view Mexican migrants as disproportionately criminal – that does not make them more likely to endorse that belief themselves. Mere exposure is powerful in some contexts, but not this one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the question of whether the IAT measures something that can be fairly called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">animus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the sense of being a preference (in this case, an unconscious one) for one group over another, rather than familiarity with stereotypes, is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anything but</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “ill-posed”. For a long time, people have been told that their test score reflects the former – that they have “implicit bias”. Outside of Jost’s confusing paragraph, no one anywhere would suggest that the definition of “implicit bias” is the same as the definition of “awareness of certain stereotypes.” If the test is claiming to measure one thing when it is really measuring the other, or a mix of the two (I’ve always thought it’s more likely the test is measuring a complicated mix of stuff than that it’s measuring A or B or C, full-stop), of course that’s an important issue to resolve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jost’s paper also includes at least one rather misleading claim. In the third paragraph of his article, he writes that “In an especially absurd comparison, the IAT was likened to measuring height with a stack of melting ice cubes.” The citation points to my NY Mag article. In fact, Jost mentions height measurement three times in the paper and in the abstract, he critiques “false analogies between the IAT and measures… [like] physical height”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I never “likened” the IAT to any measure of height! Rather, in a section of my article explaining to my lay readers the term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">test-retest reliability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I used ice cubes as an example to illustrate the concept: “A tape measure has high test-retest reliability because if you measure someone’s height, wait two weeks, and measure it again, you’ll get very similar results,” I wrote. “The measurement procedure of grabbing an ice cube from your freezer and seeing how many ice cubes tall your friend is would have much lower test-retest reliability, because different ice cubes might be of different sizes; it’s easier to make errors when counting how many ice cubes tall your friend is; and so forth.” It’s true that later in the article I note that the available evidence suggests the race IAT has low test-retest reliability, but that’s of course not the same as directly comparing — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">likening</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — the IAT to a measure of height.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned, though, the biggest worry with this new review paper is that Jost is rewriting history a bit. Nowhere is this clearer than when he argues that “As a ‘bona fide’ pipeline used to quantify levels of ‘unconscious racism’ as a fixed property of the individual—or as a diagnostic tool to classify people as ‘having’ racism or sexism (like they might ‘have’ clinical depression)—the IAT is dead. I do not know if any researchers of implicit bias actually conceived of the IAT in these ways, but critics continue to assert that this is our conception (Bartlett, 2017; Mitchell &amp; Tetlock, 2017; Singal, 2017). It certainly is not mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">course</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evangelists of the IAT have been treating it as a diagnostic tool. Here’s Banaji and Greenwald in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T]he automatic White preference expressed on the Race IAT is now established as signaling discriminatory behavior. It predicts discriminatory behavior even among research participants who earnestly (and, we believe, honestly) espouse egalitarian beliefs. That last statement may sound like a self-contradiction, but it’s an empirical truth. Among research participants who describe themselves as racially egalitarian, the Race IAT has been shown, reliably and repeatedly, to predict discriminatory behavior that was observed in the research.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s Greenwald, in an email, </span><a href="https://qz.com/1144504/the-world-is-relying-on-a-flawed-psychological-test-to-fight-racism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Quartz’s Olivia Goldhill last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “The IAT can be used to select people who would be less likely than others to engage in discriminatory behavior.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, to be clear there have been mixed messages on this front. The quote to Quartz was a serious flip-flop, as I </span><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/iat-behavior-problem.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when stood up against the 2015 paper in which Greenwald and Banaji acknowledged the test’s weaknesses. But either way, it’s almost impossible to square Jost’s claim that he isn’t aware of anyone who has claimed the IAT measures “‘unconscious racism’ as a fixed property of the individual[…] or as a diagnostic tool to classify people as ‘having’ racism or sexism” with the fact that two of his coauthors have claimed that the IAT can predict individuals’ likelihood of engaging in discriminatory behavior.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being charitable, I suppose there’s wiggle room with the word “fixed”.  But in the initial hyping of the IAT, its evangelists definitely promoted the idea that what it was measuring was, if not “fixed,” at the very least </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – you will not find much circa-2005 coverage of the IAT in which the test’s proponents highlight IAT results as fluid and easily manipulated. In fact, in the [1998] </span><a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/1998/09/29/roots-of-unconscious-prejudice-affect-90-to-95-percent-of-people-psychologists-demonstrate-at-press-conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Washington press release covering the IAT’s unveiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the author notes that while “Banaji and Greenwald admitted being surprised and troubled by their own test results, they believe the test ultimately can have a positive effect despite its initial negative impact. The same test that reveals these roots of prejudice has the potential to let people learn more about and perhaps overcome these disturbing inclinations.” Why would this be an issue if the test </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being promoted as measuring something stable that an individual could only “perhaps overcome”?  In 2005, Banaji went further, telling the Washington </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she was ‘deeply embarrassed’ at her test result – but why would she be unless she considered the IAT was measuring something stable about herself? There’s a whole subgenre of anecdotes in which individuals reveal their discomfort at their IAT results. That doesn’t jibe with the idea that it has historically been viewed as a noisy, extremely context-dependent measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goalposts are ever-shifting. Or maybe the better term is </span><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motte and bailey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fallacy of advancing an argument you can’t justify with evidence, and then, when called on to do so, retreating to a much less controversial position. Bailey: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IAT predicts individuals’ levels of unconscious bias (or racism, if you will), and therefore their future behavior.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then, after the convincing methodological critiques and underwhelming meta-analyses roll in, motte: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We never said the IAT predicts individuals’ levels of unconscious bias/racism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — rather, as Jost puts it, “[I]f the IAT measures a particular attitude at a given time in a specific social context, there is nothing inherently problematic (or unethical) about providing people with feedback concerning that attitude measurement, recognising that it is, after all, only one measurement at one point in time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting aside that this clearly wasn’t how the test was presented to the millions of people who have taken it on the Harvard Implicit website and in diversity trainings and in other settings,, it’s a confusing claim: What is the “social context” of taking an IAT? It’s hard, in fact, to come up with a more </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">contextualized social-psychological experimental experience. You’re sitting at a computer, pecking at keys, not engaging in any interaction with another human being. Now, often IAT results </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> correlated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how people behave in certain (mostly quite canned) social contexts, but the vast bulk of the IAT research does </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measure people’s “attitude at a given time in a given social context.” Or that hasn’t been the claim, at least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is this: You can’t have it both ways. You can’t portray a test as revolutionary, </span><a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/mahzarin_banaji-anthony_greenwald-the-implicit-association-test"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mention it in the same breath as the discovery of the telescope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggest it offers new racial insights on the order of Michelle Alexander’s or Ta-Nehisi Coates’ (as claimed in an email from one of Banaji’s students that she forwarded to the Quartz reporter Goldhill), and claim it does this and that and the other thing – and then pretend you never said those things.

<p>In this seminar, I introduce the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a> initiative to the group. I
explain our goals, our philosophy, our methods, our current state and, solicit
feedback on our work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The (current) goal of the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora SIG</a> is to provide a ready to use
platform for neuroscientists.  We aim to do this by making commonly used
Neuroscience software easily installable on a <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> Linux system.</p>
<p>Neuroscience is an extremely multidisciplinary field. It brings together
mathematicians, chemists, biologists, physicists, psychologists, engineers
(electrical and others), computer scientists, and more. A lot of software is
used nowadays in Neuroscience for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>data collection, analysis, and sharing.</li>
<li>image processing (a lot of ML is used here, think Data Science).</li>
<li>simulation of brain networks (<a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.org">Nest</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose">Moose</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN">PyNN</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://briansimulator.org/">Brian</a>).</li>
<li>dissemination of scientific results (peer reviewed and otherwise, think
<a class="reference external" href="http://tug.org/">LaTeX</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that a large proportion of neuroscientists are not trained in computer
science, a lot of resources are spent setting up systems, installing software
(often building whole <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency chains</a> from source). This can be
especially hard for people not well-versed in software development and related
fields.</p>
<p>So, at <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a>, we aim to enable Neuroscience research by providing a
ready to use <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> based system for researchers to work with. <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a> is
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">Free software</a> and is
therefore free to all to use, modify, study, and share.</p>

<p>It’s well-known that physical exercise is beneficial not just to physical health but also our mental health. Yet whereas most countries have detailed, evidence-backed guidelines on the type and intensity of exercise required for various physical health benefits, such guidelines do not yet exist for exercise and mood. This is partly due to a lack of necessary evidence. However, a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223980.2018.1470487">new systematic review</a> in <em>The Journal of Psychology Interdisciplinary and Applied </em>brings us usefully up-to-date on the current findings in this area, collating evidence from 38 relevant studies that examined the associations between exercise intensity, duration and modality and any effects on mood.</p>
<p><span id="more-35492"></span></p>
<p>Before dipping into some of the key take-aways, an important distinction made in the review is between aerobic exercise and anaerobic. The former involves such things as walking, jogging and cycling and means exercising in such a way that your body is able to use oxygen to burn fat for energy. In contrast, anaerobic exercise – such as lifting heavy weights or sprinting – is of such vigorous intensity that your body does not have time to use oxygen to create energy and so instead it breaks down glucose in your blood or muscles.</p>
<p>Beginning first with the influence of exercise intensity on the mood benefits of aerobic exercise, the researchers, led by John Chan at Shenzhen University, found contradictory results from 19 relevant studies. Some favoured higher intensity, others low, while seven studies found that intensity made no difference to mood benefits.</p>
<p>In relation to the intensity of anaerobic exercise, however, the results were far clearer – the optimum for improving mood is moderate intensity, perhaps because low intensity is too dull while high intensity is too unpleasant.</p>
<p>Next, Chan’s team considered exercise duration. The main finding here was that 10 minutes often appears sufficient to achieve gains in mood (although one study found that 30 minutes was required to achieve feelings of increased vigour). Overall, there was little evidence that going beyond 30 minutes leads to any further gains in mood, which is good to know for anyone who struggles to find much time for exercise in their daily schedule.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers considered studies that have compared the mood benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise (they noted that mindfulness-based physical exercise, such as Yoga and Thai-Chi, have also shown promise for boosting mood, but that there is too little evidence to draw any firm conclusions). The picture here was that the beneficial mood effects of aerobic exercise are less consistent than is found with anaerobic exercise, and anaerobic exercise appears especially to be more beneficial for beating stress and anxiety (the researchers suggested this may be because with many forms of anaerobic exercise, such as weight training, it is easier to see your progress, leading to more immediate, rewarding feelings of mastery; also anaerobic exercise is associated with increases in BDNF – brain-derived neurotrophic factor – which may help foster beneficial structural and functional changes in the brain).</p>
<p>These headline results from several decades of research come with some hefty caveats. The studies were mostly lab based, used different ways of measuring intensity, and they recruited extremely varied volunteers. You can easily imagine how study findings could differ a lot depending on people’s past experience with exercise, their age and health, and even their personality and interests.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to extrapolate from the findings to our own lives. However, when reflecting on the optimum type of exercise for your own mood, the common sense message is probably to take into consideration your own fitness level and preferences, to find that sweet spot, such that the exercise is enough of a challenge without being unpleasant.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson from this review, though, is that we clearly need much more research into how different types and intensities of exercise affect our mood in real life, and how this varies according to our own characteristics. The sophistication and ubiquity of modern fitness trackers should open up exciting new opportunities for psychology research that can address these questions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/12/03/sequence-analysis-an-old-new-section-in-bmc-bioinformatics/">Sequence analysis – an old/new section in BMC Bioinformatics</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/puzzle-2500333_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Up to now, <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em> has had one sequence analysis section for methods and another for applications. While the original rationale for having two separate sections made sense at the time the journal was created, in practice we have observed considerable topic overlap between papers that have been published in these two sections. Moreover, from the point of view of evaluating a manuscript’s contribution, we came to the conclusion that the distinction between methods and applications was not really necessary.  The decision has therefore been made to merge these sections into one new section simply called <strong>Sequence Analysis</strong>.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-10700 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/dna-2789567_1280-283x300.png" width="189" />
<p>Sequence analysis continues to be a vibrant field of research, fueled by the sustained exponential growth in DNA sequence generation. As examples we can cite some current large DNA sequencing-related projects and initiatives. Last year <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24621" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thompson et al.</a>  reported first results of the Earth Microbiome project, which is sequencing microbiomes in a diverse range of ecological niches. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06244" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Human Microbiome Project</a>  on the other hand has been ongoing now for several years. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4325" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lewin et al.</a> announced the Earth BioGenome Project earlier this year, which aims to sequence, catalog, and characterize the genomes of all of Earth’s eukaryotic biodiversity within 10 years. And on October 3<sup>rd</sup> this year, the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care announced its plans to <a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/matt-hancock-announces-5-million-genomes-within-five-years/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sequence five million human genomes in the UK</a> over the next five years. These projects and initiatives highlight the continuing relevance of DNA sequencing in medicine as well as in understanding the Earth’s biodiversity, to name just two potential  areas of application.</p>
<p>In view of the consequent data deluge, the need to extract scientific as well as practical knowledge from this data is greater than ever. Further research into sequence analysis and novel associated programs and methods is consequently all the more important.</p>
<blockquote><p>The UK Department of Health and Social Care has announced its plans to sequence five million human genomes in the UK over the next five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>The scope of the new <strong>Sequence Analysis</strong> section reflects this merge: we look for high-quality manuscripts that present novel algorithms or software/workflows for topics such as sequence alignment, DNA fragment assembly, gene prediction, noncoding RNA detection and analysis, whole genome analysis, phylogeny and phylogenomics, taxonomy classification and genome recovery from metagenome data, among many other possible topics.</p>
<p><em>BMC Bioinformatics</em> has other sections that have related scope, in particular <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/comparative-genomics" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Comparative Genomics</strong></a>, <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/transcriptome-analysis" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Transcriptome Analysis</strong></a>, and the recently launched<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/machinelearningcomp" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> <strong>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Bioinformatics</strong></a>. Prospective authors of manuscripts that use DNA/RNA sequences or genomes as primary data may submit their work to the Sequence Analysis section, or to whichever section they consider most relevant for their work.</p>

<p>Curiosity is a welcome trait in many respects and is the fuel that powers science. Yet literature is filled with fables that warn of the seductive danger of curiosity (think of how Orpheus loses his wife Eurydice forever after he succumbs to the temptation to glimpse at the underworld). In real life too, we all know the regret that can follow if we give in to curiosity – glancing at a private message that we shouldn’t have, for instance; reading a TV review when we know it contains spoilers; or trying out what happens if you put metal in a microwave (tip: don’t).</p>
<p>From whence does curiosity derive such power over us? One answer lies in the brain. In a pair of brain-imaging studies <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/22/473975">published as a preprint at <em>bioRxiv</em></a> – aptly titled <em>Hunger For Knowledge: How The Irresistible Lure of Curiosity Is Generated In the Brain</em> – Johnny King Lau and his colleagues have shown that curiosity appears to be driven by the same neurobiological process as physical hunger.</p>
<p><span id="more-35453"></span></p>
<p>The researchers laid the groundwork for their brain-scan research with a small behavioural experiment in which hungry volunteers were shown either magic tricks or pictures of tempting food, and then presented with a lottery wheel. This wheel provided a visual presentation of the odds of a gamble (which varied from trial to trial) – if they won, they would have an increased chance at the end of the experiment to learn how the trick was done or to eat the food; if they lost, it was more likely they would suffer a mild but unpleasant electric shock at the end of the experiment. Each trial the volunteers rated their curiosity about the trick or the desirability of the food, and then chose whether to take the gamble or not.</p>
<p>The main finding here was that curiosity and hunger both swayed the volunteers’ decision-making. Above and beyond the actual odds on any trial, the volunteers were more likely to take gambles when they were more curious about the magic or more tempted by the food, even at the risk of suffering an electric shock.</p>
<p>This led Lau and his colleagues to hypothesise that curiosity fuels a physiological wanting or craving, similar to hunger. To test this, they repeated the set-up with more volunteers and this time scanned their brains too. The results showed that, whether influenced by hunger or curiosity, when their participants opted to take the gamble, activity was greater in a key region of the brain known as the striatum, which is known to be associated with motivation and reward. Moreover, when driven to make the gamble, the participants showed a greater disconnect between the striatum and the sensorimotor cortex, indicative perhaps of a discounting of the physical risks of their decision (I would add a caveat: it is always difficult to interpret the functional meaning of brain activity, especially in exploratory work of this kind, so this interpretation should probably be considered tentative).</p>
<p>Similar findings emerged from a second brain-imaging study in which curiosity was provoked by obscure, intriguing trivia quiz questions rather than by magic (a typical question was “What is the only food that never spoils?”). In this case, if the participants opted to gamble, and won, then they increased their chance of finding out the answer later. Again, opting to gamble to satisfy curiosity, or hunger, was associated with greater activity in the striatum, and a greater disconnect between striatum and sensorimotor cortex.</p>
<p>Lau’s team said their findings show that “curiosity biases our decision-making by recruiting the same incentive motivation process as extrinsic rewards (e.g. foods).” If you’re curious to find out more, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/22/473975">the full paper</a>, which has not yet be finalised, is currently free to view online.</p>

<h2>Packaging MATLab tool boxes</h2>
<p>The use of MATLab tool boxes is quite common in data-analysis. There's a
noticeable movement in the scientific community towards using Python, but the
work that has already been done, and the eco-systems that have developed around
MATlab will take time to migrate to a Python based eco-system.</p>
<p>A majority of the tool boxes in use are Free/Open Source, but MATLab itself is
not. As supporters of Free/Open source, we will not attempt to include MATLab
in Fedora, but the question remains on whether we provide the toolboxes.  We've
begun discussing this in the SIG, and we'll reach out to the broader Fedora
community before we decide on how to proceed.</p>
<div class="section" id="personal-views">
<h3>Personal views</h3>
<p>Personally, I'd prefer if we only provided software that support Free/Open
source eco systems. The use of proprietary software in science, while currently
necessary, should be avoided.  Yes, it may make things a little harder to start
with, but the Free/Open source tools that will be used will be accessible by
all. Overtime, just like the Free software community, the eco system will
mature.</p>
<p>A example case is the use of Microsoft products that is common in developed
countries where universities can afford their licenses. In developing
countries, this is not the case. They cannot always afford these fees. A
solution, of course, is to use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> which is free for all to use, extend,
study, and share. Similarly, while universities and laboratories in developed
countries may be able to pay for MATlab licenses, this financial requirement
can hold back others---smaller labs and independent researchers.</p>
<p>If proprietary tools such as MATlab are the norm, then science is not open to
all. It should be.</p>

The science story of the past week was the claim from Chinese scientist He Jiankui that he has created gene-edited human babies. Prof. He reports that two twin girls have been born carrying modifications of the gene CCR5, which is intended to protect them against future HIV risk.

It's far from clear yet whether the gene-editing that He described has actually taken place - no data has yet been presented.  The very prospect of genetically-modifying human beings has, however, led to widespread c

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replicating a study isn’t easy. Just knowing how the original was conducted isn’t enough. Just having access to a sample of experimental participants isn’t enough. As psychological researchers have known for a long time, all sorts of subtle cues can affect how individuals respond in experimental settings. A failure to replicate, then, doesn’t always mean that the effect being studied isn’t there – it can simply mean the new study was conducted a bit differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs 2, a project of the Center for Open Science at the University of Virginia, embarked on one of the most ambitious replication efforts in psychology yet – and did so in a way designed to address these sorts of critiques, which have in some cases hampered past efforts. The resultant paper, a preprint of which can be viewed </span><a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ManyLabs2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is lead-authored by Richard A. Klein of the Université Grenoble Alpes. Klein and his very, very large team – it takes almost four pages of the preprint just to list all the contributors – “conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings with protocols that were peer-reviewed in advance to examine variation in effect magnitudes across sample and setting.”</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35469"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs included 79 samples of participants tested in-person and 46 samples tested online, and of these, 39 were from the U.S. and 86 came from a variety of other countries. Among the previously published findings the researchers tried to replicate were: one in which study participants who read about structure in nature said they were more likely to pursue their goals than those who read about randomness in nature (as if exposure to structure, even if unrelated, somehow motivates us); a famous example of a “framing effect” by the behavioural-economics pioneers Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman, in which respondents were more willing to drive further to get a discount on a cheap item than to get an equal-sized discount on an expensive item (which doesn’t make sense, “rationally” speaking, when the discounts are the same size); and another famous finding, this one from a team led by the leading social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, that showed that, among survey respondents, “Items that emphasised concerns of harm or fairness… were deemed more relevant for moral judgment by the political left than right.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 15 of the 28 attempted replications “worked,” in the sense of delivering the same finding in the same direction at a statistically significant level (p &lt; .05). When the threshold for significance was bumped up a couple orders of magnitude to p &lt; .0001 – a stricter standard some researchers have advocated as a countermeasure against </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionable research practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/09/made-it-an-uncanny-number-of-psychology-findings-manage-to-scrape-into-statistical-significance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">p-hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that number dropped to 14. So in total, only about half the studies replicated, and on average, the effect sizes were significantly smaller. This is not encouraging. (The study about nature-stories and goals failed to replicate, but the Tversky/Kahneman and Haidt ones did replicate, albeit with smaller effect sizes than in the originals.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs 2 was designed to address some of the problems, perceived and real, with previous replication efforts. After the Open Science Collaboration </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published the “Reproducibility Project”</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which was only able to successfully replicate about 40 percent of 100 then-recent papers in August 2015, for example, a team – including the famous social psychologist Dan Gilbert (a replication-crisis sceptic) and the leading quantitative social scientist Gary King – argued that there were statistical errors in that effort, and also that in some cases the replicators hadn’t followed the same procedures, or used the same sorts of samples, as the original experimenters. (The whole thing got rather tangled and included responses to responses to responses – you can read my writeup for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine </span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/is-psychologys-replication-crisis-really-overblown.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of whether replications are “close enough” to the original is especially important. When replications differ enough from the original studies, this introduces legitimate methodological concerns into the equation and gives those whose work fails to replicate an “out” – “You weren’t really replicating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study – you changed too much stuff.” But researchers in Many Labs 2 were more careful to follow the original studies quite closely. As a result, they argue, “variability in observed effect sizes was more attributable to the effect being studied than the sample or setting in which it was studied.” Specifically, “task order, administration in lab versus online, and exploratory WEIRD versus less WEIRD culture comparisons” – that is, whether the experiment participants were western, educated, and from industrialised rich democratic countries (a </span><a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/joe-henrich-weird-ultimatum-game-shaking-up-psychology-economics-53135"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major concern in psych research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where it’s often much easier to find WEIRD study participants than non-WEIRD ones) – all failed to account for much of the differences in effect strength observed in the studies. This partially undercuts the idea that these sorts of differences might have mattered or account for failures to replicate, and it also shows that psychology can be conducted in a robust way such that the findings – whether positive or negative – are not unduly influenced by the circumstances.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1064548916862099456"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Nosek, head of the Open Science Center and a coauthor on the paper, on Twitter, this time around researchers “minimised boring reasons for failure. First, using original materials &amp; </span><a href="http://cos.io/rr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered Reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all 28 replications met expert reviewed quality control standards. Failure to replicate not easily dismissed as replication incompetence.” He </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1064548910872580101"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the “Replication median sample size (n = 7157) was 64x original median sample size (n = 112). If there was an effect to detect, even a much smaller one, we would detect it. Ultimate estimates have very high precision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, a single failed replication – even a big, robust one – should not cause us to confidently rule </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an effect any more than a single positive result should cause us to believe it is definitely real. But this big, impressive effort advances the replication conversation in two important ways: It adds to the pile of evidence that there </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a replication crisis, and it offers a useful, replicable (sorry) set of guidelines for how to conduct rigorous replications that actually measure what experts are interested in, rather than accidentally sweeping up other stuff.</span></p>

<p>After a trauma many people have the sense it has changed them for the better, such as granting them a new appreciation for life or improving their relationships. This has given rise to the appealing notion that there is such a thing as “post-traumatic growth”. However, the majority of investigations into this phenomenon have relied on asking people whether they believe they have changed; very few have assessed people prior to a trauma and then re-assessed them afterwards to see if positive changes have actually occurred.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518811662">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> is the first to apply this kind of “prospective design” in the context of relationship breakups in young adults, and – unfortunately for anyone who found comfort and inspiration in the principle of post-traumatic growth – the authors Meghan Owenz and Blaine Fowers say their findings are more consistent with the idea that such growth is mostly illusory, the result of a positive re-appraisal of the breakup and one’s current situation.</p>
<p><span id="more-35452"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 599 undergrads currently in a romantic relationship and assessed them twice on a range of measures: at the beginning, and near the end of the semester. During that time, 100 of them lived through their relationship breaking up, an experience that, typically for their age group, they found extremely distressing (in fact, on a formal scale they rated their feelings of distress on a par with those reported by survivors of natural disasters and cardiac surgery).</p>
<p>At the start of the semester, all the participants completed a version of the commonly used “post-traumatic growth inventory” that had been slightly reworked to refer to their feelings over the last couple of weeks – such as whether they had experienced a sense of closeness with others over that time or had an appreciation for each day.</p>
<p>Near the end of the semester, all the participants re-took this same revamped version of the growth inventory, thus providing a before and after measure of their general outlook and behaviour. Importantly, the 100 students who’d been through a breakup also took the classic version of the inventory, rating how much they felt they had changed for the better in the same domains (such as closeness to others and life appreciation, among others) but specifically as a result of their relationship trauma.</p>
<p>Comparing early- and late-semester scores on the revamped growth inventory, there was no evidence for positive change, and no evidence that the students who’d been through a break-up showed any more improvement than the students who had not. In contrast, the break-up students did report feeling that the trauma had changed them for the better. Moreover, this perception of growth was higher for students who previously described themselves as more optimistic and who found their breakup more distressing.</p>
<p>Owenz and Fowers believe these findings are consistent with the idea that the perception of growth after trauma is illusory, arising from a (positive) re-appraisal of the situation. Colloquially we might invoke Freud and call this a defence mechanism – looking on the bright side as a way to cope (something that the more optimistic students, and more distressed students, were more inclined to do). More generally, the researchers acknowledge that <em>actual</em> positive growth may be a reality for some people, but they think it unlikely for most.</p>
<p>Future research might paint a different picture. The current findings pertain to young people in a specific culture going through a specific kind of trauma, and they were tested over a relatively short time frame. For now, though, these authors and others believe the burden is on advocates of the existence of post-traumatic growth to provide more robust evidence for their claims, especially using study designs that do not rely purely on people’s subjective and retrospective reports of change. The current situation – where post-traumatic growth is considered a reality based on limited research – Owenz and Fowers find  “…particularly worrisome, given the rapid move from research ‘documenting’ post-traumatic growth to interventions and self-help books designed to promote an approach to trauma that remains questionable.”</p>
