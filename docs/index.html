<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Conference-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h4>One major event in the world calendar of rheumatology</h4>
<p>Scientists, patients, rheumatologists and other health professionals met at the IFEMA Centre to discuss recent advances in research and care in the diagnosis and treatment of RMDs. Sunny Madrid is a popular destination for rheumatologists having hosted EULAR on three out of the last seven editions of the conference. Despite the routine focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other topics have shone in recent years, including co-morbidities, patient engagement, and digitalisation in diagnostics and care.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11113" style="width: 257px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11113" height="329" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/EULAR-returns-to-Madrid-225x300.jpg" width="247" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EULAR returns to Madrid</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<h4>Memorable talks attended</h4>
<p>Checkpoint inhibitors, compounds that improve survival in multiple cancers, concurrently increase numbers of adverse immune events. These <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/76/10/1747" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">include incidences of rheumatoid arthritis</a> as soon as one month after the start of treatment. <a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/faculty/david-stephen-pisetsky-md-phd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Pisetsky</a> and <a href="http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/Medizinische-Klinik-und-Poliklinik-IV/de/Ueber-uns/mitarbeiter/oberaerzte/Schulze-Koops_Hendrik/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Henrik Schulze-Koops</a> discussed the impact of these medications on B and T immune cells, respectively. Both debated whether these treatments might be uncovering latent forms of rheumatism in patients through modulation of various immune subtypes. Beth Helmink followed up by explaining the importance of the microbiome in mediating checkpoint treatment, as exemplified by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0238-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faecal transplants in immuno-deficient mice significantly boosting cancer treatment success</a>.</p>
<p>Comorbidities with RMDs were once again at the center of attention at this year’s EULAR. Despite increased awareness of comorbidities amongst rheumatologists, some reported to me that a lack of communication between specialist clinicians and scarcity of resources prevent adequate treatment of multiple conditions. This critical issue was covered in <em>BMC Rheumatology’s </em>recently published Thematic Series “<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/Comorbidity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comorbidities in rheumatic diseases – from clinical to translational approaches</a>”.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11115" style="width: 381px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11115" height="247" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/EULAR-village-300x200.jpg" width="371" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">EULAR village for exhibitions and posters.(Courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/EULAR_Press" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EULAR Press Office</a>)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>One impressive example of these comorbidities was reported by <a href="https://www.univaq.it/rubrica.php?id=395&amp;perstecnamm=on" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Piero Ruscitti</a> whose team found that remission in patients with RA was associated with an 80% drop in the incidence of negative cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>“Cannabis for the joints?” is how <a href="http://www.iasp-pain.org/AboutIASP/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Serge Perrot</a> concluded his benefit-risk analysis of treating arthritis with cannabinoids, thus generating a wave of smiles amongst delegates. Alongside <a href="https://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/davidfinn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Finn</a> and <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/expertiseguide/life-sciences/dr-stephen-alexander.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Steve Alexander</a>, they established a discussion on the history, science, and ethics of cannabis given the current grey-zone clinicians face. Current knowledge indicates that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that medical cannabis is a viable treatment for rheumatism, although use in pain, insomnia, and anxiety may be reasonably considered on a patient-by-patient basis.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging trends in rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders</strong></p>
<p>Interactive poster tours were a new addition to EULAR 2019, whereby selected presenters were given three minutes to introduce their poster in front of a screen and 20+ delegates with some time afterwards for questions. I attended as many as I could, and I was particularly impressed by the advances in musculoskeletal imaging methods. Chaired by <a href="http://www.haematologie-onkologie-bonn.de/doctor/dr-med-mudr-valentin-schaefer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Valentin Schafer</a> and <a href="https://www.rheumazentrum-ruhrgebiet.de/home/wir/ansprechpartner.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Xenofon Baraliakos</a>, advancements in technologies such as machine learning and algorithms to better diagnose rheumatic conditions were well explained.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11116" style="width: 372px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11116" height="270" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/Presenter-300x224.jpg" width="362" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A presenter uses the new interactive poster format to illustrate their work for an on-looking crowd</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>It is in this context that both <a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a><em> &amp; </em><a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> will run a cross-journal collection on advances and challenges in imaging musculoskeletal disorders until the end of 2019.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient engagement in research and development was definitely a recurring theme throughout this conference</p></blockquote>
<p>Digitalization has additionally enabled more effective communication between health care professionals and patients. For example, Susanne Karlfeldt (Karolinska Institute, Sweden) spoke of Stockholm City Council’s development of personalized, e-health solutions for patients. She outlined how mobile/web applications and regular communication between clinical, patient consultants, and patients can streamline consultation periods and improve patient satisfaction.</p>
<p>Patient engagement in research and development was a recurring theme throughout this conference. One of EULAR’s main activities and related advocacy in coming years will be to increase participation in its work with patients of RMDs. The push to ensure that research and clinical practice is geared towards the needs of patients, as well as involving them more, is something that EULAR and the general scientific community is beginning to consider more seriously. This even more evident by the sessions dedicated to People with Arthritis and Rheumatism in Europe (PARE), which featured a mix of researchers, rheumatologists, and patient advocacy groups such as <a href="https://www.arthritis.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arthritis Foundation</a> and<a href="https://oafifoundation.com/en/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Osteoarthritis Foundation International</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect conditions for exchanges of knowledge and ideas</strong></p>
<p>The open interactions between the different partners that comprise EULAR/PReS – scientists, health professionals &amp; patients – was great to see. I believe that this exchange of ideas could, and should, be applied more to other research fields, including my own background of neuroscience.</p>
<p>Space was also given to a series of sessions for individual groups. One of the most productive is the <a href="https://emeunet.eular.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EMEUNET</a> (Emerging EUlar NETwork) working group, who provide both educational and entertaining events for the young-at-heart involved in rheumatology.</p>
<p>Weather and hospitality conditions were ideal in Madrid for EULAR 2019, and it is easy to see why the rheumatology community keeps coming back again and again. <em>BMC </em>will attend EULAR 2020 in Frankfurt (3 – 6 June), something this field and journals can look forward to in anticipation.</p>

<p>The UK population continues to grow, while nursing numbers have remained static for several decades. Compounding matters, The King’s Fund and Nuffield Trust have <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/the-nhs-workforce-in-numbers%236-how-did-we-get-to-this-situation">reported</a> a 25 per cent increase in nurses and midwives leaving the NHS from 2012 to 2018, from 27,300 to 34,100. In short, in the UK, we now have far fewer nurses relative to the general population than we used to.</p>
<p>What does this mean for patients’ care experience? The situation sounds bad, but how bad? Common sense would suggest that patients will experience poorer care when nurses are overstretched, and there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to support that interpretation. But there are also positive stories, and claims about greater efficiency compensating for fewer staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/early/2019/03/27/bmjqs-2018-008948.full.pdf">study</a> in <i>BMJ Quality &amp; Safety</i> provides direct observational evidence suggesting that lower nurse-patient ratios really do result in poorer health-care interactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37461"></span></p>
<p>Jackie Bridges at the University of Southampton and her colleagues observed how patient-staff interactions varied across six NHS physical healthcare wards in England depending on the ratio of nursing and healthcare assistants to patients. In total, the researchers carefully rated 238 hours of care, which included over 3000 interactions between 270 patients and healthcare staff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, 10 per cent of those interactions were rated as negative – specifically “negative restrictive”, such as patients being moved without warning or sworn at; and “negative protective”, such as patients having to wait for medication. Crucially, the researchers found that the odds of a negative interaction increased significantly as the number of patients per registered nurse increased.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lower numbers of registered nurses working on a ward were associated with more negative interactions regardless of whether or not healthcare assistants (support staff without a nursing qualification) had been brought in to make up the numbers. Having more healthcare assistants on shift only helped if there were enough registered nurses to supervise them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As this was a purely observational study, rather than experimental, some caution is required, as the authors note: “a causal inference [about staffing levels] cannot be directly made”. Nevertheless, this is such a helpful piece of research, that’s clearly consistent what nurses have been saying for years: that they need enough of them on shift to be able to ensure that patient care is high quality.</p>
<p>This isn’t to “do down” healthcare assistants, who are undervalued enough, but it is highlighting the importance of good quality supervision. It also doesn’t mean that nurses go round looking over the shoulders of their more junior colleagues, but is consistent with the argument that patient-carer interactions will be more universally positive when there are sufficient nursing staff to deal with queries, show more junior staff what to do, talk through dilemmas, model excellent patient care, and acknowledge difficult feelings that caring roles can bring up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The study reminded me of the time I’ve spent working in mental health wards, a job which was adrenaline-fuelled and unpredictable but which I loved, and where I worked with brilliant nursing colleagues who were often rushed off their feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Media coverage of care quality in the NHS often blames individuals, and especially nursing staff, for failures. Poor care is never excusable or acceptable, but it is important to recognise that there are perfect storms of working condition which make it more likely. Negative cultures in organisations, lack of staff resources, destructive leadership, can all play their part.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150407084231/http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report">The Francis Report</a>, published in 2013, highlighted the devastating effects of a lack of compassionate care and the need to have cultures where people feel they can speak out about poor care, and where compassionate care is supported. Much has been done since to <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/05/five-myths-compassionate-leadership">champion compassionate leadership and compassionate care</a>, but this new study shows how, in the aftermath of austerity and with not enough staff to go round, it’s harder for these principles to be put into practice. For any of us – nurses included – if we are stressed, tired, under emotional pressure and not given enough time, we tend to behave less nicely. It’s not news that <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Darley-JersualemJericho.pdf">a lack of time has a negative impact on caring behaviours</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s been much about staff wellbeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/nhs-forced-prioritise-staff-wellbeing-tackle-escalating-crisis">in the papers recently</a>, with initiatives to offer mindfulness, yoga, exercise classes and the like. Interventions on an individual level can be hugely helpful and useful to know about. At the same time, it’s not good enough to offer interventions to reduce unnecessary stress caused by an uncaring system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>High quality compassionate care in hospital settings requires sufficient nurses to deliver the care and to supervise their junior colleagues. Anything less is setting up staff to fail and setting up patients for a greater likelihood of negative care. Nurses need to be cared for too, by their employer and by their colleagues, and a bare minimum is making sure there are enough colleagues on shift for it to feel safe. This new research adds to a body of evidence that takes the blame off the nurse and squarely places the responsibility on the system to do better.</p>

<p>The last time I tried to learn a foreign language, I was living in an Italian suburb of Sydney. My hour a week at a local Italian class was inevitably followed by a bowl of pasta and a few glasses of wine. As an approach to language-learning goes, it was certainly more pleasurable than my German lessons at school. Despite the wine, it was also surprisingly effective. In fact, getting better at a new language doesn’t have to mean hard hours on lists of vocab and the rules of grammar. It turns out that what you <i>don’t</i> focus on matters, too. And a glass of wine may even help …<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37458"></span></p>
<p><strong>Listen to the language, even if you don’t have a clue what’s being said – and you’re not even paying close attention</strong></p>
<p>One challenging aspect to learning a new language is that it may contain distinct speech sounds that, as a non-speaker, you can’t even tell apart. This isn’t a problem for young children – they only need to spend time around the new language to learn to hear the different sounds, simply through passive exposure. It’s long been thought adults can’t do this, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918321542">a study published in 2019</a> brings a more optimistic message and has implications for the best approach to adult language learning.</p>
<p>The researchers asked native Finnish-speakers to listen to Mandarin speech sounds while engaged in other tasks, and to do this for two hours a day on four consecutive days. Critically, even when they were instructed to ignore the sounds and focus on a silent movie, recordings of their brain waves (via EEG) suggested they were getting better at differentiating between the different Mandarin speech sounds. “For the first time, these results demonstrated that mere passive exposure to sounds can induce plastic changes related to change detection in the adult human brain, which was previously thought to happen only in infancy during the sensitive period,” the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>The researchers added that this suggests passive training may help real-life language learning. They recommend listening to a language you want to learn while you’re doing something else (as long as it’s not too cognitively demanding) – while working out at the gym, or while cooking, perhaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A passive approach to learning could also be especially beneficial to older adults in the context of remembering new vocab. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612457386">A 2013 study</a> led by Lynn Hasher at the University of Toronto showed that older adults have a greater tendency than younger adults to process distracting information. While this isn’t usually helpful, it does make them more likely to remember background information. This suggests that after a session of deliberately learning new vocab, hearing those words played in the background could help with learning.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t try too hard with the grammar</strong></p>
<p>Not only can children easily perceive the difference between a vast range of speech sounds, but they learn the grammar of a language more easily than adults too. It used to be thought that this advantage ends at about the age of seven. However, again the picture has become more optimistic of late. For instance, in 2018, a team involving Steven Pinker at Harvard University concluded that in fact, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718300994">the advantage lasts about a decade longer</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once we reach adulthood though, it does become harder to get to grips with grammar and also the structural components of words in another language.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Part of the problem could be that adults’ more highly developed cognitive skills work against them. Consider a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101806">2014 study</a> by Amy Finn at MIT and colleagues that found the harder adults worked at the structure and use of units of an artificial language – such as root words, suffixes and prefixes – the worse they did. To learn this language “morphology”, “at least in this artificial language we created, it’s actually worse when you try,” Finn comments.</p>
<p>These findings supported a theory, put forward in 1990 by the linguist Elissa Newport, that adults struggle with this aspect of language-learning because they try to analyse too much information at once. So what can you do? If you’re listening to another language, don’t over-analyse it, Finn suggests. There was a condition in her study in which some of the participants had to complete an undemanding puzzle or do some colouring while they listened to the artificial language – and it’s telling that it was this group who performed best at acquiring the new grammar. It’s hard not to conclude that if you act like a child, maybe you’ll learn as effectively as a child, too…</p>
<p><strong>Choose the right time of day – or night – to learn</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Outside more formal educational settings, a lot of language classes tend to take place in the evenings, but it’s worth considering experimental findings that suggest this isn’t an optimum time for everyone, especially older people and teenagers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For example, in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/a0037243">2014 study</a>, Lynn Hasher and her team found that older adults (aged 60-82) were better able to focus, and tended to do better at memory tests, between 8.30am and 10.30am, compared with 1pm and 5pm. Scans of their brains suggested this was because by the afternoon, their “default mode network” was more active – a neural state indicative of daydreaming. Among young adults, however, other neural networks more associated with focused attention remained active into the afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Evening learning probably isn’t ideal for teenagers either. In <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040963">a study published in 2012</a>, Johannes Holz at the University of Freiberg, and colleagues, found that 16- and 17-year-old girls performed better on tests of factual memory if they’d learned the material at 3pm than at 9pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, another study, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">published in Psychological Science in 2016</a>, suggests that evening learning can be beneficial – especially if you follow it with a decent night’s sleep, and a follow-up session the next morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>French-speaking participants were split into two groups: one learned the French translations of 16 Swahili words in the morning, returning for a second booster session that evening; the others learned the translations in the evening with a booster session the following morning. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The group that learned the vocab in the evening, slept and then studied again the next morning out-performed the other group on all kinds of memory tests. The overnight group showed virtually no forgetting after one week (unlike the same-day learners, who’d forgotten, on average, 4-5 of the translations), and by the second session, they’d forgotten less than the same-day learners and were quicker to re-learn anything that they hadn’t remembered.</p>
<p>The researchers suspect that sleep soon after learning allowed for a greater consolidation of these memories than for the other group. The results suggest that scheduling two study periods, one for close to bed-time, the other soon for after waking, is an effective way to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Take long breaks</strong></p>
<p>The idea of taking as long a break as possible between learning some vocab and revisiting it sounds counter-intuitive. However, it’s worth considering a phenomenon called the “spacing effect” when planning your study schedule.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/25/the-secret-to-remembering-material-long-term/">research published in 2007</a> by Doug Rohrer and Hal Pashler, you should aim to time the intervals between learning something and revising it based on when you’ll <i>really</i> need to recall it (for an exam, say, or a holiday) following a 10 per cent rule – i.e. you should space your revision periods at intervals of roughly 10 per cent of the total time you’d really like to retain those memories. If you’ve got a test coming up in a month, say, then you should revise what you learn today in about two or three days’ time. But if you want to remember something over the longer term, so that your performance peaks in a year’s time, then it’s sensible to revisit that information once a month. Why this rule should work isn’t clear, but it’s possible that having long gaps between learning, revision and retrieval tells your brain that this is knowledge you’ll be coming back to, so it’s worth holding for the long term.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The 10 per cent rule is only a rough guide, though. More recent research suggests the spacing effect works best when it is adapted to each individual’s progress. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797613504302">In a study</a>, published in 2014 in <i>Psychological Science</i>, Pashler and his team devised individual spacing plans for middle school pupils learning Spanish, based on the material’s difficulty level and how well the students did on early tests. They found that these individualised plans boosted test performance at the end of a semester by 16.5 per cent, and led to 10 per cent better scores than the “one-size-fits-all” 10 per cent spaced study plan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Other research has backed up this counter-intuitive idea that, rather than being detrimental, taking a long break from a language that you’re learning might actually be beneficial. A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032974">study published in 2012</a> involved 19 people becoming proficient at speaking and comprehending an artificial language and then taking a three- to six-month break. Michael Ullman at Georgetown University and his team found that the group did just as well in grammar tests after this break as they had done right after first learning the language. In fact, after the break, their brain activity while processing the language looked more like the kind of activity you see when native speakers are processing their first language. Ullman thinks taking a lengthy break from an already learned second language can help the representation of the language to shift from a form of “declarative memory” to “procedural” – akin to playing an instrument or riding a bike. This was a small study involving an artificial language so more research is definitely needed, but as the researchers noted, their findings have “potentially important consequences for second language acquisition”.</p>
<p><strong>Have a drink…</strong></p>
<p>Alcohol is not exactly known for its brain-boosting properties. It impairs all types of cognitive functioning, including working memory and the ability to ignore distractions. So you’d think it would make it harder for someone to speak in a foreign language. However, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/10/moderate-alcohol-consumption-improves-foreign-language-skills/">a study published in 2017</a> by Fritz Renner and colleagues found that it doesn’t – if anything, it can be beneficial.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>German volunteers learning Dutch who’d drunk enough vodka to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.04 per cent (approximately equivalent to just under a pint of beer for a 70kg male) were rated by independent Dutch speakers as speaking the language more proficiently during a short-test (they had to argue in Dutch for or against animal testing), compared with the other participants who’d only drunk water beforehand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Why? Perhaps because some people feel anxious when talking in a foreign language, and this was ameliorated by the alcohol. However, as Renner cautions: “It is important to point out that participants in this study consumed a low dose of alcohol. Higher levels of alcohol consumption might not have [these] beneficial effects.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A highly acclaimed neuroscientist whose work offered hope for many patients with brain injury has fallen from grace.



Niels Birbaumer. From https://www.wysscenter.ch/person/niels-birbaumer-phd/



Prof. Niels Birbaumer, of the Eberhard-Karls University of Tübingen in Germany, came under investigation earlier this year. The probe began after researcher Martin Spüler raised serious concerns over a 2017 paper in PLoS Biology by Ujwal Chaudhary et al. Birbaumer was the senior author.

<p>Can we predict who will receive a telegram from the Queen?</p>
<p>Are centenarians grown-up versions of the exceptionally resilient ‘dandelion children’ I’ve described in<a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/seven-common-sense-building-blocks-for-your-childs-brain/"> previous articles</a>?</p>
<p>Is longevity simply a case of good genes?</p>
<h2>Can we predict which child will live till 100?</h2>
<p>When writing my book, I put these questions to Professor Richie Poulton, head of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study.</p>
<p>And Poulton told me,</p>
<blockquote><p>It is quite obviously evident!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re not familiar with this great kiwi contribution to the world you can learn more <a href="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Dunedin Study has closely charted every detail the lives of 1000 people born in the mid-70s in Dunedin, New Zealand. The cohort is now entering middle age, and Poulton believes he already has a fair idea who will be blowing out 100 candles on their cake.</p>
<p>Poulton and his team have measured the pace of biological ageing in his 1000-strong cohort. Biological ageing is estimated by charting the “coordinated decline in the integrity of multiple organ systems” including 18 biomarkers of cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, lung, liver, kidney, renal, immune, and dental health.</p>
<p>Across 12 years, 18 biomarkers were measured at three time-points when the cohort members were aged 26, 32, and 38. Despite being in their 40s and still being too young to have age-related disease, clear patterns emerged.</p>
<blockquote><p>From ages 26 to 38 we see increasing differentiation between groups in terms of their physical health and mental health.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on their pace of ageing scores three groups were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>an average group who experienced one year of physiological decline per each calendar year.</li>
<li>a fast-ageing group who experienced more than twice this rate of change</li>
<li>a slow-ageing group who experienced almost no change at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Poulton’s team then chose six personal-history characteristics already known to be linked to poor health and mortality:</p>
<ul>
<li>familial longevity</li>
<li>childhood social class</li>
<li>adverse childhood experiences</li>
<li>childhood health</li>
<li>intelligence</li>
<li>self-control.</li>
</ul>
<p>As he writes in a 2017 report in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28401731/"><em>Aging Cell</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Study members with shorter-lived grandparents, who grew up in lower social class homes, who experienced more adverse childhood events, who had poorer childhood health, who scored lower on IQ tests, and who had poorer self-control all showed evidence of accelerated biological aging during their 20s and 30s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poulton predicts,</p>
<blockquote><p>The fast-ageing group is going to enter the second half of their life in bad shape and get worse … We need to start looking at ageing younger than you might think because therapies will need to be delivered by midlife in order to make a difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>He tells me the great sadness of his life is knowing he’ll won’t live long enough to see if his predictions come true.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll be pushing up daisies by then,</p></blockquote>
<p>he says.</p>
<h2>Key characteristics of those who live the longest</h2>
<p>Of course, not all centenarians or slow-agers are alike and personal histories are unique. The <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) team has found their cohort varied widely in years of education (no years to post-graduate), socioeconomic status (very poor to very rich), religion, ethnicity, and patterns of diet (strictly vegetarian to extremely rich in saturated fats).</p>
<p>However, centenarians in Sydney, New England, and Okinawa share a few key characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re nearly always lean.</li>
<li>They rarely smoked</li>
<li>They’re better able to buffer stress than most people.</li>
<li>Women have a history of bearing children after the age of 35 or even 40 years.</li>
<li>At least half have exceptionally old siblings and other relatives.</li>
<li>Children of centenarians also show delays in disease onset.</li>
<li>Score low on personality traits of neuroticism, and high on optimism and purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is extreme longevity is genetic?</p>
<p>Exceptional longevity clearly runs in families — the children and siblings of centenarians are healthier, have a more favourable “biological signature”, and they age slower. Tellingly Jeanne Calment‘s brother Francois (who died age 122, to date the oldest living human ever) lived till the age of 97). But as Jeanne said,</p>
<blockquote><p>God didn’t want there to be two hundred-year-olds in the same family, so it fell to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Members of the Okinawan Centenarian Study team believe its both nature <em>AND</em> nurture.</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the Okinawans have both genetic and non-genetic longevity advantages — the best combination — the dietary habits, the physical activity, the psychological and social aspects, all play an important role in Okinawan longevity.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We all have the genetic capability to live to at<em> least</em> our 80s.</h2>
<p>As the NECs team explain, this makes sense in the context of results from the study of Seventh Day Adventists at Loma Linda University who live eight to 10 years longer than the average American.</p>
<p>As a group, they tend to be vegetarian, non-smokers, physically fit, and they spend a lot of time with their families and with their church group. Plenty of Americans make nearly the opposite health choices and as a consequence die younger.</p>
<blockquote><p>What the Seventh Day Adventist results also show us is that the average American has the genes to reach their mid-late 80s, they just need to take very good care of themselves with proper lifestyle choices.</p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p><em>This is part 3 of a series of lessons in brain health from our elders — those folk who lived the longest and healthiest.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re living longer, but how do our aging brains fare? </em></p>
<p><em>To answer this question, I’ve looked to two sources — those exceptionally old folks who remain in robust physical and mental health till the very end of their lives, and our evolutionary past.</em></p>
<p><em>Over millennia, Mother Nature equipped us to survive and thrive in the wild. Our brains evolved such that from womb to the tomb we’re required to move, eat well, sleep, immerse ourselves in nature, avoid stress, love and befriend, and seek meaning. These requirements neatly map onto the principles of everyday life followed by the world’s longest living people.</em></p>

<p>As father to an 18-month-old toddler, I would love to know exactly what my son is thinking. Along with many parents, one of the ways I try to find out is to ask him questions of the variety “Do you want X or Y?” But does his answer to this type of question actually reveal his preference or is it a more a reflection of a quirky cognitive bias that is more powerful in children than adults?</p>
<p>Two competing effects influence how adults respond to binary choices. The first is called “The Primary Effect” which describes the way that the first option we hear tends to stick in our minds. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773285">one study</a> found that adults are more likely to choose “heads” when asked if a coin toss is going to be “heads or tails”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second effect, which sometimes contrasts with the Primary Effect, is called “The Recency Effect”. This captures the way that the last thing we hear or experience can also have more weight in our memory (this is why popstars end their concerts on their best songs, so that everyone leaves thinking the whole gig was great). In adults, neither the Primary Effect or the Recency Effect is always the more pronounced, with evidence suggesting that one’s personality type, familiarity of the information, and how controversial the topic is, all play a mediating role.</p>
<p>Keen to test if the same is true in young children, or if one of the effects is more dominant, a team led by Emily Sumner conducted two experiments and published their findings in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217207">a recent paper</a> in <i>PLOS One</i> fantastically titled “Cake or Broccoli: Recency Biases Children’s Verbal Responses”.</p>
<p><span id="more-37438"></span></p>
<p>In the first experiment, they asked twenty-four toddlers a series of questions with two options for them to consider (i.e. “Should Rori bring a lunchbox or backpack to school?”). Later, after enough other questions had been asked to mask the repetition, the order of these options were flipped (i.e. “Should Quinn bring a backpack or a lunchbox to school?”). When answering verbally, which they usually did, the toddlers chose the second option 85.2 per cent of the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, when the toddlers pointed to their preference instead of saying them, they chose the second option only 51.6 per cent of the time. It would appear that there is something about saying the answer that accentuates the Recency Effect. Further analysis of the data revealed that the Recency Effect was more powerful among younger toddlers (18-24 months old) compared with the older ones (24-48 months), suggesting its impact diminishes the older the children get, as they become more rational and logical.</p>
<p>In their second experiment, the researchers explored why the Recency Effect is so pronounced in young children. To do this, they had twenty-four 3-to-4 year olds choose names for different toys. Some of the options were one-syllable names (i.e. “Should we name this toy ‘Stog’ or ‘Meeb’?”) whereas others were longer (“Should we name this toy ‘Shallop’ or ‘Bingle?”). This went all the way up to four-syllable names. The researchers found that the longer the word was, the more likely the children were to choose the second of two options. The researchers speculated that the longer names placed more of a burden on children’s limited working memory capacity, resulting in the latter of the two options being fresher in their mind and therefore more prominent. This partially explains why the younger children in the first experiment acted on the Recency Effect more, as their working memory capacity is even more limited at that age.</p>
<p>This study has implications for both researchers in education and parents. For researchers, a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>popular way to assess young children’s comprehension and development is to have them do tasks which involve making these sort of fixed-choice decisions. However, as the authors of this study note, their findings “suggest that some of children’s earliest utterances may be the result of a recency bias, and do not necessarily indicate that the child comprehends the words they speak”.</p>
<p>For parents keen to gain an insight into their child’s thought processes and understand them better, it would probably pay dividends to vary the order of choices they give them. By ensuring that the same option is not always second, it will probably help them deduce what their child really prefers. Another effective strategy would also be having their child point to which of the two options they want, as this helped combat the recency bias in this study. Cunning parents could also consider exploiting the Recency Effect to encourage their child to express an apparent preference for a healthier option over the other. Perhaps if I do this, I can get my own toddler to eat more broccoli and less cake.</p>

update that soon also. Still <a class="reference external" href="https://pagure.io/neuro-sig/NeuroFedora/issues?status=Open&amp;tags=S%3A+Needs+packaging">quite a queue for us to work through</a>,
but we're making steady progress!</p>

After her lawyers threatened Linköping whistleblower Jaywant Phopase, accusing him of slander and demanding money, regmed researcher May Griffith wrote to me. She sent me a whole dossier: all misconduct findings against her were overruled, even in court.  Turns out, ethics dumping is good and anyway, she is not responsible for her own publications.

We don’t know how another person perceives the outside world: the color of the ocean, the sound of the waves, the smell of the seaside, the exact temperature of the water. Even more obscure is how someone else <i><b>imagines</b></i> the world in the absence of external stimuli. Most people are able to generate an internal “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/" target="_blank" title="mental representation">representation</a>”<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> of a beach — to deploy imagery — when asked, “picture yourself at a relaxing beach.” We can “see” the beach in our mind’s eye even when we’re not really there. But no one else has access to these private images, thoughts, narratives. So we must rely on subjective report.<br /><br />The hidden nature of imagery (and qualia more generally)<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span>  explains why a significant minority of humans are shocked and dismayed when they learn that other people are capable of generating visual images, and the request to “picture a beach” isn’t metaphorical. This lack of imagery often extends to other sensory modalities (and to other cognitive abilities, such as spatial navigation and autobiographical memories), which will be discussed another time.

This very blog forms a large part of a newly published study on research methods blogs in psychology. The paper has a spicy backstory.







Back in 2016, psychologist Susan Fiske caused much consternation with a draft article which branded certain (unnamed) bloggers as being “bullies” and “destructo-critics” who “destroy lives” through “methodological terrorism.”



Fiske's post (which later appeared in a more moderate version) was seen as pushback against bloggers who criticized the robustne

<p>In 2015, I retired from the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> and presented an exit seminar titled “Career Reflections of a 1970s Feminist,” using my experiences of training and working in medicine and psychiatry from 1975 to 2015 to highlight women’s issues. Afterward, I was surprised by discussions with current women psychiatry trainees, who said that not much had changed in terms of their work experiences.</p><p>This was shocking and sad. Many women who campaigned during the 1960s assumed that inequalities would melt away when the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Equal Pay Act 1970 were enacted on 29<sup>th</sup> Dec 1979. Instead, throughout 2018 there has been a deluge of media coverage about gender inequalities and sexual harassment.</p><p>The Women’s Movement has a long history dating back to the fifteenth century or before and gathering momentum in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I have in my ancestry two pioneering intellectual women, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-116">Margaret Fuller</a> (1810-1850) and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-82?rskey=st5dzI&amp;result=1">Frances Willard</a> (1839-1898), who were part of the Women’s Movement in America. In those days, their priorities were education and suffrage. They would have been disappointed to think that 200 years later, women were still suffering inequalities. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage">1893</a>, New Zealand became the first country in which women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections. The two World Wars later opened spaces for women to excel outside their domestic spheres.</p><p>Women (and men) have made great strides in this arena, but something has stalled since enactment of our discrimination and equality laws. The immediate response is to gather data and draw up policies and protocol. But these have not worked in the past, so why expect the same process to produce different results next time? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/fawcett-staff">Sam Smethers</a>, CEO of the Fawcett Society, talks of “push back.” Historians of feminism talk about <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth">waves</a> (which implies troughs too). Others talk of “undercurrents” or “stealthy factors,” or instruct in survival strategies such as “leaning in.”</p><p>We do not know why such inertia exists in our social structures. Perhaps ethological (observation of animal behaviour) research in our organisations is the place to start. How do people, men and women, behave in our institutions and why is the resistance to change so strong?</p><p>Consider these three scenarios:</p><p><strong>1. Cauliflower cheese portions:</strong></p><p>This is familiar to many women. You go to the canteen at work with male colleagues and the kindly serving staff dish out your cauliflower cheese. As a woman, mine was often smaller than that of the male doctors I dined with. Portion control was not equal. We paid the same. We were all happy—the men get a good dollop of lunch, I got plenty for my needs and the kindly staff had done their jobs well. But it was not equal. Is it a problem? Is it so much part of our indoctrinations that it is usually invisible? Is this just a clear and amusing example of many, more insidious inequalities that perpetuate gender differences in our social settings? Verdict: More research needed.</p><p><strong>2. Surfing </strong></p><p>It is becoming apparent that women doctors work harder than many men doctors and get paid less. How did that happen when the UK has a national contract? There is focus on clinical awards, who gets extras, career effects of working less than full-time, gender differences in academic medicine, and so on, but ethological research could give insights here too. Consider this stereotyped scenario: male consultant, any specialty, his secretary may make him tea or coffee, hang up his coat, prepare clinic, tribunal, and lecture materials, have letters ready for signing, manage his diary, etc. His team will usually be fully staffed and his operating theatres have their quotas of assistants. What of this happens for his woman colleague? Are more staffing gaps found in teams with women consultants? Who does the extras such as on call rota planning, extra teaching, and pastoral care? Close analysis of the ways institutions support men and women employees differently may show that while men get help to surf the waves, women get ballast and smaller surfboards. Again, more research needed.</p><p><strong>3. Witch hunting </strong></p><p>Something happens in the treatment of women employees as they get older. Just at the stage when they are likely to have fewer domestic commitments and more time available for work, their wisdom and skills seem less valued. At this stage, there seems to be a culling of older women and a stacking up of older men at the hierarchy pinnacles. Some people’s testimonies seem difficult to believe initially, until one considers witch hunting. Why did witch hunting—a gendered phenomenon that defied logic–evolve in some societies in the past, and by which medusa tentacles is such group-think or bias evident now? Why do our social systems need this sort of group behaviour, who initiates it, who perpetuates it, and who benefits from it? More research needed.</p><p>Psychiatry is not the only space in which women are silenced or burdened, but as a discipline it’s one lens through which we can analyse a larger phenomenon. Now more than ever, it’s essential to discuss, in real time, women’s experiences as health professionals and as patients in mental health services. Too often women have been silenced and the gender gap in scientific publications is one example of this. As I edited the essays for this book, I was constantly overwhelmed by their quality, integrity, and content, and so inspired by my wonderful women colleagues.</p><p>Featured image credit: “Medical hospital hallway” by Foundry.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Stress has complicated effects on our memories. Whereas some studies have found that we are better at remembering events that occurred during stressful situations, <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/32/10111%23sec-22">such as while watching disturbing videos</a>, others have shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742709001993">stress impairs memory</a>. Now <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262618301969">a study</a> published in <i>Brain and Cognition</i> suggests that stress doesn’t influence the strength of our emotional memories at all. Instead, the researchers claim, it is the fidelity of those memories – how distinct and precise they are – that changes when we go through stressful experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37420"></span></p>
<p>Maheen Shermohammeda from Harvard University and colleagues recruited 56 young adults between 18 and 23, and asked them to view a series of negative and neutral pictures. That might seem painless enough – except that half of the participants looked at the pictures while feeling rather stressed. Before they began looking at the pictures, they were told that they would later have to give a speech to a panel of judges. To make matters worse, before seeing each block of pictures they had to complete complicated maths problems. They were given just a short time to complete these, and while doing so they were told that they were performing poorly and their data would be unusable if they didn’t do well. In contrast, the control group had a fairly relaxing time: instead of a speech, they were told they would have to write a story, and they only had to complete simple maths problems at their own pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>About two weeks later, all the participants were given a surprise memory task, in which they again saw the earlier pictures alongside new images they hadn’t seen before. They had to indicate whether each picture was an old one that had been in the original task or a new image they hadn’t seen before.</p>
<p>At several points throughout the study, all participants were asked how stressed they were, and also had their heart rate measured and saliva samples taken to analyse levels of the stress hormone cortisol. As expected, the group that went through the stressful experience reported higher levels of stress, and had increased heart rates and cortisol levels (although the team had to exclude a handful of participants who, surprisingly, didn’t report feeling stressed).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, participants in both groups were better at remembering negative images – this replicates a well-established finding that emotional material tends to be more memorable. Also, the stressed group correctly remembered just as many of the earlier images as the control group<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(i.e. their “hit rate” was the same). Crucially, where the groups differed was in their patterns of “false alarms” – how often they falsely remembered new images as being from the original task. The stressed participants were more prone to false alarms for negative images compared neutral images, and the more stressed they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>were, the larger this difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The control group didn’t show any difference between the two kinds of images.</p>
<p>Based on these results, the researchers suggest it’s not the strength of our memories that is influenced by stress, but rather their fidelity, or how distinct they are from other information. For the stressed group, neutral memories became more distinct, making it easier to distinguish them from new neutral material, while negative memories were more vague or blurred, making it harder to distinguish them from new negative material. The results demonstrate the importance of separating out memory into its constituent parts (strength and fidelity), the researchers add, rather than just looking at overall performance or correct “hits”.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a rather preliminary result. The pool of participants was small to begin with, and made even smaller after the researchers had to remove those participants who didn’t respond to their stress intervention. And the participants all came from a very young, narrow age range, raising the question of whether older people respond in similar ways.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea that stress has different effects on different components of memory is an interesting proposition that deserves further attention – particularly as understanding memory during periods of stress has important real-world implications for situations like eyewitness accounts of crimes. For example, the researchers said, a “stressed witness to [a] crime … may indeed have a strong recollection of the criminal, but may also have an impoverished ability to discriminate the assailant from other individuals in a police lineup.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/06/ORCID-Reviewer-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/10/collaboration-improves-recognition-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PLOS authors have used </span><a href="https://orcid.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to make their professional lives easier. Now reviewers at PLOS can take advantage of the same benefits to track their contributions, claim credit, and build up their research profiles.</span></p>
<p><b>Same ORCID, now for reviews</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting today, reviewers can enter their ORCID iD in the Editorial Manager submission system for all PLOS journals and opt-in to automatically get credit when they complete a review, the same way they would for their published articles. The ORCID reviewer record does not contain details about the specific manuscript and we’ve introduced a delay, so reviewers can track their work even while retaining their anonymity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to record more types of work is especially important for researchers who are working to build up their scholarly reputation. For those who are getting ready to apply for funding or a new position, credit for reviews helps demonstrate the full breadth of their contributions to the field.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>“We thank PLOS for partnering with ORCID to provide their reviewers the opportunity to get credit for their critical contribution to the research ecosystem.”</p>
<p>– Laure Haak, Executive Director of ORCID.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><b>More ways to get credit = more reasons to review</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewers’ contributions to the publication process are essential. They are working researchers who give their time and expertise to help authors improve their work and help editors decide when a manuscript is ready to become part of the permanent scientific record. But recognition for reviews often flies under the radar, in part, because tools for tracking these contributions without compromising anonymity may not be available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year we rolled out options for signed and published</span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">peer review history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Combined with ORCID, we aim to give reviewers the tools and opportunities to claim credit for their reviews in a way that works for them.</span></p>

<p><b>How it works</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID is a persistent unique identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers with the same name and sticks with you throughout your careers. Even if you change your name, switch institutions, or move to another country, all of the contributions tracked by your ORCID are still identifiable and attributable to you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have an ORCID iD, you can sign up on the</span><a href="https://orcid.org/register"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ORCID website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, follow the instructions on our <a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid#loc-how-to-get-started">site</a> to link your iD to your Editorial Manager profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your ORCID is linked, you can opt-in to automatically alert ORCID anytime you complete a review. For each new review, you’ll get a message with the option to post the citation to your ORCID record. Click “authorize” to start tracking your contributions.</span></p>

<p>It’s a trick that politicians have long exploited: repeat a false statement often enough, and people will start believing that it’s true. Psychologists have named this phenomenon the “illusory truth effect”, and it seems to come from the fact that we find it easier to process information that we’ve encountered many times before. This creates a sense of fluency which we then (mis)interpret as a signal that the content is true. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of course, you might like to believe that your particular way of thinking makes you immune to this trick. But <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n7bze/">according to a pre-print uploaded recently to PsyArXiv</a>, you’d be wrong. In a series of experiments, Jonas De keersmaecker at Ghent University and his collaborators found that individual differences in cognition had no bearing on the strength of the illusory truth effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37408"></span></p>
<p>The researchers wondered whether three aspects of cognition, already known to influence how people make judgments, could determine how prone someone is to the illusory truth effect: cognitive ability or intelligence; the need for cognitive closure (i.e. the desire to avoid ambiguity); and cognitive style (whether someone thinks in a rapid and intuitive manner or takes a slower and more analytic approach). For example, someone who relies more on intuition and wants hard-and-fast answers might be more likely to use the fact that information has been repeated as a cue to its truthfulness.</p>
<p>Across six experiments involving between 199 and 336 participants, the team measured the illusory truth effect while also tapping into these aspects of cognition. The exact methods varied for each study, but generally participants would first read a mix of true and false trivia statements, then complete various cognitive tests and surveys, and finally they would re-read and judge as true or false the earlier trivia statements, as well as new ones interspersed among them. A seventh study was similar but involved fake and real political headlines (the participants’ final challenge in this case was to judge which were real and which were made up).</p>
<p>The researchers found the illusory truth effect across all seven studies: participants were more likely to rate trivia statements and headlines as true/real if they’d seen them previously. Crucially, the strength of this effect did not vary according to the participants’ cognitive ability or style, or need for closure. (A couple of studies found some small significant associations, but these disappeared when the researchers integrated all the data.)</p>
<p>These results suggest that we are all predisposed to believe repeated information regardless of our own particular cognitive profile. And while that might make us all susceptible to advertising and the fabrications of dishonest politicians, the researchers have a more optimistic take. “These novel findings are in line with the assertion that processing fluency is not a judgmental bias and flaw in the individual, but rather a cue to truth that is universal and epistemologically justified in most contexts”, they write. In other words, it’s not that there’s a foolish subgroup of people who are more vulnerable to the “illusory truth” effect, but rather it’s an advantageous and universal bias that’s arisen because most of the time fluency actually <i>is</i> a reliable signal of truth. For example, a statement that is often repeated may tend to be endorsed by more people, which could be a useful cue to its truth.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual differences relating to the illusory truth effect waiting to be discovered, the team adds. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, for example, seem to show a less strong effect, suggesting that certain fundamental aspects of memory and cognition may be required to support the effect. With a greater willingness to publish null results like this one – and not just leave them in the file drawer – researchers should be able to build up a much more complete picture of the illusory truth effect and other cognitive biases.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>You may be best advised not to read this article late at night or before you eat. Psychologists at the National Institute of Mental Health and Charles University in the Czech Republic have surveyed a large sample of non-clinical volunteers to gauge their reaction to 24 creatures that are commonly the source of specific animal phobias.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12409">published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em></a>, not only contribute to our understanding of animal phobias, but could prove incredibly useful to horror writers. Among the key findings is that spiders were unique in being both intensely fear- <em>and</em> disgust-inducing in equal measure. The researchers said this may be due to their mix of disgusting properties – including their “quirky ‘too-many-legs’ body plan” – combined with the fact they are “…omnipresent in our homes, often lurking in the hidden dark places and capable of fast unpredictable movement.” In other words, the intense fear arises in part from the prospect of coming into physical contact with a creature perceived by many to be revolting.</p>
<p><span id="more-37399"></span></p>
<p>Jakub Polák and his team recruited nearly 2000 people online and asked them to rate how frightening and disgusting they found 25 creatures, including – alongside the spider – a snail, dog, bull, maggot, cockroach, two kinds of snake (a viper and a grass snake), and ant. See the image above for the full list.</p>
<p>Depicted in photographs on-screen, this particular selection of species – aside from the red panda, which acted as a non-fear-inducing control – was chosen because they are frequently the source of animal phobias.</p>
<p>Categorising the creatures based on the levels of fear and disgust that they elicited, the researchers identified five groupings: fear-relevant, non-slimy small animals, such as cockroaches, ants and wasps; mouse-like animals, such as mouse, rat and bat, which scored low on elicited fear and disgust; snakes and lizards; parasites, such as lice and tapeworm, which triggered high disgust; and finally, farm or pet mammals, such as cat, dog and horse, which generally elicited low fear and disgust.</p>
<p>One explanation for common animal phobias is that they reflect an exaggerated, uncontrolled form of innate fears for certain creatures that we all share, particularly for creatures that imperilled our ancestors, such as spiders and snakes. Consistent with this evolutionary account, spiders and venomous snakes elicited the strongest fear reactions among the participants, while parasites elicited the strongest disgust reactions (consistent with the idea that disgust motivates a form of protective “behavioural avoidance”). However, less consistent with the evolutionary perspective on animal phobias is that 14 of the creatures elicited virtually no fear, including rats, mice and lizards, even though these animals are commonly the source of phobias.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that, similar to spiders, the parasitic creatures like tape-worm and roundworm were both highly disgust-inducing (even more than the spider) while at the same time being rated as highly fear-inducing (even more than, say, the wasp or grass-snake). <span>Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, this combined fear and disgust reaction to intestinal parasites has evolved because they infect us with microscopic larvae meaning we rarely see them with our eyes, yet we are aware they are omnipresent. Once again, as with spiders, we cannot rely only on disgust (and behavioural avoidance) to protect us, and so we also fear unwanted physical contact. The maggot, by contrast, may elicit less fear because it can be seen and avoided more easily.   </span></p>
<p>Some other details to emerge from the study are that women generally gave higher fear and disgust ratings than men, and especially for non-slimy invertebrates and repulsive human parasites – this may be in line with evolutionary theory because “women as a sex with higher reproductive cost need to be extra careful of pathogens threatening not only their health but also the [health] of their children.”</p>
<p>Also, the researchers asked their participants about any past traumatic experiences with animals, such as being seriously bitten by a dog or scratched by a cat. Surprisingly perhaps, they found that fear ratings were <em>lower</em> among people with such a bad experience in their past. However, this correlation makes sense if you consider that people with a greater fear of animals may be be more cautious and less likely to get hurt. “Our results … suggest that fear and disgust could protect subjects against harm even in our modern environment,” the researchers said. In excess, fear can be debilitating and unwelcome, but this last result is perhaps a reminder that it is also there to serve a purpose – including to protect us from the creatures that may bite us while we sleep or infect us from within.</p>

Such advanced cognitive skills require a big brain to process complex information, and a long phase of development to observe others, learn skills, and acquire social and manual tools. Essential ingredients facilitating this life style are time, parental support – and iodine.</p>

<p>Iodine is a rare mineral which is critical for development, health, and reproduction in modern humans. It is reasonable to assume that it was equally important for our ancestors. Given that normative human development depends on iodine, it is thought that expansion of brain tissue, its structural differentiation, and the related social and cognitive skills that emerged during human evolution were contingent on enhanced intake of iodine.</p>
<p>Rich sources of iodine can be found in coastal areas. It is for this reason that researchers consider such habitats as crucial for the emergence of “human” traits. Adapting to a diet of sea food, weeds, and salt water has boosted brain growth and fueled other physiological systems that control nutrition, development, and maturation. This raises the question of how organisms which became used to the unlimited intake of “brain food” were able to migrate away from the coast and invade habitats that are deficient of iodine such as continental forests, mountain areas, and dry savannas.</p>
<p>Fossil evidence demonstrates a steady increase in brain size which is suggestive for sufficient iodine intake. But what sources did our ancestors use to meet their enhanced nutritional requirements. One way to obtain this information might be to look at apes, humans closest living relatives and study their food habits. Many of them live in areas that have been occupied by prehistoric human populations and one can infer that our ancestors relied on the same food sources that make up the diet of contemporary wild ape populations.</p>
<p>The diets of bonobos (<em>Pan paniscus</em>) and chimpanzees (<em>P. troglodytes</em>) show some remarkable similarities to that of humans: Both species feed on leaves, herbs, and a variety of energy rich plant foods such as fruit pulp and seeds. Some populations dig for roots and other underground organs, extract honey from tree holes, and consume the meat of other vertebrates. While many populations of bonobos and chimpanzees inhabit areas considered to be iodine deficient compared to human standards, there is good reason to assume that sources of environmental iodine used by wild apes are sufficient to prevent the detrimental effects of iodine deficiencies that affect humans and nonhuman primates.</p>

<p>Although research on diet composition and feeding behavior of bonobos, chimpanzees and other apes have been investigated in great detail, the intake of iodine remains virtually unknown. The first data on this topic are available in a recent study published by<em> BMC Zoology</em>. Alerted by the behavior of wild bonobos at the research site of LuiKotale in the Democratic Republic of Congo, researchers from the Center for Research and Conservation (Antwerp), the Max-Planck-Society (Leipzig), and John Moores Liverpool University, launched a project to investigate the reason for the use of aquatic terrain by the otherwise terrestrial apes.</p>
<p>The continental part of the Congo basin is considered as a region where natural sources of iodine are scarce and where humans depend on supplementation of iodine. However, the results of this study show that the Congo basin is not devoid of natural sources of iodine <em>per se</em> and that some species of aquatic herbs contain iodine concentrations that are equivalent to those of marine algae (a substantial source of iodine). Bonobos and other apes are well known to use aquatic food sources and the results of our study suggest that iodine may be the driving force for this behavior. Projecting back towards the time of human migration across the African continent, populations moving into the Congo basin would have found sources of iodine to support the lives and health of migrants that were primed by the rich sources of coastal habitats.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Hearing voices that don’t exist in the outside world is the most common form of hallucination experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or related conditions and it can be very distressing. However, there is a growing recognition that hearing voices is not always pathological. Many mentally well people hear voices (or “auditory verbal hallucinations”) – in fact, around 6-7 per cent of adults in the general population report having had such experiences at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>This has led some experts to propose a “continuum model” in which the same fundamental underlying mechanism leads to hearing voices in healthy people and in patients with a clinical diagnosis, but that for various reasons, such as a traumatic past, the experience is more troublesome and distressing for the patients. However, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/45/4/733/5149404">a new open-access paper</a> in <em>Schizophrenia Bulletin</em> challenges the continuum model, finding an important brain difference between patients who hear voices and voice-hearing healthy controls.</p>
<p><span id="more-37393"></span></p>
<p>The research team, led by Jane Garrison and Iris Sommer, recruited three groups matched for age, education, sex, handedness and overall brain volume: 50 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related conditions such as nonspecific psychosis or schizoaffective disorder) who hear voices; 50 non-clinical healthy volunteers who hear voices (at least once per week); and 50 healthy controls who do not hear voices.</p>
<p>The researchers scanned all their participants’ brains, specifically looking at the length of a brain structure involved in “reality monitoring” or telling the difference between internally and externally generated experiences. For instance, a typical test of reality monitoring involves asking a person to read or imagine different words, and then asking them to recall which words they’d read and which they’d imagined.</p>
<p>Garrison and her colleagues wanted to test the idea that a problem with reality monitoring contributes to the voice-hearing experience in patients with schizophrenia, but not in healthy people who hear voices. To test this account, they used the scans to measure the length of a brain structure called the paracingulate sulcus (PCS) – this is the most frontal area of the medial prefrontal cortex and previous research has suggested that it is involved in reality monitoring. For instance, people for whom the PCS is completely absent (up to a quarter of the general population by some estimates) tend to struggle with reality monitoring tasks.</p>
<p>As they predicted, the researchers found that their patient volunteers had a shorter PCS than the healthy non-voice-hearing controls, <em>and</em> a shorter PCS than the voice-hearing healthy controls. In contrast, there was no (statistically significant) difference in the length of the PCS between the voice-hearing healthy controls and the controls who did not have hallucinations.</p>
<p>Garrison’s team believe this result is consistent with there being two routes to auditory hallucinations (see image, above). For healthy people who hear voices, the researchers believe the origin is in hyper-activation of sensory parts of the brain involved in processing auditory information. For patients with schizophrenia, by contrast, they believe there is a sensory component combined with a problem with reality monitoring.</p>
<p>“These findings, together with our previous work, corroborate a model in which part of the mechanism underlying hallucinations is shared between clinical and nonclinical individuals with hallucinations,” the researchers said, “while a second mechanism, compromising [in]adequate reality monitoring, is present in patients only.”</p>
<p>This two-route model could explain some of the differences in the voice-hearing experience reported by patients and healthy voice-hearers, such as the lower frequency and shorter duration of the experience in the latter group. In healthy voice-hearers, hyper-activation of sensory areas is likely to be a relatively exceptional event, and their intact reality monitoring can also suppress the experience. For patients, by contrast, hyper-activation of sensory areas may not need to be so intense, and they may not have the necessary reality monitoring capabilities to inhibit or make sense of their hallucinations – consequently their voice hearing is more frequent and long-lasting.</p>
<p>The new findings also chime with past research that has suggested important differences between clinical and non-clinical voice hearers at a neurobiological level. For instance, patients with schizophrenia have been shown to have heightened synthesis of the brain chemical dopamine, potentially contributing to seeing intense meaning in sensations and experiences (known as “aberrant salience”), whereas non-clinical voice hearers do not show this same abundance of dopamine.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that the new findings – and the two-route model – cannot account for some of the differences in the experiences of patients who hear voices and healthy people who hear voices, such as the more negative (angry, upsetting and controlling) content in the hallucinations reported by patients.</p>
<p>Also, it’s worth noting that, among the healthy voice-hearers in this study, the length of the PCS was intermediary between the patients and non-voice-hearing controls. It’s possible, the researchers admitted, that the reason the difference in PCS length between the two healthy groups was found to be statistically non-significant may have been due to a lack of statistical power. They said that replication of this study with larger samples could clarify this issue, adding that “…further research is [also] needed to to assess the extent to which the present results generalise to other nonclinical populations with hallucinations who may have different etiology and phenomenology of hallucinatory experience.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/06/21/policy-on-short-works/">arXiv’s policy on short works</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv is a part of the scholarly scientific community, and we strive to participate in and adapt to the changing needs of the community. Recently, we have been discussing whether arXiv should consider hosting short works, which include research discoveries, results or data without context or interpretation and do not conform to accepted standards conventional, peer-reviewed journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to keep in mind arXiv‘s goals, mission, and scope, and how arXiv achieves these for the community. arXiv provides e-prints, including preprints and author’s version of accepted manuscripts, in specific scientific disciplines. We expect submissions to arXiv to be topical and refereeable scientific contributions that follow accepted standards of scholarly communication, as exemplified by conventional mainstream journal articles. Therefore, submission should be self-contained, in the sense that they can be read and understood without excessive reference to other papers, and have sufficient, non-trivial original content, including original research or useful new exposition of existing results (i.e. review article).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are subjective criteria, and so our </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/moderation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moderation process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evaluates the suitability and value of submissions to our arXiv communities. We rely heavily on the expertise and judgement of 168 volunteer moderators and the quality control of our staff who review submissions and address correspondence. Together, they handle about 21% of our annual 140,000 submissions, which has exponentially increased by about 30% every year . If we were to modify our scope of acceptable material and accept short works in bulk, the submission rate could potentially greatly increase to a level that arXiv cannot sustain with its current structure and resources.</span></p>
<p><b>Therefore, given arXiv’s goals, mission, and resources, arXiv cannot actively or explicitly encourage submissions of short works and similar types of material.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, at arXiv, we value the importance of embracing and supporting scientific communication innovations, and we want to explore how we can support new forms. So, for the next 12 months, short, unrefereed submissions that have passed the checks of being a research article will proceed through the moderation process. In practice, it will mean that these short submissions will be placed “on hold” and not appear until approved by a moderator. Depending on the moderator load, the hold time will vary, from being not appreciable to the user to multiple days. There will be no change to how standard-length submissions are handled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the 12-month trial period we will assess the situation and evaluate if any changes are necessary. However, given currently allocated resources for arXiv and our moderators, if this process becomes unsustainable we will prematurely end it. While this may be disappointing, we have to bear in mind that our priority is the core mission and operations, so any new experiment cannot happen to the detriment of these top priorities.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does “unsustainable” mean in practice?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unsustainable process for arXiv means that too much effort is required by moderators to keep up with the submissions and appeals volume; symptoms and warning signs will include a growing “hold” queue. We will remain vigilant in monitoring the process and hope users appreciate this effort and cooperate with arXiv in this experiment.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can I cooperate?</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before submitting a short work to arXiv, consider if it meets the criteria of a research article. Does it meet the criteria of a research article, either refereeable or self-contained with sufficient non-trivial new content? It should contain research discoveries, results or data with context or interpretation.</span></li>
<li>If you submitted something and it was put “on hold” please be patient. Remember: our moderators are doing their best, but they have volunteered their limited time and resources.</li>
<li>If you submitted something and it was removed, carefully read the accompanying message and understand that there is limited ability of administrators and moderators to provide feedback on submissions that are determined to be inappropriate for arXiv. You will need to consider if you would like to put in the effort required to make the submission better aligned with arXiv main scope.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your cooperation.</span></p>

<p>There is increasing recognition that while our personality traits are stable enough to shape our lives profoundly, they are also partly malleable, so that our choices and experiences can feedback and influence the kind of people we become. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618300825">new study</a> in the<em> Journal of Research in Personality</em> shines a light on a highly consequential behaviour that captures this dynamic – smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>The results add “… to existing knowledge on the implications of smoking by showing that this behaviour is also likely to alter individuals’ characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving over time,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-37376"></span></p>
<p>It’s already well established that, by virtue of their traits, some people are more disposed than others to take up smoking – namely those who are more extraverted, less emotionally stable and less conscientious. The new research, led by Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier, suggests (but does not prove) that this habit can then feedback and shape smokers’ traits.</p>
<p>Using repeated measures of people’s personality traits over many years, the researchers report that smokers display personality changes that are different from those seen in non-smokers, especially in terms of reduced emotional stability and reduced extraversion.</p>
<p>The data come from five large surveys of middle-aged and older volunteers, four in the US and one in Japan. Ranging in size from just over 600 participants to over 6000, the surveys included information on whether the participants smoked and measures of their personality traits collected repeatedly over time spans from 4 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Overall, the results showed that smokers showed declines in emotional stability, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness, relative to non-smokers. However, the precise patterns of change varied across the different samples. The most consistent pattern was for smokers to show relative declines in emotional stability and extraversion.</p>
<p>Stephan and his team also looked to see if stopping smoking had any positive personality consequences. In fact, there was little evidence of this. If anything, stopping smoking was associated with declines in agreeableness. Perhaps, the researchers speculated, this is because of a loss of “smoking-related social interactions”; residual adverse effects of smoking; and due to health-related side-effects associated with smoking cessation, such as “heightened risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes” both of which are known to have unhelpful consequences for personality traits.</p>
<p>The study is impressive for the size of the samples and the use of a longitudinal methodology that followed the same people over time. However, it’s limited by the reliance on participants’ self-reports of their own traits; the lack of information on smoking intensity; the skew towards older participants; and it’s inability to offer insights into why smoking would seem to lead to mostly adverse personality changes.</p>
<p>The researchers speculated that the health-related harms of smoking might be a factor mediating the habit’s apparent effects on personality. Health consequences of smoking such as insomnia, depression and reduced cardio-vascular fitness are known to have negative effects on personality. “Furthermore,” Stephan’s team add, “smoking may alter the energetic capacities needed to maintain emotional stability, the tendency to be exploratory, cooperative and altruistic, self-disciplined and playful, and enthusiastic and active.”</p>
<p>A curious detail in the findings is that, unlike the US samples, differences in personality change were not found among smokers in Japan compared with non-smokers. The researchers said this result may be an extension of what has become known as the “Japanese smoking paradox” – the fact that even though smoking rates are higher in Japan than the US, rates of lung cancer and mortality risk are lower.</p>
<p>Overall, this new research represents “the largest and longest longitudinal examination of the association between smoking and personality change in adulthood,” the researchers said. The results suggest that the “deleterious effects of smoking may extend to detrimental personality changes,” they added.</p>
<p>However, and as the researchers acknowledge, this conclusion, while highly plausible, comes with a hefty caveat – the observational study design cannot prove that smoking causes personality change. It’s possible that another factor or factors, such as stressful life circumstances, both increase the likelihood of people taking up smoking and cause unwelcome long-term personality changes. It’s also possible that pre-existing personality dispositions drive both the uptake of smoking and the later trajectory of personality change over time.</p>
<p>Future research that collects more detailed baseline contextual data on participants may be able to test these possibilities. In the meantime, if you are ever tempted to take up smoking, it is worth considering that it is not just your health you are putting at risk, but quite likely also your personality.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The “learning style” myth – the idea that we each have a preferred modality for learning, usually described as visual, auditory or kinaesthetic – just won’t die. Belief in learning styles endures even though psychologists have pointed out repeatedly the many problems with the concept. Students <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/03/another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-learning-styles-students-did-not-benefit-from-studying-according-to-their-supposed-learning-style/">don’t benefit from learning in their supposedly preferred style</a>, for example, and teachers and their pupils <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/12/an-additional-reason-to-abandon-learning-styles-teachers-and-pupils-do-not-agree-on-the-pupils-preferred-learning-style/">don’t agree on the pupil’s learning style</a> in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But exactly how believers in learning styles conceive of the concept has until now remained unclear. It could be that people take an “essentialist” view that our learning style is something we are born with, for instance. On the other hand, they may believe that learning styles are more liable to change – a “non-essentialist” perspective. A new study in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/edu0000366">the Journal of Educational Psychology</a> has found that, in fact, both views are common, a result that could have implications for tackling the myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37366"></span></p>
<p>Shaylene Nancekivell and colleagues at the University of Michigan asked 331 adults who believed in learning styles to indicate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with 15 statements that laid out an essentialist view of the myth. These ranged from suggesting that learning styles are innate (e.g. “In the future, scientists will be able to determine a person’s learning style by examining their genes”) to implying that learning styles can predict success (e.g. “A person’s learning style predicts the kinds of teachers from whom they learn best”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall the participants’ responses were quite inconsistent: for example, they tended to agree that learning styles can be detected in childhood, but disagree that they are inherited from their parents. And the average rating for all statements fell almost exactly in the midpoint of the scale.</p>
<p>However, further analysis revealed two key subgroups hiding in the pool of participants. Based on patterns in their responses, the researchers identified one group they called “essentialisers”, who more strongly endorsed more of the statements, and another group of “non-essentialisers”.</p>
<p>The researchers then ran a second experiment to find out more about the beliefs of the two groups. Participants read a short story about a baby whose biological and adoptive parents had different learning styles (one set of parents were “visual” learners and the other “kinaesthetic”, for instance). The essentialisers indicated that the child was most likely to develop the learning style of their biological parents, while the non-essentialisers rated the learning style of the adoptive parents higher. Essentialisers were also more likely to believe statements relating learning styles to brain differences, such as “Brain imaging can be used to identify a person’s learning style.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These results suggest that people’s beliefs about learning styles vary much more than previous studies have recognised, the authors say. Some people appear to believe more strongly than others that learning styles are hard-wired in our brains and genes – and this could potentially make them more resistant to efforts to debunk the myth, the researchers suggest. “The present studies provide a new starting point for research on learning styles and suggest that future research on neuroscience-based myths needs to move beyond merely assessing the rate at which they are endorsed,” they write.</p>
<p>It would be useful to know whether certain individuals are predisposed to being essentialisers, but for now this remains unclear. Neither age, gender nor level of education predicted which participants were in which group. And most dishearteningly, the teachers who took part in this new research were just as likely to take an essentialist view of learning styles as the remaining participants. If essentialist views about learning styles really are more resistant to change, then understanding what makes a person think that way will be important for tackling the myth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Quelle est la part de l’inné et de l’acquis dans l’intelligence, ou plus généralement dans les facultés cognitives ? C’est une question très controversée, en particulier parce qu’elle a une grande portée politique : l’éducation est-elle importante, ou bien tout est-il prédéterminé par nos gènes ? Il est évident que dans le second cas, investir dans l’éducation semble vain ; il devrait plutôt s’agir de faire de la sélection et de l’orientation que de l’éducation.</p>
<p>Il existe une littérature scientifique abondante sur ce sujet, malheureusement ses résultats sont souvent mal interprétés et déformés par des idéologues. Prenons l’exemple d’une <a href="https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/les-profs-tombent-dans-le-piege-de-l-adn_2083387.html">récente tribune</a> de l’essayiste Laurent Alexandre dans l’Express :</p>
<p><em>« 64% de nos différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques ; l’école et la famille n’ont malheureusement qu’un rôle marginal face à nos chromosomes ».</em></p>
<p>Je vais supposer que la première assertion est correcte et bien établie scientifiquement. La conclusion est non seulement fausse, mais absurde. Revenons quelques siècles en arrière. Génétiquement, la population était sensiblement la même qu’aujourd’hui. Mais peu de gens apprenaient à lire, donc peu de gens savaient lire. Par conséquent, oui, l’éducation et la famille ont un rôle déterminant dans les capacités de lecture. Par ailleurs, si l’on avait fait la même étude sur la population de l’époque, on aurait trouvé non pas 64% mais une proportion bien plus faible de déterminisme génétique, puisque les capacités de lecture étaient en premier lieu déterminées par la possibilité d’apprendre à lire. Inversement, si l’éducation était la même pour toute, par exemple si on avait institué une école publique pour tous avec des programmes nationaux strictement appliqués de manière uniforme, eh bien on trouverait que très peu de différences de quoi que ce soit sont expliquées par l’éducation, puisque ce ne serait pas un facteur variable.</p>
<p>Une assertion du type « 64% des différences de capacité de lecture sont génétiques » est une mesure contextuelle, qui reflète en grande partie la variabilité de chacun des facteurs. En aucun cas elle n’indique un rôle causal faible pour l’éducation ou l’environnement familial. Elle peut tout aussi bien indiquer une certaine homogénéité de l’éducation reçue. Tout ce qu’elle indique, tout ce qu’indique cette littérature en général, c’est que les facultés cognitives sont influencées par des facteurs à la fois génétiques et environnementaux.</p>
<p>Etant donné que l’on ne sait pas lire spontanément mais uniquement après l’avoir appris, il faut une certaine dose d’aveuglement idéologique pour prétendre que l’école y joue un « rôle marginal ». Certes, il faut aussi avoir un cerveau pour pouvoir lire, d’où les facteurs génétiques. Par exemple, un ver de terre ne sait pas lire. Rien n’indique cependant que ces « 64% » de variation d’origine génétique concernent le cerveau. Il faut aussi des yeux pour pouvoir lire, par exemple. Des difficultés de lecture liés à un problème ophtalmologique d’origine génétique seront comptées dans ce total. De même, si (expérience de pensée) l’éducation des enfants étaient biaisée en fonction de facteurs physiques d’origine génétique, alors ce biais apparaîtrait également comme facteur génétique. Ce n’est sans doute pas ce que l’on veut dire par « facteur génétique des capacités de lecture », mais c’est quand même ce qui est mesuré.</p>
<p>La question qui a un intérêt politique, ce n’est pas : quelle part de la variabilité des capacités de lecture dans un contexte éducatif et socioculturel donné peut être expliqué par des variations génétiques (neurogénétiques ou non, purement biologiques ou conditionnés à des facteurs socioculturels) mais plutôt : dans quelle mesure améliorer l’éducation peut-il améliorer les capacités de lecture ? Pour répondre, on peut faire appel à l’histoire plutôt qu’à la génétique, et la conclusion est sans appel : historiquement, plus de gens ont su lire lorsqu’on leur a enseigné la lecture.</p>
<p>En résumé, oui l’éducation a un rôle majeur dans les capacités cognitives comme la lecture, et la science ne dit pas le contraire. Evidemment.</p>

<p>It usually helps to “get a fresh pair of eyes” on a problem, especially from someone with a different perspective than your own. But what if you could find a variety of vantage points from within yourself? After all, each of us has multiple roles and identities in life. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em>, a team led by Sarah Gaither at Duke University presents evidence that prompting children to think about their own multiple identities boosts their problem-solving skills and increases their flexible thinking.</p>
<p>“Someone can be a woman and White, a teacher and a parent, a girl and a friend,” the researchers write. “Although individuals may not automatically reflect on their multiple identities, here we propose that when they do, it may have positive consequences for their creative problem solving and flexible thinking.”</p>
<p><span id="more-37354"></span></p>
<p>In the first of three studies, Gaither and her team split 48 six- and seven-year-olds into two groups. One was the intervention group and these participants spent time reflecting briefly with a researcher about eight of their various social identities, such as “friend”, “girl” and “reader”. This process concluded with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you are lots of things at the same time.” The other group served as a control and these participants chatted briefly with a researcher about eight of their different physical attributes, such as having two feet and a mouth. Similar to the intervention condition, the control condition ended with the researcher saying “That is so cool that you have a lot of things at the same time.”</p>
<p>Afterwards all the children completed four different problem solving and flexible thinking challenges. One test involved them figuring out how a bear with a bowl of lego could reach honey in a high branch on a tree* (they were told that even stacked together the lego couldn’t reach). Another test involved coming up with novel uses for a gold box. The third involved categorising a collection of photos of 16 individuals in as many ways as possible. The last task involved an interaction with a puppet who made 16 claims about different pairs of items or individuals belonging to the same category, such as a dog and cat being the same kind of animal, or a male and female child being the same kind of person. When the child agreed the puppet was correct, this was taken as a sign of flexible thinking.</p>
<p>The findings were consistent, with the children who reflected on their multiple identities outperforming the children in the control condition on all four of the tests. For instance, half the children in the multiple identities condition solved the bear puzzle, compared with just 12.5 per cent of the control condition children; and the children agreed with the puppets’ broad-minded thinking over six times, on average, compared with under four times on average among the controls.</p>
<p>In two follow-up studies with dozens more children, the researchers showed that reflecting on another person’s multiple identities, as opposed to one’s own, did not have the same benefit; and that some of the performance gains associated with thinking about one’s own multiple identities were greater when these were phrased in a way that made them sound a stable part of the self rather than a transient preference – reflecting on being <em>a helper</em> rather than enjoying helping, for instance.</p>
<p>Past research with adults had already shown benefits to creative thinking of reflecting on one’s own different social identities. This new research builds on those findings by extending them to children, and showing that the benefits are limited to reflecting on one’s own social identities, as opposed to one’s physical attributes, or reflecting on the social identities of others. The new results also jibe with past research showing that travelling abroad and visiting other cultures can increase open-mindedness and creativity. It’s possible that reflecting on one’s own varied social identities helps to activate memories of diverse experiences and perspectives, thus helping trigger more flexible thinking – however, more research is needed to identify the precise mechanisms at play.</p>
<p>The idea that a short, simple intervention could have such seemingly dramatic effects will likely raise the eyebrows of more sceptical readers. Successful replication attempts with larger samples and diverse participants may help alleviate these doubts. Future research could also look into whether the multiple identities intervention would have greater benefits for individuals with more diverse social roles and experiences (for children raised in multicultural or multi-racial homes, for instance), and whether reflecting on social roles that one perceives negatively would still be beneficial.</p>
<p>“Our discovery suggests that anyone–regardless of their racial group or other social identification–may benefit from a multifaceted mindset,” the researchers said. “Something as simple as thinking about one’s identity from multiple angles could increase open-mindedness in a society that is becoming increasingly diverse.”</p>
<p>—<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12871">Thinking about multiple identities boosts children’s flexible thinking</a></p>
<p>*The answer is by emptying the bowl, inverting it and using it as a step to stand on and reach higher.</p>

In fact, she was drawn to Buddhist philosophy precisely <i>because </i>of its negation of self. In the doctrine of non-being (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta" target="_blank"><i>anātman</i></a>),  “there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul, or essence in living beings.” The tenet of emptiness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81" target="_blank"><i>śūnyatā</i></a>) <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> that “all things are empty [or void] of intrinsic existence”  <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">—</span></span> was problematic as well. When applied and interpreted incorrectly, <i>śūnyatā</i> and <i>anātman </i>can resemble or precipitate disorders of the self.<br /><br />Dr. Pickering noted: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>‘Eve’ is representative of a number of patients suffering both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization" target="_blank">derealisation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization" target="_blank">depersonalisation</a>. They doubt the existence of the outer world (derealisation) and fear that they do not exist. In place of a sense of self, they have but an empty core inside (depersonalisation).</i></blockquote><br />How do you find your way back to your <i>self</i> after that?

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/06/18/upcoming-arxiv-leadership-transition/">Upcoming arXiv Leadership Transition</a></h4>

<p>It has been almost ten years since I assumed the oversight of arXiv, as part of my Associate University Librarian responsibilities, with the charge of developing an organizational framework, governance model, sustainability plan, and roadmap for maintaining and developing this mission-critical resource. The arXiv leadership team believes that the service requires a full-time director as the operation continues to expand and as we register progress toward the much-needed technical architecture renewal process. I will be stepping down as arXiv Program Director in August and am pleased to announce that we’ve posted a full-time <a href="https://cornell.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/CornellCareerPage/job/Ithaca-Main-Campus/Executive-Director-of-arXiv_WDR-00019335-1">Executive Director</a> position to hire my successor. This is yet another important milestone since we <a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/arxiv-looks-future-move-cornell-cis">moved arXiv</a> from the Library to Computing and Information Science at Cornell in January 2019.</p>
<p>A year ago, I started a half-time position at <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/">Ithaka S+R</a> as Senior Advisor and am looking forward to making a full transition to research, writing, and strategic planning related to digital scholarship, open science, and preservation. So conceptually, I’ll not be that far away from arXiv and have opportunities to contribute to national and global initiatives to advance research and scholarship and build a sustainable infrastructure.</p>
<p>One of the most gratifying aspects of my arXiv affiliation over the years has been collaborating with the dedicated and supportive scientific and  scholarly communication communities. Working on arXiv has been an immensely gratifying, stimulating, and demanding role that has taught me a lot, especially about the importance of sociocultural and policy issues in scholarly communication and research. Throughout the years, I’ve benefited greatly from the advice and support from so many of you. I am grateful for having the opportunity to lead arXiv and look forward to watching it advance and innovate to serve the scientific community’s evolving needs.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>

<p>Loneliness <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/12/loneliness-is-a-disease-that-changes-the-brains-structure-and-function/">is a “disease”</a>, associated with an increased risk of death equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Strides have been made in understanding what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/20/different-kinds-of-loneliness-having-poor-quality-relationships-is-associated-with-a-greater-toll-than-having-too-few/">form of loneliness</a> is damaging<i> </i>(a lack of<i> close</i> relationships with other people, rather than a lack of relationships per se), but ways to tackle loneliness are badly needed. Now a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jfdgy/">new study</a>, available as a preprint on PsyArXiv, reveals a way in which loneliness seems to be maintained and, therefore, a potential route to an intervention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37348"></span></p>
<p>A popular model of loneliness holds that it is maintained by abnormal processing of the social signals – such as smiles and eye contact – that underlie positive social interactions. One consequence of this abnormal processing could be a failure to automatically mimic other people’s facial expressions – a phenomenon that occurs naturally during most social interactions. To investigate for the first time whether this is the case, Andrew Arnold and Piotr Winkielman at the University of California, San Diego conducted a small, preliminary study on 35 student volunteers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The students first completed three scales that measured their loneliness, depression and personality. Based on the loneliness results, they were classed as either lonely or not lonely. Next they had electrodes attached to two pairs of their own facial muscles important for generating emotional expressions – regions of the zygomaticus major (smiling) muscles in the cheeks, and also the corrugator supercilii (frowning) muscles in the brow. They were then shown video clips of men and women making facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Scales that they were given to complete showed that the lonely and non-lonely students were equally good at distinguishing between facial expressions, and there were no group differences in the strength of “negative emotion” ratings to anger, fear and sadness or “positive” ratings to joy. So the lonely people could recognise and understand emotional expressions just as well as the non-lonely group. However, there were important differences in how their <i>own</i> faces responded spontaneously to the video clips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When members of both groups saw videos of people displaying anger, for example, their own brows moved to automatically mimic this expression. But when the expression in the video was of joy, only the “non-lonely” group automatically smiled in response. The participants’ scores on depression and on extraversion bore no relation to this finding. It was loneliness that made the difference.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers checked that the lonely group could deliberately mimic smiles, as well as frowns (which they could). They also found that the lonely group smiled automatically while viewing “non-social” positive images (such as nature scenes) that also made the other group smile. These images didn’t include people (or if they did, their facial expressions weren’t obvious.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that a failure to mimic other people’s smiles automatically could be playing a role in loneliness. A failure to mimic a smile might send an antisocial signal to others, the researchers note, undermining social connections, and leading to social <i>dis</i>connect. “Indeed, this could be one behavioural mechanism that maintains chronic loneliness,” they add.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is a small study, and it can’t speak to the causal direction: does loneliness lead to a problem with smile mimicry or is it the other way around? But it does suggest a new target for addressing loneliness, and for further research into the role it might potentially play in real-world encounters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Given the serious problem of loneliness in society and its danger to health, more research on how it presents in everyday social interactions is useful for greater understanding of and treatment of the condition, ourselves and each other,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>My mother often says to me there’s no way she’d want to live to 100. And she may have a point.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good following longevity principles in an attempt to add years to your life, but what about the life <em>in </em>those years?</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally healthy?</h2>
<p>“There is certainly a myth out there that the older you get the sicker you become,” says Charlene Levitan who used to head up the Sydney Centenarian Sutdy.</p>
<p>The study has found centenarians usually remain in remarkably good health until extreme old age with their ill health compressed into the very end of life. Similarly, Blue Zones residents are unique not only because of their extended lifespan, but their long years lived free of disease and disability, what’s known as a long ‘health-span’.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7728367"><em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em></a> report of Jeanne Louise Calment’s health at age 118 is another example.</p>
<p>“The subject’s performance on tests of verbal memory and language fluency is comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal lobe functions are relatively spared and there is no evidence of depressive symptomatology or other functional illness.” wrote Karen Ritchie, a neurologist who examined Calment. “…It may be unreasonable to generalise from a single case study”, and Calment may be a “statistical outlier”, however, Calment is actually the norm.</p>
<p>As a group centenarians have a remarkable ability to sidestep the usual diseases and maladies of old age.</p>
<h2>The oldest people are Escapers, Delayers or Survivors of Disease</h2>
<p>Levitan explained to me that researcher have now identified three broad groups of centenarians:  Escapers, Delayers, and Survivors, so named because of the routes they’ve taken to avoid the major age-related diseases that kill off their peers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Escapers are those very lucky people who have managed to escape illness altogether, and are living till 100 with remarkably strong mental and physical capabilities.Then there are the Delayers who tend to delay any age-related illness until their late 80s. Finally, the Survivors are those people who have been diagnosed with an age-related disease such as cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, and so on. And yet, remarkably, they’ve survived.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another longevity project, the <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/">New England Centenarian Study</a> (NECS) found that for every five centenarians, one was an Escaper, two were Survivors and two were Delayers.</p>
<p>Even though men were far less likely reach 100 they were twice as likely to be Escapers than women. Men and women were equally likely to be Survivors or Delayers.</p>
<h2>Male centenarians to be healthier than their female counterparts.</h2>
<p>Whereas older women appear to be better able to cope and live <em>with</em> illness, older men appear to be more likely than women to die from potentially lethal illnesses.</p>
<p>It is likely that the men who are able to achieve very old age must be especially fit and delay or escape potentially lethal illnesses practically until their 100s.</p>
<p>Regardless of their age, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634289">research</a> indicates men experience a swifter decline to death with their poor health compressed into a very short space of time. For women, the trajectory from good health to death is often slower and filled with more doctor’s visits and frailty.</p>
<h2>Are the exceptionally old also exceptionally happy?</h2>
<p>In one sense, the extremely old become orphans of time. Extreme old age brings costs of survivorship and a thinned social landscape with the death of life partners and friends.</p>
<p>Physical health and strength typically decline and its harder o remember. This picture sounds depressing, yet, there is a paradox.</p>
<blockquote><p>The older you get the happier you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compared to middle age, extremely old folk’s emotional well-being, happiness and optimism is, on average, higher!</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409159"><em>The emotion paradox in the aging brain</em></a>, Mara Mather a gerontologist at USC Davis explains older adults are less physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than younger adults.</p>
<blockquote><p>When older adults experience interpersonal tensions, they engage less in destructive conflict strategies, such as yelling, arguing, or name calling, and generally find tense interpersonal situations less stressful than younger adults do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy older adults’ ability to roll with the punches is likely due to a number of factors, including wisdom, judgement, and experience, and age-related changes in the brain.</p>

This responsibility, once the domain of a company’s IT function, must be shared by all teams within organizations; scientific leadership, operations, legal and finance teams can all help mitigate risks of outsourced R&amp;D services management.</span></p><h2><strong>Five key factors make the shared responsibility necessary:</strong></h2><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Distributed, networked R&amp;D.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> R&amp;D studies are increasingly distributed across geographies, across multiple third party providers and subcontractors.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Large, electronically shared data sets. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data are being stored on multiple cloud-based platforms and transmitted electronically.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Public awareness. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While data disclosure events receive the most attention (because companies must publicly disclose data breaches), there is increased public awareness around other cyberattacks, such as ransomware attacks, phishing, and intellectual property theft.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>High dollar amounts of losses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> incurred following cyberattacks, with increasingly sophisticated and destructive attacks.

Likewise, in Europe, 91 companies have been fined for lapses in data privacy since the GDPR data privacy regulation took effect in May 2018.</span></li></ul></div>
