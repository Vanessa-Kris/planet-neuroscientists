            A remarkable and troubling new paper: Addressing reverse inference in psychiatric neuroimaging: Meta-analyses of task-related brain activation in common mental disorders



Icahn School of Medicine researchers Emma Sprooten and colleagues carried out an ambitious task: to pull together the results of every fMRI study which has compared task-related brain activation in people with a mental illness and healthy controls.

Sprooten et al.'s analysis included 537 studies with a total of 21,427

<p>During the ongoing “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">replication crisis</a>” in psychology, in which new attempts to reproduce previously published results have frequently failed, a common claim by the authors of the original work has been that those attempting a replication have lacked sufficient experimental expertise. Part of their argument, as explained recently by Shane Bench and his colleagues in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311630258X">the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em></a>, is that “just as master chess players and seasoned firefighters develop intuitive expertise that aids their decision making, seasoned experimenters may develop intuitive expertise that influences the ‘micro decisions’ they make about study selection … and data collection.”</p>
<p>To see if there really is any link between researcher expertise and the chances of replication success, Bench and his colleagues have analysed the results of the recent “Reproducibility Project” <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">in which 270 psychologists attempted to replicate 100 previous studies</a>, managing a success rate of less than 40 per cent. Bench’s team found that replication researcher team expertise, as measured by first and senior author’s number of prior publications, was indeed correlated with the size of effect obtained in the replication attempt, but there’s more to the story.</p>
<p><span id="more-16906"></span></p>
<p>The correlation between expertise and replication effect size would appear to at least partly vindicate the authors of original studies who have claimed that replication attempts have failed because replication researchers have lacked sufficient expertise. However, there is a twist because Bench and his colleagues also looked to see whether replication researcher expertise correlated with the <em>original</em> effect size found in the research they were attempting to replicate, and they found that it was.</p>
<p>What’s more, the link between replication researcher expertise and replication success evaporated when this other correlation (between replication researcher expertise and strength of the original finding) was taken into account. In other words, it seems that more experienced researchers are more likely to publish successful replications because they tend to choose more robust studies to replicate. Supporting this, there was also evidence that more experienced researchers tended to choose to replicate original studies that were less culturally sensitive, with more obviously generalisable results.</p>
<p>“The current results provocatively suggest” said Bench and his colleagues, “that expertise may not play a role in the execution of replication studies. Rather, expertise contributes to the ability to identify studies that are good candidates for replication.”</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the end of the issue. In the Reproducibility Project, replication teams did not have an entirely free choice of studies to replicate but chose from a pre-selection. It remains to be seen if researcher expertise will have the same relevance in other situations. Also, the current study used a fairly crude method of establishing researcher expertise (they looked at number of previous publications and whether they included data and experiments, but not at the direct relevance of the methods involved). For these reasons and more, Bench and his team admitted that “ironically, these results are themselves ripe for replication in order to truly understand the value of expertise in scientific research.”</p>

<p>Genome-scale models of metabolism (GEM) represent biochemical, genetic and genomic (BiGG) knowledge bases that can be utilised in a wide variety of theoretical and practical computational studies. These may range from the discovery of unidentified metabolic reactions, to the exploration of host/pathogen interactions. Recently, these models have been extended via the incorporation of additional biological information, such as protein structural information, thus giving birth to genome-scale models with protein structures (GEM-PRO).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8401" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="fig2" class="wp-image-8401 size-medium" height="119" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/fig2-300x119.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Brunk et al 2016</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>This article generates and applies the GEM-PRO methodology on two distinct organisms: <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Thermotoga maritima</em>. It is a multi-scale attempt that creates multiple links between genes (and their products), biochemical reactions and phenotypic functions, that are further enhanced by molecular-level information about individual proteins. Essentially, GEM-PRO lies at the intersection of systems biology and structural biology and offers insight into the physical embodiment of an organism’s genotype.</p>
<p>To aid in the understanding and further application of this methodology specific tutorials showing how protein-related information can be linked to genome-scale models and can be accessed in a public GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/SBRG/GEMPro/tree/master/GEMPro_recon/">https://github.com/SBRG/GEMPro/tree/master/GEMPro_recon/</a>).</p>

<p>Planarian flatworms have astonishing regenerative mechanisms in response to their environmental conditions and for that property they have been systematically studied for the past 100+ years. However, currently it is possible to trace their stem cell activity from the gene-level all the way to the organism-level, providing a unique opportunity for a ‘systems biology’ approach.</p>
<p>This article presents a nonlinear dynamical model of the flatworm’s stem cell system incorporating feedback control. It draws conclusions on the dynamics of the size, signaling systems and rates of mortality for the aforementioned animal and builds the foundations for a full conceptual framework for planarian cellular dynamics. Based on this model, the scientific community may begin to understand the mechanisms of cell migration during injury, the characterization of homeostatic levels of differentiated cells, as well as the associated stochastic effects.</p>

<p>The rapid advancement of high throughput technologies, along with the vast amounts of available ‘omics’ data, cultivate the ideal environment for a system-level investigation of pathologies. In this article, Calderone et al. showcase a state-of-the-art algorithm, termed ‘InfoMap’, which is able to exploit network community structures and is built upon network theory fundamentals.</p>
<p>It is applied to two age-related neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease, in order to identify similarities and differences in their respective network proteins and pathways. Significant insights are gained for both known and unknown processes, but particularly with regards to information about mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolism. The remarkable fact about this methodological approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of any pair of biological networks.</p>

<p>The term ‘reproducibility’ is a gray aspect for the computational biology community. Unfortunately, it is often (wrongly) open to interpretation and can have a spectrum of definitions. The authors of this study claim that the most basic form of reproducibility is <em>replicability</em>; the notion that “do other people get exactly the same results when doing exactly the same thing?” (i.e. method replicability). However, true <em>reproducibility</em> requires not only the method but also the phenomenon itself to be reproducible. Finally, when reproducing a software result the ultimate aim it to build on it, so researchers need to also consider the <em>extensibility</em> of their computational method.</p>
<p>The authors present case studies that provide insight on these three aspects. They argue that well-designed software needs to facilitate these aspects in order to ensure the value, quality and assurance of the presented computational work. Finally, specific checklists and recommendation lists are provided to guide researchers, developers and even the community towards improving and ensuring reproducibility in computational biology.</p>

<p>Reproducibility is certainly an issue when it comes to cancer research and that’s due to the heterogeneity of the disease. In biomarker discovery certain patterns of ‘omics’ data in one study may fail to be validated in another. In clinical terms, that can be attributed to a number of factors, ranging from the employed molecular methodology and the existing cancer data sets, all the way to the poorly modular patient diagnosis and the complex dynamics of cancer progression.</p>
<p>Fleck et al propose a novel systematic methodology to infer temporal sequence by integrating gene mutation with gene expression data. They are able to identify a set of mutation events that may eventually lead to changes in the gene expression. Furthermore, this model is specifically tested on both simulated and real breast cancer data from <a href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a>. Overall, by identifying the groups of genes that change during cancer progression this model may provide superior insight to the aforementioned heterogeneity of cancer, further address clinical questions or even improve the current therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>The ability to genetically mutate organisms has long been fantasized in the world of science fiction, perhaps the most famous example being the X-men franchise, where a genetic mutation can grant superhuman powers. While scientists have not yet unlocked the genetic code necessary for telekinesis, targeted genetic editing has existed since 1974 to probe and explore genetic functions. Manipulating protein levels and activities is a principal tool in understanding the functions and relationships of the molecular components in cells, but true genetic manipulation to produce a stable transgenic cell line or a true-breeding organism requires far more advanced molecular manipulation, and older techniques are hinder-some to the modern scientist in that they are time and labor intensive, requiring a scientist to screen though generations of organisms, as well as having advanced knowledge of molecular techniques.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0061-0"><strong>A straightforward and efficient method for screening for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts without selection</strong></a></p>
<p>The newest tool in the geneticist’s tool box makes use of the clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system, an endogenous adaptive immune system commonly used by bacteria and archaea to counteract “infection” by foreign DNA. This new method dramatically changes the field of molecular biology, and will allow scientists move forward with genetic experimentation in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>The type II CRISPR/Cas system from <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> appears to be particularly well suited for scientists performing genomic editing experiments for a simple reason: a single protein, Cas9, is required for crRNA binding and cleavage, and the RNA components have been engineered into a single guide RNA (sgRNA). Because of this, targeting of nearly any genomic sequence is possible with these two reagents in the cells of interest, and the creation of a knockout line depends solely on DNA cleavage by the Cas endonuclease followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of the site by the cell.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_8392" style="width: 727px;"><img class="wp-image-8392 size-full" height="197" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/CRISPR-Cas9_mode_of_action-1.png" title="Wikimedia commons" width="717" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">CRISPR-Cas9 mode of action (Wikimedia Commons, CC)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>When the CRISPR system completes the transfection process, a small, random deletion is often introduced at the repair site, which likely leads to a non-functional protein sequence that can be targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The Cas cleavage can also stimulate homology-driven repair based on a supplied DNA template, and allow for larger deletions or insertion of tags and markers, whereas older methods were unable or limited in doing so.</p>
<p>In their article <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0061-0">published</a> in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em>, Estep and colleagues describe an improved method for clonal screening without selection: using immunoblot analysis, the previous method of isolating clones by performing PCR to amplify DNA followed by sequencing or restriction digestion becomes obsolete. By screening directly for protein production, genetic knockout can be confirmed, and non-specific positive signals (false positives) unrelated to protein function can be avoided. The researchers successfully used this method to rapidly generate genomic mutants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0070-z"><strong>The regulation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay </strong></a></p>
<p>Scientists have made quite a few breakthroughs with regards to understanding the regulatory processes of mRNA this year. In an article <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0070-z">published</a> in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em>, Jin and colleges at Huazhong Agricultural University have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms employed for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the protein surveillance method that targets and breaks down non-functional mRNA</p>
<p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay clears cells of nonfunctional proteins by targeting mRNAs which contain a premature termination codon, which would otherwise be translated into a truncated protein sequence. The cellular mechanism involved in this system is not yet completely understood, though it is known that the transcription regulating protein UPF1 activates mRNA decay by recognizing abnormal translation, by using a protein complex which includes the SMG5 protein. When SMG5 is dephosphorylated it down-regulates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.</p>
<p>Jin and colleagues discovered that a microRNA, miR-433, can repress the expression of SMG5, and observed a suppression in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, presenting the possibility of new clinical treatments for various diseases which involve protein coding mutations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Noncoding microRNAs might just be coding for something after all </strong></p>
<p>The role of microRNA (very short non-coding sequences of RNA also known as miRNA) interactions within the cell is incompletely understood, and deciphering their role oftentimes requires a complex series of experiments to confirm their independent impact on cellular processes. While it is known that miRNA modulates approximately 60% of protein translation and degradation in humans, how this is accomplished is still very much a mystery.</p>
<p>One area of research that featured strongly in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em> in 2016 was the investigation of miRNA function in organ and tumor development.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0064-x">series of experiments</a> on mice, Bartram and co-workers at the University of Cologne showed that miRNAs that regulates Pax8 (a transcription factor involved in regulating the genes within the stem cells that ultimately develop into epithelial organs) are<a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0064-x"> also involved in hypothyroidism and end-stage renal failure</a>.</p>
<p>Li and colleagues from Chongqing Medical University performed a <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-015-0052-6">series of experiments</a> on human cervical tissue from cervical cancer patients and healthy controls and observed that miRNA-150 regulates the expression of FOXO4, a gene which regulates mitosis during the cell cycle and is <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-015-0052-6">found to increase with the progression of cervical cancer</a>. This new information present a new possible target for cancer treatment therapies.</p>
<p>Both of these studies highlight the important role miRNA plays in regulating multiple aspects of the cell cycle, and emphasize how incomplete our knowledge is of these highly important but often overlooked regulatory molecules. Increasingly, however, state of the art techniques are being used to catalogue miRNA abundance in different cell and tissue types. For example, in an article <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0057-9">published</a> in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em> earlier this year, Tonge and Gant at Keele University reported the global expression levels of all circulating miRNAs within the plasma of normal human subjects, greatly accelerating <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0057-9">future analysis of miRNA function in plasma</a>. By learning of the baseline expressions of human miRNAs, the researchers hope to use this library of over 500 miRNA signatures as baselines for biomarkers. miRNA biomarkers will be particularly useful for identifying organ or system specific protein deregulation or disease since miRNAs are highly specific in location and purpose.</p>
<p>These new discoveries in molecular biology are transforming modern genetics by allowing future genetic modeling and experimentation to be quickly and easily accomplished. Future studies will undoubtedly benefit from these new techniques and discoveries and build from them, allowing scientists to further broaden their horizons in understanding the finer details of our own species.</p>

<p>Our political leanings to the right or left reveal a fundamental aspect of our psyche: how much we’re drawn to stability and security versus change and uncertainty. This manifests in our attitudes and personality traits. For instance, on average, conservatives tend to prefer established hierarchy and are more conscientious. Liberals favour equality and are more open to new experiences. Now in the journal <em>Political Psychology</em> a group led by Aleksandra Cichocka at the University of Kent has <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12327/abstract?campaign=woletoc">extended this line of work</a> by showing the link between political orientation and desire for certainty is reflected at even the most basic of levels: how much we like to use nouns.</p>
<p>Across two initial studies, featuring Polish-speaking survey participants in Poland and Arabic-speaking participants in the Lebanon, the research showed that people with more socially conservative leanings tended to favour nouns over adjectives. For instance, participants with a conservative orientation were more likely to say they’d choose to end the sentence “Magda had no doubts about the success of her business. Magda …” with the noun phrase “is an optimist” than with the adjective phrase “is optimistic”.</p>
<p>This fits with the established link between having a conservative orientation and desiring stability because using a noun to describe someone implies more certainty and permanence about their state of being (past research has shown that even five-year-olds infer more permanence from noun descriptions than adjectival descriptions). Indeed, in the new surveys, the link between conservatism and noun preference seemed to be explained by participants’ relative “need for structure” with high scorers on this measure expressing a dislike of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Cichocka and her colleagues, including John Jost at New York University who is responsible for much of the research in this field, also analysed 101 key speeches delivered by 13 US Presidents, from Roosevelt’s Inaugural Address through to Obama’s State of the Union Address in 2014. They found speeches by Republican presidents featured a greater proportion of nouns compared with their Democrat counterparts.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers said their results “are compatible with previous work suggesting that language reflects, among other things, the individual’s goals and motives, including his or her political goals.”</p>

            Two new papers urge scientists to make research more reproducible.



First off, Russ Poldrack and colleagues writing in Nature Reviews Neuroscience discuss how to achieve transparent and reproducible neuroimaging research. Neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, are enormously powerful tools for neuroscientists but, Poldrack et al. say, they are at risk of "a ‘perfect storm’ of irreproducible results", driven by the "high dimensionality of fMRI data, the relatively low power of most fMRI

<p>Work is getting stale, and you’ve recently been courted by an exciting new company for a great role, the one drawback being a slight pay cut. Before you’ve made up your mind, your manager asks you whether you have plans to go elsewhere. If you wanted to avoid showing your hand, you could lie blatantly. You could change the topic. Or, you could palter: use a truthful statement to create a misleading impression.</p>
<p>“Financially, you’re treating me really well and I don’t think there’s anything out there that could match that.”</p>
<p>Paltering is the topic of a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-59847-001/">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. The authors, Todd Rogers and others at Harvard University, focused on negotiation situations, where access to accurate information had concrete consequences. They found that paltering is fairly common – real-life negotiators reported doing it more frequently then telling a lie, and as commonly as neglecting to share information – and that one reason for this is that they believed it wasn’t such a big deal as lying. In this, they were sadly mistaken.</p>
<p><span id="more-16859"></span></p>
<p>In one experiment, 130 participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website imagined trying to use eBay to sell a car with generally positive features but that sometimes mysteriously failed to start. When a prospective customer asked if there were any engine problems, the researchers told some participants to imagine that they parried the question by using a palter: emphasising the (true) fact that the car mostly ran very smoothly. Other participants were asked to play the role of the customer, and to imagine their feelings after discovering this deception post-purchase.</p>
<p>When asked to rate their own honesty in the negotiation, the seller participants rated themselves as 3.4, not too far below the mid-point on the 7-point rating scale. But the buyer participants rated the same transaction as significantly less honest, an average of just 2.5. This makes sense because unlike an outright liar, a palterer has recourse to the justification “I didn’t actually say anything untrue” to maintain their self-image as basically decent, but the victim has the same harsh experience of being deceived, regardless of the method. A follow-up study showed that people feel less comfortable paltering when responding to a direct question, conscious of the fact that their counterpart was explicitly seeking information that was then deliberately denied. But they felt that slipping in misdirection as part of a broader patter was easier to excuse.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at the material consequences of paltering as a form of deception, this time in a more complex negotiation with all participants acting as a seller and subjected to paltering by the buyer. The participants’ task was to sell a plot of land, the worth of which depended on whether it was to be used residentially or for (much more profitable) commercial use. A research assistant acted as a prospective buyer, and participants were encouraged to use part of the discussion to find out what the buyer would use the plot for. The buyer’s true aim was indeed commercial, and in one condition they openly admitted this in response to questioning. In another condition, the buyer overtly lied, claiming the use would be for residential building. And in a third key condition, the buyer paltered: emphasising the true fact that they had only been involved in residential developments to date.</p>
<p>Participants had to make a secret offer, hoping to get the highest sale price they could but knowing that it would be automatically rejected if it was beyond the buyer’s budget. When met with a lie or palter, participants made weaker, more tentative bids, and afterwards reported their suspicion that the buyer didn’t have the budget associated with a commercial bid. When the truth was revealed – the buyer had commercial plans and a big budget – participants judged both acts of deception as equally bad, expressing a disinclination to enter business relations with either type of dissembler in the future. Paltering paid off in the short term, but got punished.</p>
<p>Paltering then, is a form of deception that’s effective at actively leading other parties to false conclusions, just like straight-out lying. Perpetrators can enjoy a sense of plausible deniability, as the statements are technically true, but the harm they cause to their relationships is no less palpable.</p>

 Spliceosome rearrangements facilitated by RNA helicase Prp16 before catalytic step 2 of splicing are poorly understood. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human spliceosomal C complex stalled directly after Prp16 action (C*). The architecture of the catalytic U2-U6 RNP core of the human C* spliceosome is highly similar to that of the yeast pre-Prp16 C complex. However, in C* the branched intron region is separated (by ~20 Å) from the catalytic centre, and its position close to the U6 snRNA ACAGA box is stabilised by interactions with the Prp8 RNase H-like and Prp17 WD40 domains. RNA helicase Prp22 is located about 100 Å from the catalytic centre, suggesting that it destabilises the spliced mRNA after step 2 from a distance. Comparison of the structure of the yeast C and human C* complexes reveals numerous RNP rearrangements that are likely to be facilitated by Prp16, including a large-scale movement of the U2 snRNP.

 The spliceosome excises introns from pre-mRNAs in two sequential trans-esterifications – branching and exon ligation1 – catalysed at a single catalytic metal site in U6 snRNA2,3. The recent structures of the spliceosomal C complex4,5 with the cleaved 5’-exon and lariat—3’-exon bound to the catalytic centre revealed that branching-specific factors such as Cwc25 lock the branch helix into position for nucleophilic attack of the branch adenosine at the 5’-splice site. Furthermore, the ATPase Prp16 is positioned to bind and translocate the intron downstream of the branch point to destabilize branching-specific factors and release the branch helix from the active site4. Here we present the 3.8 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome stalled after Prp16-mediated remodelling but prior to exon ligation. While the U6 snRNA catalytic core remains firmly held in the active site cavity of Prp8 by proteins common to both steps, the branch helix has rotated by 75 degrees compared to complex C and is stabilized into a new position by Prp17, Cef1, and the reoriented Prp8 RNaseH domain. This rotation of the branch helix removes the branch adenosine from the catalytic core, creates a space for 3’-exon docking, and restructures the pairing of the 5’-splice site with the U6 snRNA ACAGAGA region. Slu7 and Prp18, which promote exon ligation, bind together to the Prp8 RNaseH domain. The ATPase Prp22, bound to Prp8 in place of Prp16, could interact with the 3’-exon, suggesting a possible basis for mRNA release after exon ligation6,7. Together with the C complex structure4, our new C* complex structure reveals the two major conformations of the spliceosome during the catalytic stages of splicing.

            <p>Quality control mechanisms intervene appropriately when defective translation events occur, in order to preserve the integrity of protein synthesis. Rescue of ribosomes translating on messenger RNAs that lack stop codons is one of the co-translational quality control pathways. In many bacteria, ArfA recognizes stalled ribosomes and recruits the release factor RF2, which catalyses the termination of protein synthesis. Although an induced-fit mechanism of nonstop mRNA surveillance mediated by ArfA and RF2 has been reported, the molecular interaction between ArfA and RF2 in the ribosome that is responsible for the mechanism is unknown. Here we report an electron cryo-microscopy structure of ArfA and RF2 in complex with the 70S ribosome bound to a nonstop mRNA. The structure, which is consistent with our kinetic and biochemical data, reveals the molecular interactions that enable ArfA to specifically recruit RF2, not RF1, into the ribosome and to enable RF2 to release the truncated protein product in this co-translational quality control pathway. The positively charged C-terminal domain of ArfA anchors in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome. Furthermore, binding of ArfA and RF2 induces conformational changes in the ribosomal decoding centre that are similar to those seen in other protein-involved decoding processes. Specific interactions between residues in the N-terminal domain of ArfA and RF2 help RF2 to adopt a catalytically competent conformation for peptide release. Our findings provide a framework for understanding recognition of the translational state of the ribosome by new proteins, and expand our knowledge of the decoding potential of the ribosome.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21053">doi: 10.1038/nature21053</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/rqgQ2n-Uk8Q" width="1" />

 We are just beginning to understand how translational control affects tumour initiation and malignancy. Here we use an epidermis-specific, in vivo ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape during the transition from normal homeostasis to malignancy. Using a mouse model of inducible SOX2, which is broadly expressed in oncogenic RAS-associated cancers, we show that despite widespread reductions in translation and protein synthesis, certain oncogenic mRNAs are spared. During tumour initiation, the translational apparatus is redirected towards unconventional upstream initiation sites, enhancing the translational efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA interference screen of translational regulators revealed that depletion of conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse effects on normal but not oncogenic growth. Conversely, the alternative initiation factor eIF2A is essential for cancer progression, during which it mediates initiation at these upstream sites, differentially skewing translation and protein expression. Our findings unveil a role for the translation of 5′ untranslated regions in cancer, and expose new targets for therapeutic intervention.

 Picornaviruses are a leading cause of human and veterinary infections that result in various diseases, including polio and the common cold. As archetypical non-enveloped viruses, their biology has been extensively studied. Although a range of different cell-surface receptors are bound by different picornaviruses, it is unclear whether common host factors are needed for them to reach the cytoplasm. Using genome-wide haploid genetic screens, here we identify the lipid-modifying enzyme PLA2G16 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) as a picornavirus host factor that is required for a previously unknown event in the viral life cycle. We find that PLA2G16 functions early during infection, enabling virion-mediated genome delivery into the cytoplasm, but not in any virion-assigned step, such as cell binding, endosomal trafficking or pore formation. To resolve this paradox, we screened for suppressors of the ΔPLA2G16 phenotype and identified a mechanism previously implicated in the clearance of intracellular bacteria. The sensor of this mechanism, galectin-8 (encoded by LGALS8), detects permeated endosomes and marks them for autophagic degradation, whereas PLA2G16 facilitates viral genome translocation and prevents clearance. This study uncovers two competing processes triggered by virus entry: activation of a pore-activated clearance pathway and recruitment of a phospholipase to enable genome release.

 The origin and cellular complexity of eukaryotes represent a major enigma in biology. Current data support scenarios in which an archaeal host cell and an alphaproteobacterial (mitochondrial) endosymbiont merged together, resulting in the first eukaryotic cell. The host cell is related to Lokiarchaeota, an archaeal phylum with many eukaryotic features. The emergence of the structural complexity that characterizes eukaryotic cells remains unclear. Here we describe the ‘Asgard’ superphylum, a group of uncultivated archaea that, as well as Lokiarchaeota, includes Thor-, Odin- and Heimdallarchaeota. Asgard archaea affiliate with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses, and their genomes are enriched for proteins formerly considered specific to eukaryotes. Notably, thorarchaeal genomes encode several homologues of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery components, including Sec23/24 and TRAPP domains. Furthermore, we identify thorarchaeal proteins with similar features to eukaryotic coat proteins involved in vesicle biogenesis. Our results expand the known repertoire of ‘eukaryote-specific’ proteins in Archaea, indicating that the archaeal host cell already contained many key components that govern eukaryotic cellular complexity.

 The human large intestine is populated by a high density of microorganisms, collectively termed the colonic microbiota, which has an important role in human health and nutrition. The survival of microbiota members from the dominant Gram-negative phylum Bacteroidetes depends on their ability to degrade dietary glycans that cannot be metabolized by the host. The genes encoding proteins involved in the degradation of specific glycans are organized into co-regulated polysaccharide utilization loci, with the archetypal locus sus (for starch utilisation system) encoding seven proteins, SusA–SusG. Glycan degradation mainly occurs intracellularly and depends on the import of oligosaccharides by an outer membrane protein complex composed of an extracellular SusD-like lipoprotein and an integral membrane SusC-like TonB-dependent transporter. The presence of the partner SusD-like lipoprotein is the major feature that distinguishes SusC-like proteins from previously characterized TonB-dependent transporters. Many sequenced gut Bacteroides spp. encode over 100 SusCD pairs, of which the majority have unknown functions and substrate specificities. The mechanism by which extracellular substrate binding by SusD proteins is coupled to outer membrane passage through their cognate SusC transporter is unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of two functionally distinct SusCD complexes purified from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and derive a general model for substrate translocation. The SusC transporters form homodimers, with each β-barrel protomer tightly capped by SusD. Ligands are bound at the SusC–SusD interface in a large solvent-excluded cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations and single-channel electrophysiology reveal a ‘pedal bin’ mechanism, in which SusD moves away from SusC in a hinge-like fashion in the absence of ligand to expose the substrate-binding site to the extracellular milieu. These data provide mechanistic insights into outer membrane nutrient import by members of the microbiota, an area of major importance for understanding human–microbiota symbiosis.

            <p>Oligomerization of membrane proteins in response to lipid binding has a critical role in many cell-signalling pathways but is often difficult to define or predict. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry platform to determine simultaneously the presence of interfacial lipids and oligomeric stability and to uncover how lipids act as key regulators of membrane-protein association. Evaluation of oligomeric strength for a dataset of 125 α-helical oligomeric membrane proteins reveals an absence of interfacial lipids in the mass spectra of 12 membrane proteins with high oligomeric stability. For the bacterial homologue of the eukaryotic biogenic transporters (LeuT, one of the proteins with the lowest oligomeric stability), we found a precise cohort of lipids within the dimer interface. Delipidation, mutation of lipid-binding sites or expression in cardiolipin-deficient Escherichia coli abrogated dimer formation. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that cardiolipin acts as a bidentate ligand, bridging across subunits. Subsequently, we show that for the Vibrio splendidus sugar transporter SemiSWEET, another protein with low oligomeric stability, cardiolipin shifts the equilibrium from monomer to functional dimer. We hypothesized that lipids are essential for dimerization of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from E. coli, which has the lowest oligomeric strength, but not for the substantially more stable homologous Thermus thermophilus protein NapA. We found that lipid binding is obligatory for dimerization of NhaA, whereas NapA has adapted to form an interface that is stable without lipids. Overall, by correlating interfacial strength with the presence of interfacial lipids, we provide a rationale for understanding the role of lipids in both transient and stable interactions within a range of α-helical membrane proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors.</p><p>Nature  1 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20820">doi: 10.1038/nature20820</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/tqAHMTxX-iE" width="1" />

 As malignant tumours develop, they interact intimately with their microenvironment and can activate autophagy, a catabolic process which provides nutrients during starvation. How tumours regulate autophagy in vivo and whether autophagy affects tumour growth is controversial. Here we demonstrate, using a well characterized Drosophila melanogaster malignant tumour model, that non-cell-autonomous autophagy is induced both in the tumour microenvironment and systemically in distant tissues. Tumour growth can be pharmacologically restrained using autophagy inhibitors, and early-stage tumour growth and invasion are genetically dependent on autophagy within the local tumour microenvironment. Induction of autophagy is mediated by Drosophila tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6-like signalling from metabolically stressed tumour cells, whereas tumour growth depends on active amino acid transport. We show that dormant growth-impaired tumours from autophagy-deficient animals reactivate tumorous growth when transplanted into autophagy-proficient hosts. We conclude that transformed cells engage surrounding normal cells as active and essential microenvironmental contributors to early tumour growth through nutrient-generating autophagy.

 Hyoliths are abundant and globally distributed ‘shelly’ fossils that appear early in the Cambrian period and can be found throughout the 280 million year span of Palaeozoic strata. The ecological and evolutionary importance of this group has remained unresolved, largely because of their poorly constrained soft anatomy and idiosyncratic scleritome, which comprises an operculum, a conical shell and, in some taxa, a pair of lateral spines (helens). Since their first description over 175 years ago, hyoliths have most often been regarded as incertae sedis, related to molluscs or assigned to their own phylum. Here we examine over 1,500 specimens of the mid-Cambrian hyolith Haplophrentis from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale Lagerstätten. We reconstruct Haplophrentis as a semi-sessile, epibenthic suspension feeder that could use its helens to elevate its tubular body above the sea floor. Exceptionally preserved soft tissues include an extendable, gullwing-shaped, tentacle-bearing organ surrounding a central mouth, which we interpret as a lophophore, and a U-shaped digestive tract ending in a dorsolateral anus. Together with opposing bilateral sclerites and a deep ventral visceral cavity, these features indicate an affinity with the lophophorates (brachiopods, phoronids and tommotiids), substantially increasing the morphological disparity of this prominent group.

            <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/795530330052493312">recently reported</a> that <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/14/037549">one of my papers</a> has been rejected by PLoS Computational Biology after 10 months and 4 revisions, on the ground of general interest. This has generated a little buzz. A colleague mentioned it on his blog. As a result, the editor of my paper contacted him directly to tell his version of the story, which my colleague has now <a href="https://medium.com/@drmdhumphries/thats-another-fine-mess-you-ve-got-us-into-peer-review-b75a9aa11034">reported on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the editor’s story is “misleading”, to be polite. It is a shame that the review process is confidential, as it allows the journal to hide what actually happens behind their closed doors. Nevertheless, I have asked the journal for the authorization to publish the content of my appeal and their response, where I explain what happened in more detail (and more accurately). They have accepted. I have removed names of the persons involved. This illustrates one of the flaws of the current peer-review system (see <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/my-new-year-resolution-to-help-move-science-to-the-post-journal-world/">this post</a> for how it could work better).</p>
<p>(Just one note: the editor has apparently told my colleague that the third reviewer was a collaborator, so they could not take into account his review. Well, that’s a lie. I know because he chose to sign his review. The "collaboration" was the scientist sending me published data.)</p>
<p>So here it is.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<p>Re: Manuscript PCOMPBIOL-D-16-00007R4</p>
<p>So after 10 months and 4 revisions, our paper has been rejected, following the recommendation of one reviewer, because it is not considered of broad enough interest. I quote from the final editorial message: “We regret that the specific hypothesis that your manuscript is geared to dispute does not reach that level of general interest.”.</p>
<p>These facts being recalled, it should be obvious enough that the editorial process has gone very wrong. There were no more technical criticisms already after revision 2, on July 8th, 4 months ago, and the paper should have been accepted then. I have repeatedly asked the editors to explain why we were required to justify novelty and significance after having been required to do so much work on technical aspects. But the editors have refused to answer this simple query. Frankly, I was expecting a bit more respect for the authors that make this journal, and I do not think that explaining the journal’s policy and the decisions is so much to ask. All I know is Michael Eisen’s view, founding editor of this journal, who has cared to comment “I agree - a paper going out for review should mean it is of interest”.</p>
<p>This editorial process has gone beyond anything I have ever witnessed in my career in terms of absurdity and waste. Why scientists (“peers”) would voluntarily make each other’s life so unnecessarily hard instead of cooperating and debating is beyond my understanding. In the end it appears that the ego of one (important?) reviewer matters more than science, and that is very sad. This being said, I have been notified that appeals are only considered when “a) a reviewer or editor is thought to have made a significant factual error” or “b) his/her objectivity is compromised by a documented competing interest”, and since bureaucracy apparently beats reason and ethics, I will now explain how this applies.</p>
<p>I have already explained at length the factual errors of the first reviewer, who is apparently the only one that is trusted by the editors. This editorial message repeats some of them (no, we are not criticizing simulation results of a particular model, but the biophysical interpretation (what goes on physically), and we did so in several state-of-the-art biophysical models, not one). I will therefore focus on case (b), and attach my previous letter to the editors for reference; please also read the responses to reviewers as regards case (a), in particular to reviewer-editor Dr. YYY who has unfortunately not cared to reply to our point-by-point response that he had required from us. The editorial decisions that have led to rejecting the paper on the basis of general interest after 10 months are so bizarre that I am compelled to question senior editor Dr. YYY’s objectivity – I presume that Dr. XXX, who sent the paper for review in the first place, does consider the paper of interest. The sequence of facts speaks for itself:</p>
<p>- On June 6th (revision #2), the editorial message reads “We understand that Reviewer 2 was very enthusiastic, and Reviewer 3 had relatively minor comments, but we both stress that addressing Reviewer 1's reservations are essential. Indeed, it is only fair to say that it seems to us that it will be challenging to address these comments in the context of the presented results.”. The exclusive reliance on one reviewer and the presumption that we could not address the comments is rather surprising. Nonetheless, the editorial message that followed was exclusively about the match with experimental data, not about interest (“the reviewer's point about (apparently) unrealistic voltage dependencies of the currents […]”). We did successfully address these comments, pointing out that the reviewer had made factual errors (such as misreading the figure he was commenting, and discussing the results of an experimental paper he had not opened).</p>
<p>- On July 8th (revision #3), the editorial message was now asking to explain the novelty compared to what we had done in the past (and published in the same journal), blindly following the 3-sentence report of reviewer #1, and making no mention whatsoever to the fact that we had just answered the major (and flawed) criticisms on experimental observations, which constituted the previous editorial message. At this point we complained that we were asked to justify the novelty of our study 7 months after submission, especially when it was explicit in the introduction; nonetheless, we complied and explained again.</p>
<p>- On August 25th (revision #4), we were appalled to read that, instead of finally accepting the paper, senior editor Dr. YYY decided to nominate himself as a reviewer, admitting that “the latest revision is first one he has had the chance to read”. The report was not an assessment of the novelty of the paper, as would have been logical since this was what the previous editorial message was about. Instead, it was a 6 pages long report full of technical queries, making negative criticisms that, for most of them, had already been addressed in previous reports, and asking for substantial modifications of the paper.</p>
<p>- At this point, I replied to the editorial message and obtained no response; as the message stated “If you would like to discuss anything, please don't hesitate to contact either of us directly”, I emailed Dr. YYY, and he started his response as follows: “To answer your email, allow me to be brief, because this sort of exchange should really be going through the journal, and indeed that will be the case from now on.”. Nonetheless, we exchanged a few emails, in which he offered no explanation; in the end we agreed that I would write a point-by-point response to his six-page review, but not modify the paper. I submitted it, together with a response to the first reviewer, and a letter to the editors, on September 22nd.</p>
<p>- Three weeks later, on October 10th, I received a message where I was asked to edit the letter so that it could be passed on to the reviewers. Apparently the editors had not noticed the response to reviewers. It still took them three weeks to read a letter, which, considering the history of this paper, does not strike me as very respectful. I complained to Dr. YYY, who replied “We believe that you have been adequately notified by the PLoS administrative team concerning the status of your revision.”. I had to exchange several emails with Dr. XXX who realized the error. I received no apology from Dr. YYY.</p>
<p>- On November 11th, I received the reject decision, together with the response of reviewer #1 and, oddly enough, of reviewer #3 to which I had not replied (since there was no remaining comment). He also was surprised, since he wrote “I don’t have the expertise, authority or, honestly, the time to judge whether the new comments from Reviewers 1 &amp; 4 are fair, or whether the authors’ responses have fully addressed them – this is clearly a job for the Editors (although hopefully not for the Editor who just became a Reviewer)”. But, editor-reviewer #4 Dr. YYY did not bother replying to my point-by-point response, which he had explicitly required.</p>
<p>- The final decision comes with excuses that are frankly hard to swallow. One is that the editors had failed to see the word “models” in the title. In 10 months and 4 revisions! Who can seriously believe that? And yes, the paper is about models – it is a computational biology journal (note that we have also successfully related the models to experimental observations, on request of the editors). The other excuse is that an anonymous reviewer (reviewer #2) had a conflict of interest and his reviews had to be dismissed. I am of course fine with that decision (let me simply state for the record that none of reviewers I have suggested are in such a position). But this happened in April, more than 6 months ago. Quite appropriately, the editor Dr. XXX asked for another reviewer who identified himself (Dr. ZZZ). Dr. ZZZ wrote a positive review, and in addition he read our responses to the other reviewers and wrote “the revisions of the manuscript in response to the other reviewers' comments seem entirely appropriate.”. At this point, given that no objection had been raised by any reviewer or editor on methods, results or clarity, the paper should have been accepted. Instead, the editors decided to follow a nonsensical comment from reviewer #1 alone: “unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists”, which was not even consistent with his/her own first positive assessment (“this is an interesting paper”). Given that Dr. XXX sent the paper for review in the first place, this decision must originate from Dr. YYY (who at this point had not read the paper, by his own admission). I am compelled to conclude that Dr. YYY has not been objective, and in fact has been actively blocking our paper. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I witness the questionable attitude of Dr. YYY, as he has recently been a reviewer for an essay I wrote. The review process was extremely long, went over multiple rounds with massive lists of requests, where Dr. YYY basically wanted to rewrite the text to follow his own views and style. During the review process, Dr. YYY contacted me directly by email to discuss the paper, going so far as asking for co-authorship (“Indeed, the level of suggestions are approaching collaboration on this paper- something I would be happy with but I assume is not what you have in mind.”). In the same email, and while the review process was not over, he asked me for an experimental collaboration – which of course I have not followed up. I had to ask the editor to intervene to stop the madness – which he did: “Indeed your paper has been unduly delayed and I have asked the reviewer to answer me within 24 hours.”. I apologize for disclosing these email excerpts, but I have no other choice since I am asked to provide documentation. It is clear that, had I imagined that Dr. YYY could be chosen as a reviewer (which seemed unlikely given his recent track record), I would have opposed him. But I did not anticipate that he would nominate himself, or overthrow the editor’s decision without even reading my paper (by his own admission).</p>
<p>Therefore, I am asking that Dr. YYY is replaced by a new senior editor with a more reasonable attitude.</p>
<p>As far as I can see: 1) the three reviewers were initially positive on the interest of the paper; 2) the editor Dr. XXX, who as far as I can tell is the only scientist involved in this process who is a member of the computational biology community, supported our paper since he sent it for review; 3) one reviewer, who seems to be an experimental electrophysiologist (unfortunately he or she has decided to remain anonymous), reverted his subjective opinion on the paper’s interest after we have pointed out the errors in his/her report, and even then, still judged the paper interesting for the computational neuroscience community. I have failed to see to how the decision is “not trivial to reach”.</p>

<p>Attached: Letter to the editors from September 16th</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Letter to the editors, September 16th</strong></p>
<p>Dear Editors,</p>
<p>In the previous revision, I raised serious objections regarding the abusive attitude of reviewer #1. These objections have apparently been completely dismissed, but what I have been most disappointed about is the total lack of response to these objections. I am writing this letter in the hope that this time it will be given some consideration.</p>
<p>This manuscript has been submitted 8 months ago. This is the fourth major revision that we have been asked to make. The responses are now totaling more than 25 pages, much longer than the article itself. We have now entered a phase where a large part of the responses consist in citing previous revisions where the issues have already been addressed. This revision reaches a new level, where a fourth reviewer is added and repeats mostly questions that we have already answered in previous revisions. Why a fourth reviewer is considered necessary after 8 months of revision is not clear, when none of the three reviewers has raised any serious concern.</p>
<p>I have officially asked a detailed explanation for this peculiar decision. The only response I have obtained so far is that there was “a tie” between “conflicting reviews”. So apparently the editorial decision has been based on a vote between reviewers. This is yet what I read on the journal’s website:</p>
<p><i>If reviewers appear to disagree fundamentally, the editors may choose to share all the reviews with each of the reviewers and by this means elicit additional comment that may help the editors to make a decision. That said, decisions are not necessarily made according to majority rule. Instead, the editors evaluate the recommendations and comments of the reviewers alongside comments by the authors and material that may not have been made available to those reviewers. </i></p>
<p>If one followed this process, then one would realize that:</p>
<p>- None of the three reviewers has any remaining objection about results, methods, or clarity of the text.</p>
<p>- Reviewer #2 and #3 have an overall very positive assessment of the paper and in particular of its interest. Rev #2: “This is a great revision. The authors have clarified and addressed all my previous concerns. […] I strongly believe the study is publishable as it stands”; Rev# 3: “This is a very clear and logically presented manuscript dealing with a key question in fundamental cellular neuroscience”.</p>
<p>- On his/her first report, reviewer #1 also made a positive assessment of the paper and of its interest: “This is a clearly written manuscript that addresses an interesting question regarding the nature of spike initiation. Specifically, the authors propose a plausible explanation […] This is an interesting paper.”.</p>
<p>- After two rounds of technical revisions, in which we pointed out the reviewer’s errors and to which no objection has been made, reviewer #1 changed his mood and now concludes, without any argument: “unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists” (sic).</p>
<p>- Reviewer #3 has read our responses to the two other reviewers and concluded: “the revisions of the manuscript in response to the other reviewers' comments seem entirely appropriate.” From these facts, it appears clearly that there are in fact 3 convergent reviews. All 3 reviewers have concluded that results and methods are rigorous and the text is well written. All 3 reviewers have found the paper interesting. It might be that reviewer #1 has “voted” negatively; however I would expect the editorial decision to be based on the content of reviews and responses, which in this case is convergent, and not on the mood of one reviewer, which in this case is inconsistent between the reports. It is my understanding that an editorial decision should be based on arguments and facts, not on the reviewer’s emotions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have replied in detail, again, to all criticisms. We have pointed out in particular the factual errors of reviewer #1. To help the editors, we have underlined the important points. We would appreciate if the editors checked for themselves whether reviewer #1 is right or not. We have also replied to reviewer/senior editor Dr YYY, although I deeply regret that this fourth version is “the first one he has had the chance to read”.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to call your attention on the conclusion of reviewer #1, on which his/her recommendation is based, which requires in my opinion a clarification from the journal: “Finally, now in their third revision, the authors acknowledge that this work strongly builds on the previous resistive-coupling hypothesis, and tests whether this hypothesis is compatible with sharp spike onset (a view they have already proposed), vs the alternative proposed by Yu, of back propagation. This very specific theoretical result I feel is unlikely to be of broad interest to the computational biology field, but could be of interest to computational neuroscientists” (Please see also our response, pointing out that the said acknowledgement was clear already in the very first version.)</p>
<p>This recommendation makes some important presumptions about this journal’s editorial views. Therefore I would very much like to know if this journal:</p>
<p>- also considers that proposing a hypothesis is more important than testing one, and that only the former should be published;</p>
<p>- considers that interesting computational neuroscience studies do not belong to this journal. I would also very much like to know if this journal considers that it is ok for a reviewer to ask for substantial technical revisions when he/she has already decided that the paper should not be published anyway. This has been indeed a lot of work for a decision ultimately based on the mood of one reviewer.</p>
<p>As I have argued in this letter, it is very clear that, given the content of the reports of the 3 reviewers and of our responses, this manuscript should have been accepted already. After 8 months and 4 revisions, and no serious objection on the manuscript, I can only hope very much that this journal does not confuse rigorous peer review with author harassment.</p>
<p>Again, I am hoping that this letter will be seriously taken into consideration, and even perhaps responded to.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Romain Brette</p>

<p><strong>Response of the editors-in-chief</strong></p>
<p>Dear Dr. Brette,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response to the recent decision on your paper “The Basis of Sharp Spike Onset in Standard Biophysical Models”. The manuscript and your appeal letter have been carefully evaluated by Dr. XXX and the journal’s Editors-in-Chief.</p>
<p>We understand your frustration regarding the length and complexity of the review process, and we would like to apologize for the time taken to reach a final decision.</p>
<p>We would like to provide some further clarification on how the editorial decision was reached. The manuscript addresses the issue - how do cortical neuronal action potentials rise so sharply? – and after an initial evaluation, Dr. XXX found it interesting enough to merit sending out for review, so that the reviewers could assess the technical solidity of the work and the conceptual advance proposed. The paper received mixed reviews, and hence merited a revision. After several rounds of revision, Reviewer 1 remained unconvinced. In order to aid the review process, Dr. YYY volunteered to evaluate the paper in depth, and his opinion concurred with that of Reviewer 1. Dr. XXX also re-read the paper and came to the conclusion that this manuscript is critically close conceptually to the previous PLOS publications - in fact the idea was laid out clearly and beautifully in the 2013 and 2015 PLOS papers. The present manuscript is an implementation of this idea, showing that other biophysically realistic models used to examine the spike sharpness issue show the mechanism that was suggested in the 2013 and 2015 PLOS papers.</p>
<p>We regret that this did not become fully clear before the third revision, and we understand your disappointment with the final outcome.</p>
<p>However, we agree that the findings of the paper are not significant enough for PLOS Computational Biology, and we will not be reconsidering the paper. We are sorry not to be more encouraging, but we hope that you can understand the reasons for this decision.</p>

            <img alt="A microsite and material found in a microsite" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Cullen-BMC_Blog-microsite_image-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>When we think about the distributions and community ecology of terrestrial vertebrates today, we generally find that large-bodied species (e.g. deer, bison, caribou, wolves) tend to be found across a very large area. White-tailed deer, for example, are found from Central America to southern Canada. Another example is the grey wolf, which historically ranged throughout most of North America, Asia, and Europe, from the high arctic to the sub-tropics. These broad distributions suggest a tolerance to environmental differences on the part of large-bodied species.</p>
<p>An interesting and perplexing pattern in the palaeoecological record is that large-bodied dinosaurs, at least in the Cretaceous of North America, do not appear to have followed this trend of very broad distributions. During this time, North America was often bisected by a large shallow sea (the Western Interior Seaway), and dinosaurs in western North America lived on a relatively narrow strip of land (sometimes referred to as Laramidia).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8158" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Paleogeography of North America during the Late Cretaceous (∼75 Ma)" class="wp-image-8158 size-large" height="786" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/journal.pone_.0012292.g001-834x1024.png" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Paleogeography of North America during the Late Cretaceous (∼75 Ma)</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Sampson et al. 2010. PLoS ONE 5(9): e12292</div></figure>
<p>A long-standing explanation for the high diversity of dinosaurs across this relatively small landmass is that they were highly sensitive to environmental differences (particularly distance from the sea), and as a result different large-bodied species would share non-overlapping ranges despite sometimes being found less than a few hundred kilometres apart.</p>
<p>Our goal was to test this hypothesis of dinosaur environmental sensitivity. We wanted to see if in two environmentally different, but time equivalent settings, dinosaurs showed ecologically distinct trends in occurrence and abundance. To do this, we needed to show what the overall pattern in vertebrate community structure was in these two settings, and in the broader context of environmental change over time in this region.</p>
<p>We collected data from dozens of vertebrate microfossil sites (or microsites for short). Microsites are concentrations of small vertebrate fossils representing a palaeocommunity from a short time interval, and are <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/origins-of-microfossil-bonebeds-insights-from-the-upper-cretaceous-judith-river-formation-of-north-central-montana/06F4B6D9881C06B6D98EBC94F5C43C04">thought to have formed in low energy ponds and rivers</a>, acting as sink for material from the region. The relative abundance of different groups can be counted and compared between sites to identify how the community is changing temporally, geographically, and environmentally.</p>
<p>All of the microsites we analyzed were collected from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, in two geographically distinct sampling areas, and all from a geological unit called the <a href="http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/e93-016#.WCX0fOErJE4">Belly River Group</a>. Sediments of this unit record a transition from marine to terrestrial setting, which is followed by a mostly terrestrial component (reconstructed primarily as an upper coastal plain, like inland Louisiana today), and finally a shift back to more marine influence (a lower coastal plain, similar to the Mississippi delta of southern Louisiana).</p>
<p>Due to the depositional history of the area, there is a time-equivalent interval where one of the sampling regions records a lower coastal plain environment, and the other sampling region records an upper coastal plain environment. This provides the temporally equivalent but environmentally distinct interval in which to test our hypotheses.</p>
<p>We found that the relative abundances of vertebrates in the palaeocommunities preserved in these microsites changed in response to fluctuations in sea level. The largest change was an inverse shift in abundance between sharks/rays and amphibians, with the former dominant in marine-influenced intervals and the latter dominant in terrestrial-influenced intervals. While not surprising, that result confirms that these communities are responding to environmental changes, and that our analyses can detect that.</p>
<p>The next step was to analyze sub-sets of the data, specifically the time-equivalent but environmentally distinct interval in the two sampling areas. We found that dinosaurs, and particularly large-bodied groups, did not vary to any noticeable degree in their relative abundances through this time-equivalent interval. In fact they were highly similar in abundances in both environments.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our results indicate that this long held notion of dinosaurs being highly sensitive to environment and sea-level may not be correct. But then what explains the high diversity of large-bodied dinosaur species present across the Cretaceous of North America? Some of the distant regions of western North America may <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rCDYCQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=sullivan+lucas+2006&amp;ots=c__sAkVIJ2&amp;sig=KnMPdsSfJwEc-TzKgLbSxA6N5XM#v=onepage&amp;q=sullivan%20lucas%202006&amp;f=false">not be as geologically time-equivalent as we currently think</a>, or were isolated geographically in some way that prevented migration.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that despite not being particularly sensitive environmentally, that dinosaurs were partitioning their ecological niches in other ways that allowed for this diversity, such as a <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6785-13-14">restriction on feeding heights</a> or a dietary preference for particular plants. Perhaps primary productivity during this time was sufficiently high that competition was lower and strict niche partitioning was not required.</p>
<p>Our study addresses a long-standing question in dinosaur ecology, though it alone cannot provide the full answer. Many dinosaur teeth can only be diagnosed to the family or subfamily, not the species. So while we focused on trends in major dinosaur groups, additional work must be done to locate more of the much rarer dinosaur macrofossils in order to completely address what is driving dinosaur species distributions.</p>

<p>The traffic lights turn amber: should you brake or accelerate on through? If there’s a teenager at the wheel, the chances are he or she will put their foot down and keep going. Teenagers love taking risks, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896475/">more so than any other age group</a>. This is partly down to the immaturity of the teen brain: they do not yet show the same connectivity between frontal decision making areas and deeper reward-related brain areas, as compared with adults. But there’s also a social element. When an adult is around, teens tend to take fewer risks, and their brains show less reward-related activity after taking a risk, a phenomenon that psychologists call “social scaffolding” because it is as if the adult presence is helping the teen to attain adult-like behaviour. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12484/abstract">new study</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em> builds on these findings and makes the claim that a teenager’s brain is influenced to a greater extent by the presence of his or her mother than by an unfamiliar adult. <span id="more-16708"></span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<p>João Moreira and his colleagues scanned the brains of 23 15-year-olds (9 girls) while they played a risk-based game that involved going through a set of 26 traffic lights as quickly as possible and deciding at each set whether to accelerate or brake as the lights turned amber. Accelerating saved time usually, but also carried the risk of a crash which would lead to a greater delay than braking. The teens played the game twice: once in the presence of their mother who was located in the scan control room, and the other time in the presence of an unfamiliar female professor who was described as an expert in adolescent driving behaviour (some played the game with mum present first, others with the stranger present first).</p>
<p>There was a tendency for the teens to take fewer risks when their mum was present, as compared with the professor, but this difference didn’t reach statistical significance. However, at a neural level there were statistically significant differences between the conditions: when mum was present, the teens’ brains showed more reward-related brain activity after making safe decisions and less reward-related brain activity after making risky decisions. Mum’s supervision seemed to make caution a more pleasurable approach, at least at a neural level.</p>
<p>There was also an important difference between conditions in terms of the functional connectivity between decision making and reward-related brain regions in the brain. In the mum condition, but not the adult stranger condition, there was a negative correlation in the activity between these regions: a more mature pattern typical of that seen in adults.</p>
<p>Finally, the teens’ brains showed more activity in regions associated with perspective-taking when taking risks in the mum condition, perhaps suggesting they were concerned with what she might think.</p>
<p>The researchers interpreted their findings as suggesting there is something unique about the influence of a parent (or a mother, at least) on the way a teenager’s brain processes risk, which could have practical implications. For example risk-prevention educational programmes for teenagers, which often struggle to make a difference, might be more likely to be effective if parents are directly involved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the study is hampered by several methodological issues such as the small sample size and the lack of a baseline control condition: the latter means it’s not clear if differences between the conditions are caused by the benefits of a mother’s presence or the opposite effect of an unfamiliar adult. Also, many issues are left unanswered, such as: would a father have the same apparent effect as a mother? And does the quality of the parent-teen relationship matter?</p>

<p>As one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in clinical practice, neck pain is a common topic in <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em>. However, this case report by Mourad and colleagues describes a patient presenting with neck pain, occipital headache and dizziness, which diagnostic imaging revealed to be caused by a basilar impression (an upward displacement of vertebral elements into the foramen magnum as a result of bone softening) rather than a musculoskeletal cause. Although fairly uncommon it can be dangerous as congenital basilar impression often remains asymptomatic and undiagnosed into adulthood. When symptomatic, neck pain is one of its most ubiquitous symptoms occurring in 59% of patients. This case report highlights the importance of considering non-musculoskeletal, rare pathologic disorders such as basilar impression within the screening and differential diagnosis of neck pain. It also demonstrates the capability of physiotherapists to screen for pathologic medical conditions and identify when patient’s symptoms are beyond the scope of physiotherapy.</p>

<p>In January, Dunning and colleagues published the first randomized control trial which compared the effectiveness of manipulation versus mobilization paired with cranio-cervical flexion exercise in ameliorating symptoms in patients with cervicogenic headache (headaches arising from musculoskeletal dysfunctions in the cervical spine). The study investigated the issue of best practice in the treatment of these headaches, which has been contentious due to the potential risks associated with manipulation.</p>
<p>The findings demonstrated that manipulation produced significantly greater reductions in headache intensity, frequency and duration as well as reductions in disability and medication intake when compared with mobilization and exercise. The study provides a baseline for treatment of cervicogenic headache, which suggests manipulation as the more efficacious in terms of symptom reduction, and also indicates the need for further research to determine the relative effectiveness of different types and dosages of manipulation.</p>

This systematic review synthesized evidence from 13 observational studies (417 shoulders) on intra- and peri-articular pathophysiologic changes seen in patients affected by primary frozen shoulder. The findings highlight that the anterior shoulder structures are the areas of greatest pathologic change in this condition. However, the study also identified that a lack of evidence with a low risk of bias, non-standardized inclusion criteria and poorly reported study characteristics preclude the production of comparable results and therefore a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of primary frozen shoulder. Ryan and colleagues suggest that a consensus regarding inclusion criteria is required before future studies can investigate tissue changes at defined stages to better understand the disease continuum and inform stage-specific management of this condition.</p>

<p>Khan et al. described the results of a longitudinal cohort study and provided the first independent longitudinal association between increasing severity of meniscal tears and worsening knee pain. It also validated previous studies by demonstrating the majority of meniscal tears (55/63) affected the medial meniscus, where the medial posterior site was the most prevalent tear location. Additionally, this study identified risk factors for tear worsening, including high BMI and osteophytes at first visit, which provides a baseline for recognizing patients where tears are likely to increase in severity. Significantly, this study showed that 16% of tears consistently increased in severity over the 8 year follow-up period, highlighting the importance of early effective management.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that patients with medially located tendon pain and a thickened plantaris close the medial Achilles tendon were often unresponsive to standard scraping treatment. Masci and colleagues demonstrated the effective use of a novel imaging technique [Ultrasound Tissue Characterization (UTC)] to diagnose involvement of the plantaris tendon in patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. The UTC algorithms allow quantification of the tendon integrity by categorizing grey scale changes into 4 different echo-types related to matrix integrity. These are then characterized on a scale from intact to completely disorganized. This is visualized in the figure below from the publication, which shows focal disorganized echopixels medially (in images A and B), while image C shows the less frequent observation of general disorganized echopixels in both medial and lateral parts.</p>
<p>Although ultrasound and color Doppler indicated plantaris tendon involvement in 20/23 cases, UTC revealed disorganized changes in the medial Achilles midportion in all patients. These changes may indirectly indicate involvement of the plantaris tendon due to its compression on the medial aspect of the Achilles tendon. This study demonstrated the effective utilization of a novel technology (UTC) and addressed the need to diagnose plantaris tendon involvement to inform future clinical management of patients with midportion Achilles tendinopathy.</p>

<p>It’s that time of year when many of us are trying our best to begin a new exercise habit. One psychological factor affecting our chances is how we think we’ll feel during the exercise, and how that compares to the way we actually feel when we get going, and how we feel afterwards. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27991804">new study</a> in <em>Health Psychology</em> has explored whether it’s possible to increase people’s adherence to a new exercise regime by making their expectations more positive. While the main intervention was a disappointment, there is an encouraging message in the results: moderate-to-vigorous exercise is likely to be more enjoyable than you think, and simply knowing this will probably help you enjoy your exercise even more.</p>
<p><span id="more-16600"></span></p>
<p>Bethany Kwan at University of Colorado School of Medicine and her colleagues recruited 101 healthy young men and women aged 18 to 45. None of them were elite or professional athletes. Their initial challenge was to run for 30 minutes on a treadmill in the lab (at a sustained target intensity of 90 to 100 per cent of their heart rate when first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilatory_threshold">out of breath</a>), and to say how they were feeling at several points throughout and afterwards. The researchers then asked them to repeat the same amount of exercise each day for the next seven days, with their adherence assessed via a heart monitor.</p>
<p>Before the participants began, the researchers asked them how they expected to feel during the exercise. Crucially, the researchers manipulated the expectations of one third of the participants in a positive manner by telling them that most people exercising at this intensity feel good and energised, and then relaxed afterward. In contrast, they told another third of the participants that most people find this intensity of exercise negative and unpleasant, and then they feel tired afterward. The expectations of the remainder of the participants was not manipulated and they acted as controls. After their lab run, the participants said how strongly they intended to keep up the week-long regimen of exercise.</p>
<p>Kwan and her team had hoped that by increasing the positivity of participants’ exercise expectations that these individuals would not only find the lab exercise more positive during and afterwards, but would then show stronger intentions to exercise and better adherence to the regimen. The results were a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Overall, participants found the lab run more pleasant than they thought they would. But participants who were manipulated to expect the lab run to be more enjoyable did not exercise more through the following week. In this sense, the main intervention was a failure.</p>
<p>However, participants manipulated to expect the lab run to be more enjoyable showed greater increases in positive feelings through the run compared to the negatively manipulated participants; moreover, compared with control participants, they remembered the run as less fatiguing. This last effect, though tentative, could be important because the more positively participants remembered the lab run, the more they tended to run through the ensuing week. This supports the common sense idea that when you’ve finished your exercise, it could be beneficial to focus on those aspects of the experience you enjoyed: doing so might increase the likelihood you’ll give it another go.</p>
<p>The researchers said their results suggest that “healthy individuals will likely find a moderate-to-vigorous exercise stimulus to be more pleasant than they expect it to be” and that encouraging exercisers to focus on the positive aspects of the exercise experience will likely “yield an overall more positive affective experience”. Hopefully the mere act of reading this article will help, by raising your expectations for your own new regime!</p>

 Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which breast cell fate are regulated are largely unknown. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells and more restricted progenitors. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast epithelial hierarchy remain ill-defined. Here, we use a high-content confocal image-based short hairpin RNA screen to identify tumour suppressors that regulate breast cell fate in primary human breast epithelial cells. We show that ablation of the large tumour suppressor kinases (LATS) 1 and 2 (refs 5, 6), which are part of the Hippo pathway, promotes the luminal phenotype and increases the number of bipotent and luminal progenitors, the proposed cells-of-origin of most human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we have identified a direct interaction between Hippo and oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling. In the presence of LATS, ERα was targeted for ubiquitination and Ddb1–cullin4-associated-factor 1 (DCAF1)-dependent proteasomal degradation. Absence of LATS stabilized ERα and the Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ), which together control breast cell fate through intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings reveal a non-canonical (that is, YAP/TAZ-independent) effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate.

            <p>Males of many polygynous species compete for access to fertile females without providing them with resources other than sperm and without investing in care for the offspring (male dominance polygyny). In such systems, local competition for access to females is intense and typically only a few males obtain matings, leading to strong sexual selection. Sampling multiple breeding areas could then provide a mechanism for males to increase their chances to reproduce. However, little is known about such sampling behaviour and about the spatial scale at which males compete. Here we show that most males of a migratory, polygynous shorebird, the pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), that arrived at a known breeding location in northern Alaska subsequently moved through a considerable part of the entire species’ breeding range (up to 13,045 km in a four-week period), sampling as many as 23 additional potential breeding sites. Our data suggest that males do not have a final breeding destination after migration from their wintering quarters, but make nomadic movements that are probably not a consequence of breeding failure. Tenure, the duration of stay at a site, correlated strongly with the number of breeding females at the site, suggesting that decisions to leave are dependent on local mating opportunities. Nomadic movements may allow males to display and sire offspring at multiple sites within a single breeding season. Sexual selection may then favour high-performance males that are able to reduce sleep to compete locally and to fly long distances between breeding sites, leading to a population with unrestricted interbreeding and without local adaptation and speciation.</p><p>Nature  1 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20813">doi: 10.1038/nature20813</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/8GAdgazZlu4" width="1" />

            <p>Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation). Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization—a particularly serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl–B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic) and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of pacritinib—a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis—was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20800">doi: 10.1038/nature20800</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/vAQPhs6sNjs" width="1" />

 Prostate tumours are highly variable in their response to therapies, but clinically available prognostic factors can explain only a fraction of this heterogeneity. Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset. These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers. We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized prostate cancer may improve cure rates.
