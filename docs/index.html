<p>To increase <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/advancing-discovery/springboard/blog/blogposts-trust-integrity/strengthening-trust-in-peer-review-through-transparency/18399148">openness and transparency into the peer review process</a> and also to enable increased diversity in our reviewer pool, the BMC Series has introduced <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review</a>. The BMC Series was the pioneer of open peer review that requires that the reviewer’s identity is revealed to the authors. For transparent peer review, reviewer reports are published for all peer reviewed content and reviewers can choose to remain anonymous or sign their report. The move to transparent peer review followed community feedback that reviewers being required to share their name was a barrier for them agreeing to review. Some reviewers may be hesitant to have their name shared, particularly if they are at an early stage in their career or are concerned with having their name revealed to the authors and the public. Giving the option to sign a report allows reviewers to choose for themselves whether they want to reveal their identity.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting peer reviewers<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12535" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2.jpg 692w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p>Reviewing for the first time might seem daunting and there may be uncertainty on what is expected from a reviewer and how to prepare a report. By providing support and guidance for our reviewers, we hope to increase clarity on the peer review process and increase their confidence in their role as a reviewer. The BMC Blog Network has resources on ‘<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/tag/how-to-peer-review/">how to peer review for beginners</a>’ that will guide novice reviewers in their role. <em>BMC Medicine</em> has a <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/peerreviewtips">collection</a> of commissioned articles from experts in different types of research methodology that provides peer review tips for junior reviewers.</p>
<p>At the BMC Series, we want to support those who review for us and provide them with the information they need when reviewing a manuscript for a BMC Series journal. We have created the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/for-reviewers">BMC Series Reviewers&#8217; page</a> that provides a guide on responding to our invite to review, how to assess and prepare a report for a BMC Series manuscript and what to expect after reviewing. Editors from the BMC Series were also involved in developing statistics checklists for editors and reviewers to use when evaluating the statistics in manuscripts and these are now part of our <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#standards+of+reporting">standards of reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Editors across the selective BMC journals (<a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Biology</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Medicine</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Genome Biology</em></a> and <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Genome Medicine</em></a>) and the BMC Series are taking part in an initiative launched in 2020 by Nature Communications to engage specifically with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23455-8">early career researchers (ECRs)</a>. The ECR program aims to support ECRs in becoming effective peer reviewers, provide outreach and instruction to ECRs on how to properly review manuscripts, and identify potential ECR candidates in order to expand current reviewer pools.</p>
<p><em>BMC Biology</em> and <em>BMC Medicine</em> have recently adopted a collaborative editorial model that directly involves Editorial Board Members in the assessment, handling, and decision making of manuscripts, granting the opportunity to scientists to manage the peer review process, while being fully supported by experienced in-house editors. The Editorial Board Member model has an open call on the journals’ websites for those interested in becoming EBMs. In addition, <em>BMC Biology</em> offers the opportunity to scientists to apply to become <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQUInBDnH_GI9mAN82kjgBQpzsDxKCtpY2gIlOt4yan6-erg/viewform">reviewers</a> at the journal.</p>
<p>We hope that providing training, resources, and opportunity will remove the barrier that researchers may face through lack of experience as a reviewer or not understanding the process and expectations. This will enable us to expand and diversify our reviewer pools by giving more people the guidance needed to be a reviewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing inclusivity and diversity</strong></p>
<p>We continue to explore new approaches to increase diversity and inclusivity in the people who review for our journals. <em>BMC Psychology</em> has launched a new collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/PDRI">Psychology of Diversity: The Road from Racism to Inclusion</a>’ that encourages submissions of research on diversity, equity and inclusion. The journal is taking applications from researchers who are interested in being a reviewer for this collection and with the journal’s transparent peer review, they can choose to have their name publicly shared if the paper is published.</p>
<p><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders </em>and <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> have launched a joint collection that is focussed on <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/PPI-RMD">Patient and Public Involvement in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Research</a>. The collection will allow interested patients, carers and members of the public to be involved in the peer review process. This will give them insight into scientific publishing and a voice in research.</p>
<p>Reviewers’ time is extremely valuable and often the reviewers we contact will not be available to review a manuscript. We encourage these reviewers to provide suggestions of alternative researchers when declining our invitation. We aim for gender, race, ethnic, geographic, career stage and other diversity in our reviewer pool. Our peer review invitations ask that reviewers consider alternative reviewers from underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
<p>Our resources will keep being developed to ensure that all reviewers are informed and supported in their role. Greater recognition needs to be given to early career researchers who peer review with their supervisor. We will look at how the names of those who contributed to a reviewer report can be included and credit given to acknowledge their work. As research and community standards advance, publishing needs to also develop. One example is the move to open data and data sharing. Building opportunities for early career researchers to review standardised format articles such as <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/data-note">Data Notes</a> so they can use their expertise to ensure community standards are adhered to. In the future we hope to create initiatives to ensure that reviewers from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented communities are afforded opportunity, encouraged, and supported.</p>
<p>BMC is committed to progressive and innovative approaches in publishing. By working with the research community and listening to their feedback, we will continue to make peer review more transparent and inclusive.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>There’s nothing less funny than explaining a joke. But analysing humour can actually tell us a lot about the development of sympathy and empathy in children.</p>



<p>Having a joke land is a complex task which requires an in-depth understanding of both the situation and mental state of the person on the receiving end. One audience, for example, might find a joke hilarious, whereas another might find that same joke wildly offensive.</p>



<p>Zeroing in on the appropriate joke, therefore, is likely to require a good amount of empathy. This ability to imagine the thoughts and feelings of your audience is pivotal to humour being well-received, but the relationship between humour and empathy has only been addressed in a handful of studies so far. However, <a href="https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/1934/1934.pdf">new research</a> from Caitlin Halfpenny and Lucy James at Keele University gives us a window into how empathy shapes humour by taking a look at junior schoolchildren’s use of jokes, and the different humour styles that emerge with different levels of empathy and sympathy.</p>



<span id="more-43919"></span>



<p>The team asked 214 junior school children aged between 9 and 11 years old to complete two self-report questionnaires. The first, the Humour Styles Questionnaire for young children (HSQ-Y), was used to identify which of four types of humour style the kids use: <em>self-enhancing</em> and <em>affiliative</em>, which are both adaptive humour styles, and <em>aggressive</em> and <em>self-defeating</em> humour, which are considered maladaptive. The second measure, the Thinking and Feeling Questionnaire (TFQ), looks at cognitive and affective empathy, as well as sympathy. Cognitive empathy can be thought of as intellectually understanding the perspective of another person, whereas affective empathy is the ability to feel congruent emotions in response to the conditions of others.</p>



<p>Analyses found that self-enhancing humour, which is used to relieve tension, boost mood, and overcome hardship, was the only style identified to be positively correlated with both types of empathy and sympathy. Kids who displayed this style, the authors suggest, are able to take on the perspective of their audience, understand their emotions, and sympathise with them.</p>



<p>The affiliative humour style, which primarily takes the form of humour to facilitate social interaction by amusing others, was found to positively correlate with just cognitive empathy, but not affective empathy or sympathy. This may reflect varying levels of cognitive development in this age group — it may be that the ability to sympathise had not yet fully developed in the children using this humour style.</p>



<p>As might be expected, aggressive humour was negatively correlated with measures of both affective empathy and sympathy, consistent with previous research on adults. Children who score low on these measures may be unable to appreciate the views and emotions of the audience, and thus struggle to adjust humour accordingly. Interestingly, displaying this maladaptive type of humour may limit the opportunities children have to socialise, giving them less of a chance to develop more adaptive humour styles.</p>



<p>Standing somewhat alone amongst the four styles, self-deprecating humour was not correlated with either measure of empathy. This may be due to the fact that this style focuses inward, rather than being concerned with the emotions and situations of others, or indeed what they’ll find funny. However, the authors note that some children in this age range may be unable to self-report on this style, as they don’t fully grasp what self-deprecating humour encompasses.</p>



<p>Humour styles also varied significantly between genders: boys were more likely to report using aggressive humour styles than girls, and were less likely to score highly in affective empathy. The exact reasons for these gender differences weren’t probed in this study.</p>



<p>These patterns of relationship between humour styles, empathy, and sympathy are a wonderful illustration of the complexity of social interactions at this age. More developed empathy and sympathy seem to give rise to self-enhancing humour styles, which are in turn associated with a number of benefits, such as social intimacy, high self-esteem, and lower levels of depression and anxiety. As such, children who have fully developed their empathy and sympathy skills may have more positive social interactions. In much the same way, less development in these domains may lead to maladaptive humour styles, which could alienate the children using these styles from their peers, and further inhibit their empathetic and sympathetic development. It’s possible that identifying such humour patterns and providing support for empathetic and/or sympathetic growth in children who often use them, therefore, may help them on their way to more adaptive social strategies.</p>

<blockquote><p>The conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources is attracting the attention of both scientists and the general public.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Medicinal plants<br />
</strong>In recent years, an increasing interest in medicinal plants and a growing therapeutic use of phytochemicals has occurred. Medicinal plants are applied for the production of phytopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals and their use is growing rapidly throughout the world: demand for wild resources has increased by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-016-0108-7">8–15 % per year in Europe, North America, and Asia in recent decades</a>. That is why the problem of the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources is attracting the attention of both scientists and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable harvest<br />
</strong>Bulgaria is rich in medicinal and aromatic plant resources but recently they are being harvested in increasing volumes, largely from wild populations. As a result, many of these plants are now endangered species. The need of sustainable use of these valuable resources in Bulgaria resulted in a <a href="http://sf.mon.bg/?go=projects&amp;p=detail&amp;projectsId=49&amp;lang=en">project</a> supported by the EU and the Bulgarian government and dedicated to Sustainable utilization of bio resources and waste from medicinal and aromatic plants for innovative bioactive products. It is an interdisciplinary project coordinated by the <a href="http://srv.orgchm.bas.bg/EN/index_en.html">Institute of Organic Chemistry with Centre of Phytochemistry</a> (IOCCP) at the <a href="https://www.bas.bg/?lang=en">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> and involves five more Bulgarian research institutions.</p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12526 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/sideritis-cult-140x110.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="110" />Natural reserves and wild nurseries are good ways to protect the plants and retain their medical efficacy in their natural habitats. However, it is not possible to designate every natural wild plant habitat as a protected area, so cultivation is the alternative. Cultivation under controlled conditions can result in higher yields of active constituents and guarantees production stability. Increased cultivation contributes to substantial decrease in the harvest volume of wild medicinal plants, benefits the recovery of their wild resources, and decreases their prices. In addition, cultivation can increase the income of people in rural communities and thus support the sustainable development of these communities.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable processing<br />
</strong>The processing of medicinal plants for obtaining extracts and active constituents is an important part of their utilization. The increasing environmental concerns over the last decades have motivated the development of sustainable extraction strategies that follow the basic <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html">principles of green chemistry</a>. So an important aim of the abovementioned project is the development of sustainable extraction approaches to obtain various plant extracts with minimum impact on the environment (lower energy consumption, renewable solvents, etc.). Green extraction technologies are able to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances and limit the cost of solvent waste disposal; among them are supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction, all considered sustainable techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Utilization of wastes<br />
</strong>Industrial processes that utilize medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) generates various kinds of residues like residual biomasses from distillation of aromatic plant and non-utilized parts of medicinal plant. The extraction residue is often treated as a waste to dumping. However residual biomasses should not be considered as waste as these can actually be recycled. These biomasses are suitable for isolation of phytochemicals like phenolics-antioxidants and converted into value added products. A good example of such utilization is the large amount of wastes generated by the production of the famous Bulgarian rose oil. One of the partner in our project, the Agrobioinstitute (Sofia) developed a technological scheme for combined utilization of waste rose biomass, aimed at the extraction of polyphenol substances and subsequent fractional extraction of polysaccharides. An additional advantage of this integrated approach is that it could be further combined with other methods and applied to other essential oil plant wastes. Valorizing by-products from the residual biomass from medicinal and aromatic plants is one of the potential ways to achieve a sustainable economy.</p>
<p><strong>A success story<br />
</strong>A success story is the one of a very popular medicinal plant, Mountain tea <em>Sideritis scardica</em>, endemic to the Balkan Peninsula. It is used for wound and burn healing, treatment of gastric ulcer, the common cold and mucous membrane inflammation. In the 1990’s, the collection of wild-growing <em>Sideritis scardica </em>became very extensive: it was in danger of extinction and was included in the Red Book list of Bulgaria. To respond to the demand of the consumers, our colleagues with the Institute of Botany developed a very productive cultivar and cultivation was gradually developing and is now very popular in rural communities with appropriate climatic and environmental conditions. We chemists studied the sustainable extraction methods and suggested the most appropriate approaches for this plant. And now, in the frame of our big project, we have recently filed a patent for a cosmeceutical based on this plant extract.</p>

The cultivation, processing and trade of high-value medicinal and aromatic plants could contribute to social equity, environmental conservation and economic prosperity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whirling-maple-seeds-inspired-tiny-flying-sensors-microfliers">Whirling maple seeds inspired these tiny flying sensors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like helicoptering maple seeds, tiny new fliers whirl gracefully as they glide.</p>



<p>The miniature aircraft, which can be made as small as a grain of sand, could be dispersed by air over long distances. Scientists envision that these microfliers, when equipped with wee sensors for measuring environmental conditions, could monitor pH, test for heavy metals or assess hazards like chemical spills, for example. The devices could also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-sunlight-powered-aircraft-could-soar-beyond-airplanes-reach">track conditions in the atmosphere</a> while aloft (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>The maple tree–lined streets north of Chicago, where materials scientist John Rogers lives, served as inspiration for the new microfliers. But Rogers, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and colleagues went smaller-than-life when designing their fleet. Some of the whirligigs are just half a millimeter across, the team reports in the Sept. 23 <em>Nature</em>. The researchers used computer simulations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y">to help select the microflier shapes best for smooth flight</a>, designing rotors of various sizes and with different numbers and shapes of blades.</p>



<p>As with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-maple-fruits-fall">maples’ seed-copters and those of other plants</a>, the fliers’ blades induce spinning motions that help stabilize flight (<em>SN: 6/11/09</em>). The designs also decrease the speed at which the microfliers fall, giving them more time to disperse. One flier fell at about 28 centimeters per second, less than half the speed of natural whirligigs from various plants.</p>



<p>In the future, the researchers plan to make biodegradable versions of the fliers, so that the objects could be scattered without defiling the environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genetics-how-polynesia-settled-migration-islands-pacific-ocean">DNA offers a new look at how Polynesia was settled</a></h4>

              
                <p>Polynesian voyagers settled islands across a vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean within about 500 years, leaving a genetic trail of the routes that the travelers took, scientists say.</p>



<p>Comparisons of present-day Polynesians’ DNA indicate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03902-8">sea journeys launched from Samoa</a> in western Polynesia headed south and then east, reaching Rarotonga in the Cook Islands by around the year 830. From the mid-1100s to the mid-1300s, people who had traveled farther east to a string of small islands called the Tuamotus fanned out to settle Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, and several other islands separated by thousands of kilometers on Polynesia’s eastern edge. On each of those islands, the Tuamotu travelers built massive stone statues like the ones Easter Island is famed for.</p>



<p>That’s the scenario sketched out in a new study in the Sept. 23 <em>Nature</em> by Stanford University computational biologist Alexander Ioannidis, population geneticist Andrés Moreno-Estrada of the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico, and their colleagues.</p>



<p>The new analysis generally aligns with archaeological estimates of human migrations across eastern Polynesia from roughly 900 to 1250. And the study offers an unprecedented look at settlement pathways that zigged and zagged over a distance of more than 5,000 kilometers, the researchers say.</p>





<p>“The colonization of eastern Polynesia was a remarkable event in which a vast area, some one-third of the planet, became inhabited by humans in … a relatively short period of time,” says archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University in New York, who wasn’t involved in the new research.</p>



<p>Improved radiocarbon dating techniques applied to remains of short-lived plant species unearthed at archaeological sites are also producing a chronology of Polynesian colonization close to that proposed in the genetic study, Lipo says.</p>



<p>In the new investigation, researchers identified DNA segments of exclusively Polynesian origin in 430 present-day individuals from 21 Pacific island populations. Island-specific genetic fingerprints enabled the scientists to reconstruct settlement paths, based on increases in rare gene variants that must have resulted from a small group moving from one island to another and giving rise to a new, larger population with novel DNA twists. Comparisons of shared Polynesian ancestry between pairs of individuals on different islands were used to estimate when settlements occurred.</p>



<p>In an intriguing twist, the DNA evidence “is consistent with the [statue] carving tradition arising once in a single point of common origin, likely the Tuamotu islands,” Moreno-Estrada says. Polynesian ancestry on all the islands with massive statues traces back to the one island in the Tuamotus where the researchers were able to obtain Indigenous peoples’ DNA.</p>



<p>The Tuamotus include nearly 80 islands situated between Tahiti to the west and other islands to the north and east where settlers carved statues. The latter outposts consist of the Marquesas Islands, Mangareva and Rapa Nui. Another late-settled island where inhabitants carved statues, Raivavae, lies southwest of the Tuamotus.</p>



<p>Settlers reached the island of Mataiva in the northern Tuamotus by about 1110, the researchers suggest. Statue makers navigated northward and eastward from Mataiva or perhaps other Tuamotu islands to as far east as Rapa Nui — eventually curving back west before arriving at Raivavae — around the same time as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-americans-may-have-traveled-polynesia-800-years-ago">an earlier DNA study suggests eastern Polynesians mated with South Americans</a> (<em>SN: 7/8/20</em>). (It’s not clear whether South Americans crossed the ocean to Polynesia or Polynesians traveled to South America and then returned.)</p>

<p>Caption: An analysis of 430 present-day individuals is shedding new light on the timings and routes of early Polynesians’ migrations. Modern DNA indicates that voyagers left Samoa and went south and then east, reaching Rarotonga in the Cook Islands by around the year 830. From the mid-1100s to the mid-1300s, people who had traveled to the Tuamotu Islands, located just east of Tahiti, spread out to settle Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, and several other islands separated by thousands of kilometers. </p>

<p>Ioannidis and colleagues’ conclusions generally support prior scenarios of Polynesia’s settlement, but some disparities exist between their genetic evidence and earlier archaeological and linguistic findings, writes archaeologist Patrick Kirch of the University of Hawaii at Manoa in a commentary published with the new study.</p>



<p>For instance, the new DNA analysis overlooks extensive contacts that occurred across eastern Polynesian in its early settlement stages, Kirch says. Analyses of closely related eastern Polynesian language dialects and discoveries of stone tools that were transported from one island to another point to substantial travels and trading throughout the region during that time.</p>



<p>Kirch, who has previously suggested that these long-distance contacts in eastern Polynesian influenced stone carving traditions, calls the new proposal that people with a shared ancestry brought stone carving to Rapa Nui and other islands “a provocative hypothesis.”</p>



<p>And there’s still no answer to one major question regarding the settlement of the islands, says molecular anthropologist Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who didn’t participate in the new research. No current line of evidence can resolve the mystery of why, after spending nearly 2,000 years on Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, Polynesians began voyaging thousands of kilometers eastward in search of new lands.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">The Pandemic Has Left Us Wanting More Personal Space — Even In Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>The boundaries of personal space aren’t set in stone. They even vary widely from person to person, between cultures, and between environments (for example, we might give strangers a wide berth on the pavement, yet end up shoulder to shoulder on trains). And though it may not feel like it on public transport, personal space is a consideration in everything from the design of buildings to logistics for large events.</p>



<p>In 2020, Covid brought a whole new element to the table in terms of our comfort levels around other people. Maintaining a physical distance was one of the few things we could do for many months to limit the risk of infection, so for many of us, the personal space boundaries we were used to suddenly became no-gos.</p>



<p>This change is fantastically illustrated by a new preprint from Daphne Halt and team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The researchers believe that our personal space preferences not only tell us about the psychological effects of the pandemic, but may be of use as an indicator of progress towards regaining normality.</p>



<span id="more-43908"></span>



<p>To examine how the pandemic has affected people’s personal space preferences, they conducted a small study with 12 participants who had also completed pre-pandemic personal space investigations at the lab.</p>



<p>The team collected data on the size of participants’ personal spaces using the Stop Distance Procedure (SDP) — a task which measures the distance at which participants become uncomfortable with an approaching person, as well as where they become uncomfortable approaching the other party. This task was performed both typically (in a space with another person) and using virtual reality. The distance data collected during the pandemic was then compared to existing pre-pandemic data from each of the participants. Data on beliefs and experiences during the pandemic were also collected.</p>



<p>Results showed that, on average, the distances participants preferred to keep during the pandemic were significantly greater than their pre-pandemic personal boundaries, both in reality and virtually. Participants who showed a greater increase also tended to perceive the risk of infection as higher. Surprisingly, though, there was no relationship between this increase in distance and <em>actual</em> infection risk (as defined by the number of positive cases in the town in which the participant lived). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors say that the increase in people’s boundaries even in virtual reality, where there was no infection risk, may be indicative of changes to neural representations of the &#8220;safety zone&#8221; around our bodies, as well as sensorimotor circuits in the brain involved in maintaining our safety. These ideas, however, will need further investigation to verify. There’s also a possibility that this increase may persist beyond the pandemic; but, it’s just as possible that our need for more space will revert to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over. The scale at which social distance measures were applied is unprecedented, and as such, it’s difficult to make predictions about what future average personal space boundaries may look like, respective to pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>Future research will be instrumental in addressing the above, as well as verifying that this phenomenon holds within a larger sample size. Cross cultural analyses may also be useful, though differences in Covid guidelines are likely to make cross-borders comparisons particularly difficult. Even so, this finding will be particularly interesting to those in fields that require estimations of personal space, and could potentially provide a basis for the development of tools to assess worry about infection in the general population.</p>

                <p>In the United States, it’s looking like booster shots of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine won’t be widely available to the general public starting this week.</p>



<p>A panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended September 17 that boosters next be allowed only for certain groups: people 65 years and older, individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and those with jobs that put them at high risk of exposure.</p>



<p>That’s more limited in scope than what the Biden administration proposed in August. Officials had announced plans to offer a third dose of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine to the general public at least six months after vaccination starting September 20, pending an OK from the FDA.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>Since officials unveiled that plan, it’s been widely debated. Some researchers — including Pfizer scientists — argue that because the vaccine’s protection against infections is waning, that could foreshadow a possible dip in protection against severe disease too. So the time to bolster everyone’s protection with a third dose is now, these researchers say. But others disagree, contending that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02046-8/fulltext">it’s more important to focus on getting doses to unvaccinated people first</a>, and that many younger, healthy vaccinated people remain well-protected against severe disease and death after just two doses.</p>



<p>Third doses are already authorized for moderately to severely immunocompromised people who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">may not develop good protection from the initial shots</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). The case for another dose was obvious for that group, says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland who wasn’t involved with the FDA panel. The data were “clear as day that the third dose was important” and could help boost the levels of protective antibodies in some patients.</p>



<p>But moving forward for the general population requires more specialized consideration, Slifka notes. “I think part of it comes down to what’s our level of risk tolerance.”</p>



<p>It’s still unclear when and for which new groups the FDA will authorize booster shots. A separate panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to weigh in on booster shots September 22 and 23. Whatever the new guidance is, it will apply only to people who received Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Decisions for Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s jabs still lie ahead.</p>



<p>Here are some of the key questions that influenced the FDA panel’s recommendation.</p>



<h4>Is vaccine effectiveness starting to wane?</h4>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are still largely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinatedhttps:/www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">keeping people out of the hospital</a> in the United States, studies show (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). Even as infections among vaccinated people go up, protection against hospitalization and death remains high, CDC epidemiologist Sara Oliver said at the September 17 meeting.</p>



<p>That’s true for all three vaccines — developed by Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J — available in the United States even with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. Before delta dominated in the country, estimates of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in adults 18 and older ranged from 84 to 97 percent. That’s compared with 75 to 95 percent effectiveness after the variant took over, Oliver said. Effectiveness against infection, on the other hand, has dipped from 72 to 97 percent before delta to around 40 to 84 percent. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, data from Israel — the first country to vaccinate the majority of its population against COVID-19 — hint that over time Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine becomes less effective at preventing severe disease, particularly in people age 60 and older. That trend spurred public health officials there to begin offering a booster dose to that age group July 30 amid a spike in cases.</p>



<p>That third dose seems to have helped. People age 60 and older who didn’t receive a booster were <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255">11 times as likely to be infected with the coronavirus</a> and nearly 20 times as likely to develop severe disease compared with those who got a third dose at least 12 days earlier, researchers reported September 15 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Preliminary data presented at the September 17 meeting suggest that the same trend may occur in people ages 40 to 59.</p>



<p>The booster brings vaccine efficacy back up to levels seen before delta came on the scene, Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health services at Israel’s Ministry of Health, told the FDA panel. “It’s like a fresh vaccine.”</p>



<p>It’s less clear, however, that protection against the worst of COVID-19 wanes in younger people, too, contributing to the FDA panel’s recommendation for boosters for those age 65 and older. But that should become clearer in the coming months, as researchers continue to monitor the situation.</p>



<p>In Israel, everyone over age 12 became eligible on August 29 for a third shot at least five months after a second dose. That decision was made because officials wanted to control the latest surge in cases, and limiting transmission would have been difficult without vaccinating everyone eligible, Alroy-Preis said.</p>



<p>Estimates suggest that transmission in Israel is indeed slowing. By one measure, infected people tend to pass the virus on to fewer than one other person, meaning the outbreak could begin to fizzle out. While hospitalizations and severe cases have stabilized since people began receiving boosters, however, the overall number of COVID-19 cases remains high.</p>



<p>That disparity may exist because the country opened schools on September 1 and many Israelis have gathered in holiday celebrations, Alroy-Preis said. But once things settle down, officials will likely have a better sense of where things stand. “We feel the booster effect, but we are not over the fourth wave yet,” she said.</p>





<h4>How safe is it to give people a third dose?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Many experts on the FDA panel expressed concerns about the possibility of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis'">heart inflammation, a condition called myocarditis</a>, that has been linked to mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer’s, particularly in young males (<em>SN: 6/1/21</em>). Most cases are mild and are easily treated.</p>



<p>Experts have determined that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent severe disease outweigh the risk of myocarditis. But most panelists were reluctant to come to the same conclusion for a booster dose for younger age groups without more data.</p>



<p>Since boosters started rolling out in Israel, officials so far have documented only one case of myocarditis out of 2 million doses — in a male in his thirties. However, not enough time has passed to know for sure: Most younger people received a third dose within the last two weeks. Officials are actively monitoring for myocarditis reports, Alroy-Preis said. In Pfizer’s clinical trial testing a third dose, none of the more than 300 participants developed myocarditis.</p>



<p>But that data did little to alleviate the concerns of the FDA panel. Not only is the picture from Israel not yet certain, but some panelists were also concerned that the Pfizer trial included too few people.</p>



<p>More than a million third doses have been given in the United States, noted Hayley Gans, an infectious disease pediatrician at Stanford University, at the meeting. So there could be a larger pool of safety data to consider. But without that data available, it feels like trying to make a decision without all the pieces, Gans said. Oliver, the CDC epidemiologist, said that the data would probably be released in the coming days.</p>



<p>Aside from the uncertainty surrounding myocarditis, a third dose appears safe. Side effects like pain at the injection site, fever and chills were mostly mild and occurred at similar rates as after a second dose.</p>



<h4>How long might the boost in immunity last?</h4>



<p>No one knows for sure, but increasing the time between doses does traditionally prompt longer-lasting vaccine protection, Slifka says. While that’s not always the case, “I doubt [any COVID-19 booster] will be shorter-lived than what we have,” in terms of immunity, he says. “It’s either going to be equal to or longer” than at least six months. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving people a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine does boost <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113468">antibodies to levels that surpass those seen after a second dose</a>, researchers reported September 15 in a separate study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>But, crucially, researchers don’t yet know what level of antibodies in the blood actually gives a person sufficient protection against the coronavirus in the first place. That would be helpful to pinpoint whether immunity, either after two or three doses, might have waned, James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, said during the FDA panel’s discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immunologist Michael Kurilla agreed. “We just can’t simply be in a position where we would just be vaccinating people every time we think there’s a problem,” so researchers need to get a better handle on how to measure protection, said Kurilla, of the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences in Bethesda, Md.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>What’s more, our immune systems have the tools to remember the coronavirus after vaccination, which should prevent severe disease, Kurilla noted. And just two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine seem to spark long-lived immune memory — including cells that make antibodies as well as other immune cells that coordinate the immune response or kill infected cells — so the body can rapidly ramp up defenses if the coronavirus were to invade.</p>



<p>Booster shots could be useful to fortify weak immune memory, giving people better protection in the future. But given that many people already have developed that strong, long-lived immune memory, it’s unclear why they would even need a third jab right now, Kurilla said.</p>



<p>Our immune systems don’t work as well as we age, however. So older people may end up needing those boosters more than younger people.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How would boosters affect the pandemic more broadly?</h4>



<p>Researchers on the FDA panel were divided on the answer to that question.</p>



<p>The effects of a third dose on controlling COVID-19 cases and spread in the United States would probably be minimal, some said. That’s partly because in this country, virus transmission is largely driven by high numbers of unvaccinated people, said Eric Rubin, a microbiologist and infectious disease physician at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. So, giving boosters to vaccinated people could have little impact on spread overall.</p>



<p>Others, including Gans, said that to answer the question, they would like to see more data on the booster’s ability to curb transmission. If that data did show that fewer people are getting infected by people who have had three shots, then giving some people, such as parents or teachers, a vaccine booster to better prevent infection and spread might help protect kids who are too young to be vaccinated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, many experts around the world emphasize that to have the most impact on the pandemic, efforts should be focused on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">getting vaccines to the unvaccinated</a>, not boosters to the vaccinated (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). In a push for vaccine equity, the World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on boosters until the end of the year. The vast majority of vaccine doses have made it into arms in high-income countries, while most people in low-income countries still lack protection, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---8-september-2021">September 8 news briefing</a>. “We have been calling for vaccine equity from the beginning, not after the richest countries have been taken care of.”</p>





<h4>What about boosters for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines?</h4>



<p>Most of the focus on boosters has centered on Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, in part because Pfizer was the first pharmaceutical company to ask for booster approval from the FDA. But millions of U.S. residents have received vaccines developed by Moderna or J&amp;J. So what do we know about potential boosters for those vaccines?</p>



<p>For now, Moderna’s vaccine appears to be outperforming Pfizer’s, meaning that boosters might be less crucial (although a third dose <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-submission-initial-data-us-fda-its-covid-19">does raise antibody levels</a>, even against coronavirus variants, the company says). When it comes to hospitalizations, Moderna’s shot was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w">93 percent effective at keeping people out of the hospital as of August 15</a>, researchers reported September 17 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. That’s compared with an estimated 88 percent effectiveness for Pfizer’s vaccine.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why there might be differences in effectiveness between the two vaccines, since both rely on the same mRNA technology. But it’s possible that the longer interval between first and second doses — four weeks for Moderna’s compared with three weeks for Pfizer’s — may help people develop a longer-lasting immune response, Slifka says. Plus, Moderna’s vaccine includes a higher dose than Pfizer’s does, which could also help. But it&#8217;s possible those differences will disappear over time as researchers collect more data, he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fewer people have received J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine than the mRNA vaccines, so there’s less information available on that shot. As of August 15, a single dose was around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w">71 percent effective at preventing hospitalization</a>, researchers reported in that same September 17 study. That’s close to the nearly 75 percent efficacy against severe disease reported in late-stage clinical trials. And there’s <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-real-world-evidence-and-phase-3-data-confirming-strong-and-long-lasting-protection-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-the-u-s">no evidence that protection wanes over time</a>, the company said in a September 21 news release.</p>



<p>But a second dose given two months after the first can <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262569v1">increase antibody levels and provide even better protection</a>, J&amp;J also announced. In clinical trials, that second shot had an efficacy of 94 percent against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States, on par with the mRNA vaccines.</p>



<p>Waiting six months to give the second dose helped boost antibody levels even more, the company said. While the two-month-interval raised antibodies four to six times as high as after the first dose, six months between doses resulted in levels 12 times as high as a month after that second shot. And more antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-second-dose-delay-complicated">could mean more protection</a> against COVID-19.</p>



<p>Booster data for these other shots <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/19/fauci-says-data-moderna-johnson-johnson-boosters-few-weeks-away-fda-review/">are on the docket for the FDA</a> to consider in the future. That could perhaps happen in a few weeks’ time, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on September 19.</p>

<p>Calling your attention to the call for abstracts for the ninth Peer Review Congress published this week. Details are available in this <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2252">Editorial</a>, co-published by <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784485">JAMA </a>and the BMJ, and on the <a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/">Congress website.&nbsp;</a> You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdnUH7Ekuw4">watch </a>the virtual symposium if you want to hear specifics from organizers of the Congress.</p>



<p>Every four year since 1989, the Peer Review Congress has brought together researchers, journal editors and all those who participate in the reporting and publication of scientific research, in order to put their own processes under scrutiny. The meetings have helped stimulate research into peer review and scientific publication &mdash; including studies of bias, reporting standards, prospective registration and many more topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ninth Peer Review Congress will be held in September 2022 and the website will open for abstracts submissions on December 1, 2021.&nbsp;<strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>deadline for abstract submissions will be January 31, 2022.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Congress was originally anchored by medical journals&ndash;the JAMA network, the BMJ and the Meta-Research Innovation Center (METRICS) at Stanford are its organizers and planners&ndash;but it now embraces a wide range of disciplines. Sharing findings and experimentation across disciplinary boundaries is particularly important. The audience of this meeting is unique and includes researchers, editors, funders, information innovators, policymakers, ethicists, journalists and more.</p>



<p>For this next congress, I have the honor to be part of an amazing&nbsp;<a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/organizers-and-advisory-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advisory Board&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;who will work with the organizers to shape the conference program. We look forward to receiving abstracts and helping to assemble a stimulating program of evidence-based discussions to improve the quality, effectiveness and fairness of peer review.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/luis-miramontes-chemistry-birth-control-pill-ingredient-sexual-revolution">Luis Miramontes helped enable the sexual revolution. Why isn’t he better known?</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Mexican scientist Luis Miramontes signed his lab notebook on October 15, 1951, he didn’t know he was documenting history.</p>



<p>That day, he made a new molecule — norethindrone. Derived from the wild Mexican yam that locals call <em>barbasco</em>, norethindrone became <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-birth-control-pill-ready-after-ten-years">one of the first active ingredients in birth control pills</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birth-control-research-moving-beyond-pill">“The pill”</a> gave women control over when they had children and let men and women enjoy sex without the chance of reproduction, thus ushering in seismic social change.</p>



<p>Miramontes’ notebook page has been immortalized in books and articles by his former supervisor, Carl Djerassi, as well as reporters. Yet compared with Djerassi and others who contributed to the pill, Miramontes attained little recognition, says Gabriela Soto Laveaga, a historian of science at Harvard University and author of <em>Jungle Laboratories: Mexican Peasants, National Projects, and the Making of the Pill</em>. “It isn’t until recently that Miramontes has even been spoken about.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luis Ernesto Miramontes Cárdenas was born in 1925, in the wake of the Mexican Revolution. He grew up surrounded by strong female role models, including his aunt María Dolores Cárdenas Aréchiga, a onetime major in Pancho Villa’s army who later joined the army of teachers bringing education to the remotest corners of Mexico. Young Miramontes decided on a career in science. By the late 1940s, he was studying chemical engineering in Mexico City.</p>



<p>It was a good time and place to be a skilled molecule maker. The Mexican company Syntex was blowing away global competition at producing low-cost hormones to treat diseases. The reason was the Mexican yam, <em>Dioscorea mexicana</em>, which contained large quantities of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cortisone-made-yams">a precursor that could be used to make several hormones</a>. In 1949, Miramontes became one of a group of researchers assigned to Syntex projects as part of an agreement with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM. Djerassi, an Austrian-born American chemist, “liked the way I worked,” Miramontes said in a 2004 interview. “If he wanted something to turn out well, or to be verified, he’d give me the job.”</p>





<p>Progesterone was just such a challenge. Doctors used it to prevent certain types of miscarriages, among other things, but it had to be injected to work. Djerassi and Syntex director George Rosenkranz wanted a progesterone pill. Following leads from other scientists, Syntex made a modified progesterone derived from the yam, one designed to survive the digestive tract and have more biological activity than progesterone. That was norethindrone. Miramontes figured out the last step in its recipe, adding a crucial carbon-carbon triple bond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, experts and activists made the connection between progesterone and birth control, because progesterone prevents ovulation during pregnancy. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-birth-control-pill-ready-after-ten-years">This paved the way for norethindrone to be used in contraception</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="258" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_miramontes_inline2.png" alt="chemical structures of norethindrone and norethynodrel" class="wp-image-3103831" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_miramontes_inline2.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_miramontes_inline2-330x125.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103831">After Luis Miramontes developed norethindrone (left), chemists at a rival company reported norethynodrel (right), a similar compound chosen for use in the first birth control pill.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103831">PubChem</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, it didn’t end up in the first pill. A year after Syntex reported norethindrone, chemists at rival firm Searle, an American company, reported their own compound, norethynodrel. It differed from norethindrone by the position of just one carbon-carbon double bond, and adding stomach acid converted it to norethindrone. Gregory Pincus, a codeveloper of the first pill, chose Searle’s compound. But norethindrone had a longer-lasting impact. Searle’s compound is no longer marketed. In 2018, norethindrone was still the 138th most prescribed drug in the United States.</p>



<p>Why, then, did Miramontes remain an obscure figure? He was a student at a time when science was especially hierarchical. And the fact that Searle beat Syntex to market cut Mexico — and Miramontes — out of the narrative. Perhaps renown was not Miramontes’ preference. His son Octavio Miramontes Vidal says: “My father was a quiet individual. He was not someone who was seeking fame.” In contrast, Djerassi “did not aspire to modesty,” according to an obituary.</p>

<p>Miramontes Vidal says that his father was bilingual, but Miramontes didn’t choose to write his story in English. Others did: Pincus mentioned Syntex in his book’s acknowledgements, but not its chemists. Djerassi credited Miramontes in his works, but called Miramontes “a young Mexican chemist” when he himself was less than two years older. “It’s about who controls the narrative, and the person who controls the narrative of the invention of the pill in the United States in many ways becomes Djerassi,” says Soto Laveaga.</p>



<p>Miramontes ended up accepting a director position at Searle to earn more money to support his growing family; he and his wife had 10 children. From there, the university seemed to close its doors, says his son Miramontes Vidal, who is a physicist at UNAM. Despite completing all requirements, Miramontes was never awarded a Ph.D. He was not a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences, which was cofounded by one of his mentors at UNAM.</p>



<p>Miramontes’ parish priest threatened his wife with excommunication, Miramontes Vidal says — the Catholic Church’s influence in 1960s Mexico can’t be overstated. Miramontes perhaps hinted at this when he wrote that the pill “generated profound, serious moral questions in some sectors of society, and obtuse, reactionary attitudes in others.”</p>

<p>Times changed. In the 1980s, Miramontes won awards from Mexican state governments and the Mexican Chemical Society. In 2010, the president of the Mexican Academy of Sciences ranked Miramontes’ work as one of Mexico’s three top scientific contributions. But the damage had been done. Miramontes Vidal says that when his father passed away in 2004, newspapers didn’t know who he was. Word of his death traveled so slowly that it took the American Chemical Society two years to issue an obituary.</p>



<p>Miramontes’ own writings suggest satisfaction with his legacy. “I consider myself lucky,” he wrote in 2001, “because the researcher, in their zeal to discover the truth at the outset of their work, on many occasions doesn’t realize what they will find.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/667224466/0/oupblogpsychology/">Eradicating ableism with disability-positive K-12 education</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/eradicating-ableism-with-disability-positive-k-12-education/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/markus-spiske-AXc2uwl4Cik-unsplashedit-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>More than half a century ago, powerful civil rights laws brought disabled children into American school systems, breaking down the physical barriers that held these young people at the margins of society. But attitudes towards disability as a devalued limitation persisted, holding social and cultural barriers between disabled and nondisabled people firmly in place. There is, however, an opportunity to use the power of education and learning to reimagine how we design the world.</p><p>In 1970, United States public schools educated only <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://sites.ed.gov/idea/IDEA-History#content">one in five students with disabilities</a>, and most states had laws on the books denying children with both physical and developmental disabilities access to mainstream schooling. In 1975, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) to support states and localities in the public education of students with disabilities. When it was reauthorized in 1990, EHA was renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). As a millennial born in 1984, IDEA afforded me, a blind kindergartener, the right to attend my local public school. I was born with a degenerative eye condition that meant I would have night blindness my whole life, and gradually lose my daytime vision as well.</p><p>By 2016, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/osep/2018/parts-b-c/40th-arc-for-idea.pdf">95% of children 6-21</a> who were eligible for services under IDEA were spending at least some part of each school day in a mainstream classroom. This was a huge leap forward but was happening in the absence of a major culture shift—even though more and more disabled children were joining classrooms, disability was absent from the curriculum. For instance, no one—not my parents, my teachers, my classmates, or myself—referred to me as “blind.” We often referred to my “eye problem,” or said that, “I couldn’t see in the dark.” There was no vocabulary to describe my sense of difference, though it was deeply felt.</p><p>In school, I did wear glasses, but none of the trappings of blindness—the white cane, the Braille business cards—those would come later. Still, I was the source of relentless bullying. I recall dreading mundane things like accidentally dropping my pencil on the ground, as I’d have to kneel down, in a cold sweat of shame, as the boys in the class taunted me, calling me “blindy” as I traced my fingers across the floor to locate my fallen writing implement. This was all because none of us knew better—because, for centuries, disabled children were bundled away and corralled inside institutions, while nondisabled children were taught to fear and underestimate them. These deeply-engrained fears of disability still exist in the present day and are acted upon in ways that harm disabled children.</p><p>Though there are only 10 US studies linking disability to bullying in school, according to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pacer.org/bullying/info/students-with-disabilities/#maincontent">one study</a> from 2009, disabled children were two to three times more likely to experience bullying than their nondisabled peers. A more recent 2019 analysis from the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pacer.org/bullying/info/stats.asp#maincontent">National Center for Educational Statistics   </a> found that, alongside physical appearance, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religion, disability was among the most common reason for bullying reported by students. Negative outcomes of bullying include lower performance in school, greater absenteeism, and lower graduation rates, among others.</p><p>This data comes as no surprise to me, as it reflects my own childhood. And this is how schools perpetuated a culture of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.accessliving.org/newsroom/blog/ableism-101/">ableism</a>—and it took powerful civil rights laws to achieve the simple step of giving disabled children access to the same educational opportunities as their nondisabled peers.</p><p>Thankfully, for a new generation of disabled students, this reality is changing, and we can begin to see a world remade by people who will grow up immersed in disability-positive education.</p><p>Organizations like <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://disabilityequalityeducation.org/#content">Disability Equality and Education</a> in Pennsylvania are developing disability-positive curricula that teach children about various forms of disability, as well as how to honor and respect the differences that make us all whole and human. Disabled authors are publishing children’s books like <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.akpress.org/we-move-together.html">We Move Together</a></em> and <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670588/rolling-warrior-by-judith-heumann/">Rolling Warrior</a></em><em> </em>that further reinforce these ideas. Films like <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.netflix.com/title/81001496">Crip Camp</a> are being used in schools to tell stories of the disability civil rights movement. These are the narratives that I had to seek out in my adult life, that will no longer be invisible for the next generation of disabled youth.</p><p>And this is just the beginning. States, localities, and school boards must demand that disability become part of the K-12 curriculum. Students who, because of IDEA, have the opportunity and the right to learn alongside their nondisabled peers should see themselves in the education they receive. And they shouldn’t be alone in these discoveries—nondisabled children should be right there with them, building disability consciousness and finding creative ways to work together to ensure everyone is included in every aspect of life. If this becomes the foundation, a child who grows into an architect is less likely to forget to build that ramp and make it beautiful; a high school student who becomes a doctor is more likely to show compassion and provide accommodation to a disabled patient; and a nondisabled government leader is more likely to consider disability issues when designing public policies. Even after the harms of bullying and the loneliness of exclusion, I believe this new world is possible because knowledge is a powerful tool to repair our entrenched fear of otherness.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Markus Spiske</a> on Unsplash</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/667224466/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/667224466/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f09%2fmarkus-spiske-AXc2uwl4Cik-unsplashedit-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/667224466/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/the-census-and-entitled-resentment/">The Census and entitled resentment</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/why-were-finnish-schools-so-successful-with-distance-and-in-person-learning-during-the-pandemic/">Why were Finnish schools so successful with distance and in-person learning during the pandemic?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/why-climate-change-education-needs-more-empathy/">Why climate change education needs more empathy</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-quantum-spin-ice-fine-structure-constant">One of nature’s key constants is much larger in a quantum material</a></h4>

              
                <p>A crucial number that rules the universe goes big in a strange quantum material.</p>



<p>The fine-structure constant is about 10 times its normal value in a type of material called quantum spin ice, physicists calculate in the Sept. 10 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. The new calculation hints that quantum spin ice could give a glimpse at physics within an alternate universe where the constant is much larger.</p>



<p>With an influence that permeates physics and chemistry, the fine-structure constant sets the strength of interactions between electrically charged particles. Its value, about 1/137, consternates physicists because they can’t explain why it has that value, even though it is necessary for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">complex chemistry</a> that is the basis of life (<em>SN: 11/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>If the fine-structure constant throughout the cosmos were as large as the one in quantum spin ices, “the periodic table would only have 10 elements,” says theoretical physicist Christopher Laumann of Boston University. “And it probably would be hard to make people; there wouldn’t be enough richness to chemistry.”</p>





<p>Quantum spin ices are a class of substances in which particles can’t agree. The materials are made up of particles with spin, a quantum version of angular momentum, which makes them magnetic. In a normal material, particles would come to a consensus below a certain temperature, with the magnetic poles lining up in either the same direction or in alternating directions. But in quantum spin ices, the particles are arranged in such a way that the magnetic poles, or equivalently the spins, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetricity-behaves-electricity">can’t agree</a> even at a temperature of absolute zero (<em>SN: 2/13/11</em>).</p>



<p>The impasse occurs because of the materials’ geometry: The particles are located at the corners of an array of pyramids that are connected at the corners. Conflicts between multiple sets of neighbors mean that the closest these particles can get to harmony is arranging themselves so that two spins face out from each pyramid, and two face in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="605" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1.jpg" alt="particles located at the corners of pyramids in quantum spin ices" class="wp-image-3103911" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-430x383.jpg 430w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-506x450.jpg 506w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-209x186.jpg 209w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092021_ec_quantum-spin_inline1-652x580.jpg 652w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103911">In quantum spin ices, particles (black dots) are located at the corners of an array of pyramids (red). Normally, the spins of the particles (green arrows) arrange so that two are pointing into the pyramid and two out. If that rule is broken, as illustrated, quasiparticles called spinons (orange and blue) form.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103911">S.D. Pace <em>et al</em>/<em>PRL</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This uneasy truce can give rise to disturbances that behave like particles within the material, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasiparticles-help-physicists-make-sense-world">quasiparticles</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/14</em>). Flip particles’ spins around and you can get what are called spinons, quasiparticles that can move through the material and interact with other spinons in a manner akin to electrons and other charged particles found in the world outside the material. The material re-creates the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the piece of particles physics’ standard model that hashes out how electrically charged particles do their thing. But the specifics, including the fine-structure constant, don’t necessarily match those in the wider universe.</p>



<p>So Laumann and colleagues set out to calculate the fine-structure constant in quantum spin ices for the first time. The team pegged the number at about 1/10, instead of 1/137. What’s more, the researchers found that they could change the value of the fine-structure constant by tweaking the properties of the theoretical material. That could help scientists study the effects of altering the fine-structure constant — a test that’s well out of reach in our own universe, where the fine-structure constant is fixed.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, scientists haven’t yet found a material that definitively qualifies as quantum spin ice. But one much-studied prospect is a group of minerals called pyrochlores, which have magnetic ions, or electrically charged atoms, arranged in the appropriate pyramid configuration. Scientists might also be able to study the materials using a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computer</a> or another quantum device designed to simulate quantum spin ices (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>If scientists succeed in creating quantum spin ice, the materials could reveal how quantum electrodynamics and the standard model would work in a universe with a much larger fine-structure constant. “That would be the hope,” says condensed matter theorist Shivaji Sondhi of the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the research. “It’s interesting to be able to make a fake standard model … and ask what would happen.”</p>

Haas at the University of Georgia, US, and Kazufumi Omura at Yamagata University, Japan, report some cultural differences in susceptibility to it. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211036873">Their paper</a>, in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, also provides some intriguing hints as to why those differences exist.</p>



<span id="more-43903"></span>



<p>In the first of two studies, Haas and Omura analysed existing data on around 5,000 middle-aged Japanese and American participants. Participants answered questions about their life satisfaction, family relationships, work situation, health and financial situation at three different time points: currently, 10 years in the past and predicted for 10 years in the future. The difference between a person’s level of reported past change and predicted future change became their End of History Illusion (EoHI) score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analysis showed that both the American and Japanese groups were susceptible to the illusion in relation to life satisfaction, family relationships and work situation, but the Americans were <em>more</em> susceptible — they reported more past vs predicted future change compared to Japanese participants.</p>



<p>Haas and Omura then looked at the participants’ scores on a measure of self-esteem. They found that among the Americans only, people who had higher self-esteem tended to be more susceptible to the illusion. The Americans also tended to feel more negatively about their pasts than their current state, whereas the Japanese participants tended to report that their pasts were more positive than their current state. The idea of personal growth — of striving for improvement and the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; — is much more popular and important in the US than in Japan. For Americans, viewing their past in a harsher light could help them to feel that they have really grown and improved, supporting their self-esteem.</p>



<p>For their second study, Haas and Omura turned to personality. The pair recruited just over 1,600 online participants from the US and Japan. All completed simple personality tests for themselves as they were currently, but also as they felt they had been 10 years ago and would be in another decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting the earlier pattern of results, Americans tended to report more past than predicted future personality change than the Japanese participants. They also tended to view their past personalities negatively, compared with their present personalities, while those from Japan tended to report their past selves relatively similar to their present selves.</p>



<p>Once again, higher self-esteem scores were linked to more reported past personality change for the Americans. But this time, Haas and Omura also looked at scores on a measure of &#8220;self concept clarity&#8221; — essentially, how well people feel that they know themselves. They found that higher scores on self-concept clarity — which were more common among the Americans — were linked to predictions of less present-to-future personality change. Why should this be?  It might be that Americans are more concerned with feeling that they &#8220;know themselves&#8221;: “Predicting that one’s self will remain stable in the future may aid in preserving confidence in self-knowledge,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Overall, they add: “these findings show that US Americans’ view of their personality development is in part driven by their motivation to believe that they have grown and improved in relation to the past and that they will be stable moving forward in the future.”</p>



<p>There are some limitations to the work. It would have been interesting to also know actual as well as estimated personality and life satisfaction scores over the 20-year period. This type of study would clearly take decades to run, however.</p>



<p>Haas and Omura argue that the work supports the idea that our life stories are central to how we think of ourselves through time — but also shows that different cultures don’t necessarily feature the same life stories. “The EoHI helps to paint a picture that one has changed substantially in the past and is now in a relatively stable good position,” the pair writes. “Although this illusion seems to exist across different cultures, US Americans seem to paint the picture of the EoHI with relatively more vivid colours than Japanese.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-pfizer-vaccine-kids-5-11-safe-works-infection">Pfizer says its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and works well for kids ages 5–11</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elementary school–age children may soon be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>



<p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German biotech company partner BioNTech reported September 20 that a low dose of their <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results">mRNA vaccine is safe for children</a>.</p>



<p>There are hints that the vaccine also protects against the coronavirus. The 10-microgram shots given to kids aged 5- to 11-years-old is a third of the dose given to people 12 and older. Yet after getting two shots 21 days apart, the younger kids produced levels of protective antibodies comparable to the levels made by 16- to 25-year-olds given two full doses. The companies, which shared the early results via a news release, did not report any data on protection against infection, hospitalization or death from the virus.</p>



<p>That preliminary report is promising, says Debbie-Ann Shirley, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and medical director of the COVID-19 clinic. Side effects from the vaccine were similar to those seen in older children with most being “brief, quickly resolved and mild.”</p>

<p>Pfizer indicated that it will soon seek emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use of the vaccine in 5- to 11-year-olds. Both the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must still vet and sign off on use of the vaccine in kids. “We’re still a couple of steps away before we might be able to put it into the arms of children,” Shirley says.</p>



<p>The news comes as cases of COVID-19 among children remain at their highest levels since the pandemic began, mostly driven by infections with delta variant. In the United States, <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%209.16%20FINAL.pdf">nearly 226,000 children were diagnosed</a> with the disease in the week ending September 16, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. While COVID-19 remains a mild disease for most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">who become infected</a>, a total of <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3">516 children have died of COVID-19</a> since the beginning of the pandemic, including 100 who died since August 4 (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Soaring infections</h3>



<p>After dipping to 8,447 child cases the week ending June 24, the coronavirus has made a resurgence fueled by the delta variant. COVID-19 infections in children in the United States have reached record levels in recent weeks, peaking at 251,781 cases the week ending September 2. That peak surpasses the previous record of 211,466 cases, set the week ending January 14 in the midst of the pandemic’s winter surge. These data are from 49 states (Nebraska stopped reporting COVID-19 data at the end of June), New York City, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam.</p>

</div>



<p>Along with the upsurge of cases, hospitalizations of children with COVID-19 have also skyrocketed, taxing pediatric health systems in some places. Most of the adolescents hospitalized are unvaccinated, even though they are eligible to get the shots, Shirley says. Nationally, about 52 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds have gotten at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, CDC data show.</p>



<p>Also troubling is that doctors are now seeing an uptick in cases of MIS-C, an inflammatory condition that strikes weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Even if the initial infection was mild or asymptomatic, the inflammatory syndrome can cause organ failure and death in otherwise healthy children. At UVA, “last week we started to see an increase in MIS-C cases right on target,” Shirley says.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/52Dm6C9xjm4/">Identity in Peer Review: Looking Forward, Looking Back</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em>This post is written by PLOS&rsquo; Editorial Director Suzanne Farley</em></p>



<p>Peer Review Week didn&rsquo;t exist when I got my start in STM publishing. 2021&rsquo;s celebration of this tenacious tenet of quality control in scholarly communication has me meandering down memory lane. Back in the day of small-scale publishing in Australia, we were still mailing unsolicited hardcopy manuscripts to prospective peer reviewers. Editorial feedback was scribbled in the margins. And everything was tracked in a desk-sized, color-coded ledger. Ah, how I loved its color-coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back then, consideration of &lsquo;identity&rsquo;&mdash;the <a href="https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com/peer-review-week-2021/">theme of Peer Review Week</a> this year&mdash;was extremely limited. Does the invitee have the right subject-expertise? Do they work with the authors? Have I sent them any other manuscripts recently? &lsquo;DEI&rsquo; was not an acronym that any of us could have defined even though diverse perspectives, discussion, and collaboration have always been key to strengthening scientific progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A New Era of Peer Review</strong></p>



<p>Fast-forward two decades and DEI frameworks and approaches&nbsp;are rightly being centered in scholarly communication discussions, resulting in better benchmarks and knowledge-sharing that give publishers and other organizations the means to better track and hold ourselves accountable for creating a&nbsp; genuinely inclusive academic ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But enhancing diversity necessitates establishing identity, and many of us are struggling with the practicalities. Our go-to databases for sourcing peer reviewers don&rsquo;t include reliable demographic indicators. We make clumsy inferences based on names and locations, while trying to be mindful of our own unconscious biases. We manually trawl non-traditional sources. New lists of historically under-represented researchers are popping up all the time, but they are yet to be centrally curated. And what about <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR</a>? Doing it right takes more time. And no one wants peer review to take longer than it already does.</p>



<p>Despite the challenges, we all as publishers owe a duty to the trust and integrity of the scientific record to be actively involved in bringing the distinct identities and unique perspectives, knowledge, and diversity of all researchers to the process. Doing it right takes organizational commitment&mdash;including investment in extra resources and new ways of working. At PLOS, a new DEI-focused workflow for recruitment of Editorial Board members (EBMs) ensures we&rsquo;re casting a wider net. (Want to be considered? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/join-editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign-up here</a>!). Establishing a baseline so we can track improvements is also underway; a DEI-focused survey of EBMs will be deployed soon. And <a href="https://plos.org/resources/editor-center/conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Editorial Board Member Code of Conduct</a> headlines inclusion and bias minimization.</p>



<p>A core tenet for PLOS has been to increase transparency at all stages of review and to offer inclusive forms of assessment for the researchers and reviewers involved in publishing. Authors who have published in our journals are often invited to peer review. Researchers at institutions with whom PLOS has partnered are another potential source of new expertise. So, we&rsquo;ve been focusing on expanding our global footprint. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our newest journals</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/partnering-with-tcc-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership with TCC Africa</a>, are just two examples of this effort. And the transparency of PLOS&rsquo; manuscript processing&mdash;where peer reviewers can choose to sign their reports, and authors can choose to publish their peer review commentary&mdash;confers visibility; seeing those with whom one identifies making a valuable contribution to a community encourages participation.</p>



<p><strong>Celebrating Reviewers in Peer Review</strong></p>



<p>Peer review will still be around long after I&rsquo;ve left scholarly publishing. There&rsquo;ll be ever more ways of doing it&mdash;formal and informal, pre-and post-publication, blinded and unblinded&mdash;facilitated by ever more platforms and technologies. A diversity of models which will hopefully be mirrored by a diversity of participatory identities.</p>



<p>However the future of peer review takes shape, it is important to continue highlighting and celebrating the individual contributions that reviewers make every day. PLOS is thankful to all reviewers that work with us and we look forward to continuing to learn from their individual experiences and tackling challenges in peer review together.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-10-scientific-surprises-science-news-first-100-years">The Top 10 scientific surprises of Science News’ first 100 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>From the day Archimedes cut his bath short to shout “Eureka,” science has been a constant source of surprises.</p>



<p>Even after the abundant accumulation of knowledge in the intervening two millennia, science still retains the capacity to astonish, and the century since <em>Science News</em> began reporting has produced its share of shocking discoveries. Some such surprises happened suddenly (if not necessarily with eureka moments); in other cases, revolutionary shifts in understanding took a while to seep slowly into general scientific awareness.</p>



<p>In either case, <em>Science News</em> was sooner or later on the job during the last 100 years, identifying and reporting the never-ending series of surprises, too numerous to mention here, except for my Top 10.</p>



<h3>10. Parity violation</h3>





<p>In the 20th century, physicists established the importance of mathematical symmetries in the laws of nature. While all sorts of changes occur in the physical world, the equations describing them remain the same. So it seemed obvious that viewing the universe in a mirror — switching left and right — should have no effect on the accuracy of those equations. Hermann Weyl, a prominent mathematician who died in 1955, boldly stated that “there can be no doubt that all natural laws are invariant with respect to an interchange of right with left.”</p>



<p>But then in 1956 physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang published a theoretical paper suggesting otherwise, and almost immediately two teams of experimenters showed that nature did indeed distinguish left from right (in technical terms, violating parity). Radioactive beta decay of cobalt atoms and the decay of unstable particles called muons both exhibited a left-right disparity in the directions traveled by the emitted beta particles — a major surprise. “It was socko!” recalled Leon Lederman, one of the experimenters, in an interview four decades later. “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-atomic-matter-laws">New atomic matter laws</a>” proclaimed the headline in <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor to <em>Science News</em>, with the subhead declaring the results “a revolution in theoretical physics.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>





<h3>9. Inert gases make compounds</h3>



<p>In the 1890s, chemists added a whole new family of elements to Dmitrii Mendeleev’s periodic table — the inert gases. Helium (detected on the sun decades earlier but not on Earth until 1895), neon, argon, xenon, krypton and radon had been previously missed because they did not — as far as anybody could tell — make compounds with other elements. Those reaction-resistant atoms became known as the inert or noble gases, as under ordinary conditions they all existed in the gaseous state. Textbooks all taught that the arrangement of electrons around the inert gas atoms precluded any opportunity for chemical combination.</p>



<p>Yet in 1962, a <em>Science News Letter</em> headline proclaimed “‘<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/impossible-compound-made-inert-gas">Impossible’ compound made with inert gas</a>.” That article reported a xenon compound, xenon tetrafluoride, created at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, while acknowledging that earlier in 1962 chemist Neil Bartlett had already prepared another xenon compound, xenon-platinum hexafluoride. Chemists had to scramble to revise their textbooks, and scientists everywhere were reminded that you shouldn’t always believe what you’re told.</p>



<h3>8. Plate tectonics</h3>



<p>In the 1960s, many earth scientists were stunned to learn that the textbooks describing the planet’s history needed to be thrown away. Alfred Wegener, however, would not have been so surprised. Wegener, who died in 1930, was an astronomer-turned-meteorologist who dabbled in paleontology and geophysics. In 1915 he wrote a book proposing that the Earth’s continents had once been assembled in a single land mass, called Pangaea; they then, over millions of years, drifted apart to their positions on today’s world map. That map is not a permanent portrait of the Earth’s features, Wegener contended, but rather a snapshot snagged from a long-running movie. But few people believed Wegener, and geophysicists argued that such large-scale motion of such huge rigid masses was physically inexplicable. Wegener’s idea of continental drift did not die, though. Geologists knew all about it. But it remained heresy until the 1960s, when magnetic patterns detected on the seafloor suggested that oceans had expanded, pushing the continents away from one another.</p>



<p>“New evidence … supports the long-debated theory that continents were once connected and have drifted apart,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/evidence-continents-drift"><em>Science News Letter</em> reported in 1963</a>. Further work over the next few years showed that continental drift was a symptom of elaborate mechanisms inside the Earth that came to be known as plate tectonics. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">Plate tectonics explains</a> not only the locations of the continents, but also how mountain ranges form and why earthquakes cluster in well-delineated zones of seismic activity. By 1969, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/time-theory"><em>Science News</em> quoted experts</a> declaring that it was time for “plate tectonics to be accepted as a basic theoretical model in geophysics.” And while many authorities for years remained reluctant to accept it, the decades following confirmed the surprising conclusion that Wegener had been essentially correct.</p>



<h3>7. DNA makes genes</h3>



<p>One of the last century’s most dramatic discoveries came in 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick, aided by an X-ray image produced by Rosalind Franklin, figured out the double helix structure of the genetic molecule DNA. But perhaps the bigger surprise came a few years earlier, when Oswald Avery and colleagues at Rockefeller University in New York City showed that DNA was the substance that genes are made from. Although the reality of genes had been established in the early years of the 20th century, nobody had any good evidence about their physical structure. In the 1920s, “people were just as vague about what genes were … as they are now about consciousness,” Crick said in a 1998 interview. “The more professional people in the field … thought that it was a problem that was too early to tackle.”</p>

Barrington Brown/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>By the 1940s, the predominant view was that genes must be constructed from proteins of some sort. DNA was just an obscure organic acid. But in 1944, Avery and colleagues demonstrated that genes consisted of strands of DNA, not proteins. <em>Science News Letter</em>, however, apparently did not notice the Avery paper, citing instead two subsequent studies, in 1950 and 1952, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chemical-cell-clue-way-heredity-works">confirming DNA as the genetic material</a>. In 1953, though, <em>Science News Letter</em> recognized the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/top-1953-science-stories">DNA double helix structure as the top science story of the year</a>. “Way life is handed on” headlined <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/way-life-handed">the story on Watson and Crick’s proposal for how DNA replication</a> serves as the basis for heredity.</p>



<h3>6. Dark energy</h3>



<p>By the 1990s, the Big Bang theory of the expanding universe had been established beyond reasonable doubt, but questions remained. Chief among them was the fate of the universe. Most experts believed that the gravitational pull of mass throughout the universe was slowing its expansion down. But they debated whether there was enough mass to reverse the expansion altogether, shrinking the cosmos into a “big crunch.” Some thought the universe would expand forever, if at an ever-diminishing rate.</p>



<p>The plot in that story twisted rather shockingly in 1998, when two teams of astronomers reported measurements of light from distant supernovas. Those reports, subsequently bolstered by additional data, revealed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">universal expansion was not slowing, but accelerating</a>. Some repulsive force, nicknamed “dark energy” in the absence of firm knowledge of its true nature, apparently pervades the cosmos. Researchers were “stunned to find that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-138">cosmos was expanding 10 to 15 percent more slowly in the past</a> than can be accounted for” without a repulsive force today, <em>Science News</em> reported.</p>



<h3>5. Dark matter</h3>



<p>In the 1930s, physicist-astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that the velocities of galaxies moving within a group called the Coma cluster seemed to defy expectations based on the gravitational effects of the visible mass. Zwicky concluded that some unseen matter — he called it <em>dunkle Materie</em>, or “dark matter” — must be lurking in the cluster to reconcile the observations with the law of gravity. Later astronomer Horace Babcock and others noticed a similar discrepancy in the outer reaches of some galaxies: Stars revolved around a galaxy’s outer edges much faster than allowed by the galaxy’s apparent mass. In the 1970s and thereafter, astronomer Vera Rubin and collaborators confirmed the rapid velocity of the outer stars in many galaxies. As <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/light-halo-hints-galaxys-dark-matter"><em>Science News</em> reported in 1994</a>, “Such behavior is a dead giveaway that the visible disk of these galaxies lies embedded in a much larger and more massive halo of unseen material.”</p>

<p>While the realization that most of the universe’s matter couldn’t be seen was surprising enough, an even greater surprise came when several lines of evidence affirmed that the dark matter could not be of the same type of matter known on Earth, composed primarily of protons and neutrons. Dark matter’s actual identity remains a mystery to this day; physicists have proposed some well-motivated possibilities, but the prospect remains that dark matter’s true nature will also come as a surprise.</p>



<h3>4. Atomic bomb and nuclear fission</h3>



<p>From the time of the discovery of radioactivity, physicists had speculated on the hidden energy packed into every piece of matter. And after Einstein published his famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, it was clear that the amount of that energy would be enormous. But most experts doubted there would be any practical way to release such energy for useful purposes, or warfare weaponry. But in late 1938, chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann found that experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons produced evidence of the much lighter element barium. Lise Meitner (who had collaborated with Hahn before fleeing Nazi Germany) and her nephew Otto Frisch figured out what had happened — the uranium nucleus had been split into pieces. Frisch immediately told Niels Bohr, about to board a ship for America. And soon after Bohr arrived, the word was out. “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-energy-released">Atomic energy released” headlined a <em>Science News Letter</em> cover story</a> in early 1939, while reassuring its readers that “physicists are anxious that there be no public alarm over the possibility of the world being blown to bits by their experiments.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="403" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680.jpg" alt="black and white photos of the atomic bomb explosions" class="wp-image-3099698" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680-646x383.jpg 646w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/010521_ts_centennial-top-10-surprises_inline2_680-314x186.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3099698">In 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima (left) and Nagasaki (right). <em>Science News Letter</em> called the bombs “doomsday thunderbolts.”</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3099698">From left: George R. Caron/Wikimedia Commons; Charles Levy/Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Soon, though, nuclear fission was transformed into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">a massive war project for building an unimaginably powerful explosive</a>, shocking the world with its potential for destruction, while offering only partially fulfilled hope for a reliable source of useful energy. “Doomsday thunderbolts,” as <em>Science News Letter</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mass-collaboration">labeled the atomic bombs dropped on Japan</a>, “herald a revolution in war such as has not been seen since the first use of gunpowder, and later on another revolution in industry probably greater than the one ushered in by the invention of the steam engine.”</p>



<h3>3. Expanding universe</h3>



<p>Philosophers and physicists alike had long pondered deep questions about the nature of the universe — whether it was finite or infinite, for instance, or whether it had a beginning or had existed eternally. But just about everybody believed that on the whole it never changed, but rather just existed, its objects rotating and revolving in cycles that forever repeated. Only a rare few (the poet Edgar Allan Poe, for example) had imagined an evolving, changing universe. But in the 1920s, mathematician Alexander Friedmann suggested that the universe might be growing or shrinking, based on his solutions to the equations of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Einstein himself had noticed that possibility earlier, but altered his equations so that they would predict an unchanging universe, as he knew of no evidence that it was otherwise.</p>



<p>But such evidence was already being collected, in measurements of the colors of light emitted by distant nebulae (later called galaxies). Analysis of that data led Edwin Hubble to show, in 1929, that the farther away a galaxy was, the faster it was flying away — implying (although Hubble didn’t immediately agree) that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">the universe is in fact expanding</a>. “The distant nebulae are rushing away from us at tremendous speeds and thus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/death-universe-required-physical-law-may-be-avoided">the real universe is constantly expanding</a>,” <em>Science News Letter</em> reported in 1931.</p>



<h3>2. Antimatter</h3>



<p>In 1930, <em>Science News-Letter</em> reported on an incredibly bold proposal by a young British physicist named Paul Dirac. He argued that matter — the solidity from which physical objects are constructed — was in fact nothing more than a bunch of “holes” in the vacuum of space. Space, he suggested, is not empty, but rather completely full of electrons endowed with “negative energy.” Those negative energy electrons could not be detected. But in spots where a negative-energy electron had been given enough energy to lift it from the negative-energy sea, a hole would form, like an empty bubble in an ocean. The absence of the electron would make the hole appear to have a positive electric charge.</p>



<p>Dirac presumed such positively charged bubbles in the negative-energy ocean would correspond to protons, the fundamental particle making up the bulk of the mass of all atoms — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/material-objects-seen-holes-space-british-scientist">in other words, all matter</a>. But that turned out not to be the surprise, because Dirac was wrong. He soon realized that the positively charged holes could not be protons, but rather must be much lighter, with the same mass as an ordinary negatively charged electron. Dirac thus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">predicted the existence of antimatter, an entirely novel idea</a>. An ordinary electron meeting its antimatter particle would disappear by filling the hole, releasing a burst of energy in the process.</p>



<p>Dirac’s “anti-electron” was very shortly thereafter detected in cosmic rays by physicist Carl Anderson, who reported “the probable existence of a … <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-106">positively charged particle of the mass of the familiar negative electron</a>.” &nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Uncertainty principle</h3>



<p>In 1927, Werner Heisenberg announced his uncertainty principle, the core idea underlying the newborn math for describing nature known as quantum mechanics. Heisenberg’s principle expressed the shocking realization that the unbroken chain of cause and effect deduced from Newtonian physics was an illusion, an approximation that nature did not observe on the subatomic scale. It took a couple of years, but <em>Science News-Letter</em> proclaimed “‘<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/uncertainty-principle-enters-science">Uncertainty principle’ enters science</a>” in a 1929 headline. “Crudely stated, the new theory holds that chance rules the physical world,” the article announced. “These weird sounding consequences arise from the contention that a particle may have an exact place or an exact speed, but it can not have both.” The report called it a “disturbing idea” that would “revolutionize the ideas of the universe … to an even greater extent than Einstein’s relativity” and was sure to make a stir “once philosophers and laymen begin their attempts at its interpretation.” Such attempts continue today — and any future interpretation succeeding in forging a consensus will surely come as an especially unexpected surprise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-mega-constellations-night-sky-stars-simulations">Satellite swarms may outshine the night sky’s natural constellations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fleets of private satellites orbiting Earth will be visible to the naked eye in the next few years, sometimes all night long.</p>



<p>Companies like SpaceX and Amazon have launched hundreds of satellites into low orbits since 2019, with plans to launch thousands more in the works — a trend that’s alarming astronomers. The goal of these satellite “mega-constellations” is to bring high-speed internet around the globe, but<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy"> these bright objects threaten</a> to disrupt astronomers’ ability to observe the cosmos (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>). “For astronomers, this is kind of a pants-on-fire situation,” says radio astronomer Harvey Liszt of the National Radio Astronomical Observatory in Charlottesville, Va.</p>



<p>Now, a new simulation of the potential positions and brightness of these satellites shows that, contrary to earlier predictions, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04328">casual sky watchers will have their view disrupted</a>, too. And parts of the world will be affected more than others, astronomer Samantha Lawler of the University of Regina in Canada and her colleagues report in a paper posted September 9 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“How will this affect the way the sky looks to your eyeballs?” Lawler asks. “We humans have been looking up at the night sky and analyzing patterns there for as long as we’ve been human. It’s part of what makes us human.” These mega-constellations could mean “we’ll see a human-made pattern more than we can see the stars, for the first time in human history.”</p>





<p>Flat, smooth surfaces on satellites can reflect sunlight depending on their position in the sky. Earlier research had suggested that most of the new satellites would not be visible with the naked eye.</p>



<p>Lawler, along with Aaron Boley of the University of British Columbia and Hanno Rein of the University of Toronto at Scarborough in Canada, started building their simulation with public data about the launch plans of four companies — SpaceX’s Starlink, Amazon’s Kuiper, OneWeb and StarNet/GW — that had been filed with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the International Telecommunications Union. The filings detailed the expected orbital heights and angles of 65,000 satellites that could be launched over the next few years.</p>



<p>“It’s impossible to predict the future, but this is realistic,” says astronomer Meredith Rawls of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the new study. “A lot of times when people make these simulations, they pick a number out of a hat. This really justifies the numbers that they pick.”</p>



<p>There are currently about <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/osoindex/search-ng.jspx?lf_id=#?c=%7B%22filters%22:%5B%7B%22fieldName%22:%22en%23object.status.inOrbit_s1%22,%22value%22:%22Yes%22%7D%5D,%22sortings%22:%5B%7B%22fieldName%22:%22object.launch.dateOfLaunch_s1%22,%22dir%22:%22desc%22%7D%5D%7D">7,890 objects in Earth orbit</a>, about half of which are operational satellites, according to the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-spacex-crew-launch-mars-satellites-2020">that number is increasing fast</a> as companies launch more and more satellites (<em>SN: 12/28/20</em>). In August 2020, there were only about 2,890 operational satellites.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers computed how many satellites will be in the sky at different times of year, at different hours of the night and from different positions on Earth’s surface. They also estimated how bright the satellites were likely to be at different hours of the day and times of the year.</p>



<p>That calculation required a lot of assumptions because companies aren’t required to publish details about their satellites like the materials they’re made of or their precise shapes, both of which can affect reflectivity. But there are enough satellites in orbit that Lawler and colleagues could compare their simulated satellites to the light reflected down to Earth by the real ones.</p>



<p>The simulations showed that “the way the night sky is going to change will not affect all places equally,” Lawler says. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04328">places where naked-eye stargazing</a> will be most affected are at latitudes 50° N and 50° S, regions that cross lower Canada, much of Europe, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, and the southern tips of Chile and Argentina, the researchers found.</p>

<p>“The geometry of sunlight in the summer means there will be hundreds of visible satellites all night long,” Lawler says. “It’s bad everywhere, but it’s worse there.” For her, this is personal: She lives at 50° N.</p>



<p>Closer to the equator, where many research observatories are located, there is a period of about three hours in the winter and near the time of the spring and fall equinoxes with few or no sunlit satellites visible. But there are still hundreds of sunlit satellites all night at these locations in the summer.</p>



<p>A few visible satellites can be a fun spectacle, Lawler concedes. “I think we really are at a transition point here where right now, seeing a satellite, or even a Starlink train, is cool and different and wow, that’s amazing,” she says. “I used to look up when the [International Space Station] was overhead.” But she compares the coming change to watching one car go down the road 100 years ago, versus living next to a busy freeway now.</p>



<p>“Every sixteenth star will actually be moving,” she says. “I hope I’m wrong. I’ve never wanted to be wrong about a simulation more than this. But without mitigation, this is what the sky will look like in a few years.”</p>



<p>Astronomers have been <a href="https://aas.org/satellite-constellations-2-workshop">meeting with representatives</a> from private companies, as well as space lawyers and government officials, to work out compromises and mitigation strategies. Companies have been testing ways to reduce reflectivity, like shading the satellites with a “visor.” Other proposed strategies include limiting the satellites to lower orbits, where they move faster across the sky and leave a fainter streak in telescope images. Counterintuitively, lower satellites may be better for some astronomy research, Rawls says. “They move out of the way quick.”</p>



<p>But that lower altitude strategy will mean more visible satellites for other parts of the world, and more that are visible to the naked eye. “There’s not some magical orbital altitude that solves all our problems,” Rawls says. “There are some latitudes on Earth where no matter what altitude you put your satellites at, they’re going to be all over the darn place. The only way out of this is fewer satellites.”</p>



<p>There are currently no regulations concerning how bright a satellite can be or how many satellites a private company can launch. Scientists are grateful that companies are willing to work with them, but nervous that their cooperation is voluntary.</p>



<p>“A lot of the people who work on satellites care about space. They’re in this industry because they think space is awesome,” Rawls says. “We share that, which helps. But it doesn’t fix it. I think we need to get some kind of regulation as soon as possible.” (Representatives from Starlink, Kuiper and OneWeb did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>



<p>Efforts are under way to bring the issue to the attention of the United Nations and to try to use existing environmental regulations to place limits on satellite launches, says study coauthor Boley (who also lives near 50° N).</p>



<p>Analogies to other global pollution problems, like space junk, can provide inspiration and precedents, he says. “There are a number of ways forward. We shouldn’t just lose hope. We can do things about this.”</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/the-census-and-entitled-resentment/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-17-15_56_36-census-2020usagraphic-1.jpg-1-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Entitled people tend to resist and resent change. For entitled white people, the latest Census data triggers panic at being replaced by those who have historically been on the margins. Whites have enjoyed being at the center of society. Politicians legislate to their needs. White people are able to move through society without being derailed or diminished by racism.</p><p>Political conservatives are both <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12380">against immigration and more entitled</a> than Democrats. And now white people, particularly those who voted for Donald Trump, see the coming demographic change as them being pushed out of the center of society and into the margins. They fear being moved into the position that immigrants and people of color have historically occupied.</p><p>From a psychological perspective, entitlement refers to one’s sense of deservingness. Entitled people believe they deserve more than others. They tend to have expectations that do not match their input, their performance, or the reality on the ground. One’s level of entitlement emerges from a variety of factors, but one’s proximity to power is a major contributor to entitlement. Those closest to power, including cultural power, are more likely to have an outsized sense of entitlement. Groups seen as the cultural default, the standard, “normal” identity in a category, have higher levels of entitlement. So, for example, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-00497-001">men tend to feel more entitled</a> than women.</p><p>Now pair United States demographic change with the rising income inequality of the last 30 years and you have entitled resentment. Too many white Republicans who are struggling economically avoid looking up at billionaires who benefit from an unequal system that allows them to pay virtually no taxes. Instead, they punch down at poor people and people of color whom they scapegoat even though they are not the cause of their economic struggles. Rather than seeing those who don’t share their ethnicity (but do their economy) as allies, they see them as enemies.</p><p>Republican politicians take advantage of the lack of coalitions across race and ethnicity tapping this resentment. Republican policies are unpopular. Their position on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/11/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/">guns</a> is unpopular.

And thus, you have the Republican strategy for winning elections. Republicans lose if everyone votes. In 2020 Donald Trump admitted, “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus">you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again</a>” if voting was made easier. And so, Republicans are passing legislation to make voting more difficult.

Will Not. Replace Us!</a>” chant at the recently reported Census trends. The 2020 Census <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/population-changes-nations-diversity.html">data</a> are in and, as expected, the white population in the US has decreased while the number of Asian Americans and Latinx Americans has increased. Whites remain the largest racial/ethnic group, but their numbers have decreased to just under 60% of the US population. In addition, rural areas of the country with concentrated numbers of white people are shrinking. Correspondingly, counties that voted for Donald Trump are declining. For instance, Trump won <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/08/2020-census-shrinking-counties-voted-trump.html">90% of the 1,600</a> counties that shrank in population between 2010 and 2020.</p><p>What hasn’t shrunk is Trump voters’ fear and panic at being replaced. Fear of the great replacement, as its been called by white supremacists, is a predictable outcome of white entitlement.</p><p>Entitlement is more than a psychological characteristic and its implications reach beyond the entitled individual. Entitlement produces panic in the privileged when they perceive their way of life changing.</p><p><strong>Read the </strong><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780197578438.001.0001/oso-9780197578438-chapter-1?utm_campaign=oupac-campaign:1364642626130777763&amp;utm_source=oupblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=text&amp;utm_term=textlink"><strong>introductory chapter</strong></a><strong> from </strong><em><strong>Enraged, Rattled, and Wronged</strong></em><strong> freely available until 31 October 2021.</strong></p><p>Featured image via <em>US Census Bureau Graphic of United States for 2020 Census</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/666915962/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/666915962/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f09%2f2021-09-17-15_56_36-census-2020usagraphic-1.jpg-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/666915962/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/">&#8220;Stop acting like a child&#8221;: police denial of Black childhood</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/the-importance-of-international-coordination-of-environmental-policies/">The importance of international coordination of environmental policies</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/09/lessons-learned-will-suffering-through-one-pandemic-help-prevent-another/">Lessons learned&#x2014;will suffering through one pandemic help prevent another?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marguerite-vogt-polio-virus-lab-research-virology">By taking on poliovirus, Marguerite Vogt transformed the study of all viruses</a></h4>

              
                <p>When nobody else wanted the job, Marguerite Vogt stepped in.</p>



<p>Working from early morning until late at night in a small, isolated basement laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, Vogt painstakingly handled test tubes and petri dishes under a fume hood: incubating, pipetting, centrifuging, incubating again. She was trying to grow a dangerous pathogen: poliovirus.</p>



<p>It was 1952 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/now-polio">polio was one of the most feared diseases in America</a>, paralyzing more than 15,000 people, mostly children, each year. Parents <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/dos-and-donts-polio">wouldn’t let their children play outside</a>, and quarantines were instituted in neighborhoods with polio cases.</p>

<p>Scientists were desperate for information about the virus, but many were hesitant to work with the infectious agent. “Everybody was afraid to go to that little lab in the basement,” says Martin Haas, professor of biology and oncology at the University of California, San Diego, and a personal friend and collaborator of Vogt’s for over three decades.</p>



<p>Vogt, a brand-new research associate in the laboratory of Renato Dulbecco, took on the task of attempting to grow and isolate the virus on a layer of monkey kidney cells. The method was called a plaque assay for the distinctive round plaques that form when a single virus particle kills all the cells around it.</p>



<p>Vogt didn’t tell her parents, both acclaimed scientists in Germany, that she was working with the virus. She later remarked that her father would have been very angry had he known of her poliovirus work, Haas says.</p>

The disease paralyzed many thousands of people each year, mostly children.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103669">AP Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>After a year of persistence, Vogt succeeded (and remained virus-free). In 1954, she and Dulbecco <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2180341/">published</a> the method for purifying and counting poliovirus particles. It was immediately used by other scientists to study variants of poliovirus, and by microbiologist Albert Sabin to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/develop-new-polio-vaccine">identify and isolate strains of weakened poliovirus</a> to make<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/live-oral-polio-vaccine-proved-safe-and-effective"> the oral polio vaccine</a> used in mass vaccination campaigns around the world.</p>



<p>Perhaps even more importantly, the poliovirus plaque assay enabled scientists worldwide to analyze animal viruses at the level of individual cells, a field now known as molecular virology. Vogt and Dulbecco’s approach remains the gold standard for purifying and counting virus particles, including in recent studies of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The method, used to measure how infectious a virus is and isolate strains of a virus for further research, is ubiquitous in labs around the world.</p>

<p>Throughout a career spanning three-quarters of a century, beginning with a publication when she was 14 years old, Vogt contributed extensively to our knowledge of the genetics of animal development, how viruses can cause cancer and cellular life cycles. Upon her death in 2007 at the age of 94, nearly 100 three-ring binders lined the shelves of her office, filled with notes on decades of experiments.</p>



<p>Vogt was known for her intense, inventive lab work, including what others have called her “green thumb” for tissue culture — the process of growing cells, viruses and tissues in a dish.</p>



<p>“Being a meticulous person, she worried about every detail of the process of cell culture,” says David Baltimore, biologist and president emeritus of Caltech who worked for three years in a lab close to Dulbecco’s. “That’s really important, because it is finicky. Long experience and precise handling are key to getting good data.”</p>



<p>Born in 1913, Vogt grew up in Germany surrounded by science. The younger daughter of two pioneers of brain research, Oskar and Cécile Vogt, she and her sister Marthe were budding scientists from their youth. Marguerite Vogt’s first paper, published in 1927, investigated the genetics of fruit fly development.</p>

<p>But a year after receiving her M.D. at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in 1936, Vogt and her liberal family were ousted from Berlin by the Nazis. Her parents lost their positions at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research (now the Max Planck Institute), and Oskar was accused of supporting communists. The family avoided arrest or death due to the intercession of the Krupp family, former patients of Oskar’s and well-connected arms manufacturers who supplied the Nazi regime. With funding from the Krupps, Oskar and Cécile set up a private brain research institute in a remote part of Germany’s Black Forest. There, they continued their research and offered shelter and jobs to other people fleeing Nazi persecution.</p>



<p>From her parents’ institute in the Black Forest, Vogt published 39 seminal papers on how hormones and genetics influence the development of fruit flies, work that was later considered ahead of its time. In 1950, with the help of German-American scientists Hermann Muller and Max Delbrück, Vogt emigrated from Germany to the United States. Vogt rarely talked about her experiences during World War II. She never returned to Germany and refused to speak her native tongue with visiting German students and scientists.</p>



<p>After briefly working with Delbrück on bacterial genetics, Vogt went to work for Dulbecco on the poliovirus assay in 1952. After that success, the pair investigated the role of viruses in cancer. Once again, Vogt developed a technique to grow a virus — this time a small DNA-containing virus called polyomavirus — and the pair was able to count how many cells the virus <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC222842/?page=1">transformed</a> into cancer cells. In subsequent papers, the team demonstrated that certain viruses integrate their genetic material into host cell DNA, causing uncontrolled cell growth. The discovery changed the way scientists and doctors thought about cancer, showing that cancer is caused by genetic changes in a cell.</p>

Dulbecco and M. Vogt/<em>J. Exp. Med. </em>1954</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1963, Vogt followed Dulbecco to the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. There, she spent decades studying viruses that can cause tumors, as well as other areas that sparked her interest, such as trying to define a cellular clock. “She was not only very intense, she was very inventive,” says Haas. “She always knew which way to go and what do to.”</p>



<p>Like the early days studying poliovirus, Vogt worked long and hard, typically six days a week, 10 hours per day. “She liked trying new things, so we often tried to do techniques that she had admired in papers she had read, or we learned things from other labs,” says Candy Haggblom, Vogt’s laboratory assistant for the last 30 years of Vogt’s career.</p>



<p>Vogt never married or had children. “Science was my milk,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/10/science/scientist-at-work-marguerite-vogt-a-lifetime-later-still-in-love-with-the-lab.html">told the <em>New York Times</em></a><em> </em>in 2001. But Vogt didn’t lack for company: She was a friend and mentor to many of the young scientists in the lab, four of whom went on to earn Nobel Prizes, and as an accomplished pianist and cellist, Vogt hosted a chamber music group that met at her home every Sunday morning for over 40 years, Haas says.</p>





<p>In 1975, Dulbecco was awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1975/summary/">Nobel Prize in physiology</a> or medicine for work on how tumor viruses transform cells, a prize <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/1975-nobel-prizes">shared with Baltimore and virologist Howard Temin</a>. Vogt was not recognized, and Dulbecco did not acknowledge her in his Nobel lecture.</p>



<p>During her lifetime, Vogt did not receive a single major prize or recognition. Despite an advanced degree and prestigious publication record, Vogt did not become a professor or get her own lab at Salk until after Dulbecco left the institute in 1972. She was 59 years old. That rankled her, says Haas, who cared for Vogt later in her life and thought of her like a mother. “She ran his lab while he ran around the world giving talks,” he says. “Marguerite ran it all.”</p>



<p>At 80, Vogt regularly jogged into the lab early in the morning. At 85, she published her final paper, fittingly about how human cells slow down and lose their ability to replicate with age.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-bone-scraper-tools-animal-skin-leather-pelt-cave-morocco">Stone Age people used bone scrapers to make leather and pelts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Discoveries in a Moroccan cave have provided a rare look at how Stone Age people may have turned animal skins into clothing.</p>



<p>Bone tools, including hide scrapers and stone-tool sharpeners, were unearthed in Morocco’s Contrebandiers cave, say archaeologist Emily Hallett and colleagues. Dating of sediment, burned stones and animal teeth excavated there <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00956-1">shows that the tools are around 90,000 to 120,000 years old</a>, the scientists report September 16 in <em>iScience</em>.</p>



<p>“Prior to major successful dispersals out of Africa and into Eurasia, <em>Homo sapiens</em> [were] making tools for various specialized functions, and those behaviors would have aided them [in] new environments,” says Hallett, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. Different types of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202021">bone tools from around the time of the Moroccan finds</a> have been unearthed at a handful of other African sites, though uses for many of those items remain unclear. Researchers have largely focused on an explosion of African bone tool styles that appeared around 44,000 years ago, after human expansions into Eurasia.</p>



<p>Of 62 bone implements from the cave, seven were hide scrapers. These tools were crafted from pieces of antelope or wild cattle ribs that were split in half lengthwise and worked into a flat, spatula-like shape. Short, deep grooves and polish on these items resulted from scraping animal hides, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The team unearthed the tools along with skinned animals’ bones. Patterns of stone-tool incisions on limb and jaw bones of sand foxes, golden jackals and wildcats resulted from detaching skin at the paws and pulling it over the head in one piece, providing evidence for the way the bone hide scrapers were used, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Ancient humans could have put hides presumably worked into leather or pelts to various uses, though clothing seems especially likely, Hallett says. DNA evidence of body lice origins suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lice-hang-ancient-date-first-clothes">people began wearing clothes at least 190,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 4/20/10</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-tracks-footprints-ancient-elephant-nursery">Fossil tracks may reveal an ancient elephant nursery</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fossilized footprints found on a beach in southern Spain betray what may have been a nursery for an extinct species of elephant.</p>



<p>The track-rich coastal site, which scientists have dubbed the Matalascañas Trampled Surface, is typically covered by 1½ meters of sand, says Clive Finlayson, an evolutionary biologist at the Gibraltar National Museum. But storm surges in the spring of 2020 washed away much of that sand and exposed the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96754-1">preserved footprints of ancient elephants</a>, cattle, deer, pigs, wolves, water birds and even Neandertals, Finlayson and colleagues report September 16 in <em>Scientific Reports. </em>The sandy-clay sediments hosting this trove of tracks were probably laid down about 106,000 years ago, previous studies suggest.</p>



<p>Among the newly uncovered tracks are the first-of-their-kind footprints of newborn <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-shakes-elephant-family-tree">straight-tusked elephants</a> (<em>Palaeoloxodon antiquus</em>), an extinct species that probably died out during the last ice age (<em>SN: 6/13/17</em>). The teeny tracks — which measure 9.6 centimeters across, about the size of a drink coaster — suggest that the petite, possibly 2-month-old pachyderms stood about 66 centimeters tall at their shoulders and weighed around 70 kilograms, slightly heftier than a Newfoundland dog.</p>



<p>Based on previous finds elsewhere of actual bones, adult straight-tusked elephants may have weighed 5.5 metric tons for females and a whopping 13 tons for males.</p>



<p>The mix of elephant tracks at the site suggests that family groups including newborns, juveniles and adult females frequented the area and possibly used it as a nursery, the researchers say. Other fossils found at the site, including those preserving traces of ancient roots, hint that the area was rich in vegetation and speckled with lakes and ponds.</p>

Neto de Carvalho <em>et al</em>/<em>Scientific </em><em>Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team’s findings “are a thrilling study,” says Anthony Martin, a trace fossil expert at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn’t involved in the research. Series of footprints show how the ancient elephants were moving, offer insight into their social structure and even provide a glimpse of their reproductive ecology, he says. If newborns were part of the family group and “if they were acting anything like modern elephants, the mother had to be nearby,” Martin says.</p>



<p>What’s more, the presence of preserved Neandertal footprints at the site suggests that the ancient hominids foraged there and may have preyed upon young elephants or scavenged dead elephants or other creatures, Martin says. The Neandertals “probably were not foolhardy enough to take on a full-sized elephant.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-learn-recognize-calls-mom-eggs-nest-sound-song">Some birds learn to recognize calls while still in their eggs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over a decade ago, behavioral ecologist Diane Colombelli-Négrel was wiring superb fairy wrens’ nests to record the birds’ sounds when she noticed something odd. Mother fairy wrens sang while incubating their eggs, even though it would have made more sense to keep quiet to avoid attracting predators.</p>



<p>The discovery “was a bit of an accident,” says Colombelli-Négrel, of Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. And it made her wonder: Could the baby birds be learning sounds, or perhaps even songs, even before they hatch?</p>



<p>Scientists have long wondered how early in development individuals learn to perceive distinct sounds. It’s known that human fetuses learn to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/language-learning-may-begin-birth">recognize their mother’s voice</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/13</em>). For birds such as superb fairy wrens (<em>Malurus cyaneus</em>) that perfect their songs with parental tutoring, it was thought that sound perception began well after hatching. But when it became obvious that mother birds were intentionally singing to their eggs, “we knew we were on to something,” says avian ecologist Sonia Kleindorfer of the University of Vienna.</p>



<p>Previous research by Colombelli-Négrel, Kleindorfer and colleagues showed that unhatched superb fairy wrens learn <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/birds-have-clever-solution-cuckoo-conundrum">a vocal “password” from mom</a> that helps mothers discriminate their own nestlings from those of pesky cuckoo invaders (<em>SN: 5/9/14</em>). What’s more, unhatched superb fairy wrens <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.1154">appear to distinguish between songs</a> of their own species and others, the team reported in 2014.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="462" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091021_lo_bird-sing_inline1.jpg" alt="Diane Colombelli-Négrel holds a brown bird on her hand" class="wp-image-3103656" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091021_lo_bird-sing_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091021_lo_bird-sing_inline1-564x383.jpg 564w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091021_lo_bird-sing_inline1-662x450.jpg 662w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/091021_lo_bird-sing_inline1-274x186.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103656">Behavioral ecologist Diane Colombelli-Négrel (shown in the Galapagos) has been studying superb fairy wrens and the sounds they make while incubating their eggs for over a decade.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103656">Katharina Peters</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That ability extends beyond superb fairy wrens, new research suggests. At least four additional types of birds recognize <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0247">sounds specific to their species while still in their eggs</a>, the researchers report in the Oct. 25 <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.</em></p>



<p>The finding is a surprise to many birdsong scientists, says vocal learning neuroscientist Wan-chun Liu of Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y., who wasn’t involved in the new research. “We used to think a lot of the learning happened after hatching, but now there seems to be more and more evidence suggesting, even in the embryonic stage … they are listening,” he says.</p>





<p>In birds and humans, a drop in embryonic heart rate is known to indicate attention to a stimulus. Colombelli-Négrel and colleagues’ earlier studies of unhatched fairy wrens showed a slowed heart rate in response to repeated sounds of their own species, but not others.</p>



<p>To investigate whether this phenomenon is widespread among birds, the team turned their attention to the embryonic heartbeats of captive Japanese quail (<em>Coturnix japonica domestica</em>), plus three more wild species: little penguins (<em>Eudyptula minor),</em> red-winged fairy wrens (<em>Malurus elegans)</em> and Darwin’s small ground finches (<em>Geospiza fuliginosa).</em></p>



<p>The team temporarily removed 109 eggs from nests and measured the heart rates of unhatched chicks before, during and after exposure to playbacks of songs from their own species or others. And the researchers investigated whether 138 individual embryos became habituated to repeated sounds of unfamiliar individuals singing their species’ own songs, which would imply learning had occurred.</p>





<p>“We expected to find learning evidence in the songbirds but not in the quail and penguins,” Colombelli-Négrel says. That’s because penguins and quail are “vocal nonlearners” — birds thought to have calls that are genetically programmed from birth and not learned from a tutor.</p>



<p>To the researchers’ surprise, all of the embryos showed not only a slowed heart rate in response to repeated sounds of their own species, but also habituation. That finding suggests that these birds learn to perceive the sounds of their species-specific songs embryonically.</p>



<p>The scientists don’t know why the penguins and quail, which have their own calls genetically baked in, have the ability to distinguish their own species’ calls from those of other birds right from birth. Perhaps it’s useful for survival, the researchers speculate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change-carbon-dioxide-ocean-algae">Australian fires in 2019–2020 had even more global reach than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>The severe, devastating wildfires that raged across southeastern Australia in late 2019 and early 2020 packed a powerful punch that extended far beyond the country, two new studies find.</p>



<p>The blazes injected at least <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03712-y">twice as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere</a> as was previously thought, one team’s satellite-derived estimates revealed. The fires also sent up vast clouds of smoke and ash that wafted far to the east over the Southern Ocean, fertilizing the waters with nutrients and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03805-8">triggering widespread blooms</a> of microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton, another team found. Both studies were published online September 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Meteorologist Ivar van der Velde of the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Leiden and colleagues first examined carbon monoxide data collected over southeastern Australia by the satellite-based instrument TROPOMI from November 2019 to January 2020, during the worst of the fires. Then, to get new estimates of the carbon dioxide emissions attributable to the fires, the team used previously determined ratios of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide emitted by the region’s eucalyptus forests — the predominant type of forest that was scorched in the blazes — during earlier wildfires and prescribed burns.</p>



<p>Van der Velde’s team estimates that the fires released from 517 trillion to 867 trillion grams of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. “The sheer magnitude of CO<sub>2</sub> that was emitted to the atmosphere … was much larger than what we initially thought it would be,” van der Velde says. The emissions “from this single event were significantly higher than what all Australians normally emit with the combustion of fossil fuels in an entire year.”</p>





<p>Previous assessments of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions from the fires, based on estimations of burned area and biomass consumed by the blazes, calculated an average of about 275 trillion grams. Using the satellite-derived carbon monoxide data, the researchers say, dramatically improves the ability to distinguish actual emissions from the fires from other background sources of the gases, giving a more accurate assessment.</p>



<p>That finding has worrisome implications. The fires swiftly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">cut a swath through southeastern Australia’s eucalyptus forests</a>, devastating the forests to a degree that made their rapid recovery more difficult — which in turn affects how much carbon the trees can sequester, van der Velde says (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>). Fires in northern and central Australia’s dry, grassy savannas are seen as more climate neutral because the grasses can regrow more quickly, he says.</p>



<p>And severe fire seasons are likely to become more common in southeastern Australia with ongoing climate change. Climate change has already <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">increased the likelihood of severe fire events such as the 2019–2020 fire season by at least 30 percent</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>The smoke and ash from the fires also packed a powerful punch. Scientists watched in awe as the fires created a “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/willdfire-thunder-pyro-clouds-aerosols-volcanic-eruptions">super outbreak” of towering thunderclouds </a>from December 29 to December 31 in 2019 (<em>SN: 12/15/20</em>). These clouds spewed tiny aerosol particles of ash and smoke high into the stratosphere.</p>



<p>Aerosols from the fires also traveled eastward through the lower atmosphere, ultimately reaching the Southern Ocean where they triggered blooms of phytoplankton in its iron-starved waters. Geochemist Weiyi Tang, now at Princeton University, and colleagues analyzed aerosols from the fires and found the particles to be rich in iron, an important nutrient for the algae. By tracing the atmospheric paths of the cloud of ash and smoke across the ocean, the team was able to link the observed blooms — huge patches of chlorophyll detected by satellite — to the fires.</p>

<p>Researchers have long thought that fires can trigger ocean blooms, particularly in the Southern Ocean, under the right conditions, says marine biogeochemist Joan Llort, now at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and a coauthor on the study. But this research marks the most direct observation ever made of such an event — in part because it was such a massive one, Llort says.</p>



<p>Large ocean blooms are “yet another process which is potentially being modified by climate change,” says biogeochemist Nicolas Cassar of Duke University, also a coauthor on the study.</p>



<p>One of the big questions to emerge from the study, Cassar adds, is just how much carbon these phytoplankton may have ultimately removed from the atmosphere as they bloomed. Some of the carbon that the algae draw out of the air through photosynthesis sinks with them to the seafloor as they die. But some of it is quickly respired back to the atmosphere, muting any mitigating effect that the blooms might have on the wildfire emissions. To really assess what role the algae play, he says, would require a rapid-response team aboard an ocean vessel that could measure these chemical processes as they are happening.</p>



<p>The sheer size of this wildfire-triggered bloom — “larger than Australia itself” — shows that “wildfires have the potential to increase marine productivity by very large amounts,” says Douglas Hamilton, a climate scientist at Cornell University who was not connected with the study.</p>



<p>“The impact of fires on society is not straightforward,” Hamilton adds. The same smoke that can cause severe health impacts when inhaled “is also supplying nutrients to ecosystems and helping support marine food webs.” What this study demonstrates, he adds, is that to understand how future increases in fire activity might help shape the future of marine productivity “it is crucial that we monitor the impacts closely now.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">Fossils and ancient DNA paint a vibrant picture of human origins</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In <em>The Descent of Man</em>, published in 1871, Charles Darwin hypothesized that our ancestors came from Africa. He pointed out that among all animals, the African apes — gorillas and chimpanzees — were the most similar to humans. But he had little fossil evidence. The few known human fossils had been found in Europe, and those that trickled in over the next 50 years came from Europe and from Asia.</p>



<p>Had Darwin picked the wrong continent?</p>



<p>Finally, in 1924, a fortuitous find supported Darwin’s speculation. Among the debris at a limestone quarry in South Africa, miners recovered the fossilized skull of a toddler. Based on the child’s blend of humanlike and apelike features, an anatomist determined that the fossil was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/african-manlike-ape-skull-new-link-mans-ancestry">what was then popularly known as a “missing link.”</a> It was the most apelike fossil yet found of a hominid — that is, a member of the family Hominidae, which includes modern humans and all our close, extinct relatives.</p>

<p>That fossil wasn’t enough to confirm Africa as our homeland. Since that discovery, paleoanthropologists have amassed many thousands of fossils, and the evidence over and over again has pointed to Africa as our place of origin. Genetic studies reinforce that story. African apes are indeed our closest living relatives, with chimpanzees more closely related to us than to gorillas. In fact, many scientists now include great apes in the hominid family, using the narrower term “hominin” to refer to humans and our extinct cousins.</p>



<p>In a field with a reputation for bitter feuds and rivalries, the notion of humankind’s African origins unifies human evolution researchers. “I think everybody agrees and understands that Africa was very pivotal in the evolution of our species,” says Charles Musiba, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Colorado Denver.</p>



<p>Paleoanthropologists have sketched a rough timeline of how that evolution played out. Sometime between 9 million and 6 million years ago, the first hominins evolved. Walking upright on two legs distinguished our ancestors from other apes; our ancestors also had smaller canine teeth, perhaps a sign of less aggression and a change in social interactions. Between about 3.5 million and 3 million years ago, humankind’s forerunners ventured beyond wooded areas. Africa was growing drier, and grasslands spread across the continent. Hominins were also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-stone-tools-unearthed-kenya">crafting stone tools</a> by this time. The human genus, <em>Homo</em>, arrived between 2.5 million and 2 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-jaw-may-hold-clues-origins-human-genus">maybe earlier</a>, with larger brains than their predecessors. By at least <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shangchen-stone-tools-put-early-hominids-china-earlier">2 million years ago</a>, <em>Homo</em> members started traveling from Africa to Eurasia. By about 300,000 years ago, <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">Homo sapiens</a></em>, our species, emerged.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>All in the family</h3>



<p>Fossil finds suggest that many hominin species have lived over the last 7 million years (dates for each species are based on those finds), though researchers debate the validity of some of these classifications. The earliest purported hominins (purple) show some signs of upright walking, which became more routine with the rise of <em>Australopithecus</em> (green). Seemingly short-lived <em>Paranthropus</em> (yellow) was adapted for heavy chewing, and brain size began to increase in <em>Homo </em>species (blue).</p>

<p>But human evolution was not a gradual, linear process, as it appeared to be in the 1940s and ’50s. It did not consist of a nearly unbroken chain, one hominin evolving into the next through time. Fossil discoveries in the ’60s and ’70s revealed a bushier family tree, with many dead-end branches. By some counts, more than 20 hominin species have been identified in the fossil record. Experts disagree on how to classify all of these forms — “Fossil species are mental constructs,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/erectus-unhinged">a paleoanthropologist once told <em>Science News</em></a> — but clearly, hominins were diverse, with some species overlapping in both time and place.</p>



<p>Even our species wasn’t always alone. Just 50,000 years ago, the diminutive, 1-meter-tall <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolutionary-shrinkage-stone-age-homo-find-offers-small-surprise">Homo floresiensis</a></em>, nicknamed the hobbit, lived on the Indonesian island of Flores. And 300,000 years ago, <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-suggest-new-species-human-genus">Homo naledi</a></em> was a neighbor in South Africa.</p>



<p>Finding such “primitive” species — both had relatively small brains — living at the same time as <em>H. sapiens</em> was a big surprise, says Bernard Wood, a paleoanthropologist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Those discoveries, made within the last two decades, were reminders of how much is left to learn.</p>



<p>It’s premature to pen a comprehensive explanation of human evolution with so much ground — in Africa and elsewhere — to explore, Wood says. Our origin story is still a work in progress.</p>





<h4>Eyes on Africa</h4>



<p>Raymond Dart had a wedding to host.</p>



<p>It was a November afternoon in 1924, and the Australian-born anatomist was partially dressed in formal wear when he was distracted by fossils. Rocks containing the finds had just been brought to his home in Johannesburg, South Africa, from a mine near the town of Taung.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1.jpg" alt="Dart and Tuang skull" class="wp-image-3103407" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1-383x383.jpg 383w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1-450x450.jpg 450w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1-580x580.jpg 580w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100-humanevol_1_Dart-Taung-1-214x214.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103407">Raymond Dart recognized that the Taung Child (shown with Dart decades after its 1924 discovery) had both apelike and humanlike qualities. The find sparked the search for more hominin fossils in Africa.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103407">Science History Images/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Imprinted on a knobby rock about as big as an orange were the folds, furrows and even blood vessels of a brain. It fit perfectly inside another rock that had a bit of jaw peeking out.</p>



<p>The groom pressed Dart to get back on track. “My god, Ray,” he said. “You’ve got to finish dressing immediately — or I’ll have to find another best man.”</p>



<p>As soon as the festivities ended, Dart, 31 years old at the time, started removing the jaw from its limestone casing, chipping away with knitting needles. A few weeks later, he had liberated not just a jaw but a partial skull preserving the face of a child.</p>



<p>On February 7, 1925, in the journal <em>Nature</em>, Dart <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/115195a0">introduced the Taung Child to the world</a>. He described the fossil as an ape like no other, one with some distinctly humanlike features, including a relatively flat face and fairly small canine teeth. The foramen magnum, the hole through which the spinal cord exits the head, was positioned directly under the skull, implying the child had an erect posture and walked on two legs.</p>



<p>Dart concluded that the Taung Child belonged to “an extinct race of apes <em>intermediate between living anthropoids and man</em>.” His italicized text emphasized his judgment: The fossil was a so-called missing link between other primates and humans. He named it <em>Australopithecus africanus</em>, or southern ape of Africa.</p>



<p>The Taung Child was the second hominin fossil discovered in Africa, and much more primitive than the first. Dart argued that the find vindicated Darwin’s belief that humans arose on that continent. “There seems to be little doubt,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/african-manlike-ape-skull-new-link-mans-ancestry"><em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, reported</a>, “that there has been discovered on the reputed ‘dark’ continent a most important step in the evolutionary history of man.”</p>



<p>But Dart’s claims were mostly met with skepticism. It would take more than two decades of new fossil finds and advances in geologic dating for Dart to be vindicated — and for Africa to become the epicenter of paleoanthropology.</p>

<h4>Against the establishment</h4>



<p>Unlike Darwin, many evolutionists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had theorized that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mans-age-now-set-millions-years">the human family tree was rooted in Asia</a>. Some argued that <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/dwv4233f">Asia’s gibbons were our closest living relatives</a>. Others reasoned that <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/24306#page/249/mode/1up">tectonic activity and climate change in Central Asia sparked human evolution</a>. One naturalist even proposed that human origins traced back to a lost continent that had sunk in the Indian Ocean, forcing our ancestors to relocate to Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>And that’s where the best contender for an early human ancestor had been found. In the 1890s, a crew led by Dutch physician-turned-anthropologist Eugène Dubois had uncovered a skullcap and thigh bone on the Indonesian island of Java. The thick skullcap had heavy brow ridges, but Dubois estimated it once held a brain that was about twice as big as an ape’s and approaching the size of a human’s. The thigh bone indicated that this Java Man, later named <em>Homo erectus</em>, walked upright.</p>



<p>Europe had its own tantalizing fossils. Neandertals had been known since the mid-19th century, but by the early 20th century, they were generally thought to be cousins that lived too recently to shed much light on our early evolution. A more relevant discovery seemed to come in 1912, when an amateur archaeologist had recovered humanlike bones from near Piltdown, England; the site also contained fossils of extinct creatures, suggesting Piltdown Man was of great antiquity. Skull bones hinted he had a human-sized brain, but his primitive jaw had a large, apelike canine tooth.</p>



<p>Some experts questioned whether the skull and jaw belonged together. But British scientists embraced the discovery — and not just because it implied England had a role in human origins. Piltdown Man’s features fit with the British establishment’s view of human evolution, in which a big brain was the first trait to distinguish human ancestors from other apes.</p>



<p>So when Dart announced that he had found a small-brained bipedal ape with humanlike teeth in the southern tip of Africa, scientists were primed to be skeptical, says Paige Madison, a historian of science at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Scientists were also skeptical of Dart. While a student in London, he had earned a reputation as a “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00359190109520451?journalCode=ttrs20">scientific heretic, given to sweeping claims</a>,” according to a paper coauthored by a colleague.</p>



<p>But initial criticism focused mostly on practical concerns, says Madison, who has <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40656-019-0258-x">studied the skeptics’ reactions</a>. “I found what they were actually saying on paper to be quite reasonable.”</p>



<p>A big problem: Dart’s fossil was of a 3- or 4-year-old child. Critics pointed out that a young ape tends to resemble humans in some ways, but the similarities disappear as the ape matures. Critics also complained that Dart hadn’t done proper comparative analyses with young chimps and gorillas, and he refused to send the fossil to England where such analyses could be done. This refusal irked the British old guard. “It was unpalatable to the scientists in England that the young colonial upstart had presumed to describe the skull himself,” one of Dart’s contemporaries later wrote, “instead of submitting it to his elders and betters.”</p>



<p>It’s hard not to wonder how the era’s colonialist and racist attitudes shaped perceptions. The Taung Child came to light at a time when eugenics was still considered legitimate science, and much of anthropology was devoted to categorizing people into races and arranging them into hierarchies. On the one hand, Western researchers tended to maintain the perverse notion that Africans are more primitive than other people, even less evolved. On the other, they wanted to believe Europe or Asia is where humans originated.</p>



<p>How these views influenced reactions to the Taung Child is not clear-cut. Many skeptics didn’t cite the fossil’s location as a problem, and some acknowledged humans could have evolved in Africa. But deep-seated biases may have made it easier for some researchers to reject the Taung Child and accept Piltdown Man, even though fossil evidence for that claim was also scant, says Sheela Athreya, a paleoanthropologist at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station.</p>



<p>Newspapers worldwide followed the Taung Child controversy. And while fans sent Dart poems and short stories casting the child as a national hero, he also received letters from disapproving creationists.</p>



<p>Amid it all, Dart had convinced at least one well-known scientist. Robert Broom, a Scottish-born physician living in South Africa and an authority on reptile evolution, recognized that fossils of fully grown <em>A. africanus</em> individuals would be needed to confirm that the Taung Child’s humanlike qualities were retained in adulthood.</p>

<p>Broom began to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-1503">find just that evidence in 1936 in caves not far from Johannesburg</a>. Often taking the heavy-handed approach of detonating dynamite to free specimens, he amassed a collection of fossils representing both the young and the old. Limb, spine and hip bones confirmed South Africa was once home to a bipedal ape, and skull bones verified Dart’s inferences about <em>A. africanus</em>’ humanlike teeth.</p>



<p>Even the staunchest Dart doubters <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/african-ape-men-declared-more-human-ape">couldn’t overlook this evidence</a>. British anatomist Arthur Keith, who had once called Dart’s assertions “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/116462a0.pdf?origin=ppub">preposterous</a>,” conceded. “I am now convinced,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/159377a0">he wrote in a one-paragraph letter</a> to <em>Nature</em> in 1947, “that Prof. Dart was right and that I was wrong; the Australopithecinae are in or near the line which culminated in the human form.”</p>



<p>A few years later, in 1953, researchers exposed Piltdown Man to be a hoax — someone had planted a modern human skull alongside an orangutan jaw with its teeth filed down. Many experts outside of England had never been convinced by the find in the first place. “It was not a complete surprise when he was proved to be a fake,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/africa-mans-cradle"><em>Science News Letter </em>reported</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Africa’s role in human evolution was not cemented. From the time of the Taung Child’s unearthing through World War II, discoveries of hominin fossils continued in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-found-fossils-prove-pithecanthropus-was-human">Indonesia</a> and at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cradle-race-rocked-war">a cave site near Beijing called Zhoukoudian</a>. These fossils kept the focus on Asia.</p>

<h4>A series of surprises</h4>



<p>It was ultimately a series of discoveries by the husband-wife paleoanthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey that shifted the focus. Louis, who had grown up in East Africa as the son of English missionaries, had long believed Africa was the human homeland. While Broom was scouring South Africa in the 1930s, the Leakeys began exploring Olduvai Gorge in what is now Tanzania.</p>



<p>Year after year, the pair failed to find hominin fossils. But they dug up stone tools, suggesting that hominins must have lived there. So they kept looking. One day in 1959, while an ill Louis stayed behind in camp, Mary discovered a skull with small canine teeth like <em>Australopithecus</em>. But the fossil’s giant molar teeth, flaring cheekbones and bony crest running along the top of the skull where massive chewing muscles would have attached suggested something else. Nicknamed Nutcracker Man for its chompers, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/predict-future-man">the species was dubbed <em>Zinjanthropus boisei</em></a> (it’s now called <em>Paranthropus boisei</em> because it is clearly a close cousin of <em>P. robustus</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-african-ape-man-skull-has-marked-human-characters">a South African species found by Broom</a>).</p>

<p>Until the <em>Zinjanthropus</em> discovery, determining a hominin fossil’s age was largely a guessing game because there was no good way to measure how long ago an ancient fossil had formed. But advances in nuclear physics in the early and mid-20th century led to radioactive dating techniques that allowed age calculations. Using potassium-argon dating, geologists reported in 1961 that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/dated-1750000-years"><em>Zinjanthropus</em> came from a rock layer about 1.75 million years old</a>. The fossil was three times older than the Leakeys initially suspected. (Later, <em>A. africanus</em> proved to be even older, living about 2 million to 3 million years ago.) The discovery vastly stretched the timescales on which researchers were mapping human evolution.</p>



<p>The surprises didn’t end there. In the early 1960s, the Leakeys’ team recovered fossils of a hominin that lived at roughly the same time as <em>Zinjanthropus</em> but had smaller, more humanlike teeth and a brain notably bigger than that of both <em>Zinjanthropus</em> and <em>Australopithecus</em>. Because of the elevated brain size and details of the hand, the Leakeys argued that this hominin was the one who made the tools at Olduvai Gorge; in 1964, Louis and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-fossil-man-found">placed it in the human genus with the name <em>Homo habili</em>s</a>, or handy man.</p>



<p>The <em>Homo</em> designation was controversial, and to this day paleoanthropologists debate how to classify these fossils. Still, the discoveries at Olduvai Gorge kicked off a paleo-anthropological gold rush in Africa. A 1974 discovery in Ethiopia, for instance, once again expanded the timescale of human evolution. It was one of the most famous discoveries in all of human evolution: the nearly 40 percent complete skeleton of Lucy, known more formally as <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em>, who lived about 3.2 million years ago.</p>



<p>Since then, researchers have shown repeatedly that the hominin fossil record stretches farthest back in Africa. Today, the oldest purported hominins date back some 6 million or 7 million years — to around the time when the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees probably parted ways.</p>

<h4>On the origin of our species</h4>



<p>Even after it became clear that hominins originated in Africa, it was still uncertain where our species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, began. By the 1980s, paleoanthropologists had largely settled into two camps. One side claimed that, like the earliest hominins, modern humans came from someplace in Africa. The other side championed a more diffuse start across Africa, Asia and Europe.</p>



<p>That same decade saw researchers increasingly relying on genetics to study human origins. Initially, scientists looked to modern people’s DNA to make inferences about ancient populations. But by the late 1990s, geneticists pulled off a feat straight out of science fiction: decoding DNA preserved in hominin fossils.</p>



<p>For paleoanthropologists, studying ancient DNA has been like astronomers getting a new telescope that sees into deep space with a new wavelength of light. It’s revealing things no one even thought to look for, says paleoanthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “That is the most powerful thing that genetics has handed us.”</p>



<p>And it’s revealed a truly tangled tale.</p>



<h4>A trellis or a candelabra</h4>



<p>Long before the rise of genetics, or even the discovery of many hominin fossils, unraveling human origins was a quest to explain how the world’s different races came to be. But after the horrors of World War II, anthropologists started to question the validity of race.</p>



<p>“This was a real moral hinge point in the science,” Hawks says. “It was a realization that viewing things through the perspective of race was creating evils in the world.” And it was scientifically dubious, as genetic evidence has shown that people are all so similar that race is more of a cultural concept than a biological phenomenon. Humans, in fact, are less genetically diverse than chimps.</p>



<p>As race was de-emphasized in the 1940s and ’50s, anthropologists started to think more about the mechanisms of evolution and how populations change over time, a direct influence of the “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolutions-evolution">modern synthesis</a>” that had united Darwinian evolution and genetics.</p>



<p>One influential forerunner to this period was anatomist and anthropologist Franz Weidenreich. After leaving Nazi Germany in the 1930s, he ended up in China studying fossils known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/peking-man-refound">Peking Man</a> (now classified as <em>H. erectus</em>), who lived several hundred thousand years ago. Weidenreich noticed that Peking Man shared certain features, such as shovel-shaped incisor teeth, with some present-day East Asians.</p>



<p>From this observation of apparent regional continuity across time, he concluded there had never been just one real-life Garden of Eden. <a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/aa.1947.49.2.02a00010">As he wrote in 1947</a>, “Man has evolved in different parts of the old world.”</p>



<p>Rather than picturing a family tree with one main trunk and branches, he envisioned human evolution as a trellis. Vertical lines represented groups of humans from different geographic regions, with the crisscrossing lines of the lattice representing mating between groups. Such gene flow enabled ancient forms across Africa, Asia and Europe to stay a unified species that gradually evolved into modern humans, with some regional variation maintained.</p>



<p>One consequence of all that mixing: “Pure” races never existed.</p>



<p>But a minority of researchers clung to the idea that race was central to understanding human evolution. In 1962, American anthropologist Carleton Coon transformed Weidenreich’s trellis into a candelabra, trimming away the intersecting lines. He argued that modern races stemmed from a common ancestor, but different lines independently evolved into <em>H. sapiens</em>, with races crossing the “sapiens” boundary at different times. In his view, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/theory-negro-origin"><em>Science News Letter</em> explained</a>, “the Negro race is at least 200,000 years behind the white race on the ladder of evolution.”</p>



<p>It’s a deeply disturbing statement to type today, and it was rejected by many at the time. Coon published his claims during the height of the U.S. civil rights movement, less than a year before Martin Luther King Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and shared his dream of racial equality. Advocates of segregation cited the supposed evidence of inferiority to justify their racist agenda. But many experts discounted Coon’s views. It’s an “extreme opinion,” one anthropologist told <em>Science News Letter</em> in 1962, lacking “evidence of any nature to support it.”</p>



<p>Still, Coon’s claims tarnished Weidenreich’s view of human evolution. And in the 1960s and ’70s, interest shifted to much earlier stages of hominin history, many millions of years ago.</p>



<h4><em>Homo sapiens</em> arrives, somehow</h4>



<p>In the mid-1980s, anthropologists went back to disentangling the roots of <em>H. sapiens</em>. By then, a basic picture had emerged: Hominins arose in Africa, and <em>H. erectus</em> was the first to venture outside of it, by what we now know was nearly 2 million years ago. In some places, <em>H. erectus</em> persisted for a long time; elsewhere, new groups appeared, such as Neandertals (<em>H. neanderthalensis</em>) in Europe and Asia. At some point, somehow, <em>H. sapiens</em> arrived and its predecessors vanished.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Some of the oldest fossils classified as <em>Homo sapiens </em>still lack some features typical of people today. For instance, a roughly 300,000-year-old skull (top) from Jebel Irhoud in Morocco has a relatively long, flat braincase. Only later does a tall, rounded braincase appear to evolve, as seen in a 195,000-year-old skull (middle, white fills in missing pieces) from Omo Kibish and a 160,000-year-old skull (bottom) from Herto, both in Ethiopia.</p>
</div>



<p>That “somehow” became a matter of debate in the 1980s, ’90s and into the 2000s.</p>



<p>Milford Wolpoff, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and colleagues revived the latticework of Weidenreich’s trellis model in the 1980s. Under this “multiregional” view, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/erectus-unhinged">it was difficult to draw a clean line between the end of <em>H. erectus</em> and the beginning of <em>H. sapiens</em></a>. In fact, Wolpoff argued that <em>H. erectus</em> and other seemingly distinct groups should be folded into our species. Through intergroup mating these earlier “archaic” <em>H. sapiens</em> gradually evolved the features of “anatomically modern” humans.</p>



<p>Critics doubted there could have been enough intergroup mating back then to allow a small, globally scattered population to remain as one. Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, and colleagues proposed instead that <em>H. sapiens</em> originated in just one place — descending from <em>H. erectus</em> or a subsequent species — and then spread across the world. Along the way, these humans replaced other hominins, including Neandertals.</p>



<p>Both theories were difficult to test. For instance, the single-origin idea predicted that the oldest modern human fossils should all be found in just one region. But there weren’t many well-dated fossils from the relevant time period. And seeing ourselves in the fossil record proved challenging. Researchers disagreed on what features defined modern humans. A globular head? A flat face? Something as banal as a chin? These disagreements meant researchers on both sides could often look at the same fossil data and claim support for their position.</p>



<h4>Genetic revolution</h4>



<p>By the 1980s, DNA offered a new way to investigate the deep past. In 1987, one genetic study shifted momentum toward the single-origin theory, with Africa as the point of origin.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley analyzed mitochondrial DNA from people around the world. Because it’s inherited from mother to child and undergoes no genetic reshuffling, mitochondrial DNA preserves a record of maternal ancestry. African populations showed the greatest genetic diversity. And when the team built a family tree using the genetic data, it had two main branches: One held only African lineages and the other contained lineages from all over the world, including Africa. This pattern suggested the “mother” lineage came from Africa. Based on the estimated rate at which mitochondrial DNA accumulates changes, the team calculated that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/325031a0">this African Eve lived about 200,000 years ago</a>.</p>



<p>“Thus,” the team reported in <em>Nature</em>, “we propose that <em>Homo erectus</em> in Asia was replaced without much mixing with the invading <em>Homo sapiens</em> from Africa.”</p>



<p>Like fossils, genetic evidence is open to interpretation. Proponents of multiregional evolution pointed out that the African diversity may not be indicative of greater antiquity but simply a sign that African populations were much larger than other ancient groups. Mitochondrial DNA also isn’t a complete record of the past — given its unusual inheritance, lineages are easily lost over time.</p>



<p>Even with those warnings, the “Out of Africa” model gained followers as genetic evidence piled up. And in the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, new dating techniques and discoveries suggested <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-fossils-are-oldest-yet">the earliest <em>H. sapiens</em> fossils came from Africa</a>, at sites in Ethiopia dating to between 195,000 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/african-legacy-fossils-plug-gap-human-origins">160,000 years ago</a>. More recently, scientists linked roughly 300,000-year-old Moroccan fossils to <em>H. sapiens</em>.</p>



<p>A new window into the past opened in 1997. A team led by Svante Pääbo, a geneticist now at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neandertals-make-big-splash-gene-pool">recovered mitochondrial DNA</a> from a Neandertal fossil. It was so different from any modern human’s DNA that it suggested Neandertals must be a separate species. That was another blow to the multiregional model.</p>



<p>But paleoanthropology is like solving a jigsaw puzzle without all the pieces; any new piece can change the picture. That’s what happened in 2010. When Pääbo and colleagues assembled the Neandertal’s genetic blueprint, or genome, and compared it with modern human DNA, the team came to a startling conclusion: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-genome-yields-evidence-interbreeding-humans">About 1 to 4 percent of DNA in non-Africans today came from Neandertals</a>.</p>



<p>“We were naïve to think that humans just marched out of Africa, killed some Neandertals and populated the world,” archaeologist John Shea of Stony Brook University in New York <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tangled-roots">later told <em>Science News</em></a>.</p>



<p>That genetic data seemed to support a compromise model between Out of Africa and multiregionalism. Yes, modern humans originated in Africa, the idea went, but once they expanded into new territories, they mated with other hominins. Hints of such hybridization had been reported in the late ’90s, when some researchers claimed an ancient skeleton from Portugal had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/fossil-may-expose-humanitys-hybrid-roots">a mix of Neandertal and human features</a>.</p>



<p>Interbreeding wasn’t the only shock to come in 2010. Pääbo’s group also analyzed DNA from a finger bone found at Siberia’s Denisova Cave. Both Neandertals and modern humans had once lived there, but the DNA didn’t match either group. For the first time, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-suggests-new-hominid-line">genetics had revealed a new hominin</a>. These Denisovans are still mysterious, known from only a few bits of bone and teeth, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-relative-bred-humans">they too interbred with humans</a>. For instance, Denisovan DNA accounts for about 2 to 4 percent of Melanesian people’s genome.</p>



<h4>It’s complicated</h4>



<p>Over the last decade, as genetic and fossil revelations have painted a more complex picture of human origins, paleoanthropologists have moved beyond both the multiregional and simple Out of Africa scenarios. Rather than a tree with separate branches or a trellis, human evolution was probably more like a braided stream, a concept traced to paleoanthropologist Xinzhi Wu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who used a river metaphor to describe patterns of human evolution in China. Different human populations may have emerged, with some floating away and petering out and others connecting to varying degrees.</p>



<p>One emerging view suggests that much of early human evolution occurred in Africa, but there was not one place on the continent where <em>H. sapiens</em> was born. Starting at least 300,000 years ago, modern <em>H. sapiens</em> features <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">start to show up in the fossil record</a>. But these features didn’t arise all together. Only through the mating of different populations across Africa did the suite of behavioral and biological traits that define us today crystallize, says Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.</p>



<p>“Our origins lie in the interactions of these different populations,” she says. Understanding those interactions is limited by how little of ancient Africa researchers have explored so far. Western, central and much of northern Africa are terra incognita.</p>



<p>There’s still much to explore in other parts of the world too. A single, unifying explanation of human origins may not be possible, as different evolutionary processes probably shaped human history in different regions, says Athreya, of Texas A&amp;M University.</p>



<p>Making more progress on understanding those processes and our roots will come from new discoveries, technological advances and, importantly, new perspectives. For the last 100 years, our origin story has been told by mostly white, mostly male scientists. Welcoming a more diverse group of researchers into paleoanthropology, Athreya says, will reveal blind spots and biases as scientists add to and amend the tale.</p>



<p>This is, after all, everyone’s story.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/15/domestic-violence-increased-during-lockdown-in-the-united-states/">Domestic Violence Increased During Lockdown In The United States</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>From the very beginning of the pandemic, activists and charities raised concerns that lockdown could be having an impact on domestic violence. Women’s Aid <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-women-and-children-experiencing-domestic-abuse-and-the-life-saving-services-that-support-them/">noted that home is often an unsafe environment</a> for those experiencing abuse, while earlier this year Refuge <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56491643">stated that they’d seen a 60% increase in monthly calls</a> to their National Domestic Abuse helpline.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-70494-001.html">new study</a>, published in <em>Psychology of Violence</em>, looks at rates of intimate partner violence during the pandemic in the United States. Like data from the UK, it suggests that domestic violence increased during lockdown — and that this was particularly linked to stress.</p>



<span id="more-43670"></span>



<p>Participants were 510 adults based in the United States, all of whom had been in a relationship for at least six months and had consumed at least one alcoholic drink in the month prior to the study’s start. On average they had spent six days a week with their partner during lockdown. After sharing demographic data, participants completed a measure of Covid-19 related stress, indicating how much the pandemic had impacted their life or behaviour, and whether they had experienced physical, psychological, social, economic or health-related stressors in its wake. They also shared how much alcohol they had been consuming in terms of both frequency and quantity.</p>



<p>Next, participants completed a measure related to psychological and physical abuse, which assessed the perpetration of intimate partner aggression in the six months prior to lockdown, and since lockdown measures began. Psychological aggression was measured with four items, with participants responding with yes or no answers to the following questions: “I yelled at my partner”, “I sulked from my partner”, “I insulted or called my partner names” and “I made threats to my partner”. Physical aggression was measured with two items: “I threw things, kicked or hit something” and “I pushed, grabbed, or hit my partner”.</p>



<p>Overall, participants reported perpetrating more acts of psychological and physical aggression after lockdown began, compared to pre-pandemic. Participants who experienced more Covid-related stress were also more likely to be psychologically or physically aggressive towards their partners. But, contrary to expectations, the relationship between stress and physical aggression was only seen among those who consumed relatively few alcoholic drinks, and not among heavy drinkers.</p>



<p>A closer look at the data showed that heavy drinkers tended to have relatively high rates of physical aggression, which didn’t change with pandemic-associated stress. Those who drank less, on the other hand, showed relatively low rates of aggression when they reported low Covid stress, but when they were more stressed about Covid, they perpetrated intimate partner aggression at the same level as these already aggressive participants.</p>



<p>In addition to individual interventions designed to reduce domestic abuse, the team suggests that wider policies that relieve stress could also reduce intimate partner aggression. “Most people wouldn&#8217;t think about intimate partner violence as a reason to offer an economic relief package, but our data suggest that it has potential to be an effective measure,” <a href="https://news.gsu.edu/2021/08/16/covid-19-pandemic-linked-to-an-increase-in-intimate-partner-aggression-study-shows/">said</a> lead author Dominic Parrott. &#8220;The data also suggest that typical high-risk groups are not the only ones at risk of perpetrating violence in this kind of crisis environment. The stress of the pandemic is so profound and so ubiquitous that you need interventions or policies that hit big swathes of the population.&#8221;</p>



<p>Several questions still remain. Firstly, it was not clear whether or not participants had consumed alcohol prior to perpetrating intimate partner aggression, which may offer vital insights. Secondly, the short physical and psychological aggression measures may have excluded certain behaviours that could have increased during the pandemic, including less extreme examples that nonetheless impacted on people’s lives. And, finally, insights were self-reported. Whether participants accurately or honestly represented their relationship with their partner is not clear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-cattle-pee-potty-training-bathroom-pollution-ammonia">Potty-trained cattle could help reduce pollution</a></h4>

              
                <p>You can lead a cow to a water closet, but can you make it pee there? It turns out that yes, you can.</p>



<p>Researchers in Germany successfully <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00966-0">trained cows to use a small, fenced-in area with artificial turf flooring as a bathroom stall</a>. This could allow farms to easily capture and treat cow urine, which often pollutes air, soil and water, researchers report online September 13 in <em>Current Biology</em>. Components of that urine, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, could also be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pipe-dreams-book-toilet-natural-resources">used to make fertilizer</a> (<em>SN: 4/6/21</em>).</p>



<p>The average cow can pee tens of liters per day, and there are some 1 billion cattle worldwide. In barns, cow pee typically mixes with poop on the floor to create a slurry that emits the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-make-mapping-hot-spots-ammonia-pollution-easier">air pollutant ammonia</a> (<em>SN: 1/4/19</em>). Out in pastures, cow pee can leach into nearby waterways and release the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fertilizer-produces-far-more-greenhouse-gas-expected">potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/14</em>).</p>



<p>“I’m always of the mind, how can we get animals to help us in their management?” says Lindsay Matthews, a self-described cow psychologist who studies animal behavior at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Matthews and colleagues set out to potty train 16 calves, which had the free time to learn a new skill. “They’re not so involved with milking and other systems,” he says. “They’re basically just hanging out, eating a bit of food, socializing and resting.”</p>





<p>Matthews was optimistic about the cows’ potty-training prospects. “I was convinced that we could do it,” he says. Cows “are much, much smarter than people give them credit for.” Each calf got 45 minutes of what the team calls “MooLoo training” per day. At first, the researchers enclosed the calves inside the makeshift bathroom stall and fed the animals a treat every time they peed.</p>



<p>Once the calves made the connection between using the bathroom stall and receiving a treat, the team positioned the calves in a hallway leading to the stall. Whenever animals visited the little cows’ room, they got a treat; whenever calves peed in the hallway, the team spritzed them with water. “We had 11 of the 16 calves [potty trained] within about 10 days,” Matthews says. The remaining cows “are probably trainable too,” he adds. “It’s just that we didn’t have enough time.”</p>

</div><figcaption>Researchers successfully trained 11 calves, such as this one, to urinate in a bathroom stall. Once the cow relieved itself, a window in the stall opened, dispensing a molasses mixture as a treat. Toilet training cows on a large scale and collecting their urine to make fertilizer could cut down on agricultural pollution, the team says.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lindsay Whistance, a livestock researcher at the Organic Research Centre in&nbsp;Cirencester, England, is “not surprised by the results.” With proper training and motivation, “I fully expected cattle to be able to learn this task,” says Whistance, who was not involved in the study. The practicality of potty training cows on a large scale, she says, is another matter.</p>



<p>For MooLoo training to become a widespread practice, “it has to be automated,” Matthews says. “We want to develop automated training systems, automated reward systems.” Those systems are still far from reality, but Matthews and colleagues hope they could have big impacts. If 80 percent of cow pee were collected in latrines, for instance, that could cut associated ammonia emissions in half, previous research suggests.</p>



<p>“It’s those ammonia emissions that are key to the real environmental benefit, as well as potential for reducing water contamination,” says Jason Hill, a biosystems engineer at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul not involved in the work. “Ammonia from cattle is a major <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/livestock-manure-stinks-infant-health">contributor to reduced human health</a>,” he says (<em>SN: 1/16/09</em>). So potty training cattle could help create cleaner air — as well as a cleaner, more comfortable living space for cows themselves.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324001935">Fuzz </a></em><br>Mary Roach<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $26.95</p>



<p>Around the world, criminals run free in the forest. These villains can’t be arrested — because they’re not human. In her latest book, <em>Fuzz: When Nature Breaks the Law</em>, Mary Roach puts the spotlight on these miscreants. On the Midway Islands, albatrosses carry out suicide missions against the U.S. Navy’s planes. In Colorado, bears break and enter, raiding the refrigerators of mountain homes. And deer do so much jaywalking.</p>



<p>Nature’s perp list also includes camels, mountain lions, crows and many more. Through such examples, Roach tackles this question: What should we do when animals break laws intended for people?</p>





<p>The book brims with Roach’s irreverent humor, which particularly shines when she experiences human-animal conflict firsthand. She tastes rat bait to better understand its allure and gets training on how to tell if a human body was mauled by a bear or by a human pretending to be a bear. She even engineers a robbery: “I had bananas. I was asking for it. I wanted to know what it was like to be mugged by monkeys.”</p>





<p>But it’s not all fun and reindeer games. Roach highlights how much real pain comes from human-animal interactions. Elephants routinely destroy people’s crops and homes. They, along with leopards, bears, deer and others, can also kill people. She also tackles the ethics of eradicating pests by mass poisoning or altering their genetics.</p>



<p>The stories might seem disparate, but they serve a wider point. Many wildlife strategies seek to save people from wild animals’ unwelcome behavior, or to increase the numbers of animals that people want to shoot, eat or admire. What would happen, Roach wonders, if we thought more about coexistence instead of conflict or exploitation?</p>



<p>Most chapters offer a blend of modern science and history, with Roach’s flair for spotting hidden absurdities. Not all the stories of nature’s criminal intent quite land, however. She highlights, for instance, how falling trees kill people, and how uncooked beans cause significant gastrointestinal distress. But it’s a stretch: Widow-makers and musical fruits are inanimate objects, lacking motive, means or opportunity. It’s hard to feel threatened by a tree or bean that can’t come running after you. Nonetheless, as another entry in Roach’s canon of books, <em>Fuzz</em> stands tall (and hairy), educating as much as it entertains. But please: Just learn from her. Do not taste the rat bait.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-sea-ice-forecast">How AI can help forecast how much Arctic sea ice will shrink</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the next week or so, the sea ice floating atop the Arctic Ocean will shrink to its smallest size this year, as summer-warmed waters eat away at the ice’s submerged edges.</p>



<p>Record lows for sea ice levels will probably not be broken this year, scientists say. In 2020, the ice covered 3.74 million square kilometers of the Arctic at its lowest point, coming nail-bitingly close to an all-time record low. Currently, sea ice is present in just under 5 million square kilometers of Arctic waters, putting it on track to become the 10th-lowest extent of sea ice in the area since satellite record keeping began in 1979. It’s an unexpected finish considering that in early summer, sea ice hit a record low for that time of year.</p>



<p>The surprise comes in part because the best current statistical- and physics-based forecasting tools can closely predict sea ice extent only a few weeks in advance, but the accuracy of long-range forecasts falters. Now, a new tool that uses artificial intelligence to create sea ice forecasts promises to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4">boost their accurac</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4">y</a> — and can do the analysis relatively quickly, researchers report August 26 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>IceNet, a sea ice forecasting system developed by the British Antarctic Survey, or BAS, is “95 percent accurate in forecasting sea ice two months ahead — higher than the leading physics-based model SEAS5 — while running 2,000 times faster,” says Tom Andersson, a data scientist with BAS’s Artificial Intelligence lab. Whereas SEAS5 takes about six hours on a supercomputer to produce a forecast, IceNet can do the same in less than 10 seconds on a laptop. The system also shows a surprising ability to predict anomalous ice events — unusual highs or lows — up to four months in advance, Andersson and his colleagues found.</p>





<p>Tracking sea ice is crucial to keeping tabs on the impacts of climate change. While that’s more of a long game, the advanced notice provided by IceNet could have more immediate benefits, too. For instance, it could give scientists the lead time needed to assess, and plan for, the risks of Arctic fires or wildlife-human conflicts, and it could provide data that Indigenous communities need to make economic and environmental decisions.</p>



<p>Arctic sea ice extent has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">steadily declined</a> in all seasons since satellite records began in 1979 (<em>SN</em>: 9/25/19). Scientists have been trying to improve sea ice forecasts for decades, but success has proved elusive. “Forecasting sea ice is really hard because sea ice interacts in complex ways with the atmosphere above and ocean below,” Andersson says.</p>

</div><figcaption>In 2020, the sea ice in the Arctic shrank to its second lowest extent since satellite monitoring began in 1979. This animation uses those observations to show the change in sea ice coverage from March 5, when the ice was at its maximum, through September 15, when the ice reached its lowest point. The yellow line represents the average minimum extent from 1981 to 2010. Current forecasting tools can accurately predict these changes weeks in advance. A new AI-based tool can predict these changes with nearly 95 percent accuracy several months in advance.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Existing forecast tools put the laws of physics into computer code to predict how sea ice will change in the future. But partly due to uncertainties in the physical systems governing sea ice, these models struggle to produce accurate long-range forecasts.</p>



<p>Using a process called deep learning, Andersson and his colleagues loaded observational sea ice data from 1979 to 2011 and climate simulations covering 1850 to 2100 to train IceNet how to predict the state of future sea ice by processing the data from the past.</p>



<p>To determine the accuracy of its forecasts, the team compared IceNet’s outputs to the observed sea ice extent from 2012 to 2020, and to the forecasts made by SEAS5, the widely cited tool used by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. IceNet was as much as 2.9 percent more accurate than SEAS5, corresponding to a further 360,000 square kilometers of ocean being correctly labeled as “ice” or “no ice.”</p>



<p>What’s more, in 2012, a sudden crash in summer sea ice extent heralded a new record low extent in September of that year. In running through past data, IceNet saw the dip coming months in advance. SEAS5 had inklings too but its projections that far out were off by a few hundred thousand square kilometers.</p>



<p>“This is a significant step forward in sea ice forecasting, boosting our ability to produce accurate forecasts that were typically not thought possible and run them thousands of times faster,” says Andersson. He believes it’s possible that IceNet has better learned the physical processes that determine the evolution of sea ice from the training data while physics-based models still struggle to understand this information.</p>



<p>“These machine learning techniques have only begun contributing to [forecasting] in the last couple years, and they’ve been doing amazingly well,” says Uma Bhatt, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute who was not involved in the new study. She also leads the Sea Ice Prediction Network, a group of multidisciplinary scientists working to improve forecasting.</p>



<p>Bhatt says that good seasonal ice forecasts are important for<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/siberia-verkhoyansk-record-heat-wave-arctic-circle"> assessing the risk of Arctic wildfires</a>, which are tied strongly to the presence of sea ice<em> (SN: 6/23/20)</em>. “Knowing where the sea ice is going to be in the spring could potentially help you figure out where you’re likely to have fires — in Siberia, for example, as soon as the sea ice moves away from the shore, the land can warm up very quickly and help set the stage for a bad fire season.”</p>



<p>Any improvement in sea ice forecasting can also help economic, safety and environmental planning in northern and Indigenous communities. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lacking-ice-huge-walrus-herd-congregates-alaska-shore">tens of thousands of walruses haul out on land</a> to rest when the sea ice disappears (<em>SN: 10/2/14</em>). Human disturbances can trigger deadly stampedes and lead to high walrus mortality. With seasonal ice forecasts, biologists can anticipate rapid ice loss and manage haul-out sites in advance by limiting human access to those locations.</p>



<p>Still, limitations remain. At four months of lead time, the system was about 91 percent accurate in predicting the location of September’s ice edge.IceNet, like other forecasting systems, struggles to produce accurate long-range forecasts for late summer due, in part, to what scientists call the “spring predictability barrier.” It’s crucial to know the condition of the sea ice at the start of the spring melting season to be able to forecast end-of-summer conditions.</p>



<p>Another limit is “the fact that the weather is so variable,” says Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. Though sea ice seemed primed to set a new annual record low at the start of July, the speed of ice loss ultimately slowed due to cool atmospheric temperatures. “We know that sea ice responds very strongly to summer weather patterns, but we can’t get good weather predictions. Weather predictability is about 10 days in advance.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What is it that makes someone feel that theirs is a &#8220;good life&#8221;? Of all the ideas put forward over the past few millennia, two are most often extolled and researched today. The first is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/17/small-pleasures-are-just-as-important-for-our-wellbeing-as-long-term-goals/">hedonistic</a> wellbeing, often called simply &#8220;happiness&#8221;, which is characterised by plenty of positive emotions and general life satisfaction. The other is &#8220;eudaimonia&#8221; — feeling that your life has meaning and that you are realising your potential. Now in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-74886-001">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Review</em>, Shigehiro Oishi at the University of Virginia and Erin Westgate at the University of Florida suggest that we’ve been missing something: &#8220;psychological richness&#8221;.</p>



<span id="more-43662"></span>



<p>A psychologically rich life is one that is characterised by a variety of interesting and perspective-changing experiences. In their paper, the pair presents a vast array of initial evidence in favour of the idea that this concept belongs alongside happiness and meaning as a third major dimension of wellbeing.</p>



<p>In one early study, 500 students reported on the extent to which a series of characteristics described their lives. Some were related to happiness (&#8220;enjoyable&#8221;, for example), some to meaning (such as &#8220;fulfilling&#8221;), and some to what the researchers felt related, positively or negatively, to the notion of psychological richness. This last group included &#8220;interesting&#8221; and &#8220;dramatic&#8221;, and also &#8220;uneventful&#8221; and &#8220;monotonous&#8221;. The results suggested that happiness, meaning and richness are indeed three distinct factors. “Psychometrically, psychological richness cannot be reduced to an aspect of meaning or happiness,” Oishi and Westgate write. They also analysed the adjectives used in a few hundred obituaries published in newspapers in the US and Singapore. Again, their analysis showed that the words could be grouped into these three distinct dimensions.</p>



<p>Further studies found that psychological richness, happiness, and meaning also all show distinct patterns of association &nbsp;with personality traits and socioeconomic status. Data from participants in the US, India and Korea all suggested that the traits of openness and extraversion are both associated with leading a psychologically rich life, while socioeconomic status (SES) is not. However, SES, along with extraversion and conscientiousness, was linked to happiness. Feelings of meaning weren’t associated with any particular pattern of Big Five scores.</p>



<p>Because psychological richness is associated with unexpectedness, novelty, complexity and perspective change, Ohio and Westgate reasoned that certain types of experiences might enhance it. And indeed, they found that students who went to study abroad developed significantly higher psychological richness scores than those who had stayed on campus. (Their initial scores had been similar; and their scores for happiness and meaning did not change.) It seems, then, that aspects of both personality and life experience can make for a psychologically richer life.</p>



<p>Yet further studies highlight distinct links between each of these three factors and people’s outlook more broadly: people who reported having happy or meaningful lives tended to report preferring to maintain social order and the status quo; they were more politically conservative. In contrast, those with psychologically richer lives were more in favour of social change; they were more politically liberal.</p>



<p>Of course none of this establishes that anybody actually feels that a psychologically rich life <em>is</em> a good life. But when Oishi and Westgate asked participants from nine different countries to describe their ideal lives by choosing from a list of features associated with a happy, meaningful or psychologically rich life, overall they chose elements from all three. When asked which they would go for if they could only choose one type of life, most chose happy, meaningful came second and psychologically rich came last. However, as the team notes, there was a “substantial minority” of participants — ranging from 7% in Singapore to 17% in Germany — who would opt for a psychologically rich life <em>above</em> a happy or a meaningful one. For this group, at least, this most defines a &#8220;good life&#8221; for them.</p>



<p>Feeling happy and that your life has meaning are both associated with better health and relationships. But why should someone desire psychological richness? From an evolutionary perspective, such people might cope better in more difficult, changing environments. For an individual, a desire for psychological richness could protect against boredom. And, the researchers suggest, it may also help people to cope with difficulties in life, and even tragedy. Someone who values the perspective change that a difficulty can bring “may find value in experiences and lives that are not otherwise happy or meaningful,” the pair writes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oishi and Westgate stress that they are not suggesting that psychological richness, happiness and meaning are wholly independent of each other — or indeed there are only three components of a good life (as there could be more). They also readily concede that a lot more work is needed to better understand the importance of psychological richness.</p>



<p>However, the finding that a significant cluster of people from a variety of countries would rather have a psychologically rich life than a happy or meaningful one alone surely makes it worthy of much more attention. Overall, the pair argues, the “addition of psychological richness broadens, deepens and enriches empirical research on a good life.”</p>

<html><body><p><strong>Author:</strong> Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, PLOS&rsquo; Director of Open Research</p>



<p><em>PLOS has been awarded a grant from the </em><a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/open-research-fund"><em>Wellcome Trust&rsquo;s 2021 Open Research Fund</em></a><em> to accelerate development and testing of new solutions that promote and reward open science. </em>PLOS Pathogens<em> will be piloting the latest version of the Dryad data repository, provided free of charge to authors and integrated into the publishing experience, along with prominent visual links on publications designed to incentivise open research practices.</em></p>



<p><strong>Why test solutions?</strong><br>Open Science practices, such as availability of supporting datasets, have been associated with <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201520">more trustworthy</a> reports of research. Sharing research data in repositories is considered best practice for data sharing &mdash; data in repositories are more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) &mdash; but most researchers share data by other methods. After <a href="https://osf.io/njr5u/">studying PLOS authors&rsquo; needs in 2020</a>, we concluded we must <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/how-can-we-increase-adoption-of-open-research-practices/">seamlessly integrate tools into researchers&rsquo; publishing workflow</a> to reduce the effort involved in adopting good practice. Especially when the incentives for adopting Open Science practices in research evaluation are not always immediate, or widely established.</p>



<p>While we found&nbsp;<a href="https://osf.io/njr5u/">in our research</a>&nbsp;that many&nbsp;researchers&nbsp;seem to be satisfied with their ability to share research data, conversely,&nbsp; we also found many researchers have challenges in accessing research data that they can reuse &mdash; which could be addressed in part by wider use of repositories. Even for COVID-19 research publications,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-021-03971-6">the rate of research data</a>&nbsp;sharing appears to be low&nbsp;and methods of data sharing often do not support the FAIR Principles.</p>



<p><strong>What will we test?</strong></p>



<p>To incentivise increased use of data repositories and better connecting of data to publications &mdash; practices associated with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">more impactful</a> research &mdash; we&rsquo;re going to test, starting later in 2021, solutions that require minimal behavioural change from researchers.</p>



<p>The first solution we&rsquo;ll be testing is the multidisciplinary curated data repository <a href="https://dryad-stg.cdlib.org/stash">Dryad</a>, which <a href="https://www.ariessys.com/views-press/news-opinion/free-webinar-streamlining-research-data-repository-deposits-with-dryad-and-editorial-manager/">can now be seamlessly integrated</a> into the submission experience of <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>. Dryad offers researchers curation of their data, and bidirectional linking between data and publications, and minimises additional effort for practicing Open Science. We&rsquo;re extending our long-standing partnership with Dryad by adopting its latest functionality and covering data deposit and curation fees for an unlimited number of papers in <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>.</p>



<p>The second solution is prominent functional links to associated research data in a repository, highlighted with visual cues on published articles &ndash; deployed in an automated fashion on <em>PLOS Pathogens</em>, and a comparator group of articles published in other PLOS journals.</p>



<p>Wellcome&rsquo;s funding will support expert design and optimisation of these visual cues so that they are engaging to readers and deployable on the PLOS platform, and in-depth user research to help us understand <em>why </em>the solutions have any of the effects we might observe.</p>



<p><strong>Community collaboration</strong></p>



<p>PLOS staff (Lauren Cadwallader, James Harney, Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Veronique Kiermer) are delighted to partner with the Editors in Chief of <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> (Prof Kasturi Haldar and Prof Michael Malim) as members of the project team, and to connect with the journal&rsquo;s wider community of researchers.</p>



<p><strong>Expected outcomes</strong></p>



<p>While our goal is to implement and test solutions rather than purely to do research, our approach is expected to result in shareable outcomes and evidence, including:</p>



<ul><li>A measurable increase in use of data repositories by authors</li><li>Increased engagement with research data linked from PLOS articles</li><li>Understanding as to why these solutions are (or are not) effective at incentivising open research practices, as well as their costs and benefits</li><li>Reports from qualitative and quantitative research and analysis, which we&rsquo;ll share openly</li></ul>



<p>By using simple, repeatable solutions and continuing to share what we learn, we expect other publishers and stakeholders will benefit from greater understanding of the effectiveness of these solutions. We also anticipate that highlighting and enabling best practices will help make Open Science more normative, which may ultimately increase trustworthiness in research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-sn-requiem-gravitational-lens-hubble-constant-universe-expansion">A supernova’s delayed reappearance could pin down how fast the universe expands</a></h4>

              
                <p>A meandering trek taken by light from a remote supernova in the constellation Cetus may help researchers pin down how fast the universe expands — in another couple of decades.</p>



<p>About 10 billion years ago, a star exploded in a far-off galaxy named MRG-M0138. Some of the light from that explosion later encountered a gravitational lens, a cluster of galaxies whose gravity bent the light so that we see multiple images. In 2016, the supernova appeared in Earth’s sky as three distinct points of light, each marking three different paths the light took to get here.</p>



<p>Now, researchers predict that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01450-9">the supernova will appear again in the late 2030s</a>. The time delay — the longest ever seen from a gravitationally lensed supernova — could provide a more precise estimate for the distance to the supernova’s host galaxy, the team reports September 13 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. And that, in turn, may let astronomers refine estimates of the Hubble constant, the parameter that describes how fast the universe expands.</p>



<p>The original three points of light appeared in images from the Hubble Space Telescope. “It was purely an accident,” says astronomer Steve Rodney of the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Three years later, when Hubble reobserved the galaxy, astronomer Gabriel Brammer at the University of Copenhagen discovered that all three points of light had vanished, indicating a supernova.</p>





<p>By calculating how the intervening cluster’s gravity alters the path the supernova’s light rays take, Rodney and his colleagues predict that the supernova will appear again in 2037, give or take a couple of years. Around that time, Hubble may burn up in the atmosphere, so Rodney’s team dubs the supernova “SN Requiem.”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a requiem for a dying star and a sort of elegy to the Hubble Space Telescope itself,” Rodney says. A fifth point of light, too faint to be seen, may also arrive around 2042, the team calculates.</p>

Rodney <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Astronomy</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The predicted 21-year time delay — from 2016 to 2037 — is a record for a supernova. In contrast, the first gravitational lens ever found — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/solid-support-gravitys-mirage">twin images of a quasar spotted in 1979</a> &nbsp;— has a time delay of only 1.1 years (<em>SN: 11/10/1979</em>).</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees with Rodney’s forecast. “It is very difficult to predict what the time delay will be,” says Rudolph Schild, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who was the first to measure the double quasar’s time delay. The distribution of dark matter in the galaxy hosting the supernova and the cluster splitting the supernova’s light is so uncertain, Schild says, that the next image of SN Requiem could come outside the years Rodney’s team has specified.</p>



<p>In any case, when the supernova image does appear, “that would be a phenomenally precise measurement” of the time delay, says Patrick Kelly, an astronomer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who was not involved with the new work. That’s because the uncertainty in the time delay will be tiny compared with the tremendous length of the time delay itself.</p>



<p>That delay, coupled with an accurate description of how light rays weave through the galaxy cluster, could affect the debate over the Hubble constant. Numerically, the Hubble constant is the speed a distant galaxy recedes from us divided by the distance to that galaxy. For a given galaxy with a known speed, a larger estimated distance therefore leads to a lower number for the Hubble constant.</p>



<p>This number was once in dispute by a factor of two. Today the range is much tighter, from 67 to 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec. But that spread still leaves the universe’s age uncertain. The frequently quoted age of 13.8 billion years corresponds to a Hubble constant of 67.4. But if the Hubble constant is higher, then the universe could be about a billion years younger.</p>



<p>The longer it takes for SN Requiem to reappear, the farther from Earth the host galaxy is — which means a lower Hubble constant and an older universe. So if the debate over the Hubble constant persists into the 2030s, the exact date the supernova springs back to life could help resolve the dispute and nail down a fundamental cosmological parameter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oak-leaf-nikon-small-world-photography-contest-2021">A beautiful oak leaf portrait won the 2021 Nikon Small World photography contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>A closeup view of even the most common objects can make the mundane look spectacular.</p>



<p>A glimpse of the underside of a southern live oak tree leaf, which won first place in the 2021 Nikon Small World photomicroscopy competition, is just one example. Jason Kirk, director of Baylor College of Medicine’s Optical Imaging and Vital Microscopy Core in Houston and a self-described microscope enthusiast, snapped the prizewinning photo with a microscope that he finished building in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. He tested his homemade device with a variety of objects from his yard, including tree leaves.</p>

<p>“A lot of times, you stick weird stuff under the microscope and see what it looks like,” Kirk says. “That’s what happened with this.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>His daughter remarked that the leaf’s trichomes — structures that help protect plants and other organisms from extreme weather and insects — looked like sea anemones. That comment inspired Kirk to craft a photo that made the leaf’s underside look like an underwater landscape.</p>



<p>The picture is a composite of around 200 images stacked together. The leaf’s trichomes are colored white and stick out of cyan-colored vessels, which carry water. Surrounding stomata, colored purple, regulate the flow of gases such as carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>The oak leaf was one of 100 stunning images recognized in <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition">this year’s competition</a>, the results of which were announced September 13. Here are a few of our favorites.</p>





<h3>A sky full of neurons</h3>

The cells’ nuclei are blue.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103546">Esmeralda Paric and Holly Stefen/Macquarie University, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It took a month of work for Esmeralda Paric and Holly Stefen, both of Macquarie University in Sydney, to capture this striking scene. Though at first glance it might look like a peek at galaxies, those glowing “stars” are mouse brain cells — part of an experiment that could help researchers understand the mechanisms behind neurogenerative diseases such as dementia.</p>



<p>The image, which earned second place in the competition, shows around 300,000 nerve cells, or neurons, separated by inky black fluid. The researchers coaxed some of the cells to extend spindly structures called axons, which allow neurons to send electrical signals, across the fluid.</p>



<p>“I named [the image] ‘The Jedi and the Sith’ … because when I look at it, I am compelled to reflect on [the] balance and connections that exist between otherwise seemingly isolated or opposing sides,” Paric says.</p>



<p>Her friends, however, had another name for the image. They “lovingly dubbed it ‘The Neuroverse,’” she says.</p>



<h3>A menacing louse</h3>

<p>Is it a scorpion’s tail? Or perhaps a crab’s claw?</p>



<p>No, this menacing, microscopic snapshot shows a side view of the rear leg and claw of a hog louse (<em>Haematopinus suis</em>). The hog louse lives primarily on swine, where the insect feeds on blood, and is one of the largest sucking lice. Severely infested pigs can go bald.</p>



<p>Retired biology professor Frank Reiser of Nassau Community College in Garden City, N.Y., captured this picture, which won third place, using dark-field microscopy to make the inner workings of the transparent louse clearly visible. The tubes running along the louse are respiratory tubes, called tracheae, carrying oxygen to tissues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of a doctoral thesis project, Paula Díaz Cespedes of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago, who studies injury-related nerve pain, snapped this stunning picture of nerve cells from a 16-day-old rat embryo. The photograph earned fourth place in the competition.</p>



<p>The colorful whirl is a dorsal root ganglion, a cluster of sensory nerve cells, including ones that detect pain. These clusters are found close to the spinal cord in many animals. The major structural component of the cells is colored green, with supporting cells that keep the neurons alive colored red. The nuclei of cells are blue.</p>



<p>Studying how the dorsal root ganglion changes after a painful injury can help researchers better understand chronic pain, Díaz Cespedes says.</p>



<h3>A kaleidoscope of dinosaur bone</h3>

<p>This work of art isn’t a stained-glass window. It’s a zoomed-in view of a tiny piece of dinosaur bone.</p>



<p>Geologist Bernardo Cesare of the University of Padua in Italy stitched together 25 images to create the picture. The black blobs are fossil remnants of the bone tissue that hosted a single bone cell. The different colors come from polarized light passing through mineral-filled pores within the sliver of bone. As the light moves through the mineral — called chalcedony, a type of quartz — the thickness and orientation of the crystals in relation to the light emit a rainbow of colors.</p>



<p>The small bone fragment, which was unearthed in Utah, inspired many photos such as this one, Cesare says.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>A sea of villi</h3>

<p>Caleb Dawson of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Researcher in Parkville, Australia wants to know how the intestine handles the myriad microbes living there. To do that, he plans to image immune cells in the gut. Those immune cells live among and inside tentacle-like structures called villi, shown in this striking picture of a mouse&#8217;s intestine.</p>



<p>Showing the villi in their three-dimensional glory was difficult, Dawson says. The task required compiling thousands of images taken in different positions while scanning intestinal tissue. Dawson added antibodies and dyes to the tissue to make parts of the villi fluoresce blue or green under certain types of light.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>When thinking about homelessness, we don’t often consider where to draw the line between housed and homeless. Couchsurfers — homeless individuals who put a roof over their head by staying with friends, relatives, or strangers found on couchsurfing sites — may not spring to mind when considering homelessness.</p>



<p>However, it’s far from a rare arrangement. Though exact numbers are lacking, studies from the last five years found that a shocking 22% of young people in the UK had slept rough at some point, and that 35% had couchsurfed in the absence of having a stable home.</p>



<p>The lack of stability, security, and sense of belonging that comes with having a home are all recognised factors in adverse psychological outcomes in those who are homeless. But, with couchsurfing being such a prevalent living situation, yet so different from sleeping rough, the psychological effects of this specific type of homelessness are well worth investigating. Now a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10530789.2021.1967647">new study</a> from researchers led by Katie Hail-Jares at Griffith University, Australia has uncovered a strong relationship between couchsurfing and psychological distress.</p>



<span id="more-43656"></span>



<p>In their study, the team included 63 participants between the ages of 15 and 25 with experience of couchsurfing for two weeks or more within the last 18 months. Participants were primarily recruited from social media, educational institutions, referrals, and local homelessness services. On average, those in the final sample were between 18 and 20 years old, and a majority were women (57.1%). Gender diverse and indigenous people were overrepresented, compared to the general population of Australia.</p>



<p>These participants took part in semi-structured interviews about their couchsurfing history and experiences, during which they completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The K10 is able to give a snapshot of mood over the preceding four weeks, and includes 10 questions probing anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>Most of the sample (46%) reported that they had stayed with between one and five hosts. But, there was a wide range of experiences; eight individuals reported staying with over 20 hosts during the course of their couchsurfing episodes.</p>



<p>K10 scores revealed that, perhaps unsurprisingly, 70% of the sample met the threshold for “very high” levels of distress. A further 22.2% scored in the “high” distress band, and 7.9% the “moderate” distress band. No participant scored below these ranges, which is alarming, given that the average Australian youth typically scores in the “low” distress range.</p>



<p>Analyses of these scores showed that older participants tended to report lower levels distress, while those who had stayed with a higher number of hosts experienced higher levels of distress. Female, gender diverse, and indigenous participants scored significantly higher on the K10 than their male counterparts.</p>



<p>The researchers believe that these trends are likely to stem, at least in part, from having to vet a higher number of potential hosts and their living situations for potential threats. The stress of this is likely to be much higher in those from marginalised groups who are conscious that they may fall victim to assault, policing, or other forms of trauma, which may explain some of the demographic differences seen in the data.</p>



<p>The authors also highlight that, though not directly probed in this study, many participants seemed to have aged out of existing support systems prioritising those under 18. This strongly suggests the need for homelessness services focused on young adults, regardless of whether they have a roof, due to the extreme psychological distress typically caused by this living situation.</p>



<p>Though the data collected from this study are informative, and allow us to draw some comparisons between the general population and couchsurfers, the correlational nature of analyses means that establishing cause and effect here is tricky. Other studies have shown the detrimental psychological impacts of homelessness, and while we could likely safely assume much of that applies here, it may also be the case that those with high amounts of distress finding themselves falling into these living situations. Future work may better illustrate the dynamics at play.</p>
