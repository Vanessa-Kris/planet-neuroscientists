<p>Olfaction in mammals is a dynamic process driven by the inhalation of air
through the nasal cavity. Inhalation determines the temporal structure of
sensory neuron responses and shapes the neural dynamics underlying central
olfactory processing. Inhalation-linked bursts of activity among olfactory bulb
(OB) output neurons [mitral/tufted cells (MCs)] are temporally transformed
relative to those of sensory neurons. We investigated how OB circuits shape
inhalation-driven dynamics in MCs using a modeling approach that was highly
constrained by experimental results. First, we constructed models of canonical
OB circuits that included mono- and disynaptic feedforward excitation,
recurrent inhibition and feedforward inhibition of the MC. We then used
experimental data to drive inputs to the models and to tune parameters; inputs
were derived from sensory neuron responses during natural odorant sampling
(sniffing) in awake rats, and model output was compared with recordings of MC
responses to odorants sampled with the same sniff waveforms. This approach
allowed us to identify OB circuit features underlying the temporal
transformation of sensory inputs into inhalation-linked patterns of MC spike
output. We found that realistic input-output transformations can be achieved
independently by multiple circuits, including feedforward inhibition with slow
onset and decay kinetics and parallel feedforward MC excitation mediated by
external tufted cells. We also found that recurrent and feedforward inhibition
had differential impacts on MC firing rates and on inhalation-linked response
dynamics. These results highlight the importance of investigating neural
circuits in a naturalistic context and provide a framework for further
explorations of signal processing by OB networks.</p>

<p>If there’s one quality you absolutely want in a leader, it’s surely charisma. Celebrated leaders are invariably associated with this magic word, and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1099-1379(200011)21:7%2525253C747::AID-JOB46%2525253E3.0.CO%253B2-J/abstract">evidence suggests</a> charismatic people inspire more trust, commitment, and results from their followers. But across a number of other supposedly virtuous traits, such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/17/having-strong-political-skills-can-be-a-handicap-in-the-workplace/">political ability</a> or assertiveness (<a href="https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1887/ames_assertiveness_jpsp.pdf">pdf</a>), researchers are starting to realise that it’s possible to have “too much of a good thing.” Could charisma fall in that category? That’s the suggestion of <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-23344-001/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-25148"></span></p>
<p>Jasmine Vergauwe of the University of Ghent and her collaborators began by investigating a mainly American sample, employees in an international aerospace company. They focused on around 300 leaders (supervisors to general managers), two-thirds of them male and typically in their late 40s, who rated themselves on a personality measure focused on capturing charismatic leader qualities. They then rated their own effectiveness as leaders, and the more charismatic they rated themselves, the more effective they believed they were. But when other members of the organisation rated the same leaders, a different picture emerged. Each group – peers, subordinates and managers – described the same pattern: both low-charisma and high-charisma leaders were seen as less effective than those in between. Charisma was useful up to a point, but beyond that, it was counterproductive.</p>
<p>If large doses of charisma are toxic, maybe we can understand why by examining the ingredient list. In the earlier surveys, Vergauwe’s team had used a measure of charismatic personality composed of four aspects: boldness, colour, imagination and mischief. Each has obvious leadership benefits but could also create problems: for example, <i>colourful</i> leaders are extraverted and inspirational, but prefer being in the spotlight to toiling away invisibly on lower-key issues. Similarly, <i>imaginative</i> leaders are visionary and creative, but can tend towards the eccentric and concerning themselves only with the big picture. Vergauwe noted that these negative aspects looked like they could interfere with specific types of leadership activity, and in a second study, the team put this to the test.</p>
<p>Nearly three hundred business leaders from 23 different countries, together with thousands of co-workers, went through a similar rating process as in the first study. This time, however, the measures of leadership effectiveness were more fine-grained, including questions about how the leader treats their staff and how competent they are at organisational strategy and tactics. One hypothesis, that highly charismatic leaders would differ in their treatment of others compared with less charismatic leaders, was not borne out; the researchers thought high charisma would be associated with being more forceful and less enabling, but no such differences emerged.</p>
<p>But when it came to where leaders were putting their focus, the data showed a clear effect. Low-charisma leaders were seen by their staff and colleagues as having too little strategic nous, but no problems with their tactical ability (they could handle the detail but struggled with the big picture). High-charisma leaders, meanwhile, were seen as strategically optimal, but tactically weak (strong on the big picture but weak on detail). Meanwhile, moderate-charisma leaders tended to be viewed as fairly optimal for both strategic and tactical aspects of the job. This suggests that the problem for the highly charismatic isn’t that they are doing too much of anything – over-strategising to the point that it becomes a detriment, for instance – but that they are neglecting other aspects of leadership along the way.</p>
<p>In their search for leaders, organisations are desperate to discover a method, based on particular traits, that ensures they will always strike gold. But wherever they mine, seams that initially appear perfect produce mixed yields, sometimes valuable, sometimes not. Organisations that are mindful of that will do just fine; for instance, knowing that specific blind spots may emerge for charismatic people, you can raise their awareness and develop them into well-balanced leaders. But recruiters who assume that any single quality is pure gold, not realising that under a different light there are copper pyrites in there too, … well, then they’re the fools. And no amount of charismatic figures on their list will make it otherwise.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/famine-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Dyslipdemia</strong></h3>
<p>Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is one of the leading causes of death in developing and developed countries.</p>
<p>Based on the Chinese national data, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 26.7% among workers aged 18-59 years in 2012, and was 33.5% among Chinese aged greater than 45-years-old. The emerging pandemic was partially caused by population growth, rapidly aging and changes of diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>However, recent studies indicated that the early life famine exposure might also increase the later susceptibility to some common chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and fatty liver disease.</p>
<h3><strong>Famine exposure</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>The famine resulted in approximately 30 million premature deaths, and the excess mortality during famine periods was used to reflect the severity of famine exposure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Due to the radical collectivization movement and inclement climate conditions, almost the entirety of Mainland China suffered from extreme food shortage during 1959-1961. The famine severity was different across provinces due to variation of climate, population density, and policies regarding shortage of foods.</p>
<p>The famine resulted in approximately 30 million premature deaths, and the excess mortality during famine periods was used to reflect the severity of famine exposure.</p>
<p>The provinces with excess mortality ≥ 50% were defined as severe famine affected areas; other provinces were defined as less severely affected areas. For example, the excess mortality of Anhui province was the highest, up to 474.9%; Tianjin province was lowest, at only 14.9%.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>In this study, the dyslipidemia prevalence of the non-exposed cohort, fetal stage, infant stage, and preschool stage-exposed cohorts in adulthood were 15.7%, 23.1%, 22.0%, and 18.6%, respectively. Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood after adjusting for age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood after adjusting for age.</p></blockquote>
<p>The risks of dyslipidemia in fetal and infant stage-exposed cohorts were significantly higher than the non-exposed cohort after adjusting for gender and current family economic status.</p>
<p>However, following gender stratification, we found that fetal, infant, and preschool stage exposure to severe famine aggravated the risk of dyslipidemia only in female adults; a similar association was not observed for male adults.</p>
<h3><strong>Gender bias? </strong></h3>
<p>We speculated that this gender-specific effect might be associated with the hypothesis that parents in China traditionally prefer boys to girls. In China, male children took precedence over females due to gender bias, and thus they may potentially be sufficiently nourished during the famine.</p>
<p>Additionally, survivor bias may be another reason to interpret the lack of “effect” on males. Prenatal Males were more vulnerable than females to both short and long term effects of famine and die at higher rates. Thus, male survivors could be healthier than female survivors.</p>
<h3><strong>Explaining the link</strong></h3>
<p>Several mechanisms might explain the link in early-life famine exposure and elevated dyslipidemia risk in later life. Firstly, severe maternal under-nutrition during pregnancy could alter the synthesis of cholesterol, increasing the plasma concentration; this has been shown in animal models.</p>
<p>Secondly, individuals who suffered from severe intrauterine malnutrition are more likely to consume a high-fat diet in adulthood while reducing the level of physical activity, thereby increasing atherogenic lipid profile, as observed by a Dutch famine study. In the present study, we did not explore the correlation between famine exposure and dietary and physical behavior due to lack of relevant data.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lipid metabolic gene methylation level may play a pivotal role in malnutrition during pregnancy, which renders it sensitive to abnormal lipid metabolism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thirdly, lipid metabolic gene methylation level may play a pivotal role in malnutrition during pregnancy, which renders it sensitive to abnormal lipid metabolism. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6592">Elmar et al.</a> comprehensively assessed the associations of prenatal malnutrition and differentially methylated regions (P-DMRs) in humans and found that <em>CPTIA</em> was involved in fatty acid oxidation and <em>KLF13</em> involved in cholesterol metabolism.</p>
<p>The methylation level as one of the principal components of epigenetics, could effectively adjust the expression level of the gene. In addition, epigenetic plasticity may play an important role in the postnatal period and result in “metabolic imprinting” which could be another biological mechanism beneath the association of early life malnutrition with metabolic diseases in adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite China now being food secure, many people are still exposed to food shortages in low-income and middle-income countries. Hence many children are still at short term risk of malnutrition associated mortality and morbidity, but also at long-term risk of adult non-communicable diseases. The heavily short and long-term adverse effects from severe food shortage ask us to implement the urgent interventions to lower their occurrence or improve their consequences.</p>

<p>
 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) affect 150 million people annually. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, 30–50% of patients experience recurrent UTIs. In addition, the growing prevalence of UPEC that are resistant to last-line antibiotic treatments, and more recently to carbapenems and colistin, make UTI a prime example of the antibiotic-resistance crisis and emphasize the need for new approaches to treat and prevent bacterial infections. UPEC strains establish reservoirs in the gut from which they are shed in the faeces, and can colonize the periurethral area or vagina and subsequently ascend through the urethra to the urinary tract, where they cause UTIs. UPEC isolates encode up to 16 distinct chaperone-usher pathway pili, and each pilus type may enable colonization of a habitat in the host or environment. For example, the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH binds mannose on the bladder surface, and mediates colonization of the bladder. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying UPEC persistence in the gut. Here, using a mouse model, we show that F17-like and type 1 pili promote intestinal colonization and show distinct binding to epithelial cells distributed along colonic crypts. Phylogenomic and structural analyses reveal that F17-like pili are closely related to pilus types carried by intestinal pathogens, but are restricted to extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Moreover, we show that targeting FimH with M4284, a high-affinity inhibitory mannoside, reduces intestinal colonization of genetically diverse UPEC isolates, while simultaneously treating UTI, without notably disrupting the structural configuration of the gut microbiota. By selectively depleting intestinal UPEC reservoirs, mannosides could markedly reduce the rate of UTIs and recurrent UTIs.

<p>
 In response to environmental cues that promote IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) generation, IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the endoplasmic reticulum allow the ‘quasisynaptical’ feeding of calcium to the mitochondria to promote oxidative phosphorylation. However, persistent Ca2+ release results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and consequent apoptosis. Among the three mammalian IP3Rs, IP3R3 appears to be the major player in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXL2 (the receptor subunit of one of 69 human SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes) binds IP3R3 and targets it for ubiquitin-, p97- and proteasome-mediated degradation to limit Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. FBXL2-knockdown cells and FBXL2-insensitive IP3R3 mutant knock-in clones display increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and sensitization to Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is frequently mutated or lost in human tumours and syndromes that predispose individuals to cancer. We found that PTEN competes with FBXL2 for IP3R3 binding, and the FBXL2-dependent degradation of IP3R3 is accelerated in Pten−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PTEN-null cancer cells. Reconstitution of PTEN-null cells with either wild-type PTEN or a catalytically dead mutant stabilizes IP3R3 and induces persistent Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis. IP3R3 and PTEN protein levels directly correlate in human prostate cancer. Both in cell culture and xenograft models, a non-degradable IP3R3 mutant sensitizes tumour cells with low or no PTEN expression to photodynamic therapy, which is based on the ability of photosensitizer drugs to cause Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity after irradiation with visible light. Similarly, disruption of FBXL2 localization with GGTi-2418, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, sensitizes xenotransplanted tumours to photodynamic therapy. In summary, we identify a novel molecular mechanism that limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to prevent cell death. Notably, we provide proof-of-principle that inhibiting IP3R3 degradation in PTEN-deregulated cancers represents a valid therapeutic strategy.

<p>
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody deposition in tissues such as kidney, skin and lungs. Notably, up to 75% of patients with SLE experience neuropsychiatric symptoms that range from anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment to seizures and, in rare cases, psychosis—collectively this is referred to as central nervous system (CNS) lupus. In some cases, certain autoantibodies, such as anti-NMDAR or anti-phospholipid antibodies, promote CNS lupus. However, in most patients, the mechanisms that underlie these symptoms are unknown. CNS lupus typically presents at lupus diagnosis or within the first year, suggesting that early factors contributing to peripheral autoimmunity may promote CNS lupus symptoms. Here we report behavioural phenotypes and synapse loss in lupus-prone mice that are prevented by blocking type I interferon (IFN) signalling. Furthermore, we show that type I IFN stimulates microglia to become reactive and engulf neuronal and synaptic material in lupus-prone mice. These findings and our observation of increased type I IFN signalling in post-mortem hippocampal brain sections from patients with SLE may instruct the evaluation of ongoing clinical trials of anifrolumab, a type I IFN-receptor antagonist. Moreover, identification of IFN-driven microglia-dependent synapse loss, along with microglia transcriptome data, connects CNS lupus with other CNS diseases and provides an explanation for the neurological symptoms observed in some patients with SLE.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/bqVQrKGjtkY/nature22820">ERF mutations reveal a balance of ETS factors controlling prostate oncogenesis</a></h4>

<p>
 Half of all prostate cancers are caused by the TMPRSS2–ERG gene-fusion, which enables androgens to drive expression of the normally silent E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG in prostate cells. Recent genomic landscape studies of such cancers have reported recurrent point mutations and focal deletions of another ETS member, the ETS2 repressor factor ERF. Here we show these ERF mutations cause decreased protein stability and mostly occur in tumours without ERG upregulation. ERF loss recapitulates the morphological and phenotypic features of ERG gain in normal mouse prostate cells, including expansion of the androgen receptor transcriptional repertoire, and ERF has tumour suppressor activity in the same genetic background of Pten loss that yields oncogenic activity by ERG. In the more common scenario of ERG upregulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicates that ERG inhibits the ability of ERF to bind DNA at consensus ETS sites both in normal and in cancerous prostate cells. Consistent with a competition model, ERF overexpression blocks ERG-dependent tumour growth, and ERF loss rescues TMPRSS2–ERG-positive prostate cancer cells from ERG dependency. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the oncogenicity of ERG is mediated, in part, by competition with ERF and they raise the larger question of whether other gain-of-function oncogenic transcription factors might also inactivate endogenous tumour suppressors.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8bYlgdJYHvU/nature22819">Histone deacetylase 3 prepares brown adipose tissue for acute thermogenic challenge</a></h4>

<p>
 Brown adipose tissue is a thermogenic organ that dissipates chemical energy as heat to protect animals against hypothermia and to counteract metabolic disease. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that determine the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue before environmental cold are unknown. Here we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is required to activate brown adipose tissue enhancers to ensure thermogenic aptitude. Mice with brown adipose tissue-specific genetic ablation of HDAC3 become severely hypothermic and succumb to acute cold exposure. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is nearly absent in brown adipose tissue lacking HDAC3, and there is also marked downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes resulting in diminished mitochondrial respiration. Remarkably, although HDAC3 acts canonically as a transcriptional corepressor, it functions as a coactivator of oestrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) in brown adipose tissue. HDAC3 coactivation of ERRα is mediated by deacetylation of PGC-1α and is required for the transcription of Ucp1, Ppargc1a (encoding PGC-1α), and oxidative phosphorylation genes. Importantly, HDAC3 promotes the basal transcription of these genes independently of adrenergic stimulation. Thus, HDAC3 uniquely primes Ucp1 and the thermogenic transcriptional program to maintain a critical capacity for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue that can be rapidly engaged upon exposure to dangerously cold temperature.

<p>
 BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a potent tumour suppressor gene that modulates environmental carcinogenesis. All carriers of inherited heterozygous germline BAP1-inactivating mutations (BAP1+/−) developed one and often several BAP1−/− malignancies in their lifetime, mostly malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and so on. Moreover, BAP1-acquired biallelic mutations are frequent in human cancers. BAP1 tumour suppressor activity has been attributed to its nuclear localization, where it helps to maintain genome integrity. The possible activity of BAP1 in the cytoplasm is unknown. Cells with reduced levels of BAP1 exhibit chromosomal abnormalities and decreased DNA repair by homologous recombination, indicating that BAP1 dosage is critical. Cells with extensive DNA damage should die and not grow into malignancies. Here we discover that BAP1 localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, it binds, deubiquitylates, and stabilizes type 3 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R3), modulating calcium (Ca2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and mitochondria, promoting apoptosis. Reduced levels of BAP1 in BAP1+/− carriers cause reduction both of IP3R3 levels and of Ca2+ flux, preventing BAP1+/− cells that accumulate DNA damage from executing apoptosis. A higher fraction of cells exposed to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, or to asbestos, survive genotoxic stress, resulting in a higher rate of cellular transformation. We propose that the high incidence of cancers in BAP1+/− carriers results from the combined reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of BAP1. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for the powerful ability of BAP1 to regulate gene–environment interaction in human carcinogenesis.

<p>
 Conventional two-dimensional differentiation from pluripotency fails to recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. Three-dimensional organoids generate complex organ-like tissues; however, it is unclear how heterotypic interactions affect lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in two-dimensional culture. We then derive three-dimensional liver bud organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during liver bud development. We find that liver bud hepatoblasts diverge from the two-dimensional lineage, and express epithelial migration signatures characteristic of organ budding. We benchmark three-dimensional liver buds against fetal and adult human liver single-cell RNA sequencing data, and find a striking correspondence between the three-dimensional liver bud and fetal liver cells. We use a receptor–ligand pairing analysis and a high-throughput inhibitor assay to interrogate signalling in liver buds, and show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) crosstalk potentiates endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Our molecular dissection reveals interlineage communication regulating organoid development, and illuminates previously inaccessible aspects of human liver development.

<p>
 During gestation the developing human fetus is exposed to a diverse range of potentially immune-stimulatory molecules including semi-allogeneic antigens from maternal cells, substances from ingested amniotic fluid, food antigens, and microbes. Yet the capacity of the fetal immune system, including antigen-presenting cells, to detect and respond to such stimuli remains unclear. In particular, dendritic cells, which are crucial for effective immunity and tolerance, remain poorly characterized in the developing fetus. Here we show that subsets of antigen-presenting cells can be identified in fetal tissues and are related to adult populations of antigen-presenting cells. Similar to adult dendritic cells, fetal dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes and respond to toll-like receptor ligation; however, they differ markedly in their response to allogeneic antigens, strongly promoting regulatory T-cell induction and inhibiting T-cell tumour-necrosis factor-α production through arginase-2 activity. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of dendritic cells within the developing fetus and indicate that they mediate homeostatic immune-suppressive responses during gestation.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/mVAwdP9GJr4/nature22375">Homeostatic circuits selectively gate food cue responses in insular cortex</a></h4>

<p>
 Physiological needs bias perception and attention to relevant sensory cues. This process is ‘hijacked’ by drug addiction, causing cue-induced cravings and relapse. Similarly, its dysregulation contributes to failed diets, obesity, and eating disorders. Neuroimaging studies in humans have implicated insular cortex in these phenomena. However, it remains unclear how ‘cognitive’ cortical representations of motivationally relevant cues are biased by subcortical circuits that drive specific motivational states. Here we develop a microprism-based cellular imaging approach to monitor visual cue responses in the insular cortex of behaving mice across hunger states. Insular cortex neurons demonstrate food-cue-biased responses that are abolished during satiety. Unexpectedly, while multiple satiety-related visceral signals converge in insular cortex, chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic ‘hunger neurons’ (expressing agouti-related peptide (AgRP)) bypasses these signals to restore hunger-like response patterns in insular cortex. Circuit mapping and pathway-specific manipulations uncover a pathway from AgRP neurons to insular cortex via the paraventricular thalamus and basolateral amygdala. These results reveal a neural basis for state-specific biased processing of motivationally relevant cues.

A high-profile paper in Cell reports on a new brain stimulation method that's got many neuroscientists excited. The new technique, called temporal interference (TI) stimulation, is said to be able to reach structures deep inside the brain, using nothing more than scalp electrodes.

Currently, the only way to stimulate deep brain structures is by implanting electrodes (wires) into the brain - which is an expensive and potentially dangerous surgical procedure. TI promises to make deep brain stim

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Heralded as a revolution in mental health care – a cost-effective way to deliver evidence-based psychological help to large numbers – low-intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recommended by NICE, the independent health advisory body in England and Wales, for mild to moderate depression and anxiety and is a key part of the “Improving Access to Psychological Therapies” programme in those countries. Prior studies into its effectiveness have been promising. However, little research has looked at whether the benefits last.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300840?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">study</a> in <em>Behaviour Research and Therapy</em> has done that, following a cohort of people with depression and anxiety over time. Disappointingly, the team led by Shehzad Ali at the University of York, found that after completing low-intensity CBT, more than one in two service users had relapsed within 12 months.</p>
<p><span id="more-24965"></span></p>
<p>Low-intensity CBT is based on the same principles as full or high-intensity CBT – clients reflect on and strive to change their habits of thought that could be contributing to their mental distress, and they also learn coping strategies and other skills. However, it’s delivered in such a way as to reduce the need for extended one-on-one time with a qualified psychotherapist. It typically incorporates self-help books and internet exercises, usually completed under the guidance of a “well-being practitioner” or coach who is trained to follow a highly structured programme rather than having any formal psychotherapy training.</p>
<p>To test the longer term outcomes for low-intensity CBT, Ali and his colleagues recruited hundreds of people at a primary care service in West Yorkshire in England. The participants were diagnosed with depression or anxiety, or both, and had enrolled in low-intensity CBT. Some dropped out prematurely and were not included in further analysis.</p>
<p>For current purposes, the researchers were interested in the 439 participants who had recovered during their low-intensity CBT (improvements in their symptoms meant they no longer met the diagnosis for anxiety or depression) and who had ended their course of treatment in agreement with their practitioner or coach – on average this was after seven contacts with their practitioner, including the initial assessment. For comparison, high-intensity CBT with a psychotherapist can last up to 20 sessions.</p>
<p>After finishing their low-intensity CBT, the recovered participants (average age 41, 60 per cent were female, over 90 per cent were white British) completed monthly questionnaires that measured their levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. As time went on, an increasing proportion of the participants showed evidence of having relapsed – that is, their symptoms had deteriorated to a point that suggested they would likely be diagnosed as having anxiety or depression again. By twelve months after the end of their low-intensity CBT, nearly 53 per cent had relapsed; half of these relapses had occurred within two months, 80 per cent within six months (for comparison, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563164">a meta-analysis of high-intensity CBT</a> found that 29 per cent of recovered clients with depression had relapsed within 12 months, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15809409/">a better outcome than for patients who stop taking anti-depressants</a>) .</p>
<p>Is it possible to predict who is likely to relapse? In the current study, recovered participants who still showed some symptoms of depression at the end of their course of low-intensity CBT (but not enough to justify a diagnosis) were far more likely to relapse over the ensuing year. Residual anxiety symptoms were not predictive in this way. The finding for residual depression symptoms suggests many low-intensity CBT users would benefit from some kind of on-going after care, such as booster sessions or other lower-intensity support.</p>
<p>“It seems hasty to consider patients ‘recovered’ at the point of discharge without assessing full remission symptoms over a longer period,” Ali and his colleagues concluded. “It could be argued that many of the relapse cases in this study actually had partial (rather than full) remission at the time of treatment completion, and thus never actually ‘recovered'”.</p>
<p>The findings from this study will fuel the fears of some experts that low-intensity CBT is a form of false economising. It may be quick and cheap but the results suggest that many people are being sent on their way before they are fully recovered.</p>
<p>One counter to that argument is that prior to the roll out of low-intensity CBT, many of the kinds of people who took part in this research (i.e. people with mild to moderate mental health problems) would have received no treatment at all or given powerful drugs. They might have spent months or years on a waiting list for a psychotherapist, during which time their problems may well have worsened. Another point to bear in mind was that this research was conducted in just one service in England, and more research is needed in other areas.</p>
<p>“It is clear that relapse prevention is an overlooked aspect of routine stepped care in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services and an important area for further policy and research developments,” the researchers said.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/08/the-prodigy-effect.html">The Prodigy Effect</a></h4>

This post might turn into a collaborative research project. If you're a data person, or an experimental psychologist interested in this, get in touch. I'd love to see if we can't formalize this idea.<br /><br />Anyway, a <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/mar/05/heimlich/" target="_blank">recent (excellent) Radiolab episode</a> about the strange, unproven ideas of Henry Heimlich (of Heimlich maneuver fame)--along with <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/?1" target="_blank">this Atlantic article</a> about Linus Pauling's ideas about vitamin mega-dosing as a cancer cure--got me thinking about the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease" target="_blank">"Nobel Disease"</a> and the effect that early successes could have on people.<br /><br />According to that link:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Nobel disease is a term used to describe a phenomenon in which Nobel Prize-winning scientists endorse or perform "research" in pseudoscientific areas in their later years. In reality, this "disease" most likely demonstrates that even the most brilliant people are not immune to crank ideas and belief in such ideas will persist to some degree even among Nobelists. It also makes for a convenient argument from authority for lesser cranks, because if a Nobel Prize-winning scientist says it, it must be true!</blockquote>As we know, we humans are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">susceptible to misconceptions, logical fallacies, and biases</a>.<br /><br />What if people who are <i>exceptionally</i> successful from an early age are biased into thinking that they're less fallible, at the exclusion of taking advice and/or criticism, while simultaneously their <i>incredible</i> success paralyzes other people from offering criticism?<br /><br />To put that another way, what I'm calling the "Prodigy Effect" is a two-way cognitive bias wherein one gives their own innate abilities undue positive weight with regards to their early success in a domain (business, art, science, etc.) which at the same time makes others reluctant to offer criticism. This seems like a mix of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-hand_fallacy" target="_blank">hot-hand fallacy</a>, some kind of "beginner's luck" bias, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy" target="_blank">gambler's fallacy</a>, with a dose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias" target="_blank">self-serving bias</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence" target="_blank">spiral of silence</a>.<br /><br />The hot-hand fallacy was made famous by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4788541579061542217&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5" target="_blank">the 1985 <i>Cognitive Psychology</i> paper</a> by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky, "The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences". Basically, this fallacy is one wherein someone who has had an early success at something believes they have a greater chance of success at future tasks.<br /><br />One of the first things that came to mind about this idea was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/m-night-shymalan-movies-keep-getting-worse-2013-6" target="_blank">this chart</a> about M. Night Shyamalan's moving ratings over time. Each successive movie is essentially rated more poorly than the last:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg" /></a></div><br />Or this review of <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace </i>(jump to 4:55) about people not calling out George Lucas on some bad ideas:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"><br />Both Shyamalan and Lucas had <i>crazy</i> successes with <i>The Sixth Sense</i> and <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, respectively. But the subsequent movies that they directed were widely regarded as pretty awful.<br /><br />But of course, these are anecdotes, and what counts is data.<br /><br />My first idea was to take a look at the list of those who have fallen prey to the "Nobel Disease" and to look at their ages compared to the average age of other Nobelists. The hypothesis is that those who are "Nobel Diseased" would be, on average, much younger when they won their first Nobel than the average Nobelist.<br /><br />Thankfully the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize website has an API</a> that provides these data, which I've cleaned and organized <a href="http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/publications/nobel_disease.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. That file also includes the MATLAB script I used to analyze the data. For people with multiple Nobel prizes, I took their age at their first win.<br /><br />What I found was that those 14 people who are classified as having the "Nobel Disease" were, on average, <i>8.4 years younger </i>when they won their first Nobel Prize compared to "normal" Nobelists.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s1600/nobel_disease.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s320/nobel_disease.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />This is significant using a two-way <i>t</i>-test (<i>p</i> = 0.011) and using resampling methods (1000 surrogate group reassignments, <i>p</i> = 0.012).<br /><br />I'd love to do the same analysis on the ratings difference between a director's first film and subsequent films, with the idea that directors who have an early huge hit would then have more poorly-rated future films, but I don't have time to dig into <a href="http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">the Rotten Tomatoes API</a>.<br /><br />This hypothesis could also be tested in an experimental psychology setup, though I don't quite have an idea for the experimental design yet.<br /><br />Anyway, interesting stuff regardless, I think.<br /><br />If you'd like to help, let me know!<br /><br /><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"></div></div><div class="p1"></div><span style="float: left; padding: 5px;"><a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"><img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border: 0;" /></a></span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.jtitle=Cognitive+Psychology&amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2F0010-0285%2885%2990010-6&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;rft.atitle=The+hot+hand+in+basketball%3A+On+the+misperception+of+random+sequences&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft.date=1985&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.epage=&amp;rft.artnum=&amp;rft.au=T+Gilovich%2C+R+Vallone%2C+A+Tversky&amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CSocial+Science">T Gilovich, R Vallone, A Tversky (1985).

<p>What is genetic basis of our intelligence? How to stimulate deep areas of the brain? How to prevent Alzheimer’s disease?  How to slash the cost of treatment of multiple sclerosis? These are some of the questions highlighted in this monthly review of research literature. As usual, while we answer some questions, research studies also dispel some myths and assumption. Whether positive or negative,  the findings always help us to advance further our knowledge of brain and its abilities. </p>
<p>This month, we marked the birthday of Stanley Prusiner, the discoverer of prions – self-replicating proteins behind many neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Recognising the importance of prions finally put the research aimed at finding the cure for these conditions on the right track.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>THE BEST</strong></p>
<p><strong>New genes for intelligence identified</strong></p>
<p>Intelligence is highly heritable: it is estimated that 80% of our intelligence in adulthood is explained by genetic factors. However, our knowledge of specific genes involved in intelligence is very limited. <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3869.html">New study</a> published this month and based on the analysis of genetic data from 78,000 individuals reported 52 genes associated with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/22/is-there-an-association-between-brain-size-and-intelligence/">intelligence</a>, 40 of which are completely novel. Interestingly, many of these genes are also involved in determining other traits such as obesity, BMI, depressive syndromes, Alzheimer’s disease and others.</p>
<p><strong>Brain region responsible for the fear of uncertain future is identified</strong></p>
<p>Many people find it difficult to cope with an uncertain future. Surprisingly, it turned out that this particular behavioural feature closely relates to the size of one specific part of the brain – the striatum. <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/emo-emo0000331.pdf">New research</a> suggests that a larger striatum is typically seen in people who have troubles dealing with uncertainties.  The study was done on psychologically healthy individuals, but an enlarged striatum has also been reported to be associated with general anxiety disorder and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/07/13/multifaceted-causes-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>.  Researchers speculate that an enlarged striatum may be linked to a higher risk of developing these disorders later in life.</p>
<p><strong>Non-invasive method of stimulating deep parts of brain</strong></p>
<p>Electric <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/29/personality-changes-after-deep-brain-stimulation/">stimulation</a> of deep parts of the brain has proven to be beneficial in treating a number of brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, and depression. However, the approach requires implanting of an electrode directly inside the brain, which involves a risky and costly surgery. A <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17)30584-6.pdf">new technique </a>reported this month avoids this problem by using a pair of electrodes located on the surface of the scalp. The method relies on the use of a phenomenon known as temporal interference. This techniques allows the targeted delivery of electrical stimulation to deep areas of brain, such as hippocampus, without stimulating the surface brain area.</p>
<p><strong>New cheap treatment for multiple sclerosis</strong></p>
<p>Antibiotic minocycline, traditionally used as an acne medicine, may provide a safe <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608889">new method </a>of treating <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">multiple sclerosis</a> (MS), at a fraction of current cost of treating this disease. This drug was developed over 50 years ago. It attracted the attention of researchers studying MS due to its spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities. Phase III trials demonstrated that minocycline slows the progress of disease in patients diagnosed during the early stages of MS.</p>
<p><strong>DNA-based vaccine for Alzheimer’s </strong></p>
<p>Despite our growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the development of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/17/alzheimers-disease-now-you-see-it/">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, we still have no single treatment that could cure this condition or stop its progression. An earlier attempt to develop a vaccine preventing the development of Alzheimer’s disease has also failed due to severe side effects. However, <a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-017-0257-7">new article</a> published this month reports a new promising DNA-based vaccine that inhibits the accumulation of amyloid proteins in animals and shows no side effects observed in previous trials. It remains to be seen if these effects can be reproduced in humans.</p>
<p><strong>Blood-brain barrier and omega-3 fatty acids</strong></p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are well known for their positive effects on general health. <a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/comments/S0896-6273(17)30287-8">Recent findings</a> demonstrate that these compounds are critical players in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, the key structure for protecting the brain from various pathogens and toxins. Moreover, researchers demonstrated that permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be regulated by suppressing a protein that transports <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/16/nurturing-the-brain-part-7-omega-3-fatty-acids/">omega-3 acids</a> to blood vessel cells. Making the barrier more penetrable is advantageous for efficient delivery of drugs when treating patients with various brain disorders.<br />
<strong>THE WORST</strong></p>
<p><strong>No stress relief from high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol</strong></p>
<p>Users of cannabis often claim that they use the drug for relaxation and stress relief. More detailed<a href="http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(17)30220-X/fulltext"> investigation</a> of this effect shows a mixed picture. While experimenting with different doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active substance in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/">marijuana</a>, researchers found that small doses of the compound do indeed reduce stress. However, a slightly higher doses (sufficient to produce a mild “high”) produce an opposite effect and increase anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Visual cortex develops and matures much slower than assumed</strong></p>
<p>It is traditionally believed that our visual system, including the parts of brain involved in the analysis of visual information, matures within the first few years of life. A <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2017/05/29/JNEUROSCI.2304-16.2017">new article</a> published this month demonstrates that this assumption is incorrect. Visual cortex continues developing till the late 30s – early 40s. The authors of the article speculate that other parts of the brain may also reach maturity much later in life than currently assumed.</p>
<p><strong>Transcranial direct-current stimulation  does not enhance cognitive training</strong></p>
<p>Transcranial direct-current stimulation () is increasingly used as a method of improving learning abilities. The technique relies on passing weak electric impulses to the brain via electrodes attached to the scalp. Despite the growing popularity of this technique, the evidence in support of its advantages are very limited. A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139">paper</a> published this month casts further doubt on any benefits provided by <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/">tDCS</a>. The author reported no improvements of working memory in a large group of subjects using this method, as compared to controls. Furthermore, the analysis of the existing literature on the subject also does not provide any meaningful support to the method. Clearly, further research on tDCS should be done to confirm or rule out the existence of its effects.</p>
<p><strong>Poor sense of smell in humans is a misconception</strong></p>
<p>The superiority of animals sense of smell compared to humans appears to be obvious to most people. After all, we do rely on a dog’s sense of smell for hunting, and it is well known how quickly sharks can detect the slightest smell of blood. However, a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263">new article</a> published this month in <em>Science</em> attempts to dispel the view that the human ability to detect smells is as bad as we are used to thinking. The number of brain cells involved in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/03/smell-your-age/">smell</a> detection in humans is almost the same as in animals, and it is estimated that we can distinguish up to one trillion of different odors. We may lack the degree of specialization demonstrated by many animals in interpreting the information obtained through olfactory system, but the human ability to recognize smells is definitely much stronger than we are accustomed to think.</p>
<p><strong>Women are not better than men at face recognition</strong></p>
<p>It is commonly assumed that women are better  at recognizing and reading faces and correctly interpreting facial expressions. However, a <a href="http://eneuro.org/content/early/2017/04/26/ENEURO.0104-17.2017">study</a> published this month casts serious doubts on this assumption. Using a series of tests, scientists demonstrated that no detectable difference in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/17/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces/">facial recognition</a> exists between two genders. Importantly, the neuroimaging of the areas of brain known to be involved in face recognition has shown identical neural activity in both men and women when they were watching a video clip featuring multiple familiar and non-familiar faces.</p>

<p>Exercising self-control leaves you feeling drained. That’s what many of us in the West believe and it’s what we seem to experience – think of the fatigue after a morning spent dealing with difficult clients or focused on spreadsheets on a computer screen. But in Indian culture, there is a widespread belief that mental effort is energising – that the more concentration and self-control you expend in one situation, the more invigorated you will feel for the next challenge.</p>
<p>Psychology has, so far, mostly backed up our Western intuitions. Over 100 studies – nearly all conducted in the West – have shown that participants are less able to resist temptation or exercise mental focus after completing a mentally taxing task, an effect that researchers call “ego depletion”. But now <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24735-001/">a paper in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em></a> has tested Indian participants and it shows for the first time a “reverse ego-depletion effect” – the more difficult an initial mental task, the better participants performed on a subsequent challenge.</p>
<p><span id="more-24854"></span></p>
<p>Belief in the benefits of exercising self-control permeates Indian Culture. Children are taught concentration techniques, such as focusing on a candle flame in a dark room. Regular prayers and meditation are widely encouraged. It’s a cultural view that appears to manifest in education: Indian children have longer class times and spend more time on homework than American children; Indian students spend more time reading books than Americans.</p>
<p>To test how these beliefs and practices might shape the basic psychological processes underlying self-control, Krishna Savani at Nanyang Technological University and Veronika Job at the University of Zurich completed four studies involving hundreds of Indian participants, as well as participants in Switzerland and the US.</p>
<p>The usual procedure was that participants completed an initial easy or difficult ten-minute challenge, such as solving mazes, the Stroop test (naming the ink colour of words denoting a different colour, e.g. “blue” written in red), word searches, or an editing type task, and then they proceeded to second, unrelated task of a similar kind. For example, the first task might be easy or difficult mazes, and the second task might be a Stroop test.</p>
<p>Indian participants who completed a more difficult initial task tended to perform better on the second challenge than Indian participants who completed an easier initial challenge – in other words, reverse ego-depletion. In most cases, Western participants showed the opposite pattern of performance, showing worse results after a tougher initial test, which is the established ego-depletion effect.</p>
<p>Among Indian participants, the more strongly they endorsed the idea that mental effort is energising, the stronger the reverse ego-depletion that they tended to exhibit.</p>
<p>These new findings challenge the established theory in Western psychology that self-control or willpower is like a fuel, that if you use it up in one situation, you will have less left over for the next challenge.</p>
<p>It’s even been suggested that self-control depends on sugar in the body and that you can enhance your willpower by consuming glucose drinks.</p>
<p>But as is so often the case in psychology these days, the story is not that simple. Recently, there have been several <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/24/new-research-challenges-the-idea-that-willpower-is-a-limited-resource/">failed attempts</a> to replicate the ego-depletion effect, even with Western participants. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/11/08/labs-worldwide-report-converging-evidence-that-undermines-the-low-sugar-theory-of-depleted-willpower/">Doubts</a> have been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/26/new-review-prompts-a-re-think-on-what-low-sugar-levels-do-to-our-thinking/">raised</a> about the links between self-control and glucose. Other <a href="http://99u.com/articles/7257/how-to-power-through-any-demanding-task">studies</a> have suggested that if people believe their willpower is unlimited, then expending self-control doesn’t harm their performance. All this points to motivation as the key factor underlying the exercise of self-control, not some energy-based physiological process.</p>
<p>These new results are in line with the motivation account. They show for the first time that if people believe mental effort is energising, not only is their performance not adversely affected by prior mental demands, but it is actually enhanced.</p>
<p>How malleable are these beliefs? In a final study, Savani and Job tested the effects of manipulating Indian and American participants’ beliefs about self-control. One group read a 600-word article about how exerting willpower is energising, the other group read an article of the same length about how exerting willpower is mentally draining. Then both groups completed two tests of mental concentration in succession.</p>
<p>Participants from India and America who read the energising text showed reverse ego-depletion: their performance on the second task was better if the first task was more challenging.  In fact the worse performance on the second task was for participants who read the “exerting willpower is energising” text and then completed an initial easy task. If you believe mental effort is energising, then it seems it is tasks that are too easy that take more of a toll.</p>
<p>The researchers said their results “can be viewed as casting further doubt on claims that ego-depletion is a pan-cultural phenomenon rooted in human biology, and instead supports the argument that motivational factors play a crucial role in determining how strenuous tasks influence subsequent self-control exertion.”</p>

<p>Results-free review is a new model of peer review aiming to reduce publication bias, preventing impressive ends justifying poor means. <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a> <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0167-7">launched results-free review</a> in December 2016; today the first <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0183-2">article</a> to have undergone the results-free peer review process, by <a href="http://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/pcu-group/researchers/zorana-zupan/">Zorana Zupan</a> and colleagues from the University of Cambridge (UK), was published. The authors also discuss their research in <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/12/are-micro-drinking-behaviors-responsible-for-increased-wine-consumption-when-served-in-a-larger-glass">this blog</a>.</p>
<p>The authors of the article and <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/koula.asimakopoulou.html">Koula Asimakopoulou,</a> the Associate Editor who handled the peer review of the article, talk to us about their thoughts on results-free review.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do you think results-free review could help move towards a more robust publication process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>Results-free review is one of several measures that could improve the scientific process towards the goal of research that is more transparent, reproducible and efficient as described in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021">Manifesto for Reproducible Science</a>. Results-free peer review shifts the focus of the decision to publish from the results of the research towards the importance of the research question and the adequacy of the methods used to answer it. Given that the stages of the scientific process are inter-connected, introducing measures at the evaluation stage may also positively impact other stages. For example, researchers may focus more on ensuring robust designs for their studies if these are the key point of evaluation, as in results-free peer review. Further, if findings are not central to the evaluation, this may dis-incentivize researchers from data dredging (also known as p-hacking) to produce statistically significant results to increase the chances of publication.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor: </strong>It is well known that studies reporting null results are less likely to receive favorable attention in terms of publication than studies reporting significant effects. The difficulty with this approach is the resultant publication bias that can take place and which, in some cases, can mask our understanding of science, to include cases where results showing that eg. Drug therapy is no better than placebo never appear. For this reason, a results-free review is likely to help a more objective peer review process to take place.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have any previous experiences of publication bias?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> We have experience of journals rejecting manuscripts describing studies that aimed to replicate and extend previously published studies because they are not seen as sufficiently novel.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Yes – especially with systematic reviews where there are not enough studies showing an effect to justify their publication.</p>
<blockquote><p>Well aware of the bias against null results we opted for a review process we judged could guard against this</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>As far back as 1977, Michael J. Mahoney found that <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01173636">reviewers judged the methods and quality of null studies more critically than those of positive studies</a>. More recently, John P. A. Ioannidis identified a <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187180">substantial time lag in the publication of trials reporting null results</a>, with null results taking several months longer from the time of submission to eventual publication than positive results. Could results-free review offer a solution to current barriers of publishing null results?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Results-free review does indeed have the potential to overcome the publication bias against null results. This is a testable hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Of course.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our experience of the review process was positive. It seemed like a more scientific approach to peer review with the paper judged on the question asked and the methods used to address the question.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>As an author, what factors influenced your decision to opt into results-free review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>Our study provided no evidence to support the hypotheses tested. Well aware of the bias against null results we opted for a review process we judged could guard against this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Did taking part in results-free review impact the preparation or reporting of your manuscript at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>We prepared the manuscript in the same manner as for all our publications then submitted the sections sequentially.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of having peer review conducted in this way? And how did it compare to standard peer review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Our experience of the review process was positive. It seemed like a more scientific approach to peer review with the paper judged on the question asked and the methods used to address the question.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> It helped me focus on the methods of the study. The difficulty that I did have was that it felt like I was missing a big part of the paper and in many respects a paper can have a great method section but totally incomprehensible / poorly analyzed results, which worried me at first. So it felt like I was reviewing half a paper rather than a complete piece of work which will take some getting used to!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/peer-review-policy">open peer review</a> model further improves the transparency of results-free review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>Open peer reviews could help build confidence in the results-free process. Moreover, there is some evidence that open peer reviews are of higher quality than those prepared anonymously, although the potential risks of open-identity peer review should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor: </strong>Most certainly. I am sure we can all think of peer reviewers who have been unkind at times, probably inadvertently. I find that an open peer review system encourages reviewers to think carefully about their recommendations.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From the readers’ point of view, do you think that results-free review could change the appraisal of a study’s quality?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Results-free review does indeed have the potential to alter how readers approach papers, highlighting the importance of the research question and the methods used to address this as the context in which results are to be understood. If it results in more studies being published with null findings this would provide an evidence base that is more representative of a field than the one that currently exists.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> I think it places greater emphasis on ensuring that when you read a Method section and an Introduction, these two tie well together and are logically related. So in that sense, yes, a results-free review may well make it harder for papers to get through a first review, unless the sections that are available to the reviewer are particularly well written.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>From your perspective, what are the key pros and cons of results-free review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author: </strong>There are many advantages of results-free review. As well as removing the bias towards publishing statistically significant findings, this process could improve the quality of systematic reviews if it fosters a less biased pool of published studies, and help in generating unbiased hypotheses. Overall this would improve the quality, reliability and credibility of scientific findings.</p>
<p>In terms of cons, the division of the peer review process into two stages may require additional work for editors and reviewers, with the potential to lengthen the peer review process, although this was not our experience. Without formal evaluation, it has the potential to appear as though it is addressing important sources of bias in the evaluation of research findings but may not actually do so and thereby inadvertently lead to false reassurance about its contribution to reproducible science.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> The pro is obviously a move towards minimizing publication bias. The cons have to do with the paper feeling incomplete when you first look at it!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you see a future for results-free review in becoming the ‘norm’ for peer review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Yes, we can see this becoming the norm. However, high-impact journals must lead in adopting these procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Yes</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Results-free review offers one potential solution to tackling publication bias. However, what other key steps do you think need to be taken to address the problem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Other key areas to tackling publication bias are identified in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021">Manifesto for Reproducible Science</a>. These include: pre-registering studies, data sharing and incentivizing good practice.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Dedicated outlets for studies reporting null results may be helpful.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contribution to the future of peer review</strong><br />
The number of new publishing initiatives is on the rise and it is important that these are rigorously evaluated to ensure they are having the desired outcomes. The evaluation of results-free review, will be conducted by our randomized controlled trial, in order to determine how (an if) it influences publication bias and the editorial decision-making process. If deemed effective, it is our hope that results-free review will become the ‘norm’ for peer review.</p>
<p>In a field which has been plagued by the under-reporting of both <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0135-2">replications</a> and <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-7283-1-2">null findings</a>, <em>BMC Psychology</em> has always had a policy of publishing all sound science, thus aiming to reduce the impact of publication bias. We have never made editorial decisions on the basis of the perceived interest of a study or its likely impact. We hope that results-free review is another feather in our bow in the effort to improve the reproducibility of our published research even further.</p>
<p>BioMed Central is committed to combating publication bias and promoting reproducibility. In a complementary approach to results-free review, BioMed Central is now also offering authors the chance to submit <a href="https://cos.io/rr/">Registered Reports</a>, another format shifting the emphasis from research results, to the scientific questions being asked and the strength of the study design.<em> BMC Biology</em> is the first BioMed Central journal to embrace the format and is now <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/bmcb/default.aspx">welcoming submissions</a>. You can learn more about the initiative by <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/05/03/scientific-odyssey-pre-registering-voyage/">reading this blog</a> from the journal’s Chief Editor.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Splash-Graham-Norris-Flickr-CC-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>A <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z">recent study</a> of ours published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, found that when the same portion of wine was served in a larger, rather than smaller, glass, wine sales increased by almost 10%. But how does a larger glass lead to increased sales or consumption? One possibility, suggested by another recent study, is that the same portion of wine in a larger, rather than smaller, glass is perceived as a smaller amount. This perceptual effect could lead to changes in drinking behavior – for example, larger glasses might encourage faster drinking, lessen satisfaction with the amount served, or increase the pleasure associated with drinking the wine. We wanted to examine these possible mechanisms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD011045/PUBHLTH_portion-package-or-tableware-size-changing-selection-and-consumption-food-alcohol-and-tobacco">Our recent Cochrane review</a> found that larger portion sizes and tableware increased consumption of food and non-alcoholic drinks, but found no evidence relating to consumption of alcohol. If larger glasses increase alcohol sales as suggested by <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z">our recent study</a> increasingly large glasses could counteract policies and regulations aimed at curbing alcohol consumption. Given that alcohol is associated with an increased risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and liver disease, reducing the amount consumed would lead to significant health benefits.</p>

<p>In this study, <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0183-2">published today</a> in <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a>, we randomized female university students to drink a fixed portion of red wine (175 ml) in a larger (370 ml) or smaller (250 ml) wine glasses of the same design, in a lab-based setting. We observed their micro-drinking behavior (drinking speed, number and duration of sips) using video recordings and assessed their satisfaction and pleasure with the wine they were served using self-report measures.</p>
<p>We found no evidence that consuming wine from a larger, in comparison to a smaller glass, alters micro-drinking behavior, satisfaction or pleasure. Nonetheless, the results showed that regardless of glass size, faster drinking and greater pleasure increased the desire to drink further.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to determine whether a larger glass increases consumption by encouraging faster drinking and increasing pleasure in naturalistic settings such as bars or pubs, and with a more representative sample.</p>
<p>If clear mechanisms for how larger wine glasses may increase alcohol consumption are established, this would clarify the circumstances under which glass size may have an effect. This might inform local policies, for example, larger glass sizes served in licensed premises could be capped in order to limit alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>
 Complete and accurate reference genomes and annotations provide fundamental tools for characterization of genetic and functional variation. These resources facilitate the determination of biological processes and support translation of research findings into improved and sustainable agricultural technologies. Many reference genomes for crop plants have been generated over the past decade, but these genomes are often fragmented and missing complex repeat regions. Here we report the assembly and annotation of a reference genome of maize, a genetic and agricultural model species, using single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and notable improvements in the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the repetitive portion of the genome revealed more than 130,000 intact transposable elements, allowing us to identify transposable element lineage expansions that are unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length transcripts obtained by single-molecule real-time sequencing. In addition, comparative optical mapping of two other inbred maize lines revealed a prevalence of deletions in regions of low gene density and maize lineage-specific genes.

You get on during a shift change, when a new driver takes over for the old one. The new driver appears to be Middle Eastern, and for a second you have a fleeting reaction that the situation might become dangerous. This is embarrassing and ridiculous, you think. You hate that the thought even crossed your mind. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country" target="_blank">1.8 billion</a> Muslims in the world.

Nonetheless, in terms of statistical co-occurrence in the English language, the root word <i>Islam-</i> is now associated with all that is bad and evil in the world. Could the constant exposure to news about radical Islamist terrorism and Trump's proposed <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/871143765473406976" target="_blank">Muslim Ban</a> result in an involuntary or “forced” stereotyping in the bus scenario above?<br /><br />A recent study found that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183" target="_blank">semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases</a>, which means that <i><b>machines</b></i> (which do not have cultural stereotypes) become “biased” when they learn word association patterns from large bodies of text, such as Google News. The authors used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding" target="_blank" title="a representation of words as points in a vector space">word embedding</a> algorithm called Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) to improve the performance of the machine learning model. As a measure of human bias, they used the popular <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9654756." target="_blank">implicit association test</a> (IAT), from which they developed the Word-Embedding Association Test (WEAT). Instead of response times (RTs) to a specific set of words, WEAT used the distance between a set of vectors in semantic space. The authors were able to replicate the associations seen in every IAT they tested (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183" target="_blank">Caliskan et al., 2017)</a>, suggesting:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: red;"><b>The  number, variety, and substantive importance of our results raise the  possibility that all implicit human biases are reflected in the  statistical properties of language. </b></span></blockquote><br /><b>Arab-Muslim Implicit Association Test</b><br /><br />Because of the relationship between word associations and implicit bias, I decided to take the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Study?tid=-1">Arab-Muslim IAT</a> at <a href="https://www.projectimplicit.net/index.html" target="_blank">Project Implicit</a>, an organization interested in “<b>implicit social cognition </b>— thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness and control.” This definition seemed to fit with the bus scenario, which involved an impulse to profile the driver based on a rapid evaluation of perceived ethnicity.<br /><br />In the Arab-Muslim IAT, the participant classifies words as good (e.g, <i>Fantastic</i>, <i>Fabulous</i>) or bad (e.g, <i>Horrible</i>, <i>Hurtful</i>), and proper names as Arab Muslim (e.g., <i>Akbar</i>, <i>Hakim</i>) or “Other People”  (e.g, <i>Ernesto</i>, <i>Philippe</i>, <i>Kazuki</i>).<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> The bias is revealed when you have to sort both of these categories at the same time. Are you slower when Good/Arab Muslim are mapped to the same key, compared to when Bad/Arab Muslim are mapped to the same key?

The strength of semantic associations between words can vary over time and contexts, so we can wonder if this has shifted any in the last year. In addition, different results have been observed when <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23175679/" target="_blank">faces were used</a> instead of names, and when a better list of “Other People” names was used to specify ingroup vs. outgroup (see explanation in footnote <b><span style="color: purple;">#2</span></b>).<br /><br />A Muslim-Terrorism test has in fact been developed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435844" target="_blank">Webb et al. (2011)</a>. They used a variant of the IAT (the <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/gnat/" target="_blank">GNAT</a>) with Muslim names (e.g., <i>Abdul</i>, <i>Ali</i>, <i>Farid</i>, <i>Khalid</i>, <i>Tariq</i>), Scottish names (e.g., <i>Alistair</i>, <i>Angus</i>, <i>Douglas</i>, <i>Gordon</i>, <i>Hamish</i>), terrorism-related words (e.g., <i>attack</i>, <i>bomb</i>, <i>blast</i>, <i>explosives</i>, <i>threat</i>) and peace-related words (e.g., <i>friendship</i>, <i>harmony</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>serenity</i>, <i>unity</i>). In an interesting twist, the authors varied “implementation intentions” to flip the Muslim-Terrorism test to the Muslim-Peace test in half of the subjects:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Following the practice trials, one-half of the participants (<i>implementation intention condition</i>)  were asked to form an implementation intention to help them to respond  especially quickly to Muslim names and peace-related words. Participants  were asked to tell themselves ‘If Muslim names and peace are at the top  of the screen, then I respond especially fast to Muslim words and peace  words!’. Participants were asked to repeat this statement several times  before continuing with the experiment. The other half of the  participants (<i>standard instruction condition</i>) were given no further instructions.</blockquote><br />I actually discovered this strategy on my own in 2008, when my IAT results revealed I was <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/human-all-too-human-and-alien.html" title="Human, All Too Human (AND Alien)">Human AND Alien</a> and NEITHER <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/im-alive-im-dead.html" title="I'm Alive I'm Dead">Dead NOR Alive</a>. <br /><br />And indeed, the Muslim-Peace instructions neutralized the strong Muslim-Terrorism association seen in the control participants <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435844" target="_blank">Webb et al.

Even before we're born, human beings are sensitive to face-like shapes, according to a paper just published in Current Biology.



British researchers Vincent M. Reid and colleagues of the University of Lancaster used lasers to project a pattern of three red dots onto the abdomen of pregnant women. The lasers were bright enough to be visible from inside the womb. The dots were arranged to be either "face-like", i.e. with two "eyes" above one "mouth", or inverted. The inverted condition was a

<p>New “CRO Finder” Connects Scientists with Specialized Resources</p>
<p>by Cliff Culver, VP Strategy and GM, Science Exchange | <a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com">www.scienceexchange.com</a></p>
<p>NEW YORK, June 7, 2017 — The Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), the only public charity solely focused on funding the development of drugs for Alzheimer’s, and Science Exchange today announced the launch of ADDF ACCESS, a first-of-its-kind online platform designed to match scientists working on central nervous system (CNS) diseases with a vetted network of contract research organizations (CROs).</p>
<p>ADDF ACCESS meets the unique needs of scientists in both academia and small biotech companies by combining the resources of Science Exchange, the world’s leading marketplace for outsourced research and development, with the Alzheimer’s drug discovery knowledge of the ADDF.</p>
<p>“Drug discovery requires a wide range of expertise, from medicinal chemistry and pharmacology to project management and regulatory affairs,” said Lauren Friedman, Ph.D., ADDF ACCESS program director. “Researchers don’t always have the interdisciplinary teams needed to develop a drug. We created the new ACCESS website with Science Exchange to connect researchers with high-quality CROs and provide guidance and resources to help successfully advance their drug programs.”</p>
<p>On ADDF ACCESS, scientists will find:</p>
<p>A network of CROs and consultants with CNS drug discovery expertise, vetted by the ADDF and Science Exchange<br />
An expert concierge service to match scientists with the right CROs, solicit multiple competitive quotes, and manage projects<br />
A library of educational resources, including a guide to CNS drug discovery and development<br />
“Early-stage drug research is the engine that drives progress in treating Alzheimer’s and CNS diseases,” said Dr. Howard Fillit, M.D., executive director and chief science officer of the ADDF. “We are excited to provide a resource specifically designed to facilitate connections that fuel this engine. Every scientific discovery gets us closer to finding a treatment.”</p>
<p>“Eliminating the laborious, resource-intensive process of finding and negotiating with CROs and other service providers helps researchers focus on their important work, and that’s what Science Exchange is all about,” said Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Science Exchange. “We are thrilled to partner with the ADDF on this new ACCESS website that will give scientists specializing in CNS diseases the tools and services they need to bring important, potentially life-saving drugs to market faster.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sorry to bother you – I’m just after three pounds sixty-five for a bus ticket to Bromley.</em>”</p>
<p>Living in an urban area you frequently hear this kind of request, which showcases a persuasion approach called the “pique technique”, whereby people are more likely to comply with requests for an unusually specific quantity, because it piques their interest. But do people really give more readily, or in higher amounts, when exposed to the technique? A <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2017.1305986">meta-analysis</a> in the journal <i>Social Influence</i> puts pique through its paces.</p>
<p><span id="more-24836"></span></p>
<p>The technique was first investigated in the nineties by a trio of researchers – <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb00610.x/abstract">Michael Santos, Craig Leve and Anthony Pratkanis</a> – with experimental assistants posing as panhandlers on Santa Cruz wharf and asking passers-by for either 17 cents or a quarter. They found the unusual sum led to more compliance from the passers-by, and so to more coinage in the cup.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesised that the unusual sum is effective as it disrupts the “refusal script” that people have primed in response to generic requests, and instead generates curiosity that encourages the person to engage. The paper spawned further work exploring the technique, including its effectiveness when asking for someone’s time, but some studies found no effects or even negative effects.</p>
<p>To make sense of this muddied picture, Seyoung Lee and Thomas Feeley from the University of Buffalo looked across the available research, six studies in all, to verify whether there is a reliable case for the technique and what might be driving it.</p>
<p>Does piquing pay? Across the studies, there were 16 tests of whether successful requests led to more generous donations when the request was for an unusual sum, and the meta-analysis showed that this was not the case: donations, when given, were similar for both typical and unusual request amounts.</p>
<p>However, piquers earned more overall, because the technique enhanced the chances of getting a donation in the first place. The size of the effect was larger than for other tricks for gaining compliance like the <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique">foot in door</a> technique (.27 vs. .11 in terms of statistical effect sizes). The effect size varied across different studies and conditions, so Lee and Feeley investigated what might moderate it, finding the technique more successful in studies conducted in France compared to the US, and working better for smaller requests than for those involving more than a dollar.</p>
<p>The analysis also showed that when the technique was used, people were more likely to respond by asking what the money was for. This is consistent with the idea that the technique disrupts automatic processes and encourages conscious engagement with the request. It’s as if the unusual detail shakes the person out of a slumber to see the moment as the beginning of an interaction, rather than as environmental noise to tune out. Unfortunately the paper doesn’t provide data on whether these curious people were more likely to donate; we do know, however, that when the piquer preemptively explained what the request was for (as per my opening example), participants were more likely to comply.</p>
<p>Many persuasion techniques are overtly exploitative, trying to win compliance by wearing away the target’s defences. Piquing in some way fits this mould, by dodging underneath the normal means of parrying an unsolicited request. But its basic mechanism seems legitimate: to wake us up to what’s happening right now, and then leave it to our conscience how to react. After all, even if you have a principled objection to giving to charity street reps or to the homeless, it’s no bad thing to sometimes be prompted to consciously reflect on your decision.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/11/laziness-and-being-academic-batman.html">Laziness and being an Academic Batman</a></h4>

Batman sucks compared to the rest of the Justice League: Superman could vaporize him before he could even think to pull out his anti-Superman spray; the Flash could pummel him at light speed; Wonder Woman could Lasso of Truth him. But Batman's gone toe-to-toe with each of them and won many times.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kFyRPqh1WNo/UksI1q1HmuI/AAAAAAAAFmI/wpfeTeaBohQ/s400/batman_tower_of_babel.jpg" style="cursor: move;" width="381" /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">(Seriously if you haven't read <i>Tower of Babel</i>, stop reading my drivel right now and go do so.)</div><br />Other than the fact that it's all made up, how can this happen?<br /><br />Batman's strength is in his planning. He thinks ahead and prepares for every contingency, no matter how small. There's a very important lesson here. It's okay if you're not the smartest, fastest, or strongest as long as you're mindful of your limitations and can admit your own weaknesses. To own them.<br /><br />When I give academic talks, I've got 20-30 extra slides tacked onto the end that contain data and results from several side experiments. Not only is it thorough, but it shows you've thought hard about the problems you're addressing. It's amazing the kinds of reactions you get from the crowd when someone asks a pointed scientific question and you can say, "well according to this followup experiment we found that..."<br /><br />It's no secret that I was a really poor undergraduate student. I only vaguely knew what I wanted to do and I couldn't admit that I didn't love where I was at the time.<br /><br />I hated busy work. I hated the social pressure to be <i>seen</i> doing something as opposed to <i>actually</i> doing something. That's what I felt like college was.<br /><br />After I graduated my two roommates and I spent most of that first post-college summer locked away in a bedroom playing video games until sunrise. All day, every day. We moved all of our desks into one bedroom so we could sit side-by-side-by-side and play <i>Counterstrike </i>and <i>Team Fortress</i>, <i>Civ III</i>, <i>Starcraft</i>, and whatever else grabbed our attention. This gaming marathon was punctuated by me heading out to party on the weekends.<br /><br />My girlfriend of 4 months at the time (and now, by some stroke of luck I'll never fathom, my wife) would stop by the apartment on her way to work in the morning to say hello. We'd all still be sleeping, of course, because we'd just gone to bed after another marathon night of gaming.<br /><br />From the outside this must have looked like incredible laziness. But it was largely apathy and paralysis induced by the unknown. I just didn't know how to get a job, how to be a scientist, or how to change my situation.<br /><br />Since those days I've caught a lot of lucky breaks to help me get to where I am today.<br /><br />But a big part of what helped my early scientific career was my laziness. Or rather, my disdain of busy work.<br /><br />I'm a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love#The_Tale_of_the_Man_Who_Was_Too_Lazy_to_Fail" target="_blank">"constructive laziness" and being too lazy to fail</a>. That is, I try to take the time to think though the entirety of a problem before trying to attack it. This can take you a long way (though it can also hinder you if you're not careful...)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://xkcd.com/974/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="166" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Algorithms are laziness!<br /><br />Laziness is undervalued and "putting in your hours" is overvalued.<br /><br />Wait, that's not quite right... maybe a better way for me to say that is: the power of constructive, focused laziness is undervalued and people put an unwarranted emphasis on "being seen at work". Think back to the story about Gauss's algorithm for summing the first 100 digits. It was busy work and he solved it by being smart (and possibly a smart ass), not by just chugging through it like everyone else.<br /><br />I recognize that what I'm about to say comes from the perspective of a certain kind of privilege, but I've worked manual labor jobs and there is something to be said for a career that you can leave at work. Science isn't like that. There's a cost associated with it. When I was driving a forklift and working the loading dock, I sure as hell didn't lay in bed at night wondering how to do it better. But now I spend a lot of my time "on" and thinking about my research. I have to make time to turn off.<br /><br />But that's a cost I accept because working the loading dock wasn't what I wanted to be doing forever.<br /><br />Without my deep, internal drive to want to socialize, hang out, shoot the shit, and do nothing, I wouldn't be where I am today. I value spending time with my wife, son, and friends, and I value a career that allows me to do that.<br /><br />"Being privileged to work hard for long hours at something you think is worth doing is the best kind of play." - Robert Heinlein, Lazarus Long, <i>Time Enough for Love</i>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we celebrate World Oceans Day with a Science Exchange success story. This is a story about connecting ocean conservation advocates with the scientists whose expertise is helping to guide conservation strategy.  </span></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_1080" style="width: 391px;"><img alt="World Oceans Day -- Sharks" class=" wp-image-1080" height="259" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/World-Oceans-Day-leopard-sharks-300x204.jpg" width="381" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Robust shark populations are a sign of healthy oceans.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://fusion.net/section/project-earth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Earth team from Fusion TV </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">approached Science Exchange with a unique sequencing project. They were working on a </span><a href="http://fusion.net/story/569662/fusion-shark-cartilage-industry/#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentary film </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about the illegal poaching of sharks for use in shark cartilage capsules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that shark cartilage is </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2902826/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ineffective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or even </span><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576906003651"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro-inflammatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite this and the importance of conserving sharks, who are the ocean’s apex predators, the cartilage capsule industry has managed to persuade retailers and consumers that shark cartilage could promote joint and bone health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fusion TV Project Earth team wanted to find out if cartilage pills contained illegally obtained shark tissue. They needed a service provider who could perform DNA sequencing on 30 different supplements to see if they contained protected or endangered sharks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Science Exchange network, the Fusion TV Project Earth team obtained sequencing services from a California-based service provider. Together, they were able to detect DNA from the endangered scalloped hammerhead sharks, whose trade is highly regulated, in the capsules sold at nationwide health food stores and pharmacies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fusion TV Project Earth team urged both the cartilage pill manufacturers and retailers to share more precise information about the origins of the shark material found in the pills. In response, </span><a href="http://fusion.net/story/569662/fusion-shark-cartilage-industry/#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two major retailers removed shark cartilage pills from their stores and website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results showed that scientific evidence can influence positive change and help to protect our natural environment. And by providing the Fusion TV Project Earth team with easy access to the world’s best scientific service providers, Science Exchange helped put the data directly into the hands of the agents of change.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/suzukii-strawberry-by-David-Duneau-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The impressive diversity of animals we see today results from evolutionary adaptations that allow animals to inhabit different types of habitats and exploit different food sources. The ability to adapt to a new food has ecological, evolutionary, and agricultural relevance: many of the world’s most problematic pest species cause extensive agricultural damage precisely because of their ability to exploit new foods. This makes understanding how animals adapt their biology to match that of their food all the more important.</p>
<p>To be able to use a new food, animals need to tune their physiology, their morphology, and their behaviour to match the characteristics of the new food. They need to adjust their physiology so that the nutritional composition of the new food can support their growth and reproduction. They need to develop morphological features that allow them to exploit the new food. Finally, they need to acquire behavioural preferences to find and to choose to feed on the new food.</p>
<p>One way to understand how animals adapt to new foods is to compare two closely related species that differ in their food use. This is especially powerful if we know that one of the two species has evolved to use a new food from within a group of species that share a common food source. Our study uses this approach to compare two species of fruit flies: <em>Drosophila suzukii</em> – a pest species that has evolved to feed on ripe fruit – and <em>Drosophila biarmipes</em> – a close relative that, like the other species in this group, feeds on rotting fruit.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9112" style="width: 2724px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9112" height="1939" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Biarmipes-mf-strawberry-by-David-Duneau.jpg" width="2714" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>Drosophila biarmipes</em> feeding on a strawberry.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">David Duneau</div></figure>
<p><em>Drosophila suzukii, </em>commonly known as the spotted wing <em>Drosophila</em>, has recently invaded both the United States and Europe. Its spread has devastated crops of soft skinned fruit, including cherries, strawberries and grapes, on both continents. This fly causes such damage by laying its eggs under the skin of these fruits, thanks to a serrated, enlarged ovipositor – the structure female flies use to insert their eggs into food. The larvae then grow inside the ripening fruit, eating the fruit and rendering it unsuitable for human consumption. Its sister species, <em>Drosophila</em> <em>biarmipes</em>, has a more modest ovipositor that cannot penetrate the skin of the fruit. This more modest ovipositor of <em>Drosophila biarmipes</em> is similar to many other <em>Drosophila </em>species, and is thought to restrict most <em>Drosophila </em>flies to a diet of rotting fruit.</p>
<p>Although <em>Drosophila suzukii’s</em> enlarged ovipositor has received considerable attention, this species would not be able to cause such extensive damage if the larvae were unable to use the ripe fruit to support their development. <em>Drosophila </em>larvae, in general, are mostly interested in eating the yeasts that grow on the fruit, as this is their main source of protein. Relative to rotting fruit, ripe fruit has significantly less yeast. Thus, the switch from rotting to ripe fruit represents a considerable nutritional challenge for larvae.</p>
<p>Given this, our study explored the differences in the nutritional requirements between the larvae of both species. We found that <em>Drosophila suzukii</em> larvae required less protein for their growth and survival than did their close relative, <em>Drosophila biarmipes</em>. This was reflected in their feeding patterns; <em>Drosophila biarmipes </em>larvae consumed more protein than <em>Drosophila suzukii. </em>Furthermore, when offered a choice between protein rich and protein poor diets, <em>Drosophila biarmipes</em> larvae showed a stronger preference for protein rich food than <em>Drosophila suzukii</em> larvae.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>The above video, taken by Cláudia Mendes, shows a Drosophila suzukii larvae being found inside a ripe cherry.</em></p>
<p>We next explored whether the adult females differed in their choice of where to lay their eggs. Unlike the larvae, adult females of the two species did not differ in their preference for egg laying. Rather, we found that females differed in their preference for the hardness of the egg laying substrate. While <em>Drosophila biarmipes </em>females laid eggs only in the softest food, <em>Drosophila suzukii</em> females showed no preference for substrate hardness. This demonstrates that while larvae use nutritional cues to determine their preferences of what to eat, adult females use cues related to the physical properties of the food to determine where to lay their eggs.</p>
<p>Our study illustrates how a simple shift in food use, from rotting to ripe fruit, involves adaptations of several traits across both larval and adult life stages. Importantly, they highlight how studying a single adaptation will provide a limited picture of how animals come to exploit new foods. Rather, studying the suite of traits involved in adapting to new foods will provide greater insights into how animals evolve new food preferences and how these traits potentiate the emergence of new pests.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Why do we sometimes stay friends with ex-partners? There may be many reasons, but according to a new <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916302690">paper</a> in <i>Personality and Individual Differences </i>they fall into seven main categories – and men and women don’t quite see eye-to-eye on them. The research also found that certain personality traits were related to motivations for staying friends after a break-up.</p>
<p><span id="more-24810"></span></p>
<p>Justin Mogilski and Lisa Welling at Oakland University, US, asked a group of 348 volunteers to think of as many reasons as possible for why two former partners might want to remain friends. This resulted in a 153-item list.</p>
<p>A second group of hundreds more people – all of whom who had gone through at least one break-up (and were overwhelmingly exclusively heterosexual) – rated the importance of each item on a scale of 1 – 5. Then they completed personality questionnaires, including one tapping features of pathological personality, such as the tendency to experience negative emotions, antagonism (aggression and grandiosity), and sensation-seeking.</p>
<p>From the ratings, Mogilski and Welling identified seven main categories of reason for wanting to stay friends with an ex:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability/sentimentality (e.g. “They made me a better person.”)</li>
<li>Pragmatism (e.g. “They had a lot of money.”)</li>
<li>Continued romantic attraction (e.g. “I still had feelings for them.”)</li>
<li>Children and shared resources (e.g. “Me or my ex was pregnant.”)</li>
<li>Diminished romantic attraction – which could cause a friendly relationship to lose its sexual aspect (e.g. “I lost sexual interest.”)</li>
<li>Social relationship maintenance (e.g. “To prevent awkwardness in our friend group.”)</li>
<li>Sexual access (e.g. “To keep having sex with them.”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, participants rated the reliability/sentimentality reasons as most important and practical reasons as least important.</p>
<p>There were some gender differences: men gave higher scores to practical and sexual access reasons than women did. Still, when certain aspects of personality (extraversion, honesty/humility and antagonism) were controlled for, the gender difference was only slight – in other words, men and women with similar personalities tended to give similar reasons. In particular, participants of both sexes who scored more highly on the trait of antagonism and/or on extraversion, gave higher ratings to practical reasons for maintaining a friendship. Extraversion in men and women was also associated with being motivated to maintain a friendship to continue sexual encounters.</p>
<p>Another link with personality was that people who experienced more negative emotions put a higher importance on reliability/sentimentality reasons, and continued romantic attraction. This could be because they suffer greater psychological distress during a break-up, and staying friends with an ex who can offer continued support and romantic interest may mitigate this, the researchers suggested.</p>
<p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407500173007">Other work</a> has found that friendships with former partners are common, and about half of divorced people report <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192513X05275435">continued contact</a> two and ten years after separating.</p>
<p>The new findings suggest that friendships after break-ups may provide an opportunity for ex-partners to continue to exchange desirable resources – such as love, status, information and money, Mogilski and Welling write in their paper.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations with the study, however. The mean age of the participants was 21.4 years in the first group and 21 in the second. Arguably, university students have only limited experience on which to base many of their judgements, and relatively few will have personal experience of reasons relating to pregnancy and children. Rather than seeking participants’ general attitudes to this issue, future work could also benefit from asking people about the motives behind specific post-relationship friendships they’ve experienced.</p>
