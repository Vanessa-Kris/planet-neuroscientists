<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/Open-Science_blog-image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892" rel="author" target="_blank">0000-0001-7318-5892</a></div><blockquote><p><strong>“Scientists can do much more with their own data if things are shared publicly and shared publicly quickly in order to have potential for real world impact.” -Trevor Bedford, lead of the Open Science Prize winning team.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Science Prize, a new initiative from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and the Wellcome Trust, encourages and supports open science approaches that generate benefit to society, advance research and spur innovation. An integral component of the selection process is demonstrated use and generation of <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2017/03/03/hooray-for-open-data-day/" target="_blank">open data</a></strong>, so PLOS is proud that this year’s winner of the <strong><a href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/" target="_blank">Open Science Prize</a></strong> is PLOS author and evolutionary, computational biologist <strong><a href="http://plos.io/TBedford" target="_blank">Trevor Bedford</a></strong> of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. <strong><a href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/res/p/finalists/" target="_blank">Finalists for the prize</a></strong> are also PLOS authors, including Michael Bamshed’s team, featured in a blog post for <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/02/optimism-on-rare-disease-day-with-research-possibilities-are-limitless/" target="_blank">Rare Disease Day</a>;</strong> <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146581" target="_blank">Aurel Lazar’s</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://plos.io/ASChiang" target="_blank">Ann-Shyn Chiang’s</a></strong> team, for the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001821" target="_blank">Ben Goldacre’s</a></strong> team, for OpenTrialsFDA.</p>
<p>These scientists and their teams are making sure that open content – from publications, datasets, code and other research outputs – are discovered, accessed and reused. Bedford and his team won the prize for development of nextstrain.org, a <strong><a href="http://www.nextstrain.org/" target="_blank">website</a></strong> that integrates shared, open sequence data from global research teams into a model for real-time tracking of virus evolution. This provides the larger community a powerful <strong><a href="http://www.nextstrain.org/zika?dmax=2016-10-12&amp;dmin=2013-09-14&amp;l=radial&amp;m=div&amp;r=country" target="_blank">graphic tool</a></strong> to facilitate pathogen surveillance and epidemiological investigations.</p>
<h3><strong>Open Data Tool Accelerates Policy and Research</strong></h3>
<p>In an interview discussing the value of open science approaches, Bedford spoke about open data, attribution, licensing and his experience in using preprints to support a publication strategy that releases data quickly while providing peer-reviewed citations for himself, his international collaborators and his postdocs and students.</p>
<p>One of the three final criteria in judging for the award is the level of demand and utility demonstrated by the proposed service or tool. This criterion worked in favor for nextstrain.org, as the team works with viral sequence data, made publicly available, to infer transmission patterns and evolutionary dynamics. Over the course of the last 15 years, according to Bedford, methods have gotten to a good place. Most recently, “fast genomic turnaround times means more actionable information is possible. This has created a powerful situation during outbreaks, where context is needed for robust conclusions, so investigators are willing to share data,” says Bedford. “We need to put datasets together for comprehensive inferences about what is going on,” he continues.</p>
<h4>In creating the nextstrain.org website, Bedford wanted to do something useful that wouldn’t be construed as scooping other people’s data for a publication. He sees the website as a good way to provide value to the community and work with other labs’ data, yet not be perceived as wanting to make a claim of ownership in the same way as a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/" target="_blank">preprint or published paper</a></strong> would. Those involved in the project are committed to use and reuse of properly attributed pre- and post-publication data that is out there and referenceable.</h4>
<p>What gives Bedford’s collaborators their intellectual property claim? “I admit this is a wild west at the moment for sequence data,” he says. Many researchers deposit sequences in GenBank before publication “but fear that it is not clear this is prepublication data,” he adds (GenBank doesn’t have these type of settings). Scientists also post data to lab websites or <strong><a href="https://github.com/nextstrain" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong> with caveats that the data is prepublication; his website uses all these sources. Sequences posted with GitHub are immediately incorporated with sources notified of data use.</p>
<p>When asked if everyone is a believer in open data and if there were instances when he encountered resistance or hesitancy to <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005278" target="_blank">share data</a></strong>, Bedford replied they use whatever people <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134826" target="_blank"><strong>want to share</strong></a>. He has noticed a positive trend in the sharing ethos, however. During the time of the Ebola outbreak there was a significant lag that by the time of Zika was less so. The <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/02/10/zika-emergency-puts-open-data-policies-to-the-test/" target="_blank">publisher agreement</a></strong>, signed by PLOS and others, to make data rapidly and openly available helped in this area, he believes. “The requirement for sequence data to be deposited in GenBank or otherwise made publicly available at the time of manuscript submission, not publication, contributes to research reproducibility,” says Bedford. PLOS, through its own <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/data-availability" target="_blank">sequence deposition policies</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/" target="_blank">partnerships for enhanced methods reporting</a></strong>, continually works to strengthen these issues.</p>
<p>For some, the Open Access, Open Science community needs to do a better job of showcasing the value of this more transparent and open way of doing science, from bench to publication and beyond. Thus far there has been positive engagement with the World Health Organization for influenza vaccine strain selection via the related tool, <strong><a href="http://nextflu.org/h3n2/3y/" target="_blank">nextflu.org</a></strong> (eventually slated to migrate to the nextstrain website).  Bedford envisions three audiences that would make practical use of his team’s open data tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those performing viral sequencing or using sequence data, as a useful platform to compare and share data</li>
<li>Those involved in outbreak responses, as a tool to understand data, transmission patterns and strain evolution</li>
<li>Researchers or others interested in characterization of mutants and the ability to look at historical mutations</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Publishing and License Choice</strong></h3>
<p>Bedford has an integrated publication strategy for his lab and work that best uses the various venues available. He publishes in a mix of Open Access and paywalled journals, creates webtools, deposits datasets and posts preprints. One strategy is to publish a statistical model or methods article, develop the model into a website or webtool and link to the website in published articles (rather than embedding JavaScript for the tool directly into the article).</p>
<h4>He likes the pattern of building an ecosystem around a work: post a preprint with links to published/released genomes, <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/27/105171.article-info" target="_blank">update the preprint</a></strong> with new data or analysis and then submit that paper for publication to a peer-reviewed journal. This allows his team to capture the whole chain of research and progress, establishing <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/03/113100.1" target="_blank">provenance of credit</a></strong> along the way. Concerns of datasets posted on GitHub or GenBank getting scooped are similar to the scooping concerns surrounding the preprint server conversation. Helping people understand they’re putting an intellectual claim on their data (or paper) with posting has ameliorated, but not eliminated, those concerns.</h4>
<p>Those using source code to develop tools for Open Science have several choices in licensing. For smaller projects, Bedford prefers the MIT license (also used for <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/02/a-year-of-open-for-discovery/" target="_blank">code developed at PLOS</a></strong> that is released as Open Source) which provides free and unlimited use and reuse rights, provided attribution is made clear. Other projects of his, including nextstrain.org, are released to the public under a GNU General Public License (GPL). This license provides that anyone using the source code to generate a derived product must, in turn, make that product open source. In other words, if a commercial entity adopts his open source code, that company must provide their code open source as well. The license status is essentially inherited and passed down to the next generation of product together with the code. One benefit of choosing the less restrictive MIT license, similar to CC BY for published articles, is maximum reuse without restriction.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all finalists of the Open Science Prize, sharing their work and data for the benefit of basic science, translational research and global public health.</p>

I enjoyed this fun forum organized by David Poeppel and Mike Gazzaniga. The format included three pairs of speakers on the topics of memory, language, and action/motor who “consider[ed] some major challenges and cutting-edge advances, from molecular mechanisms to decoding approaches to network computations.”<br /><br />Co-host Marcus Raichle recalled his inspiration for the symposium: a similar Big Ideas session at the Society for Neuroscience meeting. But human neuroscience was absent from all SFN Big Ideas, so Dr. Raichle contacted Dr. Gazzaniga, who “made it happen” (along with Dr. Poeppel). The popular event was standing room only, and many couldn't even get into the Bayview Room (which was too small a venue). More context:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“Recent discussions in the neurosciences have been relentlessly reductionist. The guiding principle of this symposium is that there is no privileged level of analysis that can yield special explanatory insight into the mind/brain on its own, so ideas and techniques across levels will be necessary.”</blockquote><br />The two hour symposium was a welcome addition to hundreds of posters and talks on highly specific empirical findings. Sometimes we must take a step back and look at the big picture. But since I'm The Neurocritic, I'll start out with some modest suggestions for next time.<br /><br /><ul><li>There was no time for questions or discussion.</li><li>There were too many talks.</li><li>It would be nice for all speakers to try to bridge different levels of analysis.</li><li>This is a small point, but ironically the first two speakers (Gallistel, Ryan) did not talk about human neuroscience.</li></ul><br />So my idea is to have four speakers on one topic (memory, let's say) with two at the level of Gallistel and Ryan<sup><b><span style="color: purple;">1</span></b></sup>, and two who approach human neuroscience using different techniques. Talks are strictly limited to 20 minutes. Then there is a 20 minute panel discussion where everyone tries to consider the implications of the other levels for their own work. Then (ideally) there is time for 20 minutes of questions from the audience. However, since I'm not an expert in organizing such events, allotting 20 minutes for the audience could be excessive.

But wrong. Oh so very wrong. Memory is <i>not</i> essentially molecular, we should <i>not</i> approach memory and the brain from a design perspective, and information storage need <i>not</i> mimic a computer. <br /><br /><ul><li>The brain does <b><i>not</i></b> use Shannon information.</li></ul>More precisely, “the kind of information the brain uses may be very different from Shannon information.” Why is that?

<p>Doctors who want to avoid accusations of hypocrisy should keep themselves in reasonable shape if they intend to advise their patients to do the same. Indeed, some medical organisations explicitly encourage their physicians not only to stay fit, but to make sure that their patients know it, thereby role-modelling the recommended behaviours. However, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-08697-001/">new research</a> published in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> shows that doctors who promote their own fitness may actually scare away overweight patients who are most in need of help.</p>
<p><span id="more-22554"></span></p>
<p>Researchers Lauren Howe and Benoît Monin lifted real-life MD profiles from the website of an American medical group, and sorted them into two types. Fitness-focused profiles explicitly stated that the doctor prioritised staying healthy and active, or cited two or more active hobbies like hiking and biking; meanwhile the other profiles didn’t emphasise fitness.</p>
<p>Howe and Monin recruited 143 people who had some concerns about their weight and a BMI over 25, the cutoff for being considered overweight. The participants viewed and then rated five fitness-focused doctor profiles and five comparison profiles. The participants expressed a greater suspicion that fitness-focused doctors would be judgmental towards patients with unhealthy habits, and they said they would be less willing to choose such a doctor as their own physician.</p>
<p>While it’s no good alienating prospective patients, nor would faking unhealthy habits be a good solution, so Howe and Monin looked at some other options. First, they looked at adding a caveat to the fitness-focused profiles, for example “I try to maintain a regular exercise routine” was followed by “(though it’s hard to find the time and energy)”. But although overweight participants found these profiles somewhat less judgmental, it didn’t change their reluctance to select them as a health provider. But a second tweak was more successful: extending the fit doctors’ profiles with a non-judgmental phrase like “everyone has their own definition of a healthy life and what it means to be healthy for them” made them the most preferred option.</p>
<p>Generally, are doctors feeling a pressure to promote themselves as healthy? Howe and Monin note that the profiles on the medical website they surveyed did show a tendency to talk up fitness: nearly a third of profiles of were fitness-focused, and only 2 out of nearly 100 mentioned any struggles with keeping healthy. In truth, the average doctor is more unhealthy than the US general population in a number of areas – exercise, weight and daily consumption of fruit and vegetables, with smoking being a notable exception. But you wouldn’t assume this based on how they present themselves, which may be why, in a survey ran by Howe and Monin, respondents assumed that doctors are healthier on every front. Perhaps physicians should prescribe themselves a healthy dose of honesty.</p>

In a thought-provoking new paper called What are neural correlates neural correlates of?, NYU sociologist Gabriel Abend argues that neuroscientists need to pay more attention to philosophy, social science, and the humanities.





Abend's main argument is that if we are to study the neural correlates or neural basis of a certain phenomenon, we must first define that phenomenon and know how to identify instances of it.

Sometimes, this identification is straightforward: in a study of brai

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/17/alzheimers-disease-now-you-see-it/">Alzheimer’s Disease – Now You See It</a></h4>

<p>The exact mechanisms underlying the devastation that is Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are not entirely understood, but researchers do know that inflammation in the brain is related to the onset of the disease. Now, through a basic eye exam, clinicians may be able to spot AD warning signs, including inflammation, long before symptoms appear</p>
<p>Normally, the brain depends on tau protein to receive nutrients and get rid of waste. When a toxic form of the tau protein clumps together, it forms tangles that are noxious to the brain. These toxic tau proteins may be at least partly responsible for the inflammation that is characteristic of AD, and inflammation may start before the tau tangles form. Now, researchers at the University of Texas speculate that this inflammation may be detectable by examining the retina during routine eye exams. This type of screening would be non-invasive and inexpensive and may eventually allow for early intervention to mitigate brain cell death and cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Authors of the current study, published in <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em>, examined brain analyses and retinal samples from human patients with AD, as well as a mouse model of AD. The findings suggest that toxic tau proteins induce inflammation that spreads throughout the brain, initiating the vicious cycle of cell death and more inflammation. Screening of the retina as part of a normal health check-up can detect inflamed tissue earlier in the disease process than other methods of AD screening.</p>
<p>AD has long been known to impact the visual system, and pathophysiological connections have been made between AD and visual disorders, such as certain types of cataract and glaucoma. The eye offers easy access to cerebral functioning, and ocular biomarkers for AD may potentially improve disease diagnosis and management.</p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia and its prevalence is growing as the world’s population ages. Patients with AD exhibit profound, progressive declines in cognition, memory, and social functioning. To date, there are no cures and available treatments are only marginally effective at managing some of the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>The new findings are far from offering cures or preventions for AD, but the authors hope that, eventually, early detection of inflammation will lead to therapeutic options for reducing inflammation and minimizing neurodegenerative brain damage.</p>

This year, the campaign focuses on <a href="http://www.earthday.org/earthday/global-environmental-climate-literacy-campaign/">Environmental and Climate Literacy</a>, with the aim of building a global understanding on climate change and the threat it poses to the planet.</p>
<p>One important aspect of climate change is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought">drought</a>. As the temperature of the earth continues to rise, some areas will see more rainfall, but others will see considerably less, causing drought conditions.  It has been estimated that, by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the areas in the world affected by drought will have doubled compared to today.</p>
<p>Plants are constantly being exposed to many kinds of environmental challenges, one of the main ones of course being drought. A lack of water can seriously affect a plants growth and development, a particularly important consideration for food crops as it is likely to have a detrimental effect on crop quality and eventual yield.</p>
<p>It is therefore vital to investigate how plants respond to drought conditions and look at ways to improve a plants tolerance to a shortage of water.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Plant Biology</em></a> receives an increasing number of articles that describe studies investigating plant tolerance in plants, and particularly plants that are important food crops. In order to celebrate Earth Day, I thought I would highlight two of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>How wild peaches cope with drought</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8797" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="Cultivated peaches are vulnerable to the effects of drought." class="size-medium wp-image-8797" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/peaches-1586955_1920-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Cultivated peaches are vulnerable to the effects of drought.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Pixabay</div></figure>
<p><em>Amygdalus Mira (Koehne) Yü et Lu</em> is a type of wild peach.  It is considered an ideal<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germplasm"> germplasm</a> (essentially, a supply of living plant tissue from which new plants can be grown)  for improving cultivated peach plants. Due to a lack of genetic variation, cultivated peach plants are vulnerable to environmental stresses, including drought. Cao <em>et al</em> recently <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1000-z">published the results</a> of a study looking into how wild peach respond to a shortage of water.  Wild peach plants were split into one of two groups; one group was then exposed to drought-like conditions for 16 days while the other group were watered well. Perhaps not surprisingly, the researchers observed that root length and water content were reduced for those plants that had been exposed to in drought-like conditions. They also found that relative conductivity, proline, malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels had increased, as had the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes. Furthermore, only proline levels returned to normal after the plants were re-watered after the 16 day period.  There were also changes in the expression of 95 different proteins in the drought-exposed wild peach plants when compared with well-watered plants, including those involved in cytoskeleton dynamics, carbohydrate, nitrogen and energy metabolism, transcription and translation, transport, stress and defence.  The researchers concluded that the interaction between enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, increased proline, malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels, increase in relative conductivity, and changes in the  levels of proteins expressed all help to make wild peach plants resistant to the effects of drought.</p>
<p><strong>How tomatoes cope with drought</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8798" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Chloroplasts may help tomatoes withstand the effects of drought" class="size-medium wp-image-8798" height="197" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/tomatoes-1280859_1280-300x197.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Chloroplasts may help tomatoes withstand the effects of drought.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Pixabay</div></figure>
<p>Tomatoes have another trick up their sleeve when it comes to surviving drought.  A <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0971-0">recent article</a> by Tamburino and colleagues looked at how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast">chloroplasts</a> present in tomatoes may have an important role in protecting these plants during times of water shortage, by investigating how three-week-old tomato (cv Crovarese) seedlings respond to a lack of water followed by its reintroduction (the “rewatering cycle”). Similar to the response of wild peach plants, the researchers found that a lack of water restricted the growth of the tomato plants and led to increased levels of proline, abscisic acid (ABA) and late embryogenesis abundant gene transcript. Again, very much like the wild peach plant, the expression of a number of proteins in the chloroplast protein repertoire were also affected by drought-like conditions. Once the rewatering cycle began, there was evidence of a general recovery of tomato plant function, but the chloroplast protein repertoire remained affected.  Changes in gene expression of some candidate genes and a rise in abscisic acid levels suggest that a specific chloroplast-to-nucleus (retrograde) signaling pathway becomes activated, leading ultimately to a stress response that help the tomato plant cope with drought conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Can research hold the answer to the problem of food shortages caused by drought?</strong></p>
<p>So, what conclusions, tentative or otherwise, can be made so far? Reports that climate change will result in an increase in world hunger over the next few decades highlights the importance of developing crops that can provide high yields even in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The research by Cao <em>et al</em> suggests that reintroducing some of the genetic variation present in wild peach plants to cultivated peach plants, may well also reintroduce some drought-resistant mechanisms to the crop, increasing the tolerance to drought and increasing the amount of fruit produced. And Tamburino <em>et al</em> conclude that ad hoc designed plant mutants could be used to further investigate the retrograde signalling pathway thought to be responsible for drought tolerance in Crovarese tomatoes.</p>
<p>Research into how to make food crops more drought resistant is undoubtedly a very active area of research and it is hoped that it will provide solutions to what could become a serious worldwide concern.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/pXbbTitbZZk/nature22057">Visualizing multistep elevator-like transitions of a nucleoside transporter</a></h4>

<p>
 Membrane transporters move substrates across the membrane by alternating access of their binding sites between the opposite sides of the membrane. An emerging model of this process is the elevator mechanism, in which a substrate-binding transport domain moves a large distance across the membrane. This mechanism has been characterized by a transition between two states, but the conformational path that leads to the transition is not yet known, largely because the available structural information has been limited to the two end states. Here we present crystal structures of the inward-facing, intermediate, and outward-facing states of a concentrative nucleoside transporter from Neisseria wadsworthii. Notably, we determined the structures of multiple intermediate conformations, in which the transport domain is captured halfway through its elevator motion. Our structures present a trajectory of the conformational transition in the elevator model, revealing multiple intermediate steps and state-dependent conformational changes within the transport domain that are associated with the elevator-like motion.

This draft introduces the cable equation, and how conduction velocity depends on axon diameter in unmyelinated and myelinated axons. There is also a short section on the extracellular potential. There are a few topics I want to add, including branching and determinants of conduction velocity (beyond diameter). There is also (almost) no figure at the moment. Finally, it is likely that the chapter is reorganized for clarity. I wanted to upload this chapter nonetheless so as to move on to the next chapter, on spike initiation with an initial segment.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>“The believer is not the one who eats when his neighbour beside him is hungry” said <a href="http://islam101.net/index.php/theology/prophet-muhammad-s-a-a-w/379-generosity-of-the-prophet">the founder of Islam</a>, but many unbelievers see this as the norm: that religious people rarely do the good demanded by their faith. Some evidence seems to support this cynicism. Surveys on tackling inequality and support for welfare often find that the religious <a href="http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-5052">show less enthusiasm</a> <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912909359404">for helping</a> the poorest in society. This would seem to reflect badly on the faithful, but <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/npe/9/3-4/182/">new research</a> in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics </i>involving Turkish Muslims offers some redemption. The findings suggest that the religious may be taking a pragmatic approach that expresses their compassion for the needy while remaining consistent with their beliefs about a just deity … and in fact, from a practical perspective, this approach may lead to surprisingly good outcomes.</p>
<p><span id="more-22529"></span></p>
<p>Ceyhun Elgin and colleagues from Boğaziçi University in Turkey, presented 550 students with a survey that asked them to tackle a resource-sharing problem. This involved a shipwreck where two parties, named Friday and Robinson, had become stranded on neighbouring islands: Island A and Island B, respectively. Each island had 12 fruit plants, and due to a quirk, each plant could only be tended (and consumed) by one person. For reasons unexplained, Robinson can only get 20 fruit from each plant (perhaps he’s a poor farmer), but he can visit both islands (maybe he’s a good swimmer or sailor). In contrast, Friday can harvest 120 fruit per plant, but he must remain on his island, Island A. The question is, what’s the fairest way to divide up ownership of the plants? Decide for yourself between the three options below.</p>

<p>These options actually represent three different political theories of distribution. The egalitarian Option Three pops out: it flattens out differences to produce equality for all. Elgin and his team measured (Islamic) religious belief in the participants and found that actually non-believers were much keener on this approach, with 38 per cent endorsing it compared to just a quarter of believers. This might seem to reinforce the idea that the religious disregard the plight of the needy. But if so, it would make sense for them to be especially drawn to utilitarian Option One, happy for inequality to thrive as long as the net total value is very high … but in fact there were no significant differences between groups in their preference for this option.</p>
<p>Instead, more than half of believers (55 per cent) settled in for Option Two, versus 43 per cent of non-believers. This distribution, called a Maximin split, aims to reduce inequality only insofar as it creates the best case for the worst off. Here, giving Robinson any more trees would make Friday the worst off – and actually worse off than Robinson is now, so going any further would be prohibited by the principle. The Maximin split is a desirable societal outcome articulated by liberal political philosopher <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">John Rawls</a>. But many on the left find Rawls infuriating because his philosophy shores up the classic liberal compromise: endorsing the variations in wealth we see in our current capitalist system as long as the system promises an efficient route to eliminating poverty. In other words, the position doesn’t support eliminating inequality altogether.</p>
<p>However, the Rawlian compromise seems to suit the religious pretty well. Eglin’s team speculate that as religious people have more faith in a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000727">just world</a>, believing in a fair deity that guides affairs, they are reluctant to hobble winners in the name of egalitarianism. Some support for this interpretation came from a followup survey where Robinson’s poor ability to tend fruit was revealed to be due to injury. Option One, which is toughest on Robinson, became much less attractive to non-believers, but believers stuck to their guns. Non-believers see a lack of blame, and are motivated to redress the situation, whereas the religious see fate in action, and are not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most religious participants still cared about the worst off. Suspicious of social engineering to correct the way of things, but mindful of the virtue of compassion, they find their preferences best expressed via the Maximin distribution. <i>A half-hearted fudge! </i>we could cry – <i>less compassionate than the non-believer.</i> But look closely at the table, and you can see that Maximin actually leaves the poorest individual, Robinson, better off than in Option Three. In this case, an ideological focus on equality obscures the best outcome for the needy. Assuming these findings generalise to other faiths and cultures, perhaps religious and unbelievers don’t differ in their compassion for others, but in their ideologies – a just world, or the necessity of equality – that can colour how they act when they encounter someone in need.</p>

<img alt="Pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/truke-img-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As scientific research becomes more reliant on published datasets and online resources, the effects of data corruption are a growing concern. This is particularly the case in the field of genomics where researchers often use online depositories and published supplements for their analyses.</p>
<p>Problems can occur when data is altered by formatting defaults in programs such as Microsoft Excel. This poses a problem to genomics researchers when gene names are converted to dates. For example, inputted gene names such as ‘SEPT2’ may be converted to 2016/09/02 when the program automatically formats this gene name to a date.</p>
<p>The huge scale of this problem was highlighted by <em>Ziemann et al</em> in an <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7"><span style="color: #0066cc;">article published</span></a> recently in <em><a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/">Genome Biology</a></em>. The researchers scanned leading genomics journals to find that one fifth of papers containing supplementary gene lists harboured these errors. Altered gene names were present in 987 supplementary files of 704 publications. Interestingly, it transpired that the journals with the highest impact factors were more likely to contain the corrupted data.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8832" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Pixabay" class="size-medium wp-image-8832" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/truke-img-1-300x169.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Finding this high rate of data corruption in published materials is disconcerting to the genomics community, who utilise these data sources heavily. This error can be difficult to reverse, and there have been few known solutions to remediate it.</p>
<p>In order to combat this troubling issue a team from Health Research Institute Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP) in Spain have developed a new software tool named <em>Truke</em>, to help retain the integrity of genomic data. The new software which is described in an article <a href="http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3631-8">recently published</a> in <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Genomics</em></a>, restores corrupted symbols to their original gene names, through methods such as library referencing and reverse engineering.</p>
<p>By sourcing data from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"><em>National Center for Biotechnology Information</em></a> (NCBI) database, a library of error prone gene symbols are collated, and their corresponding ‘dates’ predicted. When the user’s datasets are scanned by the system, the false dates are identified, and converted back to their original gene names. Safeguards are in place to avoid errors in the system. For example, in cases where a false date could correspond to more than one gene name, such as SEPT1 or SEPT-1, this discrepancy is flagged to the user for action.</p>
<p>The <em>Truke</em> web application was built using R, Shiny, HTML and bootstrap2 programming tools, and is freely available for use at <a href="http://maplab.cat/truke">http://maplab.cat/truke</a>.</p>
<p>As shown in this <a href="http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3631-8?utm_content=buffer6d452&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">article</a>, we are presented with a potential solution to a problem which can be commonly overlooked by both scientists and publishers. While more and more data is published each year, perhaps these threats to data integrity can be lessened with the help of software solutions.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to work in an environment focused on cooperation and solidarity, one that put the needs of the many above those of the few? Sounds great … but collectivism has some surprising downsides, especially if you’re a star performer. New <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-06323-001/">research</a> in the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i> looks at workplace reactions to high performers and their polarising effect on those around them, and shows that in more cooperative climates, hotshots are actually more likely to get a raw deal.</p>
<p><span id="more-22509"></span></p>
<p>Elizabeth Campbell and her colleagues surveyed 350 hair stylists, mainly women, working within a chain of Taiwanese salons. The researchers were interested in how the most successful stylists were treated by their peers: they identified hotshots by asking managers for performance ratings, and then they surveyed all the staff to find out the benefits and threats they saw in each other, and how much criticism and support they received. They also asked stylists about their salon’s working climate by asking them how much they agreed with statements like “there is a high level of cooperation between stylists”.</p>
<p>You can consider a fellow hotshot a benefit: an inspiration, a source of advice and expertise, and a way to attract prestige. Or you can see them as a threat; they’re likely to take the best duties and customers, and garner the greatest favour from leadership.</p>
<p>The researchers found that hotshots experienced more negative treatment in the form of belittling and criticism when they were surrounded by co-workers who felt threatened. In contrast, hotshots received more help and support if their colleagues saw them as a benefit. The typical high performer had a mixed bag: compared to the typical stylist, they were criticised more, but also received more support.</p>
<p>But that support was lacking within salons with more cooperative climates. This might seem puzzling until you understand a cooperative climate isn’t about sweetness and biscuits, but rather a culture where group solidarity is paramount. Under these conditions, a stand-out performer is simply a nail that needs to be hammered down, like the 1940s factories whose unionised workers gave a hard time to “rate-busters” whose performance made the rest look bad.</p>
<p>To investigate this systematically, the researchers ran an experiment with 284 US undergraduates, divided into collaborative teams who were told in an introduction either to approach their problem-solving tasks with a highly cooperative focus (e.g. interaction was described as a “collaborative discussion”, and rewards were split equally) or a with a more competitive focus (interaction would be “spirited debate”, and there were more individualised rewards, but still collaborating toward a common goal). Participants were then isolated in separate cubicles and after each round of problem-solving, they received information about the performance of each team-member and had the chance to exchange messages with each other (actually the information and messages were made up by the researchers, but the participants didn’t know this).</p>
<p>After a few rounds, participants were asked how they felt about some of the other specific team members, including those made to seem like hotshots. Participants who perceived a star performer as a threat tended to join in with backbiting when receiving bitchy chat-messages about the hotshot from another member, but crucially this only happened in the cooperative condition. In the low-cooperative one, there was no heightened denigration of hotshots. So whereas the earlier survey evidence suggested that helping of strong performers was impaired by a more cooperative culture, this experiment showed a cooperative culture was associated with more belittling of strong performers.</p>
<p>It’s notoriously hard for organisations to hang on to high performers who are often courted by rival organisations with better financial packages or positions. But money can’t buy working with people who really know, value and respect you. So overly solidarity-focused organisations – the kind that may resent their outstanding performers – risk eroding their edge in holding onto their talent. Maybe that’s just fine for some of the rank and file, but not for those who want their organisations to excel.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/sKzumA7mtXo/nature22058">High-avidity IgA protects the intestine by enchaining growing bacteria</a></h4>

<p>
 Vaccine-induced high-avidity IgA can protect against bacterial enteropathogens by directly neutralizing virulence factors or by poorly defined mechanisms that physically impede bacterial interactions with the gut tissues (‘immune exclusion’). IgA-mediated cross-linking clumps bacteria in the gut lumen and is critical for protection against infection by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). However, classical agglutination, which was thought to drive this process, is efficient only at high pathogen densities (≥108 non-motile bacteria per gram). In typical infections, much lower densities (100–107 colony-forming units per gram) of rapidly dividing bacteria are present in the gut lumen. Here we show that a different physical process drives formation of clumps in vivo: IgA-mediated cross-linking enchains daughter cells, preventing their separation after division, and clumping is therefore dependent on growth. Enchained growth is effective at all realistic pathogen densities, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Furthermore, IgA enchains plasmid-donor and -recipient clones into separate clumps, impeding conjugative plasmid transfer in vivo. Enchained growth is therefore a mechanism by which IgA can disarm and clear potentially invasive species from the intestinal lumen without requiring high pathogen densities, inflammation or bacterial killing. Furthermore, our results reveal an untapped potential for oral vaccines in combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

<p>
 The Rad51 (also known as RecA) family of recombinases executes the critical step in homologous recombination: the search for homologous DNA to serve as a template during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although budding yeast Rad51 has been extensively characterized in vitro, the stringency of its search and sensitivity to mismatched sequences in vivo remain poorly defined. Here, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analysed Rad51-dependent break-induced replication in which the invading DSB end and its donor template share a 108-base-pair homology region and the donor carries different densities of single-base-pair mismatches. With every eighth base pair mismatched, repair was about 14% of that of completely homologous sequences. With every sixth base pair mismatched, repair was still more than 5%. Thus, completing break-induced replication in vivo overcomes the apparent requirement for at least 6–8 consecutive paired bases that has been inferred from in vitro studies. When recombination occurs without a protruding nonhomologous 3′ tail, the mismatch repair protein Msh2 does not discourage homeologous recombination. However, when the DSB end contains a 3′ protruding nonhomologous tail, Msh2 promotes the rejection of mismatched substrates. Mismatch correction of strand invasion heteroduplex DNA is strongly polar, favouring correction close to the DSB end. Nearly all mismatch correction depends on the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase-δ, although the repair proteins Msh2, Mlh1 and Exo1 influence the extent of correction.

<p>
 There are no disease-modifying treatments for adult human neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test RNA-targeted therapies in two mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease. Both models recreate the progressive adult-onset dysfunction and degeneration of a neuronal network that are seen in patients, including decreased firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a decline in motor function. We developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 gene by screening 152 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The most promising oligonucleotide, ASO7, downregulated ATXN2 mRNA and protein, which resulted in delayed onset of the SCA2 phenotype. After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection to ATXN2-Q127 mice, ASO7 localized to Purkinje cells, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 expression below 75% for more than 10 weeks without microglial activation, and reduced the levels of cerebellar ATXN2. Treatment of symptomatic mice with ASO7 improved motor function compared to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the BAC-Q72 SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized protein levels of several SCA2-related proteins expressed in Purkinje cells, including Rgs8, Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76 and Fam107b. Notably, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells returned to normal even when treatment was initiated more than 12 weeks after the onset of the motor phenotype in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings support ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human neurodegenerative diseases.

<p>
 The 2013–2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5% of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic ‘gravity’ model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.

<p>
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis and death 2–5 years after disease onset. Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords, and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS. There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases. Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression. However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2–5% of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions. Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies, and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS. We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS, targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy.

<p>The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established, but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies or are known from poorly preserved or incomplete material. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the bird–crocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22037">doi: 10.1038/nature22037</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/wNGe1vrWbc0" width="1" />

<p>
 A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome. Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such ‘human knockouts’ can provide insight into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare (&lt;1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3 has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3 homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations provide a roadmap for a ‘human knockout project’, a systematic effort to understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans.

<p>
 In vertebrates, skin colour patterns emerge from nonlinear dynamical microscopic systems of cell interactions. Here we show that in ocellated lizards a quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton (a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges from a continuous Turing reaction–diffusion system. Skin thickness variation generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying reaction–diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/FMCLBNGKrVo/nature21718">Topological defects in epithelia govern cell death and extrusion</a></h4>

<p>Epithelial tissues (epithelia) remove excess cells through extrusion, preventing the accumulation of unnecessary or pathological cells. The extrusion process can be triggered by apoptotic signalling, oncogenic transformation and overcrowding of cells. Despite the important linkage of cell extrusion to developmental, homeostatic and pathological processes such as cancer metastasis, its underlying mechanism and connections to the intrinsic mechanics of the epithelium are largely unexplored. We approach this problem by modelling the epithelium as an active nematic liquid crystal (that has a long range directional order), and comparing numerical simulations to strain rate and stress measurements within monolayers of MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells. Here we show that apoptotic cell extrusion is provoked by singularities in cell alignments in the form of comet-shaped topological defects. We find a universal correlation between extrusion sites and positions of nematic defects in the cell orientation field in different epithelium types. The results confirm the active nematic nature of epithelia, and demonstrate that defect-induced isotropic stresses are the primary precursors of mechanotransductive responses in cells, including YAP (Yes-associated protein) transcription factor activity, caspase-3-mediated cell death, and extrusions. Importantly, the defect-driven extrusion mechanism depends on intercellular junctions, because the weakening of cell–cell interactions in an α-catenin knockdown monolayer reduces the defect size and increases both the number of defects and extrusion rates, as is also predicted by our model. We further demonstrate the ability to control extrusion hotspots by geometrically inducing defects through microcontact printing of patterned monolayers. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for apoptotic cell extrusion: spontaneously formed topological defects in epithelia govern cell fate. This will be important in predicting extrusion hotspots and dynamics in vivo, with potential applications to tissue regeneration and the suppression of metastasis. Moreover, we anticipate that the analogy between the epithelium and active nematic liquid crystals will trigger further investigations of the link between cellular processes and the material properties of epithelia.</p><p>Nature 544 212 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21718">doi: 10.1038/nature21718</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/FMCLBNGKrVo" width="1" />

<em>For put them side by side—</em><br />
<em>The one the other will contain”</em><br />
<em>            —Emily Dickinson</em></p>
<p>During human evolution, our cerebral cortex increased in size in response to new environmental challenges. The cerebral cortex is the site of diverse processes, including visual perception and language acquisition. However, no accepted unitary theory of cortical function exists yet. One hypothesis is that there is an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit that implements a simple and flexible computation. This idea is known as the “canonical circuit.”  As Gary Marcus, Adam Marblestone, and Thomas Dean note in a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/346/6209/551.full.pdf">perspective piece in Science</a>, there is still no consensus about whether such a canonical circuit exists nearly four decades later. Researchers argue that there is little evidence that such a uniform structure can capture the diversity of cortical function in simple mammals.</p>
<p>What would it mean for the cortex to be diverse rather than uniform? Marcus and his colleagues propose that the brain may consist of an array of elementary computational units, which act in parallel as a microprocessor<sup>1</sup>. To probe at questions on cortical circuitry, collaborative endeavors engaging scientists and engineers have emerged. In parallel with the <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu">Human Brain Project</a> in Europe, the <a href="https://www.braininitiative.nih.gov">Brain Research through Advancing Imaging Neurotechnologies</a> Initiative is developing tools to view the brain at superior spatial and temporal resolution<sup>2</sup>. Researchers aim to directly study the relationship of a neuron’s function to its connections. This can be accomplished by mapping neuronal connections in conjunction with acquiring functional activity data.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up </strong></p>
<p>Researchers can scale up from the study of neurons and synapses to those of neural circuits and networks. However, this bottom-up approach may not be the best way to understand the neural basis of human cognition. Psychologist <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aai/2010/918062/#B14">Frank van der Welde</a> argues that this confuses the nature of understanding with the way to achieve understanding<sup>4</sup>. He provides an analogy to physics. To understand the universe, a bottom-up approach would begin with an understanding of elementary particles, how these particles combine to make atoms, and how atoms to combine to make molecules. However, physics did not begin with the study of elementary particles. It began with a study of the solar system, which provided the first law of motion. In summary, understanding can proceed from top to bottom as well as bottom to top.</p>
<p>To understand human cognition, neuroscientists should combine top-down and bottom-up approaches. One top-down approach is generating a large-scale simulation of neural processes that generate intelligence. This project intersects neuroscience and artificial intelligence. For instance, a research team at IBM represented 8 x 10<sup>6</sup> neurons and 6400 synapses per neuron on the IBM Blue Gene Processor, and ran 1 s of model time in 10 s of real time<sup>5</sup>. Large-scale simulations provide a tool to investigate the brain not limited by the experimental and ethical limitations of <em>in vivo </em>work. Through such virtual models alongside neuroscience studies, researchers may arrive at the neural basis of intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>As neuroscience details the anatomy and activity of the brain, artificial intelligence seeks to develop an independent, non-biological path to intelligence. Researchers of both fields can agree that artificial intelligence is not the equal of natural intelligence in most important tasks for human cognition such as vision, motor manipulations, and natural language understanding. However, this is not to say that artificial intelligence won’t ultimately achieve principles of natural intelligence. I met with <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, a professor of computer science at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu">New York University</a>, to learn more about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Advances in artificial intelligence have been incredible, from IBM Watson to Google DeepMind AlphaGo. Davis believes that AI will continue to advance and be used for positive and negative applications. For instance, AI can be used for improving <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md">the quality of medicine</a> and building <a href="https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/">self-driving cars</a>. “The impact of that will be largely positive though there will be a negative impact on employment. It will also be used for military purposes, and the immediate effects of that are mostly negative,” Davis says. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence is far from building programs that retain human-level intelligence. The human brain has an unsurpassed ability to do complex, real-time interactions in a dynamic world.</p>
<p>To implement reasoning in artificial intelligence, Davis explains different techniques available by example. For instance, chess-playing program Deep Blue did reasoning by thinking through a large number of paths to the future and determining what solution works out. A second example is software verification programs. These algorithms search for bugs in programs through logical reasoning. The program provides users with a formal proof that a program doesn’t have a certain kind of bug. A third example is taxonomic reasoning, which is a simple form of logical reasoning by category. This type of reasoning has been done in programs called semantic nets, which have been in use for 50 years.</p>

<p><strong>A New Century of the Brain</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.paulallen.com">Paul Allen</a>, the co-founder of Microsoft, has funded two distinct research projects in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/09/30/brain/?utm_term=.eb1f3ef1b622">The Washington Post</a> aptly describes it as Allen’s $500 million quest to dissect the mind and code a new one from scratch. Elon Musk has funded a rival company called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/27/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-cranial-computing/">NeuroLink</a> to create human-computer hybrids. To build an artificial brain, Davis believes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The replica of the human brain can mean either the ability to do human-level tasks, which I think in principle is possible, or algorithms that are an imitation of the brain. We don’t yet know which direction is the best way to pursue AI. There’s an awful lot we don’t understand about the brain so it may be pre-mature to try the latter. </em></p>
<p>            Neuroscience and artificial intelligence both aim to identify architectures of intelligence and cognition. <a href="https://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/gazzaniga">Michael Gazzaniga</a> states that cognitive neuroscience asks: what are the algorithms that drive structural neural elements into the physiological activity that results in perception, cognition, and consciousness? Likewise, artificial intelligence asks: what are the algorithms that can generate human-like intelligence in machines to perform reasoning, planning, and learning? Both fields describe mechanisms of intelligence as “algorithms.”<sup>4</sup> To uncover human intelligence and cognition, intersections in neuroscience and artificial intelligence are necessary. Perhaps only then can we can understand what makes us human.</p>
