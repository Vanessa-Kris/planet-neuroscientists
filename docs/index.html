                <p>I recently read Philip Goff’s book, “Galileo’s error”, where he advocates for the panpsychist view that consciousness is a widespread element of reality, so that atoms are very slightly conscious (note that we should talk of panpsychism<em>s</em> as there are certainly variations on this theme). The book is well written and does a good job at explaining the issues with the different brands of materialism and dualism. It also pushed me to refine some concepts and revisit some issues, which is good.</p>
<p>However, I was not convinced by his proposal. To me, it seems that it boils down to another “what else?” argument: materialism is flawed, dualism is false, therefore panpsychism is true. This cannot be a reasonable response to the fallacious “what else?” argument of materialists: if you are not a materialist, then you are a dualist.</p>
<p>The argument in a few words (certainly a bit caricatured) is that consciousness cannot be reduced to the physical properties of matter, and therefore it must be an additional fundamental property of matter, in some way what atoms are “made of”. Then comes the so-called “combination problem”, which is to understand how atoms get together to form a single conscious entity, a problem that Goff admits is unsolved. This is a strikingly reductionist account of consciousness: if we are conscious, it must be because parts of us are conscious.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are different panpsychisms. Integrated Information Theory (IIT), for example, considers consciousness as a property of certain kinds of systems, not a property of atoms. What they have in common, however, is that they postulate consciousness beyond life (of course, some materialist accounts also do). Towards the end of the book, Goff speculates on the ethical issues raised by the possibility that plants might be conscious, and so is it ok to have a vegan diet? But on his account, atoms are also conscious so maybe nuclear fission makes atoms suffer? Maybe nuclear fusion feels like love to atoms and the sun is a sort of gigantic hippie paradise? Who knows.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem I see with the argumentation is that “being conscious” is used as a sort of empty placeholder. The theory is meant to explain subjective perspective, but never asks what a subject might be. Free will is presented as one of the difficult things to explain, but the proposal offers no account of agency. And if atoms are conscious, do they have emotions? But what is an emotion? It seems to me that a theory of consciousness should try to address at least some basic aspects of the phenomenon to explain, beyond the mere fact that it exists.</p>
<p>These questions about subjects and agency are addressed in particular in some corners of theoretical biology, which try to develop the concept of a living organism. Typically, theories of life describe a living organism as a set of processes whose operation ensures their own continued existence; some form of organizational closure that resists entropic decay (see e.g. Varela &amp; Maturana; Kauffman; Rosen; more recently Moreno, Mossio, Montevil, to name a few). The concept of organism is what allows developing derived concepts such as agency, autonomy, but also some aspects of perception and emotion (namely the valence of emotion).</p>
<p>Goff proposes that free will is not action free from determinism, but action that has reasons. But reasons imply goals, and goals imply autonomous agents, concepts that panpsychism, whether Goff’s or IIT’s version, offers no account of. No amount of integrated information (“Phi”) provides any goal to the system, and so this theoretical construct cannot account for either free will or emotion.</p>
<p>I will now discuss a few more specific points made in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The hard problem is harder than you might think</strong></p>
<p>Everything starts with the “hard problem” of consciousness, a problem that has been discussed by many thinkers, the most well-known arguments being probably those of Chalmers and Nagel. Basically, the problem is that experience is not something that can be derived <em>deductively</em> from the properties of matter. There is no logical reasoning that would start with a mechanistic description of a material system, and that would end up with “therefore, this system feels pain”. Of course, there could be a “therefore” that means: whenever a material system has some property P, it feels pain, but this would be an empirical relation (e.g. the “neural correlates of consciousness”), not a logical relation. Basically, you cannot deduce pain from Newton laws.</p>
<p>In the book, the author takes it as a flaw of reductive materialism, the idea that consciousness is a state of matter. It certainly is a flaw of materialism, but it is much worse than that.</p>
<p>In his famous paper (What is it like to be a bat?), Nagel hits the more general problem: experience is something that you live, not something that you describe. Of course, you could try to describe an experience, but understanding the words is not the same thing as having the experience. Philosophers like to speak of the redness of red, but I find this a rather poor choice. Everyone (with some exceptions) has the feeling of red whenever something with the right spectral properties is presented, so it is easy to conflate objective properties of objects with subjective experience.</p>
<p>But consider taste, for example. Taste is interesting because not everyone has the same tastes, meaning that people can have different experiences for the same stuff, and taste can change over time. There is no need to try to imagine the ultrasonic world of bats. Consider for example coriander. Many people hate coriander, and this has been linked to some genetic variant in olfactory receptor genes. Now try to describe the taste of coriander to someone who does not like it. I personally would have no idea where to start; someone might find words to describe it, but we can be sure that the person would be essentially clueless about how it might taste. One might say that the taste of coriander is the taste caused by the activation of the corresponding olfactory receptor; one might describe the odorant molecules, and so on: none of that conveys the taste. There is just no alternative to actually experiencing an experience.</p>
<p>So the problem is much deeper than a flaw of materialism: the problem is that experience is not something that can be explained, whatever the number of words, it is something that is lived. Postulating the existence of an extra non-physical law, which says for example that the universe is made of consciousness, or that certain systems are conscious, will not solve this problem. We might want to postulate the existence of coriander taste as an extra law of nature, it would still not explain what it feels like to taste coriander. Thus, if panpsychism pretends to explain the quality of experience, then it commits the exact same error as reductive materialism. This should make us highly skeptical of claims such as “the quality of experience is specified by the informational relationships [the complex] generates” (Balduzzi &amp; Tononi, 2009) - all the more that it reduces experience to its epistemic value while neglecting the hedonic value (see below).</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that nothing interesting can be said <em>about</em> experience, including its relation with matter. But panpsychism is not at all necessary for that. For example, sensorimotor theories of perception have something to say about the structure of experience, for example about the spatialization of pain (see <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/spatial-perception/spatial-perception-of-pain/">my short series on that</a>). Thus, panpsychism does not solve the hard problem. It does not dissolve it either: the problem still exists even if you consider that materialism is flawed, because it is not an issue with materialist explanations but with explanations in general.</p>
<p>Before I move on to the next topic, I would like to point out that there are certain ways to communicate experiences, but those are not descriptive. More accurately, there are ways to <em>induce</em> experiences in people. These are art, poetry, or guided meditation. A musical experience is not the end point of a logical reasoning. Guided meditation practices, or poetry, use words to put you into certain states of mind, but the words are only there to guide you (“imagine you are a mountain”), they do not constitute the experience.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The case against dualism</strong></p>
<p>In his book, Goff also rejects dualism, but I found the argument rather peculiar. He claims that the main objection against dualism is empirical: we understand a lot about how the brain works, so surely we would have noticed if there were an intervention by some kind of mental entity - some scientific law would be broken, basically. This is a peculiar argument because virtually all scientific findings in neuroscience are of a statistical nature, so there is no way we would notice an intervention rather than categorize it as a random event. Our understanding of the brain is not that extensive.</p>
<p>But we can take the argument as a thought experiment. Suppose we have perfect understanding of the physical working of the brain, so we could for example predict the evolution of brain states from the current state. We could know before the subject herself what she is going to talk about, or the voluntary movements she is going to make. In other words, we would know perfectly how the “philosophical zombie” works. This knowledge is precisely the premises of the hard problem: we have a perfect mechanistic understanding of physiology and behavior, but none of this understanding implies that the person is conscious, or explains the taste of coriander.</p>
<p>If it is the case that we can have this kind of understanding (even as a theoretical possibility), then indeed dualism is false, at least the kind of dualism that supposedly explains free will and agency (as Penfield or Eccles thought).</p>
<p>But it also implies that there cannot be any <em>empirical</em> support for any panpsychist theory, since all the empirical data are already supposedly accounted for by a physicalist account. Therefore, I find it odd that Goff supports the empirical argument against dualism and at the same time claims that there is empirical support for IIT. By his own argument, that cannot be the case. If we have a physicalist account of whatever a person might say or do in different circumstances, then this will include any kind of empirical evidence that we might think of. All the empirical evidence would already be accounted for, and therefore could not count as evidence for the panpsychist theory.</p>
<p>To claim otherwise is to believe that consciousness is required to do certain things, such as speaking of what one sees. But this is contradictory with the claim that a physicalist framework can explain behavior but not consciousness. This is to give a causal role to consciousness, above the causal role of physical processes, and that is precisely Goff’s objection against dualism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The epistemic and the hedonic</strong></p>
<p>To end these notes, I would like to come back to the remark I made at the beginning, that a theory of consciousness should try to address at least some basic aspects of the phenomenon to explain, and not just acknowledge that it exists.</p>
<p>Ned Block pointed out that there are two aspects of consciousness that need to be accounted for: access consciousness, i.e. its functional aspects, and phenomenal consciousness or “what it is like”, the latter being notoriously more complicated than the former.</p>
<p>I would like to rephrase it as follows. Experience typically comes in at least two dimensions, an epistemic and a hedonic dimension. For example, consider toothache. That experience is informative: it aches somewhere, and perhaps you notice that it aches when you drink something cold and so on. But pain is not just information: it is also something you would like to get rid of. It has a hedonic value, namely a bad one.</p>
<p>Both IIT and global workspace theory focus on the epistemic aspect, but fail to account for the hedonic aspect (for the epistemic aspect as well, but at least they try). This might come from the failure to include life into the picture. For a living organism, there is some sense in saying that an event or an act is good or bad for the organism, according to whether it helps or threatens the organism’s self-maintenance. In contrast, there is no sense in saying that some event is good or bad for a photodiode. The photodiode has been built by some (other) conscious entity to perform a certain function, and so only that external entity can assess whether some transformation of the system is good or bad, according to whether it continues to perform the ascribed function.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this explains why an organism <em>feels</em> bad, rather than just acts accordingly, but it is certainly an aspect of the phenomenon that things that are bad for the organism also tend to <em>feel</em> bad. Without an organism, some autonomous entity for which “bad” can mean something, it seems difficult to theorize about the hedonic aspect of experience. This makes me skeptical of claims that entities that are not living organisms (atoms, photodiodes and so on) are conscious.</p>

                <p><em>Ahead of the publication of </em>PLOS Climate<em>&rsquo;s first articles, Editor-in-Chief Emma Archer answers a selection of questions submitted by you.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Tell us about your research. What are you working on at the moment?</strong></em></p>



<p>I am currently working at my main field site, the semi-arid Karoo in South Africa, understanding both how climate has changed in the past, and how it might change in the future. What are the implications for land management in this area, including the range of practices from commercial livestock through to private and state conserved areas, which are themselves dynamic and changing? How do we ensure more sustainable, resilient and equitable futures in these precious landscapes?</p>



<p><em><strong>What do you make of COP26 and its outcomes?</strong></em></p>



<p>I try to achieve a balance between disappointment (so much more could have been done); and optimism at some of the more positive outcomes. For example, this was really the first time the role of nature and nature&rsquo;s contributions to people was taken into account at the climate negotiations. Those of us working at the biodiversity-climate interface are encouraged that we can work together increasingly in the future to achieve positive synergies.</p>



<p><strong><em>What are the top priorities for climate research in South Africa?</em> [where Emma is based]</strong></p>



<p>We continue to work hard to balance excellent climate research with the key task of communicating the findings for decision-makers in a way that supports, rather than hinders, their use.&nbsp; I think we are improving all the time in balancing these tasks, but still have so much to do.</p>



<p><em><strong>What excites you most about </strong></em><strong>PLOS Climate</strong><em><strong>&rsquo;s mission?</strong></em></p>



<p>I am very excited to have the opportunity to support the diversification of voices in published climate expertise, as well as providing a platform for updated climate research to hopefully add to the basis of critical decision-making. This is a particularly critical year in which to be launching the journal; and we feel so privileged to be able to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>How do you see climate science evolving in 2022 and beyond?</strong></em></p>



<p>I hope that climate science will expand and diversify, with better representation in excellent climate science from previously underrepresented groups and geographic regions.</p>



<p><em><strong>Why does Open Science matter? How does it relate to the climate crisis?</strong></em></p>



<p>The climate crisis can only be addressed with the best possible up-to-date scientific evidence base being accessible to decision-makers. Open Science is absolutely essential in this regard (and not just in the field of climate change, of course).&nbsp; I see this as part of the essential task in the climate crisis &ndash; taking science out of the lab (as a turn of phrase) and to the decision-makers.</p>



<p><em><strong>What is it like to work with the journal&rsquo;s editorial board?</strong></em></p>



<p>It has been such a privilege to work with this team. The energy and enthusiasm has been great, and we have noticed a real passion amongst editorial board members for <em>PLOS Climate</em>&rsquo;s mission and journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>What kind of research is </strong></em><strong>PLOS Climate </strong><em><strong>especially interested in</strong></em>?</p>



<p>Research right across our theme and specialty groups, including inter and multi-disciplinary work! We have been delighted at the pipeline of papers so far, and are very keen to see those submitted in 2022, including research papers, reviews, opinions pieces and some very exciting paper collections on key topics.&nbsp;</p>

The findings suggest humans socialize in ways that could be used to pick them out of datasets that are supposedly anonymized.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that people tend to remain within established social circles and that these regular interactions form a stable pattern over time, says Jaideep Srivastava, a computer scientist from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who was not involved in the study. “But the fact that you can use that pattern to identify the individual, that part is surprising.”</p>



<p>According to the European Union’s <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>, companies that collect information about people’s daily interactions can share or sell this data without users’ consent. The catch is that the data must be anonymized. Some organizations might assume that they can meet this standard by giving users pseudonyms, says Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a computational privacy researcher at Imperial College London. “Our results are showing that this is not true.”</p>





<p>de Montjoye and his colleagues hypothesized that people’s social behavior could be used to pick them out of datasets containing information on anonymous users’ interactions. To test their hypothesis, the researchers taught an artificial neural network — an AI that simulates the neural circuitry of a biological brain — to recognize patterns in users’ weekly social interactions.</p>



<p>For one test, the researchers trained the neural network with data from an unidentified mobile phone service that detailed 43,606 subscribers’ interactions over 14 weeks. This data included each interaction’s date, time, duration, type (call or text), the pseudonyms of the involved parties and who initiated the communication.</p>



<p>Each user’s interaction data were organized into web-shaped data structures consisting of nodes representing the user and their contacts. Strings threaded with interaction data connected the nodes. The AI was shown the interaction web of a known person and then set loose to search the anonymized data for the web that bore the closest resemblance.</p>



<p>The neural network linked just 14.7 percent of individuals to their anonymized selves when it was shown interaction webs containing information about a target’s phone interactions that occurred one week after the latest records in the anonymous dataset. But it identified 52.4 percent of people when given not just information about the target’s interactions but also those of their contacts. When the researchers provided the AI with the target and contacts’ interaction data collected 20 weeks after the anonymous dataset, the AI still correctly identified users 24.3 percent of the time, suggesting social behavior remains identifiable for long periods of time.</p>



<p>To see whether the AI could profile social behavior elsewhere, the researchers tested it on a dataset consisting of four weeks of close-proximity data from the mobile phones of 587 anonymous university students, collected by researchers in Copenhagen. This included interaction data consisting of students’ pseudonyms, encounter times and the strength of the received signal, which was indicative of proximity to other students. These metrics are often collected by COVID-19 contact tracing applications. Given a target and their contacts’ interaction data, the AI correctly identified students in the dataset 26.4 percent of the time.</p>



<p>The findings, the researchers note, probably don’t apply to the contact tracing protocols of Google and Apple’s Exposure Notification system, which protects users’ privacy by encrypting all Bluetooth metadata and banning the collection of location data.</p>



<p>de Montjoye says he hopes the research will help policy makers improve strategies to protect users’ identities. Data protection laws allow the sharing of anonymized data to support useful research, he says. “However, what’s essential for this to work is to make sure anonymization actually protects the privacy of individuals.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/acknowledging-reviewers/">Authors aren’t the only ones: Acknowledging peer reviewers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a> </p>



<p>In this third and final entry in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=academic-contributions">three-part series</a> on academic credit, we turn our attention to peer review. Reviewership, like editorship, tends to be considered standard, part of life as a research scientist. But while editors enjoy the benefits of appearing on the journal masthead (and at PLOS, on each published article they handle), reviewers remain indistinct, and too often, unacknowledged.</p>



<h2>Recognizing the contributions of peer reviewers</h2>



<p>Not all scientific contributions are equally evident&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t important. Rigorous peer review is essential to publishing trusted, validated research articles. Serving as a peer reviewer is not only critical to maintaining the integrity of the scientific record, it is an important aspect of a research career, and a stepping stone to more prestigious editorial board roles. Indeed, a demonstrated history of peer review is often a component of tenure applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In keeping with the importance of peer review, the process is neither simple nor easy. Conducting a review involves reading a research manuscript (typically more than once) and assessing it with a critical yet constructive eye. In evaluating a manuscript, a reviewer applies knowledge and expertise gleaned through years of study, broad reading in the field, and hands-on research experience. The end product is an intelligent summary of the manuscript, the reviewer&rsquo;s impressions, and a succinct set of recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p id="survey">We believe that peer review is both essential to communicating scholarly research, and a scholarly endeavor in its own right. However, researchers receive little acknowledgement for their work as reviewers (beyond the grateful thanks of authors and journal staff), and few reliable records of reviewer contributions exist.</p>

<h2>Solution: Credit beyond authorship</h2>



<p>Peer review is so central to the research enterprise, and the knowledge contained within each review is so dense, and so valuable, that, we believe, peer review should be recognized as an academic contribution in its own right. Making peer review reports more transparent simultaneously illustrates the value of the reviewers&rsquo; contributions and underscores the quality of the final published research article. In this way, opening referee reports is a first step toward peer review taking its rightful place as a scholarly output.</p>



<p>For that reason, PLOS has implemented options for researchers to bring peer review into the open, and for reviewers to claim credit for their work, even when their identity remains anonymous.</p>



<p>PLOS offers reviewers the opportunity to sign their peer reviews, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">since 2019</a>, authors have had the option to publish decision letters, including peer reviews, alongside their final research article. This gives reviewers the opportunity to claim credit and showcase their work publicly in cases where they feel comfortable doing so.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, our partnerships with <a href="https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/">ORCID </a>and <a href="https://publons.com/publisher/60/public-library-of-science">Publons</a> allow researchers to automatically track and receive credit for their reviews without revealing their names, and regardless of the authors&rsquo; decision to publish the review.</p>



<h2>Reflecting on credit for everyone</h2>



<p>From the outside, focusing on credit may seem peripheral to the larger endeavor of scientific exploration. But in the sciences, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/credit/">credit opens pathways</a> for researchers to keep exploring. Transparently, accurately, and fairly capturing researcher contributions can be used to inform professional development, foster inclusion and equity, limit misconduct, improve the robustness of research, and ultimately, to increase trust in all the different types of work that researchers do.</p>

                <p>For many of us, it’s the height of winter, with harsh weather and the pandemic keeping us inside. If you’re looking for a new way to pass the time, why not help science?</p>



<p>Researchers from a range of disciplines rely on the power of crowdsourcing to collect and analyze data. From transcribing weather logs dating back to the Victorian era to classifying African animals caught by camera traps, here are just a few ways to put your free time to good use.</p>



<h4>Solar Jet Hunter</h4>



<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Build a database of solar jets</p>





<p><strong>HOW TO HELP:</strong> NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, has been monitoring the sun’s activity for more than a decade. Studying <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">the sun’s outbursts</a>, including the narrow jets of plasma that erupt from the surface, will help scientists better understand space weather and crack solar mysteries (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>). But first, researchers need to find those jets. That’s where you and other armchair astronomers come in. Just go online, review sequences of SDO images, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sophiemu/solar-jet-hunter">determine if solar jets are visible and document details about the events</a>. In addition to helping scientists study the sun, the dataset could help create a computer program that could speed up future solar jet identifications.</p>



<h4>Weather Rescue At Sea</h4>



<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Extend the climate record further back in time</p>



<p><strong>HOW TO HELP:</strong> To put today’s climate change into perspective, scientists need a long-running record of global temperatures. That record is pretty good for the 20th century, but becomes spottier in the 19th century. To fill in the gaps, researchers are digitizing weather logbooks from ships that sailed in the mid-1800s. Anyone with an internet connection (and willing to read old-timey cursive handwriting) <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/p-teleti/weather-rescue-at-sea">can help transcribe the wealth of data</a> locked away in these books.</p>



<h4>Community Collaborative Rain, Hail &amp; Snow Network</h4>



<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Improve the quality of precipitation data</p>



<p><strong>HOW TO HELP:</strong> Because rain and snowfall are so variable over even short distances, the best way to accurately assess precipitation is to get as many on-the-ground measurements as possible. That’s the aim of this network of volunteers across the United States, Canada and the Bahamas who make daily precipitation measurements in their backyards. With a project-approved rain gauge and some online training, <a href="https://www.cocorahs.org/">you can collect data</a> that’s useful to everyone from farmers and city managers to the National Weather Service.</p>





<h4>Frog Find</h4>



<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Monitor threatened frogs</p>



<p><strong>HOW TO HELP:</strong> To keep tabs on frog species vulnerable to extinction, scientists in Australia have deployed acoustic monitoring devices in several of the country’s national parks. Researchers are seeking volunteers to listen in on hours of recordings. Just hop online, review a field guide of frog calls and <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ollibruuh/frog-find">start identifying amphibians</a> in audio clips.</p>



<h4>Prickly Pear Project Kenya</h4>



<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Assess the impacts of an invasive plant</p>



<p><strong>HOW TO HELP:</strong> Invasive prickly pear cacti are spreading throughout East Africa. To learn how the plants may be altering the behavior of native wildlife, ecologists set up camera traps in Kenya. Citizen scientists<a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/peter-dot-stewart/prickly-pear-project-kenya"> can help document what’s present in more than 100,000 photos</a>. After taking an online tutorial, you can catalog everything from the aardvarks to the zebras that you see.</p>



<h4>Finding Rico</h4>



<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Identify genius dogs</p>



<p><strong>HOW TO HELP:</strong> In 2004, researchers introduced the world to Rico, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fetching-lexicon-language-clues-come-dogs-vocabulary">a border collie that recognized about 200 spoken words</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/04</em>). Now, scientists are <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/news/researchers-looking-the-world-over-for-clever-dogs">looking for more high-vocabulary dogs</a> to study canine intelligence and language skills. If your pooch seems to know at least 20 objects by name, the team wants to hear from you.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fishing-cat-hunt-fish-india-scientists">Scientists uncover the secret to fishing cats’ hunting success</a></h4>

              
                <p>When the famously enigmatic fishing cat hunts in deep water, it keeps calm and stays still. At least, most of the time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Asia’s <em>Prionailurus viverrinus </em>prowls swamps and marshes at night, searching for fish that could make for a nutritious meal. Depending on how deep the water is, the wild feline <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/mammalia-2020-0133/html">switches its hunting strategy</a> to maximize its energy gain, scientists report December 24 in <em>Mammalia</em>.</p>



<p>The report offers “the first detailed look at how the fishing cat hunts,” says coauthor Tiasa Adhya, a Kolkata-based biologist. One of the foremost experts on the species, Adhya in 2010 cofounded <a href="https://fishingcat.org/the-fishing-cat-project/">The Fishing Cat Project</a> — the longest-running fishing cat research and conservation project in the world.</p>



<p>Just over a decade ago, the fishing cat was among the least-studied wild felines in the world. To raise awareness among local communities and gather data on the medium-sized cat, the project launched the Know Thy Neighbor initiative in 2016. More than 20 people living near three prime fishing cat habitats on India’s east coast — including Chilika, the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia — were trained to install camera traps in their respective neighborhoods.</p>

<p>One of the volunteers, Subas Behera, is a fisherman who lives near Chilika in Bhusandapur village. Each evening, Behera would place a camera trap at a predetermined location and remove it the next morning to avoid theft or damage. He has, with great affection, named the female fishing cat recorded by his camera trap ‘Choti,’ meaning small, after her one short, back leg.</p>



<p>“A fishing cat thinks just like a fisherman,” Behera says. “We’re both constantly thinking about where the fish are.”</p>





<p>Divyajyoti Ganguly, a wildlife biology master’s student at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore and coauthor of the study, analyzed 197 videos collected by the camera traps from 2016 to 2018.</p>



<p>In deep water — where much of the cats’ bodies are submerged — the felines tend to wait patiently for the perfect opportunity to strike. They stayed still nearly 52 percent of the time and jumped after prey just 3.9 percent of the time, the videos showed.</p>



<p>This ‘sit and wait’ approach helps fishing cats conserve energy while also increasing the chances of successfully ambushing prey. The fishing cat “thinks hard before jumping in,” Adhya says. “It has to optimize its [energy] gain.”</p>



<p>When hunting in shallow water, fishing cats were more active, patrolling about 96 percent of the time and occasionally pawing the water to flush out fish, Ganguly and Adhya found.</p>



<p>The insight “expands and elaborates on our understanding of the fishing cat’s semiaquatic nature,” says wildlife ecologist Jim Sanderson, founder and director of the Small Wild Cat Conservation Foundation in Corrales, N.M., who was not involved in the study.</p>





<p>Jaguars in Brazil have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jaguars-brazil-wetland-huge-numbers-fish-hunt-play">been spotted fishing</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN</em>: 10/13/21). But fishing cats&nbsp;have actual physical adaptations to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their partially retractable claws let the felines hook and hold fish, while their double-layered coats help them stay dry, previous work has shown. The fishing cat is one of only two wild cats in the world with adaptations to be semiaquatic, the other being the&nbsp;flat-headed cat&nbsp;(<em>Prionailurus planiceps</em>) of southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Still, there is more to learn about fishing cats, including just how many there are in the world. To date, there have been no national counts in any of the 10 countries in which the feline is known to exist. The cats do face increasing threats from habitat loss and degradation, as well as human-animal conflict, leading the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to classify the species as vulnerable.</p>



<p>“Living off fish inevitably brings fishing cats into conflict with people doing the same thing,” Sanderson says. “That’s why fishing cat conservation means working with the local people.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/25/how-to-master-the-art-of-conversation-according-to-psychology/">How to master the art of conversation, according to psychology</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Every time we catch up with a friend, we share the stories of our lives, from the mundane to the profound. Swapping stories — and especially secrets — helps to create friendships in the first place. Now new research is providing some intriguing insights into how to get that process going, and keep it going — on how best to handle conversations, to turn acquaintances or even strangers into new friends, and new friends into life-long confidantes.</p>



<span id="more-45139"></span>



<p><strong><em>Do</em> talk to strangers…</strong></p>



<p>Back in 2014, a pair of psychologists published a now classic study of Chicago commuters, which found that although our instinct is to ignore strangers, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/">we are happier when we chat to them</a>. Importantly, this was true for introverts as well as extraverts. The researchers also found that the commuters’ reluctance to strike up a conversation with a stranger was down to a mistaken belief that strangers wouldn’t want to talk to them. In 2021, a team that included Nicholas Epley, one of the authors of the initial paper, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-90811-001">published very similar results from a study of train commuters in the London area</a>. Clearly, this phenomenon applies to British people, too. So, go on, next time you’re with a stranger, why not try striking up a conversation — it’ll probably go better than you think.</p>



<p><strong>…But be aware of their personal space</strong></p>



<p>Our preferred personal space — the distance that we like to keep between ourselves and whoever we’re interacting with — varies with sex, culture, context and familiarity, and the Covid-19 pandemic is having an influence, too. A 2017 study of almost 9,000 people from 42 different countries <a href="https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/873645.sorokowska_et_al_2017.pdf">found some big geographical differences</a>, especially between what the researchers referred to as &#8220;contact cultures&#8221; (South America, the Middle East and Southern Europe) and &#8220;non-contact cultures&#8221; (Northern Europe, North America, Asia), where people prefer to stand further apart. So the cultural background of the person you’re talking to is certainly worth bearing in mind, if you don’t want to make them uncomfortable. The research also found that women from most countries prefer more space than men. And in 2021, a small study in the US found that the preferred personal distances that these participants had reported before the pandemic <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">grew during it, both in reality and virtually</a>. We’ve got used to giving other people a wider berth. This research suggests that with Covid-19 infections continuing, we still want it.</p>



<p><strong>Do go deep</strong></p>



<p>We want deep and meaningful relationships with others, and we know that sharing intimate stories can create them. But how soon after meeting someone should we move past the small talk? According to a 2021 study again involving Epley and led by Michael Kardas, the answer is: right away. The participants in this research <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/15/we-enjoy-deep-conversations-with-strangers-much-more-than-we-expect-to/">overestimated how awkward a deep conversation with a stranger would be</a> — and also underestimated how interested strangers would be in their revelations. And though the participants <em>expected</em> to prefer a shallow over a deep conversation with a stranger, this was not the case. The deep conversations left them feeling more connected.</p>



<p><strong>Do be complimentary</strong></p>



<p>Do you worry that saying &#8220;Oh, I love your dress!&#8221; or even &#8220;You’ve got a great sense of humour!&#8221; might sound insincere or too personal, and create awkwardness rather than fellow feeling? Well, <em>don’t </em>is the message of yet <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-92058-001.pdf">another new study</a> involving Epley, also published in 2021. Earlier research has shown that giving compliments draws both strangers and friends closer together. It also costs nothing, either financially or in terms of effort. And yet this work, led by Xuan Zhao on participants in the US, consistently found that pairs of friends undervalued the positive effect of compliments made to the other — they <em>under</em>estimated the resulting feelings of warmth in the recipient and <em>over</em>estimated how awkward that recipient would feel. This mistaken viewpoint seemed to have real-world effects: the participants also reported generally giving fewer compliments than they felt they should give, or even would like to give.</p>



<p>What if you don’t <em>fully</em> believe in the compliment that you’re giving? &#8220;People may be reluctant to flatter others with insincere compliments because they overestimate the likelihood that their insincerity will be detected,&#8221; the researchers write. In other words, do it anyway — odds are they’ll take your comment at face value.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t fret after a conversation</strong></p>



<p>One of the most positive, feel-good findings I’ve ever reported on was this: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/24/the-liking-gap-we-tend-to-underestimate-the-positive-first-impression-we-make-on-strangers/">other people like us more than we think</a>. This was the conclusion of a study of strangers who were paired up for brief conversations. Afterwards, they rated how much they liked their partners and how much they thought their partners liked them. And they consistently underestimated how much they were liked — they’d made a better first impression than they thought. What’s more, the shyer the person, the bigger the &#8220;liking gap&#8221;. So don’t let worries about how you might have come across to a new acquaintance put you off building on an initial conversation; they’re probably keener to talk again than you might assume.</p>



<p>In 2021, a paper in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-94729-001">revealed the existence of another conversation-related gap</a>: the &#8220;thought gap&#8221;. After a conversation, we tend to think about the person we’ve been talking to, reflecting on their stories or perhaps their advice, note Gus Cooney at the University of Philadelphia and colleagues. But though we do this ourselves, the team found in a series of studies that their participants mistakenly believed that they thought more afterwards about a person they’d had a conversation with than the other person did about them. &#8220;Collectively, these studies demonstrate that people remain on their conversation partners’ minds more than they know,&#8221; the team writes. One of the reasons this message is important is this: in one of the studies, learning how much the other person was actually thinking about them affected their willingness to reconcile after an argument.</p>



<p>Overall, then, for such a social species, we’re surprisingly bad at judging how conversations, and the specific content of these conversations, affect our relationships, and our own wellbeing. But the overwhelming take away message from these studies, at least, is positive: it’s all better than you think, so stop worrying, and get sharing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">The James Webb Space Telescope has reached its new home at last</a></h4>

              
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/24/orbital-insertion-burn-a-success-webb-arrives-at-l2/">finally arrived at its new home</a>. After a Christmas launch and a month of unfolding and assembling itself in space, the new space observatory reached its final destination, a spot known as L2.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">Guiding the telescope to L2 is &#8220;an incredible accomplishment by the entire team,&#8221; said Webb’s commissioning manager Keith Parrish in a January 24 news conference announcing the arrival. &#8220;The last 30 days, we call that &#8217;30 days on the edge.&#8217; We’re just so proud to be through that.&#8221; But the team&#8217;s work is not yet done. &#8220;We were just setting the table. We were just getting this beautiful spacecraft unfolded and ready to do science. So the best is yet to come,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">The telescope can’t start doing science yet. “We’re a month in and the baby hasn’t even opened its eyes yet,&#8221; said Jane Rigby of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &#8220;Everything we’re doing is about getting the observatory ready to do transformative science. That’s why we’re here.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are still several months’ worth of tasks on Webb’s to-do list <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">before the telescope is ready</a> to peep at the earliest light in the universe or spy on exoplanets’ alien atmospheres (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>





<p>“That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who is managing this next phase of Webb’s journey. “Everything could go perfectly, and it would still take six months” from launch for the telescope’s science instruments to be ready for action, he says.</p>



<p>Here’s what to expect next.</p>



<h4>Life at L2</h4>



<p>L2, technically known as the second Earth-sun Lagrange point, is a spot about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in the direction of Mars, where the sun and Earth’s gravity balance out the inward-pulling centripetal force that keeps a smaller object on a curved path. That lets objects at Lagrange points stay put without much effort. Pairs of massive objects in space have&nbsp;<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/754/what-is-a-lagrange-point/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five such Lagrange points</a>.</p>



<p>The telescope, also known as JWST, isn’t just sitting tight, though. It’s orbiting L2, even as L2 orbits the sun. That’s because L2 is not precisely stable, Friedman says. It’s like trying to stay balanced directly on top of a basketball. If you nudged an object sitting exactly at that point, it would be easy to make it wander off. Circling L2 in 180 days as L2 circles the sun in a “halo orbit” is much more stable — it’s harder to fall off the basketball when in constant motion. But it takes some effort to stay there.</p>





<p>“JWST and other astronomical satellites, which are said to be at L2 but are really in halo orbits, need propulsion to maintain their positions,” Friedman says. “For JWST, we will execute what we call station keeping maneuvers every 21 days. We fire our thrusters to correct our position, thus maintaining our halo orbit.”</p>



<p>The amount of fuel needed to maintain Webb’s home in space will set the lifetime of the mission. Once the telescope runs out of fuel, the mission is over. Luckily, the spacecraft had a near-perfect launch and didn’t use much fuel in transit to L2. As a result, it might be able to last more than 10 years, team members say, longer than the original five- to 10-year estimate.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’re very, very happy with our estimated lifetime. It’s going to extensively exceed our 10 years,&#8221; said Parrish in the Jan. 24 news conference. The team will put an exact number on that lifetime over the next few months. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s going to be really thrilled by it. It&#8217;s just a degree of how thrilled,&#8221; he said.</p>

</div><figcaption>Webb’s final destination is a spot in space called L2, about 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth. The telescope will actually orbit L2 as L2 orbits the sun (as shown in this animation). This special “halo orbit” helps the spacecraft stay in place without burning much fuel.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Webb has one more feature that helps it stay stable. The telescope’s gigantic kitelike sunshield, which protects the delicate instruments from the heat and light of the sun, Earth and the moon, could pick up momentum from the stream of charged particles that constantly flows from the sun, like a solar sail. If so, that could push Webb off course. To prevent this, the telescope has a flap that acts as a rudder, said Webb sunshield manager Jim Flynn of Northrup Grumman in a January 4 news conference.</p>



<h4>Cooling down</h4>



<p>Webb sees in infrared light, wavelengths longer than what the human eye can see. But humans do experience infrared radiation as heat. “We’re essentially looking at the universe in heat vision,” says astrophysicist Erin Smith of Goddard Space Flight Center and a project scientist on Webb.</p>



<p>That means that the parts of the telescope that observe the sky have to be at about 40 kelvins (–233° Celsius), which nearly matches the cold of space. That way, Webb avoids emitting more heat than the distant sources in the universe that the telescope will be observing, preventing it from obscuring them from view.</p>



<p>Most of Webb has been cooling down ever since the telescope’s sunshield <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/sunshield-successfully-deploys-on-nasa-s-next-flagship-telescope">unfurled on January 4</a>. The observatory’s five-layer sunshield blocks and deflects heat and light, letting the telescope’s mirrors and scientific instruments cool off from their temperature at launch. The sunshield layer closest to the sun will warm to about 85° Celsius, but the cold side will be about –233° Celsius, Parrish said  in a January 4 webcast.</p>



<p>“You could boil water on the front side of us, and on the backside of us, you’re almost down to absolute zero,” Parrish said.</p>



<p>One of the instruments, MIRI, the Mid-Infrared Instrument, has extra coolant to bring it down to 6.7 kelvins (–266° Celsius) to enable it to see even dimmer and cooler objects than the rest of the telescope. For MIRI, “space isn’t cold enough,” Smith says.</p>



<h4>Aligning the mirrors</h4>



<p>Webb finished unfolding its 6.5-meter-wide golden mirror on January 8, turning the spacecraft into a true telescope. But it’s not done yet. That mirror, which collects and focuses light from the distant universe, is made up of 18 hexagonal segments. And each of those segments has to line up with a precision of about 10 or 20 nanometers so that the whole apparatus mimics a single, wide mirror.</p>



<p>Webb will train each of its 18 mirror segments on a single bright star called HD 84406, in the constellation Ursa Major. It&#8217;s &#8220;just near the bowl of the big dipper. You can’t quite see it with your naked eye but I’m told you can see it with binoculars,&#8221; Lee Feinberg, Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard said at the January 24 news conference.</p>



<p>Starting on <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/12/webb-begins-its-months-long-mirror-alignment/">January 12</a>, 126 tiny motors on the back of the 18 segments started moving and reshaping them to make sure they all match up. Another six motors went to work on the secondary mirror, which is supported on a boom in front of the primary mirror.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Here’s how Webb’s primary mirror will act as one big looking glass | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-N_nkSiZ7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>Before the James Webb Space Telescope can start observing the universe, all 18 segments of its primary mirror need to act as one 6.5-meter mirror. This animation shows the mirror segments moving, tilting and bending to bring 18 separate images of a star (light dots) together into a single, focused image.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This alignment process will take until at least April to finish. In part, that’s because the movements are happening while the mirror is cooling. The changing temperature changes the shape of the mirrors, so they can’t be put in their final alignment until after the telescope’s suite of scientific instruments are fully chilled.</p>



<p>Once the initial alignment is done, light from distant space will first bounce off the primary mirror, then the secondary mirror and finally reach the instruments that will analyze the cosmic signals. But the alignment of the mirror segments is &#8220;not just right now, it’s a continuous process, just to make sure that they’re always perfectly aligned,&#8221; Scarlin Hernandez, a flight systems engineer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said at a NASA Science Live event on January 24. The process will continue for the telescope&#8217;s lifetime.</p>



<h4>Calibrating the science instruments</h4>



<p>While the mirrors are aligning, Webb’s science instruments will turn on. Technically, this is when Webb will take its first pictures, says astronomer Klaus Pontoppidan, also of the Space Telescope Science Institute. “But they’re not going to be pretty,” Pontoppidan says. The telescope will first test its focus on a single bright star, bringing 18 separate bright dots into one by tilting the mirrors.</p>



<p>After a few final adjustments, the telescope will be “performing as we want it to and presenting beautiful images of the sky to all the instruments,” Friedman says. “Then they can start doing their work.”</p>



<p>These instruments include <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nircam.html">NIRCam</a>, the primary near-infrared camera that will cover the range of wavelengths from 0.6 to 5 micrometers. NIRCam will be able to image the earliest stars and galaxies as they were when they formed at least 12 billion years ago, as well as young stars in the Milky Way. The camera will also be able to see objects in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of the solar system and is equipped with a coronagraph, which can block light from a star to reveal details of dimmer exoplanets orbiting it.</p>



<p>Next up is <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nirspec.html">NIRSpec</a>, the near-infrared spectrograph, which will cover the same range of light wavelengths as NIRCam. But instead of collecting light and turning it into an image, NIRSpec will split the light into a spectrum to figure out an object’s properties, such as temperature, mass and composition. The spectrograph is designed to observe 100 objects at the same time.</p>



<p><a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/miri.html">MIRI</a>, the mid-infrared instrument, is kept the coldest to observe in the longest wavelengths, from 5 to 28 micrometers. MIRI has both a camera and a spectrograph that, like NIRCam and NIRSpec, will still be sensitive to distant galaxies and newborn stars, but it will also be able to spot planets, comets and asteroids.</p>



<p>And the fourth instrument, called the <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/fgs.html">FGS/NIRISS</a>, is a two-parter. FGS is a camera that will help the telescope point precisely. And NIRISS, which stands for near-infrared imager and slitless spectrograph, will be specifically used to detect and characterize exoplanets.</p>

</div><figcaption>The James Webb Space Telescope’s science instruments are stored behind the primary mirror (as shown in this animation). Light from distant objects hits the primary mirror, then the secondary mirror in front of it, which focuses the light onto the instruments.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>First science targets</h4>



<p>It will take at least another five months after arriving at L2 to finish calibrating all of those science instruments, Pontoppidan says. When that’s all done, the Webb science team has a top secret plan for the first full color images to be released.</p>



<p>“These are images that are meant to demonstrate to the world that the observatory is working and ready for science,” Pontoppidan says. “Exactly what will be in that package, that’s a secret.”</p>



<p>Partly the secrecy is because there’s still some uncertainty in what the telescope will be able to look at when the time comes. If setting up the instruments takes longer than expected, Webb will be in a different part of its orbit and certain parts of the sky will be out of view for a while. The team doesn’t want to promise something specific and then be wrong, Pontoppidan says.</p>



<p>But also, “it’s meant to be a surprise,” he says. “We don’t want to spoil that surprise.”</p>



<p>Webb’s first science projects, however, are not under wraps. In the first five months of observations, Webb will begin a series of <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-ers-programs">Early Release Science projects</a>. These will use every feature of every instrument to look at a broad range of space targets, including everything from Jupiter to distant galaxies and from star formation to black holes and exoplanets.</p>



<p>Still, even the scientists are eager for the pretty pictures.</p>



<p>“I’m just very excited to get to see those first images, just because they will be spectacular,” Smith says. “As much as I love the science, it’s also fun to ooh and ahh.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimicrobial-resistance-cause-death-antibiotic-bacteria">Antimicrobial resistance is a leading cause of death globally</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bacterial infections that don’t respond to treatment are a leading cause of death around the world.</p>



<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02724-0/fulltext">antimicrobial resistance caused an estimated 1.27 million deaths</a>, researchers report January 19 in the <em>Lancet</em>. More people died from untreatable bacterial infections that year than from HIV or malaria.</p>



<p>Overall, bacterial antimicrobial resistance played a role in an estimated 4.95 million deaths globally, including the 1.27 million directly caused by resistant infections, the study found. The estimates are based on an analysis of hospital, surveillance and other sources of data covering 204 countries and territories by an international group of researchers called the Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators.</p>



<p>Resistance to two classes of antibiotics, beta-lactams (which include penicillin) and fluoroquinolones, was behind more than 70 percent of resistance-caused deaths. Those <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drug-resistance-has-gone-global-who-says">drugs are the first-line options</a> for many bacterial infections (<em>SN: 4/30/14</em>).</p>





<p>Among the bacteria responsible for fatal drug-resistant infections, the top three were <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>and<em> Staphylococcus aureus</em>, the researchers found. These pathogens can cause dangerous infections in health care settings in people with weakened immune systems.</p>



<p>Worldwide, 64 deaths per 100,000 people were associated with treatment-resistant bacterial infections and 16.4 deaths per 100,000 people were caused by such infections, the group found. Notably, western sub-Saharan Africa had the highest mortality rates: 114.8 deaths per 100,000 people were associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance and 27.3 deaths per 100,000 people were due to resistance.</p>



<p>Overall, the mortality rate from bacterial antimicrobial resistance was higher in places with fewer health care resources. This illustrates that solutions need to consider regional differences, the research group says. Limits on antibiotic use to deter resistance is key in many places. But in western sub-Saharan Africa, for example, increasing access to antibiotics may lessen the mortality burden from resistance, since second-line antibiotics needed after first-line drugs fail aren’t readily available.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubble-everlasting-pop-water-glycerol-microparticles">An ‘everlasting’ bubble endured more than a year without popping</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you hate having your bubble burst, you’ll love these “everlasting” bubbles.</p>



<p>While soap bubbles are known for their fragile constitutions, the new bubbles can <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.L011601">stick around for more than a year</a> before they pop, scientists report January 18 in <em>Physical Review Fluids</em>.</p>



<p>Instead of soap and water, the bubbles are made with water, microparticles of plastic and a clear, viscous liquid called glycerol. That trio of ingredients staves off factors that normally hasten a bubble’s death.</p>



<p>In a standard soap bubble, gravity pulls liquid to the bottom of the bubble, leaving a thin film on the top that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shimmering-soap-bubbles-have-dark-side">can easily rupture</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/17</em>). Evaporation of the liquid film also saps bubbles’ stamina. In the everlasting bubbles, plastic particles cling to the water, maintaining the film’s thickness. Meanwhile, glycerol absorbs moisture from the air, counteracting evaporation.</p>



<p>“When we discovered that the bubble didn’t rupture after days we were really astonished,” says physicist Michael Baudoin of Université de Lille in France. So he and colleagues waited to see how long the bubbles would last. And waited, and waited. One bubble persisted 465 days before it burst, making it the longest-lived bubble ever produced under normal atmospheric conditions. That bubble turned slightly green before its demise, a potential hint at what caused it to finally pop. Microbes probably took up residence, weakening the bubble’s structure, the team suspects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/24/highlighting-refugees-resilience-can-boost-their-confidence-and-engagement-at-university/">Highlighting refugees’ resilience can boost their confidence and engagement at university</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Refugees face all kinds of obstacles to settling well into a new country. One is the &#8220;stigmatised identity&#8221; of refugees as being weak, unskilled victims, write Christina Bauer at the Free University of Berlin and colleagues in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211028978">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>. So the team designed a simple intervention to reframe that identity as one characterised instead by perseverance and the ability to cope with adversity. When they tested it with refugees who were studying online, they found that it increased their engagement with their course — which in theory could make for greater future university and career success.</p>



<span id="more-45132"></span>



<p>In an initial study, the team recruited 93 participants who had come as refugees an average of four years earlier to European countries from mostly the Middle East. All could speak at least basic English. They were asked to imagine that they would soon be studying at a German university that offered free degrees to refugees. A &#8220;reframing&#8221; group then read passages purported to have been written by previous refugee students about how being a refugee had improved their resilience — how it had helped them to be independent, for example, and not to give up. This group also wrote down things that they themselves had learned as a refugee that might help them to succeed at the university (these were framed as tips that would be shared with future students). A control group was given an intervention that focused on study strategies rather than refugee identity.</p>



<p>All the participants then chose the difficulty level of a logical-thinking exercise that they were told was used at the university. The team found that the reframing group chose more difficult exercises than those in the study skills group. Independent raters who had scored all the written responses also rated this group’s comments as being more motivated, more agentic (more in control) and more empowering.</p>



<p>Given the artificial nature of the task, these are suggestive rather than compelling findings. But then the team turned to 533 actual refugee students (mostly men, mostly quite young, mostly Middle Eastern), who were enrolling at a genuine German university.</p>



<p>Each student received either the 10-minute-long identity-reframing or study-skill intervention at the beginning of their online study at the university. And the team found immediate but also long-term impacts. One year on, the reframing group had engaged 23% more with the learning platform than the other group; at the 7-month mark, they had also completed more courses. This latter difference between the two groups was only marginally significant. But, the team concluded, “there was some evidence that the intervention increased refugees’ long-term academic achievement as well as their engagement.”</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t ask the participants about their initial feelings about refugee identity. Perhaps some already saw themselves as being strong and resourceful, and the intervention only affirmed these feelings. But whether it was a &#8220;reframing&#8221; or an affirmation, the intervention did seem to make a difference, and it’s certainly simple to run.  “The one-time identity-reframing intervention can be delivered briefly online, can reach additional students at negligible cost, and is highly scalable,” the team comments.</p>



<p>A version aimed at changing tutors’ and fellow students’ perceptions of refugee identity might make a difference, too, of course. Indeed, the authors of a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/28/theres-surprisingly-little-evidence-behind-common-beliefs-about-the-best-way-for-immigrants-to-adapt/">recent major study that found essentially no evidence that any culture-related strategy adopted by an immigrant helps their wellbeing</a> argue that the focus should shift to looking at how the receiving societies behave.     </p>

              <h4><a href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/week7-blog-post.html">Week7 Blog Post</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hello there! and welcome once again to my blog.</p>
<p>This is about a journey of adventure, headaches, victory dances and learning!</p>
<h3>What was my original internship project timeline?</h3>
<p>Week 1-2: Learn the Fedora package maintainer process, and improve existing packages via pull requests to practice the workflow.</p>
<p>Week 3-5: Go over the NeuroFedora packaging queue and identify a list of tools for packaging</p>
<p>Week 6-9: Follow the Fedora package maintaining process, and submit packages for review.</p>
<p>Week 10: Follow the review process and make necessary improvements to submitted packages.</p>
<p>Week 12: Submit packages for QA, test them, update documentation.</p>
<h3>What have I accomplished in the first half of the internship</h3>
<p>I would say being an open source contributor is the biggest achievement so far as this is my first open source project, also i contribute to an organization as big as Fedora. </p>
<p>For this first half i've being able to package python spec files,make updates and even review other packages, learn more about git as i practice. Generally i think I and my mentor have already gone over list 😄</p>
<h3>What project goals took longer than expected?</h3>
<p>The projects I found most challenging was learning how to write blogs for non technical audience, but my mentor carefully took me through a session where he explained the bits of writing for a non technical audience and i'm sure with more practice i'll get better.</p>
<p>Also building some packages took longer than expected, but with some help of course i had my victory dance.</p>
<h3>What would I do differently if I were starting the internship over?</h3>
<p>If i was to start my internship over again? well i wouldn't change much because i love my learning curve and speed, though some times it's challenging and i spend more time on projects than expected but my mentor tries to help me out and modify my timing to help me understand better.</p>
<p>But... i think i should have started taking notes earlier as i forget alot of little details 😄</p>
<h3>What is my new plan for the second half of the internship?</h3>
<p>I plan on making notes at every step and also timing myself to catch up with my given tasks.</p>
<p>My Outreachy internship has really been awesome, it gave me the opportunity to be part of a bigger community, to learn things i never knew about, to meet awesome people and become a better version of myself. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">What the Tonga volcano’s past tells us about what to expect next</a></h4>

              
                <p>On January 15, an underwater volcano in the island nation of Tonga erupted with the explosive force of a nuclear bomb, and it may not be done just yet.</p>



<p>The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&#8217;apai volcano in the South Pacific launched a towering, mushroom-shaped cloud of ash and dust at least 20 kilometers into the atmosphere — and <a href="https://twitter.com/simon_sat/status/1483129968393695239">possibly as high as 39 kilometers</a> by one estimate. The blast sent <a href="https://twitter.com/NiwaWeather/status/1482275541353140224">shock waves that are still rippling</a> through the atmosphere a week later.</p>



<p>Images show ash caked on Tonga islands, coating buildings, clinging to crops and probably contaminating water supplies. The power of the explosion also triggered a rare volcanic tsunami that raced across the ocean, inundating the densely populated island of Tongatapu 65 kilometers away from the eruption, sending residents fleeing to higher ground. At least three people have died due to the eruption and tsunami.</p>



<p>The volcano may now return to a period of dormancy after releasing its fury. But it also might not. Researchers who have studied Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&#8217;apai’s eruptive history, recorded in layers of hardened ash and fragments of volcanic pumice, say that this volcano has tended to erupt explosively every thousand years or so — and not just once, but in multiple pulses.</p>



<p>Whether that will happen this time, and if so, when, is very difficult to say at this point, says Shane Cronin, a volcanologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. He has been working with colleagues to gather information on the volcano to help with relief efforts and predict what might come next.</p>

<p>“Time will tell, and the next few days may tell us a lot,” he says.</p>



<p>Tonga has no active seismometers — and communications from the island nation remain largely incapacitated by ashfall and flooding. But with the help of satellite images, Cronin and others are keeping close watch over the region, hunting for changes to the volcano’s shape or height or other indicators that may signal that magma might be on the move again.</p>





<p>For now, the volcano’s violent past may offer some clues to its future. Even before the recent eruption, most of the volcano, including the caldera, or central crater, was submerged; now it’s sunk even farther. But at the crater’s fringe lie two small, uninhabited islands — Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai. They once rose a hundred meters or so above the water. That’s where, after a small 2014–2015 eruption, a new volcanic cone appeared, essentially bridging the two islands. That provided a landing spot for Cronin and his colleagues, who journeyed there in 2015 and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2017EO076589">discovered Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&#8217;apai‘s hidden history</a>.</p>



<p>Cronin talked with <em>Science News </em>about the recent eruption, why its tsunami was so unusual and his and his colleagues&#8217; efforts to piece together the volcano’s history. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>What’s happening in the eruption’s aftermath? Satellite images show a cloud of sulfur dioxide from the volcano over the Pacific.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> Yes, the plume is stretched out really long now to the northwest. It’s quite high in the atmosphere, over 25 kilometers in elevation. So it will stay there for a little while, not long enough to make a long-term climate impact but certainly enough to generate some acid rain [in the region].</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>What are some of the ashfall hazards?</strong><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> [Satellite photos suggest many Tonga] islands are gray and covered in ash. It’s very hard to tell from the air, but it looks in the range of a few centimeters thick. That means the risk of buildings collapsing is low. The biggest problem is crops, because the ash sticks to the plants and they may die.</p>

<p>A secondary problem is drinking water: The ash has salts in it that dissolve in water and turn it acidic. Around 50 percent of Tongans have their water from roof-fed rainwater supplies. The taste and odor are unpleasant, and it could cause stomach upsets, but it’s not poisonous in that it doesn’t have high concentrations of heavy metals.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>A lot of the land you mapped in 2015 is now submerged. What’s it like to know that this place is just gone?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> It’s a bit sad. It’s remarkable how changeable these volcanic landscapes are. This one hasn’t maybe sunk in yet because I’ve been so busy in the aftermath of it. We’re still looking at all of the photos coming through of the changes. It seems that the whole top of the volcano actually just dropped vertically, by at least 10 meters; just the tips of [Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai] islands are now above sea level.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>Was there a large magma chamber under the caldera that emptied and collapsed, dropping everything down?</strong><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> That would be my interpretation. Some other volcanologists are saying there’s no evidence yet, and that the [observed volume of erupted magma] was quite small. But the explosion originated maybe 250 meters below sea level. You have material exploding upward, but also a lot that probably went sideways.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>When did you realize the volcano might be bigger and more explosive than suggested by the 2014-2015 eruption?</strong><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> &nbsp;Well, we knew that there was a bigger volcano [than just the cone] there, we just didn’t know what the shape of it was. We took with us a multibeam seafloor mapping system, thinking we’d try to map the submarine shape of the new cone.</p>



<p>As we were driving [offshore] with the multibeam, we started seeing a whole lot of other little submarine volcanic cones. It was like, “Wow, look at that!” And then we realized that they were all within a deep basin, about 150 meters deep. The little cones were actually all inside one large submerged caldera, about 6 kilometers across.</p>

<p>[Meanwhile] I spent a lot of time looking at a series of [volcanic] deposits on Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai. It was clear they were produced by much more violent processes [than what had formed the new cone. These deposits] were ignimbrite: They were hot, welded together and contained charcoal, which we used to get the year of the event: 1100. Then, below a layer of soil, there was another series of very similar deposits [dating to about the year 200]. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>So basically you realized that every thousand years or so, there was a series of powerful eruptions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> Yes. And probably there were two or three more sets of deposits underneath that array.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>Ocean island volcanoes </strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/no-kilauea-wont-cause-mass-destruction-krakatoa"><strong>like Kilauea </strong></a><strong>aren’t usually very explosive (</strong><strong><em>SN: 5/16/18</em></strong><strong>); their basalt magma tends to be less thick and gassy. So what happened here?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> We don’t know the composition of this eruption, because we don’t have any sample material yet. But everything else we’ve sampled from this volcano is actually quite boring — it’s all basalt, more or less the same compositions during the little magma leaks as during the major explosive events.</p>



<p>The main difference in the major explosive events is that the magma maybe had a little bit more residence time [within the magma chamber], allowing it to accumulate more gas. [As magma rises toward the surface and the pressure decreases, gases in it expand, giving magma its potentially explosive power.]</p>



<p>When there’s plenty of water around and the gassy magma blasts quickly into the ocean, you can also have some explosive blasts. You’ve got the interaction of fragmenting hot magma with cold seawater, and you flash the seawater into steam, adding a lot of energy to the explosion. We call that a phreatomagmatic eruption.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>It’s pretty unusual for a volcano to produce a tsunami, too, isn’t it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> Yes, there’s been a lot of discussion about how the tsunami was so energetic. It’s hard to create enough energy with volcanoes [because they don’t tend to be big enough and shift enough water to create a powerful tsunami, unlike earthquakes].</p>



<p>Even if you consider the whole 6-kilometer diameter of the underwater crater, and the whole thing dropping by 10 or even 100 meters, that’s still a very small area. It’s a relatively small volume of water that gets displaced to generate a tsunami.</p>



<p>I’ve been thinking about this the last few days, to try to explain the energy transfer from volcano to waves. During an explosive eruption, you have processes that blast material upward, producing the main eruption column. But when we are close to sea level, or maybe even submarine, you also end up generating very dense eruption columns underwater that can collapse and travel out laterally.</p>



<p>So you can end up with these laterally directed currents made up of a mix of hot rock particles, air and water droplets flowing down the flanks of the volcano. And we’ll never see them because they’re underneath the waves. [These flows] are potentially a mechanism for a lot more extra volume, and for a lot of lateral energy, that could create tsunami events. They’re very unusual tsunamis in that respect.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>The volcano had a few smaller eruptions on December 30 and January 13. Were you bracing for more?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> I was watching it like a hawk, for sure. After the 30th of December event, we scrambled around to get images to try and figure out what was happening.</p>



<p>The 2014–2015 eruption had some small surges at the [volcano’s] base, some jets, spectacular to look at but mainly locally important. The December 30 and January 13 events were more vertical, quite decent plumes, a step up in terms of explosive energy, and obviously the pressure was rising, and by the 15th, that pent-up, gas-rich magma was ready to erupt.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>So the big question: What can we expect next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> We don’t have a lot to go on. There are no seismographs anywhere near this volcano, or in Tonga, which is a real problem. All the observations up to now were taken from a boat, or these aerial images. It’s hard to do any prediction.</p>



<p>So [volcanologists] have come up with three possible scenarios, small, medium and large, based on the geologic background. The large scenario is that there’s this pent-up, gas-charged magma that has erupted, and it caused a very large explosion, and has changed the shape of the upper part of the volcano. So, if new magma rapidly arrives to take its place and comes into that really unstable edifice, it may start to create further explosive eruptions, but also potential flank collapses [possibly causing more tsunamis].</p>



<p>The medium scenario is that there’s new magma, but [any] new cracks in the volcano’s flanks mean the magma could degas [becoming less likely to explode] before it erupts. There will still be magma-water interaction, though, and chances of a small eruption plume and maybe a small tsunami.</p>



<p>The small scenario is that there’s a little bit of residual activity, some small water-magma events, and then everything quiets down. Right now, we aren’t seeing a great deal of disturbance or discoloration in the water from aerial images, which seems to indicate that things are quieting down.</p>



<p>Time will tell now, and we’ll be watching.</p>

                <p>A brilliant blast from a galaxy 2 billion light-years away is the brightest cosmic “Cow” found yet. It’s the fifth known object in this new class of exploding stars and their long-glowing remnants, and it’s giving astronomers even more hints of what powers these mysterious blasts.</p>



<p>These Cow-like events, named for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cow-may-be-strange-supernova">first such object discovered</a> in 2018 — which had the unique identifier name of AT2018cow — are a subclass of supernova explosions, making up only 0.1 percent of such cosmic blasts (<em>SN: 6/21/19</em>). They brighten quickly, glow brilliantly in ultraviolet and blue light and continue to show up for months in higher-energy X-rays and lower-energy radio waves.</p>



<p>X-rays from the newest discovery, dubbed AT2020mrf, <a href="https://aas.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/AAS239_Mon2_YuhanYao.pdf">glowed 20 times as bright as the original Cow</a> a month after the blast, Caltech astronomer Yuhan Yao reported January 10 at a virtual news conference held by the American Astronomical Society. And even one year after this new object’s discovery, its X-rays were 200 times as bright as those from the original Cow. Yao and colleagues also reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00751">the results in a paper</a> submitted December 1 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Unraveling all that took a bit of time. The Zwicky Transient Facility at Caltech’s Palomar Observatory near San Diego, Calif., initially noted a bright new burst of light June 12, 2020, but astronomers didn’t realize what it was at the time.</p>





<p>Then in April 2021, researchers with the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space telescope, which studies X-ray light, alerted Yao and her colleagues to an interesting signal in SRG data from July 21–24, 2020, at the same spot in the sky. “I almost immediately realized that this might be another Cow-like event,” says Yao. The astronomers sprang to action and looked at that location with multiple other observatories in different kinds of light.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Bright spot</h4>



<p>The brightest Cow-like supernova blast yet seen, AT2020mrf, was not visible (empty circle) in January 2020 in X-rays captured by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma space telescope. But in July, it was hard to miss.</p>

<p>One of those observatories was the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory, the world’s most powerful X-ray telescope. In June 2021, a year after the original supernova blast, it captured X-rays from the same location. The source’s signal “was 10 times brighter than what I expected,” says Yao, and 200 times as bright as the original Cow was a year post-explosion.</p>



<p>Even more exciting was that the strengths of both the Chandra X-ray detection and the original SRG X-ray observations also changed within hours to days. That flaring characteristic, it turns out, can tell astronomers a lot.</p>



<p>“X-rays give us information of what’s happening at the heart of these events,” says MIT astrophysicist DJ Pasham, who has studied the original Cow but was not part of this new study. “The duration of the flare gives you a sense of how compact or how big the object is.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>A compact object like an actively eating black hole or a rapidly spinning and highly magnetic neutron star would create the strong and variable X-ray signals that were seen, Yao says. These were the two most probable <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-neutron-star-black-hole">leftover remnants of the original cosmic Cow</a> as well, but the AT2020mrf observations provide even greater certainty (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Further observations and catching these objects earlier in the act with multiple types of light will help researchers learn more about this new class of supernovas and what type of star eventually explodes as a Cow.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Belief in conspiracy theories has been linked to various factors, including <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">low levels of critical thinking</a>, a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">need to feel special</a>, and even a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">yearning for excitement and thrills</a>. But how does political ideology come into it? Some studies suggest that there is a straightforward association, in which people with more extreme right-wing views are more prone to conspiracy theories. But other work has found a “U-shaped” relationship, where conspiratorial thinking is more common among people on the extremes of both the right <em>and </em>left compared to those with more moderate views.</p>



<p>The latter finding has tended to come from research into a small group of relatively prosperous nations, note the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01258-7">new study</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>. But now, looking at data from more than 100,000 people across 26 countries, the team finds further evidence that conspiracy theories are more common among the far left as well as the right, and provides some suggestions as to why this is the case.</p>



<span id="more-45115"></span>



<p>Across two studies, Roland Imhoff from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and colleagues recruited 104,253 participants from European nations, as well as Brazil, Israel and Turkey. Each participant rated their political orientation on a single scale from extreme left to extreme right, and also indicated what party they would vote for (or had voted for in the previous election). They also completed the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, which taps into endorsement of conspiracy theories with questions like “I think that there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions”.</p>



<p>The team did find some evidence, in the first study at least, that there was an overall linear relationship between political orientation and having a conspiracy mentality, with people on the extreme right more likely to endorse conspiracy theories. But this effect wasn’t consistent on a country-by-country basis: in some countries there was no relationship, and in others it was actually people on the extreme <em>left</em> that endorsed conspiracy theories more.</p>



<p>Instead, the researchers found that the data better fit a U-shaped relationship, where belief in conspiracy theories rose both for extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing participants. This relationship proved significant for both studies, and was more consistent across individual countries.</p>



<p>Why would people on the fringes of the political spectrum be more likely to endorse conspiracy theories? One possibility is that these people don’t see their political views reflected in government — after all, extreme political groups do not make it into government as often as more moderate parties — and turn to conspiracy theories to try and make sense of this apparent lack of political control.</p>



<p>To test this theory, the researchers looked at whether conspiracy beliefs differed between those who supported a party in government and those who supported a party that wasn’t in power. They found that participants whose preferred party was not in power did indeed show stronger endorsement of conspiracy theories. But even after controlling for this, the researchers still found that U-shaped relationship between political ideology and conspiracy beliefs, suggesting that a lack of political control can’t be the only reason that people on the extremes endorse conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>An alternative explanation is that the extreme left and right actually share some views that are also related to conspiracism. These people often demonise the outgroup, for instance, and subscribe to authoritarian views – themes which also crop up in conspiracy beliefs. Indeed, the team found evidence that supporters of extremely left-wing parties were only prone to conspiracy beliefs when those parties were nationalistic and authoritarian, and not when they were socially liberal.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the results suggest that people are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories if they don’t see themselves represented in government — but also that subscribing to an extreme political ideology also has an effect above and beyond that of a lack of representation.  There are some limitations though. As the authors note, it could be that people who believe in conspiracy theories are drawn to fringe parties, rather than conspiracy theories developing as a reaction to a lack of power. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the team also found evidence that political unrest within a nation and conspiratorial language from its leaders can also have a profound effect on who endorses conspiracy theories. Further work could look in more detail at how political rhetoric can give rise to conspiracy beliefs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rain-global-economy-drought-flash-floods">Intense drought or flash floods can shock the global economy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extremes in rainfall — whether intense drought or flash floods — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04283-8">can catastrophically slow the global economy</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 13 <em>Nature</em>. And those impacts are most felt by wealthy, industrialized nations, the researchers found.</p>



<p>A global analysis showed that episodes of intense drought led to the biggest shocks to economic productivity. But days with intense deluges — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">such as occurred in July 2021 in Europe</a> — also produced strong shocks to the economic system (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). Most surprising, though, was that agricultural economies appeared to be relatively resilient against these types of shocks, says Maximilian Kotz, an environmental economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Instead, two other business sectors — manufacturing and services — were the most hard-hit.</p>



<p>As a result, the nations most affected by rainfall extremes weren’t those that tended to be poorer, with agriculture-dependent societies, but the wealthiest nations, whose economies are tied more heavily to manufacturing and services, such as banking, health care and entertainment.</p>



<p>It’s well established that rising temperatures can take a toll on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-economic-cost-united-states">economic productivity</a>, for example by contributing to days lost at work or doctors’ visits (<em>SN: 11/28/18</em>). Extreme heat also has clear impacts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">on human behavior</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/21</em>)<em>.</em> But what effect climate change–caused shifts in rainfall might have on the global economy hasn’t been so straightforward.</p>





<p>That’s in part because previous studies looking at a possible connection between rainfall and productivity have focused on changes in yearly precipitation, a timeframe that “is just too coarse to really describe what’s actually happening [in] the economy,” Kotz says. Such studies showed that more rain in a given year was basically beneficial, which makes sense in that having more water available is good for agriculture and other human activities, he adds. “But these findings were mainly focused on agriculturally dependent economies and poorer economies.”</p>



<p>In the new study, Kotz and his colleagues looked at three timescales — annual, monthly and daily rainfall — and examined what happened to economic output for time periods in which the rainfall deviated from average historical values. In particular, Kotz says, they introduced two new measures not considered in previous studies: the amount of rainy days that a region gets in a year and extreme daily rainfall. The team then examined these factors across 1,554 regions around the world — which included many subregions within 77 countries — from 1979 to 2019.</p>



<p>The disparity over which regions are hit hardest is “at odds with the conventional wisdom” — and with some previous studies — that agriculture is vulnerable to extreme rainfall, writes Xin-Zhong Liang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03783-x">a commentary in the same issue</a> of <em>Nature</em>. Researchers may need to incorporate other factors in future assessments, such as growth stages of crops, land drainage or irrigation, in order to really understand how these extremes affect agriculture, Liang writes.</p>



<p>“That was definitely surprising for us as well,” Kotz says. Although the study doesn’t specifically try to answer why manufacturing and services were so affected, it makes intuitive sense, he says. Flooding, for example, can damage infrastructure and disrupt transportation, effects that can then propagate along supply chains. “It’s feasible that these things might be most important in manufacturing, where infrastructure is very important, or in the services sectors, where the human experience is very much dictated by these daily aspects of weather and rainfall.”</p>



<p>Including daily and monthly rainfall extremes in this type of analysis was “an important innovation” because it revealed new economic vulnerabilities, says Tamma Carleton, an environmental economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the new work. However, Carleton says, “the findings in the paper are not yet conclusive on who is most vulnerable and why, and instead raise many important questions for future research to unpack.”</p>



<p>Extreme rainfall events, including both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">drought and deluge, will occur more frequently</a> as global temperatures rise, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted in August (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). The study’s findings, Kotz says, offer yet another stark warning to the industrialized, wealthy world: Human-caused climate change will have “large economic consequences.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-saliva-spit-sharing-relationships-kiss-food">Babies may use saliva sharing to figure out relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>Young children are always watching. That includes when people swap spit through actions like sharing food — helping the tots work out who is in close relationships with one another, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Typically, people are more likely to share things that can lead to an exchange of saliva, such as kisses or an ice cream cone, with family members or close friends than with an acquaintance or colleague. As a result, intimate actions that share saliva can be markers of a “thick relationship,” or people who have enduring attachments to each other, such as parents, siblings, extended family or best friends, says Ashley Thomas, a developmental psychologist at MIT.</p>



<p>Young children often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/your-baby-knows-who-your-real-friends-are">pick up on social cues</a> from the people around them (<em>SN: 1/30/14</em>). So to see if kids, including babies and toddlers, might use saliva sharing as a cue for intimate bonds, Thomas and colleagues turned to experiments of people engaging with puppets.</p>



<p>When shown a puppet seemingly crying in a video, children as young as about 8 months old were <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn5157">more likely to look at an adult who had previously shared saliva with the puppet</a> — either directly or by sharing food — rather than another adult who hadn’t, the team reports in the Jan. 21 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Researchers, of course, can’t know exactly what babies are thinking. But tracking where they look is one way to get a hint. The idea is not that young children might be expecting an adult to comfort the puppet, Thomas says. Instead, the researchers expected that the young children would look toward the person that they expect to move first when the puppet expresses distress, and that would be the person who has a closer relationship with the toy, she says.</p>



<p>For some of the experiments, the team showed 8- to 10-month-old babies or 16- to 18-month-old toddlers videos of a woman sharing an orange slice with a puppet. A second video depicted another woman and the puppet playing with a ball. During a final video that showed the puppet seemingly crying while seated between the two women, the kids’ eyes were drawn to the woman who had shared the orange slice — a sign the tots may have been expecting her to react.</p>



<p>The team saw similar results when one woman interacted with two puppets. The woman stuck her finger in her mouth and then one puppet’s mouth to share her saliva. For the other, she touched only her forehead and then the puppet’s forehead. Infants and toddlers spent more time looking at the puppet that had swapped saliva after the woman showed distress.</p>



<p>Older children ages 5 to 7 years also picked up on saliva sharing as a mark of close relationships. Kids in that age group predicted that people sharing utensils or bites of food might be family while those sharing toys or divvying up food could be either friends or family.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how the findings relate to the daily lives of young children. Future experiments could switch out actresses in the study for family members or teachers to better understand the role saliva may play in how infants and toddlers distinguish different types of relationships. Other cues, such as hugging, may also play a role, Thomas says.</p>



<p>The study also focused only on children living in the United States, and didn’t compare across cultures. Still, the findings are exciting, says Darby Saxbe, a clinical developmental psychologist and co-director of the University of Southern California Center for the Changing Family in Los Angeles. It would be interesting, she says, to figure out whether kids from groups of people that have different hygiene or eating traditions react differently in the same situations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fin-whale-eat-choke-baleen-oral-plug-muscle-fat">A ‘trapdoor’ made of muscle and fat helps fin whales eat without choking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the world’s largest whales feed by lunging through the water with mouths wide open. Scientists have long wondered how the animals withstand the tremendous pressure of water rushing into their throats without choking and drowning.</p>



<p>A plug made of muscle and fat found at the back of fin whales’ mouths might offer a clue. The plug blocks the channel between a fin whale’s mouth and its pharynx, the entrance to the respiratory and digestive tracts. The plug appears to prevent water from rushing into the whale’s lungs and stomach while it lunges and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01727-9">could explain how all lunge-feeding whale eat without choking</a>, researchers report January 20 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“Think of [the plug] as a trapdoor,” says Kelsey Gil, a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. “It’s always closed unless muscular activity pulls it out of the way.”</p>



<p>Gil and her team identified the plug after&nbsp;examining the pharynx of 19&nbsp;fin whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) recovered from an Icelandic whaling station. Because fin whales <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baleen-whales-eat-poop-more-food-ecosystem">are prodigious eaters</a> and can weigh up to 100 metric tons, the size of a midsized passenger plane, it was easier to work with just the pharynx (<em>SN: 11/3/21</em>).</p>





<p>“Even then we had to use a forklift to move the pharynx to the lab. It can weigh a few hundred pounds,” says Gil.</p>





<p>Once the samples were in the lab, she and her team manipulated different structures in the pharynx to see how they could move and looked at which direction muscle fibers ran within the whales’ throat to understand how the muscles behave when they contract.</p>



<p>When a whale gulps water, the pressure leads to the plug creating a tight seal over the whale’s pharynx. Then, with a mouth full of water and prey, a fin whale pushes the water out through its baleen plates before it swallows. The swallow reflex probably activates the muscle that pulls the plug up to the top of its throat, blocking the upper airways and letting prey slide into its digestive tract. The plug, which appears to be unique among mammals, may explain how other lunge-feeders eat without choking on water, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“The discovery of the ‘oral plug’&nbsp;answers a long-standing question about how whales can simultaneously protect their respiratory tract while opening their mouths wide to engulf prey-laden water,” says Sarah Fortune, an expert in large whales at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who was not involved in the study. It also helps us better understand the adaptations that permitted once terrestrial mammals to evolve back into sea-dwelling creatures, she says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are many fields in which women are underrepresented: in certain areas of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/03/diversity-grants-can-discourage-diverse-candidates-from-applying-for-more-lucrative-scholarships/">education</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/25/women-and-early-career-academics-experience-imposter-syndrome-in-fields-that-emphasise-natural-brilliance/">academia</a>, in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/03/16/women-need-female-role-models/">politics</a>, and in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/21/supportive-male-allies-can-make-male-dominated-workplaces-less-hostile-for-women/">senior leadership roles</a>. Efforts have been made across sectors to improve this representation, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/">as we’ve particularly covered</a> in the case of STEM.</p>



<p>Unequal representation may start before the workplace or university, however — even before school. Exploring children’s literature, a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260566">new study</a> in <em>PLOS One </em>from researchers at Princeton and Emory universities finds an overrepresentation of male protagonists in children’s books, potentially reinforcing damaging societal expectations for those of all genders.</p>



<span id="more-45103"></span>



<p>To analyse gender representation in this context, the team gathered data on 3,280 children’s books published between 1960 and 2020: these books included award winners, bestsellers, recommendations given to parents and teachers, and those featured in publishing catalogues. Books were aimed at children aged 0-16, and only those featuring a single identifiable protagonists were included in the set.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The books that were included were then coded for the gender of the protagonist, the year of publication, the gender of the author, the age of the target audience, the type of character (human or a non-human being like an animal, alien, toy, or vehicle) and the genre of the book (fiction or non-fiction).</p>



<p>The team found that in the 1960s, almost three-quarters of books had male protagonists. This proportion decreased between 1960 and 2020, including over the last two decades — a continuing journey towards equity that spells good news for those seeking more representative gender representation in books. But the team’s analysis showed that even today, there is still underrepresentation of women and girls in children’s books.</p>



<p>This representation was also not uniform. Male authors were much less likely than female authors to feature women or girls as their protagonists; in fact, men were three times more likely to write a male protagonist than a female one. Non-fiction books and books that featured non-human characters were also less likely to feature female protagonists. Books aimed at younger rather than older children also less frequently featured a main character who was a woman or girl: books aimed at infants, for instance, featured male protagonists twice as often as female protagonists.</p>



<p><a></a>What the team did not look at, however, were the behaviours associated with the characters they surveyed. Were boy characters less emotional than girls, more interested in science, or more active? Even if the gender of characters is, frequency-wise, equal, what stereotypes or characteristics are being promoted in the content of the books? Similarly, a review could also take place looking at other elements of identity and experience: how non-binary genders, race, class, sexuality and disability are represented in children’s books and with what characteristics.</p>



<p>This is not just a case of representation for its own sake. Research has suggested that non-stereotypical protagonists can <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/examining-the-impact-of-fiction-literature-on-children-s-gender-EcO9Ql9iUE?impressionId=5e6806ee21685&amp;i_medium=docview&amp;i_campaign=recommendations&amp;i_source=recommendations">make a dent in gender stereotypes</a> in children and even make less gender-stereotypical behaviours <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00986/full">seem more acceptable</a>. More diverse books could potentially, therefore, help children of all genders debunk harmful stereotypes and feel more confident in themselves before they even get to school.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Environmental Data and Impact-Oriented Modeling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) include the prevention of environmental degradation that can impact <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2016/04/26/global-health-security-interconnected-world-bmc-medicine-attends-cugh-2016/">human health</a>. Data and publicly facing visualizations provide crucial information to better understand complex, public health problems so that decision makers and the public can understand the problem. This is done through a concept called impact-oriented modeling.</p>

Environmental degradation involves the destruction of environments and loss of wildlife. Immediate action is needed to reverse the damage.  The use of impact-oriented modeling demonstrates current damage and future changes, highlighting the necessity for decision makers and governments to make significant changes. </div></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Most environmental data is collected from multiple methodologies of varying accuracy and precision resulting in poor and difficult data interpretation. Thus, there is a critical need to bring together these different data sources and to create better organization and visualization of the data. One solution is to use impact-oriented modeling to integrate the data and to help users employ and contextualize the data for behavioral modification.</p>
<p>Typically, policymakers value scientific models to help them make decisions that could have wide-ranging impacts. For example, with COVID-19, scientific models continue to be used to help inform policy makers on needed interventions to control the pandemic. Unfortunately, scientific models themselves can be difficult to interpret and understand except for the initiated. Also, scientific models and data need to be coupled with understandable outputs and visualizations to make the greatest impact. Combining these two key elements is the focus of impact-oriented modeling. More and more, policymakers are turning to impact-oriented modeling to help make thoughtful, scientific and research-informed decisions. Similarly, applying impact-oriented modeling to climate change data could help inform both policymakers and the general public about the issues and help inform the current discussions underway. Recently, a paper by Shah et al. (2021) created a 7 step framework for success of impact-oriented modeling that can be applied to climate change data.</p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations for Climate Change Impact-Oriented Modeling:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Agility:</strong> <em>Is the data providing timely information?</em> Environmental data and the implementation of a wide range of global and regional policy commitments on climate change requires responsiveness to new inputs of data and reflect current trends. The <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (OECD), the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) and many others provide updated environmental indicators.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Responsiveness:</strong> <em>Does the data respond to new evidence?</em> Models should allow the public and policy-makers to react to the data and should be responsive to the data in an iterative fashion. A feedback loop of action-information-reaction should drive models to continuously evolve along with climate change indicators. Detecting long-term trends of environmental data is affected by numerous factors, including the time span of available data. Moreover, determining which environmental variables are likely to allow for earlier detectable change in the data will allow current and planned monitoring programs to be more efficient in modifying user behaviors. For instance, Kural et al. (2021) developed a new climate-change dataset that comprises different types of adaptation-related activities and may be used to compare adaptability initiatives within and between International Organizations.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Transparency:</strong> <em>Are the data and model’s mechanisms publicly available for validation?</em> The validation of models and data sources is crucial for accuracy verification, iteration and improvement. Many organizations provide environmental data that is fully open-source and make publicly available mechanisms of its models and its assumptions. Backtesting methodologies are crucial to ensure continuous iteration and improvement of data models.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Usability:</strong> <em>Can the data and model be used easily and efficiently?</em> Environmental data and climate change indicators need to be fully accessible and easy to understand by the public. Clearly labeled colors and user friendly fonts are an important strategy for usability.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Accessibility:</strong> <em>Can the data and model be understood and used by a broad audience, irrespective of scientific and other capabilities?</em> Environmental degradation and global warming depends on the cumulative behavior of individuals. As a broader understanding of environmental models and indicators could result in huge success or failures, models must use language and visuals that are simple in order to ensure accurate understanding. For example, the OECD provides <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/green-talks-live.htm">videos and webinars</a> related to environmental topics and targeting global audiences.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Universality:</strong> <em>Do data and the model draw on inputs that are defined and measured consistently?</em> As the impact of environmental-related behaviors have broader effects, what happens across artificial political boundaries matters across the globe. Therefore, standardization and consistency in measuring environmental indicators allows a universal understanding of global warming. For example, the IPCC provides complete global climate data and scenarios for environmental changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Adaptability:</strong> <em>Can the model be modified and adapted? </em>Efforts to provide useful and updated global environmental data demonstrates adaptability of environmental datasets to changes in climate change indicators and environmental policies implemented by policymakers. For example, <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-science-and-policy/mendeley-datasets">Mendeley Datasets for Environmental Science and Policy</a> enables researchers to deposit any research data (such as raw and processed data, mechanisms and methods) associated with their research manuscripts.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Actionability:</strong> <em>Does the model </em><em>direct stakeholders to clear next steps and action items?</em> Models that fail to provide action items may contribute to confusion or actions that violate environmental standards. In contrast, environmental models that provide clear actionable implications can contribute to wider positive effects. The environment portal of the OECD helps countries design and implement effective policies to address environmental problems and sustainably manage natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>To Sum Up…</strong></p>
<p>Environmental and climate change models need to fulfill the suggested considerations in order to provide scientific researchers with actionable, behavior-changing, and even life-saving information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-drinking-straw-gold-silver-russia">Gold and silver tubes in a Russian museum are the oldest known drinking straws</a></h4>

              
                <p>Eight silver and gold tubes held in a Russian museum have long been thought to have been either ceremonial staffs or canopy supports. In reality, the long tubes are the oldest surviving drinking straws, researchers say.</p>



<p>People used <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2021.22">these high-end straws</a> to drink beer from a communal vessel more than 5,000 years ago, conclude archaeologist Viktor Trifonov of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg and colleagues. Excavations in 1897 in what’s now Armenia uncovered the metal tubes, jewelry and other goods in a burial mound containing three individuals from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/maikop-treasure-given-museum">Maikop culture</a>, which dates to between about 5,700 and 4,900 years ago (<em>SN: 6/7/30</em>).</p>



<p>Each slender tube extends for just over one meter. Four of the finds include a gold or silver bull figurine, punctured by a hole so that it could be slid up and down the tube. Meanings attributed to straws with or without figurines are unknown, Trifonov’s group says.</p>

<p>Residue from the inner surface of one tube, near its tapered tip, contains barley starch granules, cereal particles from a wild or domesticated plant and a pollen grain from a lime tree, the scientists report in the February <em>Antiquity</em>. Those may have been ingredients of a flavored beer, though <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-beer-brewing-malt-grains-europe">further work needs to confirm that the barley remains show fermentation damage</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Maikop people, who inhabited southern Russia and southeastern Europe, probably had cultural ties to Sumerians living near the Persian Gulf, the researchers say. More than 4,000-year-old Sumerian carvings show people using long straws to drink from communal vessels.</p>



<p>Beer brewing began as early as around 13,000 years ago in the Middle East. And seal impressions on clay tablets dating to roughly 7,000 years ago in Iraq and Iran depict people drinking with straws.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beetle-fly-fast-wing-bristles-stroke-tiny-featherwing">These tiny beetles fly fast thanks to wing bristles and a weird, wide stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Featherwing beetles are some of the world’s smallest flying insects. Yet they can rocket along with the speed and agility of much larger insects. Now, scientists have figured out how the beetles do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wide wing stroke combined with lightweight, bristled wings allow the beetles <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04303-7">to efficiently propel themselves through the air</a>, researchers report online January 19 in <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some species of featherwing beetles are particularly tiny; two of the insects set end to end would barely reach a credit card’s thickness. At such small sizes, the air is viscous and air friction becomes a serious obstacle to flight. But previous research from entomologist Alexey Polilov of Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia and colleagues showed that the insects can fly at speeds comparable to that of beetles three times as large.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polilov and his team investigated this flying prowess further, studying one of the smallest featherwing beetles, <em>Paratuposa placentis</em>, using high-speed video and computational simulations.</p>





<p>The beetle’s style of beating its wings is unlike anything previously described, the team found. Its wings make a wide, figure-eight pattern, clapping together at the top of their upstroke to reduce drag and meeting again at the bottom of the downstroke. This wide motion gives the beetle extra power to push through the air.</p>



<p>Crucially, the beetle’s wings are made of bristles. Because of the air friction at these small sizes, those bristles allow the wings to have the flapping power of wings made of membranes, like those of a housefly, but for a lot less mass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“The bristled wing rows almost as well [as membranous wings] without letting much air through, like the feather of a bird,” Polilov says.&nbsp;Video recordings of some other featherwing beetles show they have a similar flying style, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The beetles’ ancestors were larger than their modern kin. The findings give insights into how insects can retain important athletic abilities as they scale down in size.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A new catalyst has been found to be a valuable and cost-effective method for eliminating the dye, methylene blue, from water. Dyes are harmful pollutants released by the textile, food, and leather industries. When released into water, such as rivers, they can reduce sunlight transmission for photosynthesis, harm aquatic ecosystems, and impact public health. Methylene blue is a dye typically used for dyeing wool and silk. Several techniques have previously been developed for environmental dye pollution treatment, however, these methods are not suitable for industries operating on a small scale, due to high costs. Researchers in South Africa have developed a nanomaterial to enhance the degradation of methylene blue dye under light. The nanomaterials were found to effectively degrade methylene blue dye within 150 minutes, making them possible candidates for effective environmental pollution treatment. </span></p>

Researchers at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">University of North Florida </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">investigated the evolution of tardigrades and found that loss of &#8216;Wnt&#8217; genes may be related to their simplified development, anatomy, and miniaturization. Wnt genes code for molecules called ligands that activate signaling pathways for the animal’s development. The researchers suggest that the loss of several Wnt genes could be related to a reduced number of cells and simplified development that has helped these creatures to become almost immortal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regular, voluntary, shelter-wide testing for COVID-19 was found to be feasible in a homeless shelter in Germany. Living conditions in homeless shelters can facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Social factors and pre-existing health conditions also put homeless people more at risk of experiencing severe disease. COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters have resulted in high infection levels amongst residents and staff. Researchers at the Charité Institute of Tropical Medicine and International Health carried out a study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter in Berlin. Shelter staff supported with PCR testing weekly testing of residents and the testing process was evaluated through group discussions and questionnaires. Shelter staff perceived the testing to be valuable and a good experience, but work-intensive. The researchers recommended a flexible approach to implementing shelter-wide testing, accounting for community levels of transmission, available resources, and local recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Higher levels of family support were associated with reductions in the risk of sleep dysfunction, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality, in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults. Evidence suggests that LGB adults experience more sleep problems than the general population. Family support can play an important role in supporting the health and wellbeing of individuals and lack of family support has been associated with poorer sleep quality. LGB individuals are particularly at risk of experiencing lower family support. Researchers at the University of Toronto statistically analyzed UK longitudinal data that included 1703 LGB individuals. The researchers also found that support from a friend as a proxy for family did not diminish the effects of low family support on sleep problems. Future programmes to support LGB individuals with sleep problems could include examination of family support to inform the best route of care. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ‘one-stop’ gynecological cancer ultrasound clinic was found to be highly effective in the management of patients referred for ovarian cancer screening. Approximately, 7000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in the UK. Women in England with abdominal pain and bloating frequently have certain protein levels checked to screen for ovarian cancer. This has led to a significant rise in referrals to ovarian cancer services. To help manage demand, ‘one-stop’ clinics have been designed to manage referral demand, and facilitate quicker diagnosis and patient-centered care. In these clinics, patients will often be offered a consultation with a gynecology specialist and some also offer an ultrasound examination. Researchers carried out a retrospective review of a service in Northampton, UK, to examine the efficiency of one of these services. The service effectively provided a same-day full assessment, definitive diagnosis, and management plan to referred patients. Almost two-thirds of patients could be discharged back to primary care for repeat follow-up tests on the same day of their initial appointment. To further support the effectiveness of these services, the researchers suggest that ultrasound scan facilities should be rolled out to all one-stop gynecological cancer clinics. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disinfectant-sawdust-kill-deadly-microbes-sustainable">A disinfectant made from sawdust mows down deadly microbes</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new, sustainable disinfectant made from sawdust and water can knock out more than 99 percent of some disease-causing microbes, including anthrax and several strains of flu.</p>



<p>Widespread use of some disinfectants can cause environmental harms. For instance, chlorine-containing ones, such as bleach, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution">can form dangerous by-products</a> when they react with other molecules (<em>SN: 11/25/18</em>). Some other potentially greener disinfectants rely on a compound called phenol or its chemical lookalikes, but they can be costly and energy-intensive to make.</p>



<p>Phenolic structures abound in wood, however, as part of the large, branching molecules that make up plant cell walls. So environmental engineer Shicheng Zhang of Fudan University in Shanghai and colleagues wondered if sawdust waste could provide a greener source of antimicrobial compounds.</p>



<p>The researchers cooked mixtures of water and sawdust for one hour under pressure and filtered them. Then the team tested the sawdust concoctions for their prowess at killing off the microbes <em>Staphylococcus epidermis</em>, a skin microbe that can cause infections in immunocompromised people, and <em>E. coli</em>, a gut microbe that can cause foodborne illness<em>. </em>Depending on a disinfectant’s concentration, it could zap more than 99 percent of the microbes, the team reports in the Jan. 18 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>The disinfectant was similarly successful <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/3/e2106843119">at inactivating anthrax and influenza viruses</a>, the researchers found<em>.</em> It may also be potent against spores, a dormant form of bacteria that can be difficult to kill. Experiments showed it could inactivate the spores of a typically harmless bacteria, <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>.</p>



<p>A chemical analysis revealed that the sawdust-based soup contains high concentrations of phenol-like compounds. The pressure cooker treatment probably breaks the wood’s molecular chains, freeing up antimicrobial phenolic molecules.</p>



<p>Under a microscope, the scientists saw that their disinfectant damaged the cell walls of <em>E. coli</em> and <em>S. epidermis</em>. The phenolic compounds may also damage the proteins and genetic material of bacteria and viruses, Zhang says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many of us &#8220;treat&#8221; a bad night’s sleep with a couple of cups of coffee the next morning. But just how much does caffeine really help? Research shows that it makes a big difference to tasks that require &#8220;vigilant attention&#8221;, or continuous monitoring. One theory even holds that the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation are underpinned by impairments in attention, and this implies that caffeine could be a general cure for sleep-deprivation ills. However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-46303-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em> suggests that this is not the case. Caffeine indeed restored vigilant attention to regular levels in sleep-deprived participants. But it had barely any impact on another type of performance that is important for all kinds of jobs.</p>



<span id="more-45092"></span>



<p>Michelle E. Stepan at the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues studied 276 students with normal sleep habits. They came into the lab in the evening to complete two tasks. The first was a simple computer-based visual vigilance task — a red circle appeared on the screen at random intervals and every time they saw it, they had to click a mouse. If they took longer than 500ms to respond to a circle, this was counted as a lapse in attention.</p>



<p>The second task measured what’s called &#8220;place-keeping&#8221;. In this study, the participants had to keep track of where they were in a seven-step screen-based task. The participants were initially trained in how to complete the steps correctly, in the right order, and then expected to remember this information. Every so often, they were interrupted part-way through a sequence and asked to complete another brief task. They then went back to the original task. To resume correctly, and complete the steps in the right order, they had to remember where they’d broken off. The researchers counted the number of mistakes that they made.</p>



<p>After this, some participants were sent home to sleep as normal while the others were kept awake overnight in the lab. The next morning, the sleepers came back in, and all were given a capsule that contained either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. Then they completed a second round of visual vigilance and place-keeping tests.</p>



<p>The differences in the results were clear. Sleep deprivation (without caffeine) impaired performance on both tasks, as expected. With caffeine, though, sleep-deprived people did just as well on the visual vigilance task as those who’d had a good night’s sleep (without morning caffeine). Caffeine clearly worked very well to fix this particular deficit. (Though those who’d slept and consumed caffeine did best of all.)</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t the case for the place-keeping task. A few did get some benefit from caffeine — the people who were worst at the task. But most of the sleep-deprived participants did not. For the majority, caffeine did not affect the cognitive processes needed for place-keeping.</p>



<p>The work implies that the theory that all of the cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation can be explained by impaired attention is wrong. And the team now calls for more work to get at exactly how a lack of sleep interferes with various types of cognitive processes.</p>



<p>But there’s an important practical message, too. Remembering where you are in a sequence of key steps, so that you can complete a procedure properly, is important in jobs everywhere from factories to hospitals. While caffeine does indeed help with simple attention, it could be a potentially dangerous mistake to think that it can fix sleep-deprivation deficits in performing this type of task, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pyroclastic-flow-volcano-destruction-eruption">Volcanic avalanches of rock and gas may be more destructive than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Avalanches of ash, gas and rock that cascade downhill during volcanic eruptions may be even more dangerous than scientists had realized.</p>



<p>Pulses of high pressure form within these slides, known as pyroclastic flows, as a result of turbulence, laboratory and field measurements show. Those pressures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27517-9">can be far stronger</a>, and more destructive, than hazard assessments typically assume, researchers report December 15 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s not a small difference,” says Gert Lube, a volcanologist at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Conventional hazard assessments might suggest a certain flow will only burst windows, he says, “when actually, the pressures are so strong, they knock down the walls of the building.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-deadliest-volcanoes-and-how-they-kill">Pyroclastic flows</a> are the deadliest volcanic hazard (<em>SN: 6/5/18</em>), in part because of the pressures they generate. Due to their violent nature, researchers often have to estimate average obstacle-smashing pressures in the flows using computer simulations based on measurements of geologic deposits left by past flows.</p>

</div><figcaption>At Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, researchers released mixtures of hot rock, ash and gas down a channel to replicate volcanic avalanches known as pyroclastic flows. These pyroclastic flows have an internal rhythm that makes them especially destructive, a new study suggests.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To directly study the inner workings of these forces of nature, Lube and colleagues reproduced smaller versions of the flows in experiments, measuring destructive factors like particle velocities and flow densities and temperatures. That let the team calculate the pressures inside the flows. The researchers also analyzed the first measurements of pressures in natural flows, collected in 2019, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-deadly-2019-eruption-new-zealand-satellite-data-monitoring">pyroclastic flows burst from the Whakaari volcano</a> and engulfed a set of infrasound sensors (<em>SN: 6/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>To the researchers’ surprise, pressures in the flows oscillated rhythmically, as volcanic particles clustered into cascading waves and trains of rolling eddies. These pressure pulses would successively damage obstacles like blows from a jackhammer, Lube says. The pulses sometimes smashed more than three times as hard as the average pressure estimates typically suggested by conventional hazard-gauging simulations.</p>



<p>Many hazard assessments are probably drastically underestimating pyroclastic flows’ destructiveness, Lube says. “It’s a big wake-up call.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-digital-health-publishes-first-papers/">PLOS Digital Health publishes first papers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Note: PLOS published the following press release on January 18, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that PLOS<em> Digital Health</em> published its initial cohort of papers. PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and PLOS<em> Digital Health</em> is the second of these journals with papers ready for publication. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to drive transformation in the delivery of equitable and unbiased healthcare through ethically conducted, impactful and immediately accessible research. The journal will accept papers from our diverse community of researchers, which will include engineers, social scientists and industry leaders among others. The journal has so far received nearly 150 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;More relevant than contributing to the field of digital health, I hope <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> will spearhead a movement among journals to take a more proactive role in diversifying the research community and re-drawing the unequal map of the medical knowledge system,&rdquo; said Editor-in-Chief, Leo Anthony Celi, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>. &ldquo;We cannot address health disparities without tackling knowledge inequalities between rich and poor countries.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;<em>PLOS Digital Health</em> centers Open Science practices; for example, preprinting, open data and open code,&rdquo; said Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS. &ldquo;Embedding Open Science practices in emerging fields like digital health ensures their outputs can be relied upon to drive positive change in healthcare.&rdquo;</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond the article processing charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. <em>PLOS Digital Heath</em> utilizes our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee model</a>. PLOS will waive the annual fee if a member institution is in a <a href="http://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/">Research4Life country</a>. Our existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>Our current Editorial Board is composed of more than 30 editors representing 15 countries, including 12 Section Editors, and reflects PLOS&rsquo; commitments towards building diverse, equitable and inclusive editorial boards. PLOS Digital Health&rsquo;s nearly 150 submissions came from 33 countries.</p>



<p>Here are links to three of the 10 papers that <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> just published, as well as two opinion pieces and one Review:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/contributorship/">What author order can (and cannot) tell us: Understanding contributorship</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a> </p>



<p>Welcome back to the second in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=academic-contributions">three-part series</a> on academic credit. In this post, we focus on identifying researchers&rsquo; specific contributions to a research project, and explore how those contributions are reflected on a published paper. Authorship is central to the reward system of science and directly impacts each researchers&rsquo; career prospects. Yet standards for allocating authorship are variable, and often opaque. What types of contributions merit inclusion on an author list? How are we to understand the contributions of each researcher who is included on the list?</p>



<h2>Identifying specific author contributions</h2>



<p>In the biological and medical sciences, the degree of public credit a researcher receives for a publication is based on their position within the author list. While the significance of author order varies across disciplines and cultures, traditionally, there are two highly valued and much-coveted positions: first author, credited with conceptualizing and executing the central parts of the study, and last author, occupying the most senior, supervisory position. That can be problematic, because it does not provide a consistent and fair way to acknowledge the essential contributions of midlist authors. An average author list cannot communicate, for example, who developed critical methods, collected the data, ran the analysis, or wrote the first draft. In some cases, an author list may also include honorary authors, either as an expression of esteem, in an attempt to leverage a famous name, or because the honorary author has asked to be included in all publications within their sphere.</p>



<p>The inadequacy of the author list as a vehicle for expressing author contribution is also evident in team science. As research becomes increasingly cross-disciplinary and complex, in many cases, it&rsquo;s no longer possible for one person to lead and execute all aspects of a study. In team science, instead of organizing themselves hierarchically, researchers work together, with two or more equal partners taking on the responsibilities of a senior researcher within their specific areas of expertise, for example data collection and stewardship, statistics and design, coding, or methodological development. Our systems for allocating and representing academic credit have not kept pace with the ways researchers work today.</p>



<p>The importance and yet the ambiguity of the author list creates, at the very least, inaccurate and unfair perceptions about the contributions and capabilities of the researchers involved. It can also conceal bias and work to keep researchers from under-represented groups in midlist, junior roles. Because the allocation of credit is so central to how a research scientist is perceived, and to the future of their career, a fair and accurate representation of each author&rsquo;s contribution is vital.</p>



<h2>Solution: Tracking <em>all </em>author contributions with CRediT</h2>



<p><a href="https://casrai.org/credit/">CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)</a> is a universal, community-developed open classification system that uses 14 different roles to describe the aspects of scientific authorship, from conceptualization to review and editing. Each author listed on a manuscript is assigned one or more taxonomic roles. Role assignments appear on the final published research article and are encoded into article meta-data where they can be harvested by databases and indexers.</p>



<p>The granularity of the CRediT taxonomy diminishes the importance of author order. For example, tenure applicants need not be evaluated on how many times they were listed as first author, but on their specific contributions to each work. The CRediT taxonomy also reinforces the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship?utm_source=plos&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=plos-1607-credit">author qualification guidelines</a> by clearly highlighting instances of honorary authorship to authors at submission, giving them the opportunity to pause and consider the composition of their author list.</p>



<p>The CRediT taxonomy distinguishes itself from other, publisher- or discipline-specific author taxonomies in that it is both broadly applicable within the sciences and widely accepted, enabling it to establish norms and shared understanding across publishers, funders, and universities.</p>



<p>PLOS was part of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/508312a">working group</a> that originally developed and tested the CRediT taxonomy. When the system was <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/">finalized</a>, PLOS transitioned from our previous, publisher-specific taxonomy to the new tool.</p>



<h2 id="video">A meta-analysis of the CRediT taxonomy</h2>



<p>CRediT has opened new avenues for meta-research, enabling scientists to better understand not only how each other contributed to the work, but to begin to identify and interpret patterns in contributorship that expose larger truths about the way science operates, and can point the way toward more efficient, robust and inclusive scientific practices. In the video below, we chat with Dr Cassidy Sugimoto and Dr Vincent Larivi&egrave;re about their recent study &ldquo;Investigating the division of scientific labor using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)&rdquo; and discuss ideas for future studies.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h3>More opportunities for authorship</h3>



<p>As the CRediT taxonomy helps to illustrate, writing articles is just one small part of conducting research. In addition to properly allocating credit for traditional research articles and peer review, Open Science also offers new opportunities to surface, share, and receive credit for more of the research process, including both open data and open methods, such as Registered Reports, Lab and Study Protocols, Methods Research Articles, and linked code. Sharing these research outputs as stand-alone resources allows them to accumulate citations in their own right, independent of the main research article, and increases discoverability by creating more points of entry. At the same time, making research artifacts public enhances trust in related research articles. Over time, a pattern of openness can help to build a reputation for high-quality research, collaborative sharing, and leadership.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/acknowledging-reviewers/">next post</a> in this series, we&rsquo;ll discuss the importance of peer review, and how we can better acknowledge and reward the contributions peer reviewers make to published research.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on our collective mental health, from its effects on the experience of postnatal depression among <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/08/rates-of-postnatal-depression-among-new-mothers-rose-sharply-during-lockdown/">new mothers</a> to the ongoing impact of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/09/first-hand-reports-of-brain-fog-highlight-struggles-of-those-living-with-long-covid/">post-Covid brain fog</a>. Research has also looked at what might remedy some of these negative effects — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/03/during-lockdown-meaningful-activity-is-more-fulfilling-than-simply-staying-busy/">engaging in meaningful activity</a>, for example, or making changes in our lives to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/02/coping-with-remote-working-during-covid-19-the-latest-research-digested/">feel more in control</a>.</p>



<p>Umair Akram and colleagues explore another potential technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00857-8">in their paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> —looking at memes. They find that pandemic-related memes could provide one coping mechanism for people experiencing anxiety, with anxious people more likely to find them funny, relatable, and shareable. </p>



<span id="more-45067"></span>



<p>First, the team showed participants 45 of the highest rated memes from the subreddit <a href="http://reddit.com/r/coronavirusmemes">/Coronavirusmemes</a>, each of which depicted an image with a short, humorous caption related to the pandemic. On a scale from 1 to 5, participants indicated how negative, relatable, funny, offensive and shareable each meme was. They then completed a measure of symptoms of anxiety and indicated whether any friends or family had been unwell with coronavirus.</p>



<p>The participants also completed a scale assessing what emotional regulation strategies they use, measuring the extent to which they use “cognitive appraisal” — changing the way they think about a situation — and “expressive suppression” — changing behaviour in response to emotional events.</p>

From <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00857-8">Akram <em>et al</em> (2021)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ratings of the memes did not differ across demographic categories — there was no difference by age, gender, or whether anyone close to them had had coronavirus. But when comparing anxious and non-anxious participants, there was a big difference. More anxious participants rated the memes as funnier, more relatable and more shareable, though there was no difference between these two groups when it came to how positive or negative or offensive they found them.</p>



<p>Browsing r/CoronavirusMemes, you start to see why someone experiencing anxiety might relate to these memes. Many of them discuss isolation, loneliness, death, and illness — so someone who is feeling something distressing could find some comfort in their equally dark themes. Despite this, however, participants did not rate the images as negative. The team suggests that there may have been an emotional blunting towards these themes — because we were deluged with (mostly bad) news about the virus, this plus the humour of the images may have dulled their negative themes.</p>



<p>In fact, the researchers suggest that it’s possible the memes could act as a coping mechanism. By making light of a serious event, negative experiences can be reappraised, making them less anxiety inducing. And the fact that memes are shared online facilitates a feeling of peer support: the comforting idea that we are all in this together.</p>



<p>This suggestion may need deeper exploration. Humour can certainly serve as a balm in difficult times — previous research has found a similar pattern, with people with depression <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/14/people-with-depression-may-find-sad-memes-funnier-and-more-uplifting/">finding sad memes</a> funnier and more uplifting. But looking at a meme is likely to be a momentary experience and may not do much for long-term anxiety or depression. Looking at ways to incorporate humour into coping strategies or other treatments warrants further research.</p>

                <p>Around 1900 B.C., a student in the Sumerian city of Nippur, in what’s now Iraq, copied a multiplication table onto a clay tablet. Some 4,000 years later, that schoolwork survives, as do the student’s errors (10 times 45, for example, is definitely not 270). The work is a reminder that no matter how elegant or infallible mathematics may seem, it’s still a human endeavor.</p>



<p>That’s one lesson I took from “<a href="https://history-of-mathematics.org/">History of Mathematics</a>,” an online exhibit developed by the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City and Wolfram Research, a computational technology company. Bringing together the Sumerian tablet and more than 70 other artifacts, the exhibit demonstrates how math has been a universal language across cultures and throughout time.</p>



<p>Divided into nine “galleries,” the exhibit sums up the development of key topics related to mathematics, including counting, arithmetic, algebra, geometry and prime numbers. Each gallery has a short timeline and features a handful of artifacts that serve as entry points to explore some milestones in more depth.</p>







<p>Among the highlights: The oldest known surviving calculating device, the Salamis Tablet, is a marble counting board from the Greek island of Salamis dating to 300 B.C. It’s a precursor to the abacus. By moving pebbles across the board, a person could perform calculations. An early documented instance of using a symbol for “zero” as a placeholder (to, say, distinguish 1 from 10, 100 or 1,000) appears in the Bakhshali Manuscript, an Indian text dating to perhaps as early as A.D. 300. The manuscript’s black dots eventually morphed into the open circles we know today as zeros. Also on display is <em>Al-Jabr</em>. Written in around 820 by Persian polymath Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, the book established the field of algebra and gave the discipline its name. In 1557, the <em>Whetstone of Witte</em>, an English algebra text, introduced the modern equal symbol.</p>



<p>But the exhibit is more than just a collection of fun facts. As the galleries explain, humans’ relationship with numbers goes back deep into prehistory. Modern math, however, stems from the rise of cities, with the need to keep track of people and supplies, and to undertake ever more complex construction projects.</p>



<p>Some mathematical principles must have been so vital to civilization’s success that they appeared in many ancient cultures. Take the Pythagorean theorem. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century B.C., famously related the side lengths of a right triangle in the equation a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. But a clay tablet reveals that people in Mesopotamia had worked out the relationship more than 1,000 years earlier. Ancient Chinese and Indian scholars were also familiar with the relationship.</p>

<p>Other math problems have had multiple solutions. The history of counting is littered with an array of methods for keeping track of numbers, from various forms of finger counting to the stringed recording devices called quipus, or khipus, used in the Inca Empire in the 1400s and 1500s. The placement and types of knots along a quipu’s strings indicate different numerical values, though researchers today are still trying to understand exactly how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/khipus-knotted-cords-incas-taxes">to interpret the data recorded on these devices</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>Parts of the exhibit assume a high level of mathematical knowledge, such as some of the interactive features that give technical explanations behind some artifacts’ mathematical principles. But a section of “learning journeys” aimed at “kids and others” provides materials that fill in some of the missing details from the main galleries and will appeal to adults whose memories of high school or college math are fuzzy.</p>



<p>“History of Mathematics” is a fascinating starting point for anyone interested in learning about the origins of the mathematical concepts that so many of us use every day but often take for granted. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">Scientists vacuumed animal DNA out of thin air for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a dreary winter day in December of 2020, ecologist Elizabeth Clare strolled through the Hamerton Zoo Park in England wielding a small vacuum pump. She paused outside of animal enclosures, holding aloft a flexible tube attached to the machine. Her mission: suck animal DNA out of thin air.</p>



<p>The ability to sniff out animals’ airborne genetic material has been on scientists’ wish list for over a decade. DNA collected from water has been used to track aquatic species, including salmon and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-dna-census-oceans">sharks</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/18</em>). Scientists knew they could use environmental DNA, or eDNA, in the air to monitor land-based species — if only they could trap it. Now, researchers have done just that by using vacuums, two independent groups report January 6 in <em>Current Biology.</em></p>



<p>“It’s such a crazy idea,” says Clare, of York University in Toronto. “We’re vacuuming DNA out of the sky.”</p>



<p>The idea came to Clare, who did the work while at Queen Mary University of London, during a previous experiment in which she sampled air outside naked mole rat burrows. At the zoo, Clare and colleagues ran the vacuum pump for half-hour sessions in and around animal enclosures, collecting 72 samples from 20 sites. Then, the team took the material ensnared in the pump’s filter back to the lab for analysis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another team at the University of Copenhagen was unknowingly chasing the same idea. Biologist Kristine Bohmann and colleagues sought to trap airborne DNA at the Copenhagen Zoo using tiny fans similar to the ones that cool down computers. The team also experimented with a vacuum. Deploying their contraptions between 30 minutes and 30 hours at the tropical house, stables and in open air, the researchers found that both the fan and vacuum method collected ample animal DNA.</p>



<p>“It was so much fun,” Bohmann says. “It felt like we could just play around and be creative.”</p>





<p>To test the technique, both teams used a zoo for its roster of animals. Air in the wild could host DNA from unpredictable places, but at zoos, the researchers could cross-reference the captured airborne DNA with animals listed in exhibits. That allowed the scientists to confirm the source of the DNA, and see how far it traveled between enclosures.</p>





<p>Bohmann and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221016900">identified 49 different vertebrate species in the Copenhagen Zoo</a>. They detected animals living in the sampled enclosures, such as okapis (<em>Okapia johnstoni</em>) in the stables and a Dumeril’s ground boa (<em>Acrantophis dumerili</em>) in the rainforest house. But the researchers also picked up on mammals and birds from surrounding exhibits as well as fish used as food. “That was quite surprising,” Bohmann says.</p>



<p>At the Hamerton zoo, Clare’s team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222101650X">identified 25 different species</a>, including not only targeted zoo residents, but also unexpected ones. In the dingo enclosure, the team detected DNA from meerkats (<em>Suricata suricatta</em>) that live 245 meters away.&nbsp;</p>

Clare</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Zoo outsiders also turned up in each team’s results. Clare’s team detected the European hedgehog (<em>Erinaceus europaeus)</em>, which is endangered in England, while Bohmann’s group picked up on mice and domesticated dogs. They caught whiffs of human DNA too.</p>



<p>Sucking DNA from the air could be a noninvasive way to identify where endangered species have been by picking up on their genetic footprints, Bohmann says. The method would be an upgrade from camera traps, which work only when critters wander by, she says.</p>



<p><a></a>Neither team knew the other was working on the same concept. They got in touch after seeing an early version of each other’s studies on a preprint server. Clare describes it as “the most enormous scientific coincidence” of either of their lives. The teams chose to publish their studies together to corroborate each other’s results and further the adoption of their emerging ideas.</p>



<p>Just how this proof-of-concept technology will translate in the field is unclear. Airborne eDNA in the wild is more dispersed, and detection may be impacted by environmental factors such as weather and wind. But just as aquatic eDNA has progressed over the last decade, so too will airborne eDNA, Clare says. “I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing other people go out and use the technique.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-smell-taste-gene-genetic">A genetic analysis hints at why COVID-19 can mess with smell</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many people, one of the fastest tip-offs that they have COVID-19 is the loss of taste or smell. Now researchers have pinpointed some genetic variants in people that may make it more likely that the coronavirus might rob them of these senses.</p>



<p>A study of nearly 70,000 adults with COVID-19 found that individuals with certain genetic tweaks on chromosome 4 were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00986-w">11 percent more likely to lose the ability to smell or taste</a> than people without the changes, researchers report January 17 in <em>Nature Genetics</em>. The data come from people who’d had their DNA analyzed by genetic testing company 23andMe and self-reported a case of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Two genes, <em>UGT2A1 </em>and <em>UGT2A2</em>, that help people smell reside in the region of chromosome 4 linked to sensory loss during infection, epidemiologist Janie Shelton of 23andMe and colleagues found. Both genes make enzymes that metabolize substances called odorants, which produce distinctive smells.</p>

<p>Studies suggest that loss of smell, a hallmark symptom of COVID-19, stems from infections taking hold in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-sense-smell-brain-nerve-cells">smell-supporting cells</a> called sustentacular cells (<em>SN: 6/12/20</em>). It’s possible that the genetic variants near <em>UGT2A1 </em>and <em>UGT2A2</em> could affect how the two genes are turned on or off to somehow mess with smell during an infection, Shelton says.</p>



<p>The team combined loss of smell and taste in one survey question so the study can’t parse whether the genetic variants are involved in the loss of one sense over the other. “When you lose your sense of smell, often your taste is highly diminished,” Shelton says. Taste can also go away without loss of smell.</p>



<p>Some people have a sustained loss of smell, even after the coronavirus leaves their bodies, Shelton says. Understanding how the virus snuffs out sniffing ability could help researchers find ways to bring it back.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/17/conflicting-health-information-can-compromise-our-attention/">Conflicting health information can compromise our attention</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We get our information about health from many sources. Sometimes we seek advice from doctors or other medical professionals; sometimes we talk to friends or family; we read newspapers and watch TV; and we diagnose ourselves with rare and alarming afflictions with the help of the internet.</p>



<p>In some ways, this variety offers a democratisation of knowledge, a way for more of us to understand what’s going on with our health. But what happens when this information contradicts itself? This is the subject of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10865-021-00256-4">new study</a> from a team at Rutgers University, published in the <em>Journal of Behavioral Medicine.</em></p>



<span id="more-45053"></span>



<p>Participants were first asked to read an article focused on whole grain intake and the health benefits of such food. In one condition, participants were shown positions on the topic that were congruent, reading that experts agreed whole grains were indeed healthy. In the other condition, participants read that experts disagreed about whether there were positive outcomes from eating whole grains.</p>



<p>They then took part in a game designed to test attention, in which they had to indicate as quickly as possible the direction of a target arrow, displayed among distractor arrows.</p>



<p>Following the game, participants rated how mentally demanding the task was, and indicated how confused they were about which foods are best to eat and how bored and tired they were of <em>hearing</em> about what foods are best to eat.</p>



<p>Those who had read conflicting health information had a lower correct response rate in the attention task than those who had read congruent information. These participants also took longer to respond to each stimuli during the trials, suggesting a decrease in cognitive processing speed. There was also a difference in how mentally demanding the task was for participants: those receiving conflicting information rated the game as being more work than those who did not. The team therefore suggests that the cognitive resources needed to process conflicting information can impact important attentional mechanisms.</p>



<p>Those who saw conflicting health information were also more likely to be confused by nutritional information, and had greater feelings of backlash towards nutritional information. This suggests that conflicting health information can not only tire us out and dull our responses but may also impact our behaviour, potentially putting us off from following advice about our health.</p>



<p>So how do we stop people from being overwhelmed by conflicting information? The team suggests that, in a clinical setting, health practitioners should seek to understand whether patients have been exposed to inconsistent messages, and help them clarify what they believe and why. More broadly, educational programmes that help people understand how best to analyse information could also ease some of the attentional demand of conflicting advice. And while we can’t prevent exposure to <em>all</em> forms of conflicting health information, the study may be one motivation to stop those anxiety-inducing Google self-diagnosis spirals.</p>
