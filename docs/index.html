                <p>Scientists are discovering a surprising bright side for some people with asthma: They are less susceptible to COVID-19.</p>



<p>The very same immune system proteins that trigger excess mucus production and closing of airways in people with <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2119680119">allergic asthma may erect a shield</a> around vulnerable airway cells, researchers report in the April 19 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding helps explain why people with allergic asthma seem to be less susceptible to COVID-19 than those with related lung ailments, and could eventually lead to new treatments for the coronavirus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by airway inflammation. The result is coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/most_recent_national_asthma_data.htm">8 percent of people in the United States have asthma</a>, with about <a href="https://www.aafa.org/allergic-asthma/">60 percent of them having allergic asthma</a>. Allergic asthma symptoms are triggered by allergens such as pollen or pet dander. Other types of asthma can be set off by exercise, weather or breathing in irritants such as strong perfumes, cleaning fumes or air pollution.</p>



<p>Usually, asthma is bad news when it comes to colds and flu. At the start of the pandemic, most experts predicted that coronavirus infections and asthma would be a dangerous mix, says Luke Bonser, a cell biologist at the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved in the study. And that is true for people whose asthma is not triggered by allergies and those with related lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Those conditions put people at high risk for severe COVID-19.</p>



<p>But as the pandemic progressed, researchers noticed that people with allergic asthma weren’t developing severe COVID-19 as often as expected. Here’s a look at why that may be.</p>



<h3>Protein protection</h3>



<p>What sets allergic asthma apart from other types of asthma and COPD is a protein called interleukin-13, or IL-13.</p>



<p>Usually, IL-13 helps the body fight off parasites such as worms. Certain T cells pump out the protein, and the body responds by churning out sticky mucus and constricting airways. This traps the worms, holding them in place until other immune system cells can come in for the kill.</p>



<p>“In the case of [allergic] asthma, the body is making a mistake. It’s mistaking a harmless substance, like pollen, for a worm,” says Burton Dickey, a pulmonologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston who was not involved in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But it wasn’t clear how IL-13 was protecting people with allergic asthma from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To find out, pathophysiologist Camille Ehre of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill and colleagues grew cells from the lining of the airways from six lung donors. Some of the cells were treated with IL-13 to mimic allergic asthma. Then the researchers infected some of the cells with SARS-CoV-2.</p>



<h3>Lawn trouble</h3>



<p>Next on the list of to-dos was to compare how cells that haven’t been treated with IL-13 behave when healthy and when infected with the coronavirus.</p>



<p>Uninfected cells grew in lawns resembling lush grasslands, where the tufts of waving fronds are actually hairlike protrusions called cilia, which grow from the tops of airway-lining cells, the team confirmed. Cilia’s motions help move mucus, and anything stuck in the mucus, out of the lungs.</p>

<p>Cells infected with the coronavirus looked much different. The lush lawn was now slathered in mucus, and bald spots appeared as infected cells died. The doomed cells get squeezed out of the lawn of cilia and inflate like a balloon. The inflation happens partly because chambers called vacuoles inside the infected cells get clogged with viruses. “It’s just filled with viruses, and then it gets kicked out of the club and it blows up and releases all these viruses,” Dickey says.</p>

<p>But not all the cells in the infected lawn were affected equally. Looking at the cells from the side, researchers could see that cells sporting cilia were infected with the coronavirus. But mucus-producing cells called goblet cells, which don’t have cilia, were rarely infected. That may be because a protein called ACE2 decorates the surface of ciliated cells far more often than it does goblet cells. ACE2 is the protein that the coronavirus uses as a door into cells.</p>

<h3>A sticky solution</h3>



<p>When researchers doused the cells with IL-13 before adding the coronavirus, the results were strikingly different.</p>



<p>The lawn of waving cilia atop the treated cells was mostly intact, with far fewer balloons of dying cells rising above the surface. But the fronds didn’t wave as vigorously as in untreated cells. That’s because IL-13 reduces cilia beating, the researchers found. &nbsp;Less active cilia could mean that virus-laden mucus sticks around longer. “That can be a double-edged sword inside the lungs because you want to clear the mucus, but you don’t want to spread it around,” Ehre says.</p>

<p>Counting cells under the microscope, the researchers saw that far fewer of the infected cells treated with IL-3 got the heave-ho. Whereas the untreated cells had ejected about 700 of their own by about four days after infection, only about 100 treated cells had gotten kicked out. The images showed that IL-13 really was protecting cells from infection. But how was still an unanswered question.</p>



<p>One thing that IL-13 does is stimulate airway-lining cells to churn out a type of sticky mucus that can trap viruses before they can infect cells. The team found that untreated cells released a burst of the mucus shortly after being infected with the coronavirus, depleting stores of the sticky stuff. But cells treated with IL-13 were still well-stocked with mucus.</p>

<p>All that extra mucus from the treated cells could ensnare viruses and expel them from the lungs before much damage is done. But people with nonallergic asthma and COPD make plenty of mucus too, and they aren’t protected from the virus. So Ehre and colleagues stripped away the mucus to see how the airway cells fared without this phlegmy trap.</p>



<p>Even without the mucus, IL-13 was still protective.</p>



<h3>Barricading the doors</h3>



<p>Examining patterns of gene activity, the team found that IL-13 was also causing cells to make less ACE2, the protein that SARS-CoV-2 commandeers as a gateway into cells. “It makes it much harder for the virus to find its door to enter the cells,” Ehre says.</p>



<p>That result agrees with previous findings from Bonser and colleagues. “Being able to replicate the same data in several different studies, that’s great,” he says. And the new study looks more closely into IL-13’s protective mechanism than previous research did.</p>



<p>Cells treated with IL-13 also turn down the activity of genes involved in making protein-producing factories called ribosomes, the researchers discovered. That may limit viral replication in cells. But some genes’ activity was also turned way up. That includes several genes involved in making keratan sulfate, a long, sugar-studded protein that is found in cartilage and the eyes’ corneas. “It’s there in the body to make a shield,” Ehre says.</p>



<p>That seems to be what it is doing for airway cells too. A thick layer of keratan sulfate developed on top of cells treated with IL-13, armoring them against a coronavirus infection.</p>

<p>Which of these protective mechanisms is most important, or if it’s a combination of all of them, is one of the many things left to explore, Ehre says. “This paper is not the final paper that figures everything out. There is way more work to do.”</p>



<p>Knowing even more details about how IL-13 works to protect against the coronavirus could lead to new treatments, Bonser says. But IL-13 itself probably will not be used as a drug because of the inflammation, excess mucus, cough and shortness of breath it triggers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the extra protection doesn’t mean that people with allergic asthma don’t have to be concerned about getting COVID-19, Dickey says. “People with asthma have had very bad outcomes. This is not a virus you want to take chances with,” he says. But it’s OK to bask on the bright side a little. “It’s not fun to have asthma, so you have to be grateful for every rare occasion where it does something useful.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">Ancient zircons may record the dawn of plate tectonics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s crust may have gone on the move roughly 3.8 billion years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A change in the chemistry of ancient zircon crystals from different bygone eras <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021AV000520">may be the earliest hint of subduction</a>, the sliding of one tectonic plate under another, researchers report in the April <em>AGU Advances.</em> This shift may mark the first steps of processes that would evolve into modern <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">plate tectonics on Earth</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Before then, early Earth may have donned a relatively immobile “protocrust,” such as observed on Venus today, the team says.</p>



<p>“Earth is actually quite distinct to other planets, in that it has plate tectonics,” says study coauthor Nadja Drabon, a geochemist at Harvard University. “We’re trying to figure out, when did it become so special?”</p>





<p>Geologists have long debated what <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remnants-earths-original-crust-preserve-time-plate-tectonics">Earth’s crust looked like during the Hadean Eon</a>, more than 4 billion years ago (<em>SN: 3/16/17</em>). One reason the debate has remained unresolved is that opportunities to investigate that distant past are scarce, as few rocks have survived the eons of tectonic activity.</p>



<p>But zircons — extremely resilient, bright gemstones — are renowned for their ability <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-billion-year-old-crystals-hint-lost-continents-fate">to last for billions of years</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/17</em>). Geologists know this because they can reliably estimate zircon ages by measuring how much uranium and lead is in the crystal. Growing zircons readily capture uranium but tend to exclude lead, so any lead found in zircon is assumed to have decayed from uranium. Geologists know that decay rate, which is based on uranium’s half-life, so they can estimate the zircons’ age.</p>



<p>What’s more, zircons provide clues about the environments in which they formed, as their growing lattices of zirconium, silica and oxygen capture tiny amounts of other elements from their surroundings.</p>



<p>Most of the world’s Hadean zircons have been found in a just a dozen sites, and most of those are from a site in Australia. But since 2018, Drabon and her colleagues have reported on a new source: the Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains in South Africa. Dozens of zircons collected from that region crystallized between 4.15 to 4 billion years ago, while thousands of others are at least 3.3 billion years old. The findings have provided the researchers with a new, roughly 800-million-year window into the past, straddling the end of the Hadean and the beginning of the Archean Eon.</p>



<p>For the new study, the researchers peered through that window by checking the zircons for trace elements—uranium, scandium, ytterbium, niobium and cerium—and also for different forms of oxygen and hafnium.</p>



<p>Prior to 3.8 billion years ago, most of the zircons contained quantities of different forms of hafnium through time that supported the existence of an old, stable protocrust. What’s more, these older zircons contained trace elements at levels that were similar to those found in zircons from Hawaii’s volcanic hotspot. There, new rock is created as a plume of molten material rises from Earth’s mantle and crystallizes — a process that could have operated in the absence of moving plates.</p>



<p>But in the zircons that formed after 3.8 billion years ago, the researchers found no more evidence of a protocrust, and many of the zircons contained trace element signatures resembling those found today at subduction zones.</p>



<p>That’s a fundamental shift, says Jennifer Kasbohm, a geochronologist at Yale University who was not involved in the study. “We really consider subduction to be essential for plate tectonics.”</p>



<p>Previous analyses of zircons from other places, such as Australia and India, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14857-1">have reported similar compositions</a>, the researchers note, suggesting that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-and-go-plate-tectonics">an early form of plate tectonics</a> may have become widespread by around 3.8 billion years ago (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Moving forward, Drabon plans to investigate if other minerals were trapped inside the zircons during their formation. If so, those hitchhiking bits might open even more windows into Earth’s early tectonic history.</p>

To social psychologists, nostalgia is good, “a meaning-providing resource [that] may serve an existential function” by helping us avoid thoughts of death (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103106001661" target="_blank">Routledge et al., 2008</a>). <br /></p><p>To cognitive neuroscience types, nostalgia is encapsulated in an fMRI experiment that compares brain responses to pictures of “nostalgic” objects (from childhood) vs. contemporary objects (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91322-z" target="_blank">Yang et al., 2021</a>).<span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span><br /><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDhKD3WJY5DiGJHhL_oYxUAX5hJFtWRXKuNu5UEHfgQ2LTH8KF3gD-Db8kK58fbBmL9_Lr2Tq1veP0vl0bdL4SHwlO8uARxFeTl2qWZE9oEJRnC7JV0n4i1_IiWK7cFzJjjLvvRrOs_gV3rsPymo1FqiYVtKGjTEMn_racJEWraLqFw1-f9w/s864/nostalgic%20chewing%20gum.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="346" data-original-width="864" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDhKD3WJY5DiGJHhL_oYxUAX5hJFtWRXKuNu5UEHfgQ2LTH8KF3gD-Db8kK58fbBmL9_Lr2Tq1veP0vl0bdL4SHwlO8uARxFeTl2qWZE9oEJRnC7JV0n4i1_IiWK7cFzJjjLvvRrOs_gV3rsPymo1FqiYVtKGjTEMn_racJEWraLqFw1-f9w/w400-h160/nostalgic%20chewing%20gum.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>In this post, my authority on cultural nostalgia is Svetlana Boym, who was the <a href="https://faculty.slavic.fas.harvard.edu/svetlana-boym/home" target="_blank">Curt Hugo Reisinger Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literatures</a> at Harvard, a Russian <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">émigré,</span></span> and an <a href="https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~boym/main.htm" target="_blank">extraordinary</a> thinker, writer, cultural theorist, and photographer. Her 2007 essay was adapted from her influential book, <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/svetlana-boym/the-future-of-nostalgia/9780465007080/" target="_blank"><i>The Future of Nostalgia</i></a> (2001). She viewed nostalgia as a manifestation of collective memory and longing, with two contrasting types. Reflective nostalgia is exemplified by the displacement of immigrants, who may long for a home that no longer exists (or perhaps never existed). Restorative nostalgia, on the other hand, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally" target="_blank">dangerous impulse</a> to return to a “pure” (or nationalistic) state of a distant past. Is it fair for psychologists to consider nostalgia as a private reminiscence devoid of a larger context?</p><p><br /></p><p><b>A Blast from the Past</b><br /></p><p>The reconciliation between these different views of nostalgia used to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7965609/" target="_blank">terror management theory</a> (TMT). In this theory, reminders of death (mortality salience) increase in-group favoritism and defense of one's own world view as a way to assuage existential fear. Thus, restorative nostalgia might be seen in the light (or darkness) of TMT. Indeed, instructing participants to write about a nostalgic event lessened mortality salience (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103106001661" target="_blank">Routledge et al., 2008</a>). However, TMT has <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/35271/168050/Many-Labs-4-Failure-to-Replicate-Mortality" target="_blank">failed to replicate</a> in several large studies, so there goes that idea (i.e., the link between social psychology experiments and restorative nostalgia, not the concept of restorative nostalgia itself).<br /></p><br /><p><b>Escape from the Pandemic</b></p><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/01/20/pandemic-memory-covid-2020-2021-2022/" target="_blank">COVID memory vortex</a> altered our perception of time and space and warped the horizon of past and future.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">How I decided on a second COVID-19 booster shot</a></h4>

              
                <p>Booster shots against COVID-19 are once again on my mind. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that older people and immunocompromised people are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-second-booster-dose-two-covid-19-vaccines-older-and">eligible for a second booster shot</a> provided it has been at least four months since their last shot. After I got over the shock of the FDA calling me “older” — meaning anyone 50 and up — I’ve been pondering whether to get a second booster (otherwise known as a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine, or third dose of any vaccine if you initially got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine), and if so, when.</p>



<p>Peter, a 60-year-old acquaintance who asked me not to use his last name to protect his privacy, told me he’s going to get a second booster, but not now. He’s holding out for fall and hoping for a variant-specific version of the vaccine. Right now, he and his wife “are vaxxed out,” he says. And he worries that getting boosted too often could hurt his immune system’s ability to respond to new variants. “I just think it’s the law of diminishing returns,” he says.</p>



<p>Lots of scientists and policy makers are thinking about these issues, too. For instance, last week an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/live-mtg-2022-4-20.html">met to discuss boosters</a>. And a bevy of studies about how well boosters work and how they affect the immune system have come out in recent weeks, some of them peer-reviewed, some still preliminary.</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In making my own decision, I wanted to know several things. First, does a second booster really provide additional protection from the coronavirus beyond what I got from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-choose">my first booster</a> (<em>SN: 11/8/21</em>)? Second, are there downsides to getting boosted again? And finally, if I’m going to do it, when should that be and which vaccine will I get?</p>



<p>To get a handle on the first question, I need to know how much protection the first booster actually gave me. I’m not immunocompromised, so there’s no reason for me to get an antibody test to see if I have enough of those defenders to fend off the coronavirus. I just have to assume that my immune system is behaving normally and that what’s true for others in my age group also goes for me.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How long does COVID-19 booster immunity last?</h4>



<p>Although the exact numbers vary, several studies have found that a third dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gave higher levels of protection against the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">omicron variant</a> than two doses did (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>). But that protection wanes after a few months.</p>



<p>Data from Israel, where some people have been getting fourth doses for months, suggest that a second booster does indeed bolster protection, but again only temporarily. In health care workers who got a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202542">fourth dose, antibody levels shot up</a> above levels achieved after the third jab, researchers reported April 7 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Vaccine effectiveness against infection was 30 percent with the Pfizer shot and 11 percent with Moderna. Both were better at preventing symptomatic disease, with Pfizer weighing in at 43 percent and Moderna at 31 percent. But those who did get infected produced high levels of the virus, suggesting they were contagious to others.</p>



<p>In a separate study published in the same journal, researchers looking at people 60 and older found that a fourth dose gave protection against both infection and severe disease, but the<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201570"> protection against infection began to decline after about five weeks</a>.</p>



<p>There’s more data on protection against severe illness from a study of more than 11,000 people admitted for COVID-19 to a hospital or emergency department in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health care system. At nine months after the second shot, two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00101-1/fulltext">31 percent effective</a> at keeping people out of the emergency room with omicron, researchers reported April 22 in <em>Lancet Respiratory Medicine</em>. The shots were 41 percent effective at preventing more severe illness resulting in hospitalizations from the omicron variant.</p>



<p>The third dose (first booster) bumped the effectiveness way up to 85 percent against hospitalization and 77 percent against ER visits, the team found. But the effect was temporary. By three months after the booster, effectiveness had declined to 55 percent against hospitalization and 53 percent against emergency room visits. The same jump in protection and quick waning from the first booster has also been noted in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1046488/S1482_Warwick_Omicron_5_1_2022.pdf">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.13.22272308v1.full.pdf">Qatar</a>.</p>



<p>It’s been about six months since my first booster shot, so any extra protection I got from it is probably gone by now. But will a fourth dose restore protection?</p>



<p>The CDC calculates that for every million people 50 and older who get a fourth dose of vaccine, 830 hospitalizations, 183 intensive care unit admissions and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-04-20/05-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">85 deaths could be prevented</a>. Those are impressive numbers, but many people think efforts should be focused more on getting still-unvaccinated people immunized instead of worrying about additional shots for the already vaxxed. CDC’s numbers support that. Because unvaccinated people are so vulnerable to the coronavirus, you would need to vaccinate just 135 people aged 50 and older with two shots to prevent one hospitalization. But already vaccinated people still have quite a bit of immunity, so you’d need to vaccinate 1,205 older people with a fourth dose to prevent one hospitalization.</p>





<h4>How does my health factor in?</h4>



<p>Of course, that’s data concerning populations. I and millions of others are trying to make individual calculations. “People need to make decisions based on their health condition as well as their exposure levels,” says Prakash Nagarkatti, an immunologist at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia. For instance, people whose jobs or other activities put them in contact with lots of people have higher exposure risks than someone who works at home. People who are older or have underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or lung, kidney, liver and heart diseases are all at higher risk. Those people might benefit from a shot now. “But if you’re 50 to 60 and very healthy, I don’t know if you need it right away,” Nagarkatti says. “You could maybe wait a few months.”</p>



<p>I’ve got some health risks that may make me more likely to get severely ill, and I have a couple of big events coming up this summer where I could get exposed to the virus. So getting boosted now to get a little bump in immunity that should last for a few months seems like a good idea. I’m also basing that decision about when to get a booster on what’s happening with the virus.</p>



<p>Case counts in my county are on the upswing. Nationally, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#variant-proportions">BA.2.12.1, a potentially even wilier subvariant </a>of the already slippery BA.2 omicron variant, is on the rise, making up almost 29 percent of cases in the week ending April 23. South Africa is experiencing a rise in cases caused by the <a href="https://twitter.com/TWenseleers/status/1518673358845620225">omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5</a>. It could be the start of a fifth wave of infection in that country, something researchers thought wouldn’t happen because so many people there were previously infected and vaccinated, Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said April 26 in a news briefing. “It has the flavor of, ‘Here we go, again,’” he said. “So much for the idea of herd immunity.”</p>



<h4>Are there any downsides to a second booster?</h4>



<p>But would I be harming my immune system if I get a booster shot now? Previous experience with vaccines against other viruses suggests repeated boosting isn’t always a good thing, Galit Alter, codirector of the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research said in the news briefing. For instance, in one HIV vaccine trial, people were boosted six times with the same protein. Each time their antibody levels went up, but the researchers found that the immune system was making nonfunctional, unhelpful antibodies that blocked the action of good ones. So far, that hasn’t happened with the COVID-19 vaccines, but it could be important to space out doses to prevent such a scenario.</p>



<p>Another worry for immunologists is <a href="https://www.jimmunol.org/content/202/2/335">original antigenic sin</a>. That has nothing to do with apples, serpents and gardens. Instead it happens when the immune system sees a virus or portion of the virus for the first time and trains memory cells to make antibodies against the virus. The next time the person encounters the virus or another version of it, instead of adding to the antibody arsenal, it continues to make only those original antibodies.</p>

</aside>



<p>With the coronavirus, though, “what’s happened is the opposite of antigenic sin,” says Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Rockefeller University in New York City. He and colleagues examined what happens to the immune response after a third dose of vaccine, focusing especially on very long-lived immune cells called memory B cells. Those <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04778-y">memory cells still made new antibodies</a> when they got a third look at the vaccine, Nussenzweig and colleagues reported April 21 in <em>Nature.</em> That wouldn’t happen if antigenic sin were a problem. And it’s great news since an ever-growing repertoire of antibodies may help defend against future variants.</p>



<p>A separate <em>Nature Immunology</em> study found that other immune cells called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01184-4">T cells also learn new tricks</a> after a booster dose or a breakthrough infection. Those and other studies seem to indicate that getting a booster isn’t bad for my immune system and could help me against future variants.</p>



<h4>Is it okay to mix and match COVID-19 booster shots?</h4>



<p>Now the question is, which booster to get? Mixing vaccines doesn’t seem to push the immune system toward making the unhelpful antibodies, Alter said. It “tantalizes the immune system with different flavors of vaccines, and seems to reawaken it,” she said. “Even mixing and matching mRNAs may be highly advantageous to the immune system.” She and colleagues found that the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abm2311">Moderna vaccine may make more IgA antibodies</a>, the type that help protect mucous membranes in the nose, mouth and other slick surfaces in the body from infection, than the Pfizer vaccine does. Pfizer’s makes more of the IgM and IgG antibodies that circulate in the blood, data published March 29 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em> show.</p>



<p>Since I got the Pfizer vaccine for my first three doses, it seems wise to shake things up with Moderna this time. I’ve already booked my shot.</p>



<p>As for Peter, after I laid out the evidence, he said he was convinced that he should probably get a shot now, as his doctor recommends. But he admitted he might just wait to see if Moderna comes out with an updated version of its vaccine.</p>



<p>What’s really needed, all the experts tell me, is to better understand how the immune system operates so researchers can build better vaccines with longer-lasting protection so we won’t be facing needles multiple times per year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-brightly-colored-feathers-heads-fossil-skull-soft-tissue">Pterosaurs may have had brightly colored feathers on their heads</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pterosaurs not only had feathers, but also were flamboyantly colorful, scientists say.</p>



<p>That could mean that feathers — and vibrant displays of mate-seeking plumage — may have originated as far back as the common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, during the early Triassic Period around 250 million years ago.</p>



<p>Analyses of the partial skull of a 113-million-year-old pterosaur fossil revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04622-3">the flying reptile had two types of feathers</a>, paleontologist Aude Cincotta of University College Cork in Ireland and colleagues report April 20 in <em>Nature</em>. On its head, the creature, thought to be <em>Tupandactylus</em> <em>imperator</em>, had whiskerlike, single filaments and more complicated branching structures akin to those of modern bird feathers.</p>





<p>Because the fossil’s soft tissues were also well-preserved, the team identified a variety of different shapes of pigment-bearing melanosomes in both feathers and skin. Those shapes ranged from “very elongate cigar shapes to flattened platelike disks,” says Maria McNamara, a paleobiologist also at University College Cork.</p>



<p>Different melanosome shapes have been linked to different colors. Short, stubby spheroidal melanosomes are usually associated with yellow to reddish-brown colors, while the longer shapes are linked to darker colors, McNamara says.</p>



<p>The range of melanosome geometries found in this <em>Tupandactylus</em> specimen suggests that the creature may have been quite colorful, the team says. And that riot of color, in turn, hints that the feathers weren’t there just to keep the creatures warm, but may have been used for visual signaling, such as displays to attract a mate.</p>

<p>Scientists have wrangled over whether pterosaurs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Earth’s first true vertebrate flyers</a>, had true feathers, or whether their bodies were covered in something more primitive and hairlike, dubbed “pycnofibers” (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>). If the flying reptiles did have feathers, they weren’t needed for flying; pterosaurs had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-bat-wings-clumsy-evolution-flying-gliding">fibrous membranes stretched between</a> their long, tapering wings, much like modern bats (<em>SN: 10/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>In 2018, a team of researchers including McNamara reported that some of the fuzz covering two fossilized pterosaur specimens wasn’t just simple pycnofibers but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-reptile-pterosaur-fossils-fur-primitive-feathers">showed distinct, complex, branching patterns</a> similar to those seen in modern feathers (<em>SN: 12/21/18</em>). But some researchers have disputed this, saying that the branching observed in the fossils was an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01308-9">artifact of preservation</a>, the appearance of branching created by overlapping fibers.</p>



<p>The new pterosaur specimen has “turned all that on its head,” McNamara says. In this fossil, “it’s very clear. We see feathers that are separated, isolated — you can’t say it’s an overlap of structures.” The fossilized feathers show successive branches of consistent length, extending all the way along a feather’s shaft.</p>



<p>And though the previous pterosaur fossils described in 2018 did have some preserved melanosomes, those were “middle-of-the-road shapes, little short ovoids,” McNamara says. In <em>Tupandactylus</em>, “for the first time we see melanosomes of different geometries” in the feathers. That all adds up to bright, colorful plumage.</p>



<p>“To me, these fossils close the case. Pterosaurs really had feathers,” says Stephen Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study. “Not only were many famous dinosaurs actually big fluffballs,” he says, but so were many pterosaurs.</p>





<p>Many dinosaurs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/feathered-dinosaurs-may-have-been-rule-not-exception">particularly theropod dinosaurs</a>, also had colorful feathers (<em>SN: 7/24/14</em>). What this study shows is that feathers aren’t merely a bird thing, or even just a dinosaur thing, but that feathers evolved even deeper in time, Brusatte adds. And, as pterosaurs had wing membranes for flying, their feathers must have served other purposes, such as for insulation and communication.</p>



<p>It’s possible that dinosaurs and pterosaurs evolved this colorful plumage independently, McNamara says. But the shared structural complexity of the pigments in both groups of reptiles makes it “much more likely that it was derived from a common ancestor in the early Triassic.”</p>



<p>“That’s a big new implication,” says Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England.</p>



<p>Benton, a coauthor on the 2018 paper, wrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01036-z">a separate commentary on the new study</a> in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. If feathers arose in a common ancestor, Benton says, that would push back the origin of feathers by about 100 million years, to roughly 250 million years ago.</p>



<p>And that might have other interesting implications, Benton writes. The early Triassic was a rough time for life on Earth; it was the aftermath of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">the mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian that killed off more than 90 percent of the planet’s species (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>). If feathers did evolve during that time, the insulating fuzz, as well as warm-bloodedness, may have been part of an early arms race between reptilian mammal ancestors called synapsids and the pterosaur-dinosaur ancestor.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/29/prejudice-among-trump-supporters-increased-after-he-became-president/">Prejudice among Trump supporters increased after he became president</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-text-align-left"><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Whether or not Donald Trump’s presidency actively increased prejudice or simply emboldened those who already held bigoted views was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/08/14/trump-and-racism-what-do-the-data-say/">frequently</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/trump-effect-an-experimental-investigation-of-the-emboldening-effect-of-racially-inflammatory-elite-communication/0335108B8E4AF36CBFFA1E45816C6143">debated</a> during his term. A new study looks more closely at prejudicial attitudes during the presidency, exploring the views of over 10,000 American citizens.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01287-2">The study</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour, </em>finds a complex picture. While prejudicial attitudes decreased among Trump’s opponents, his supporters showed an increase in prejudice — and this seems to be because they believed these views had become more socially acceptable.</p>



<span id="more-46116"></span>



<p>First, the researchers conducted a set of studies looking at attitudes towards Muslims. In 2014/2015, before Trump came into power, participants completed a scale measuring their levels of Islamophobia. Some also rated how ashamed, angry, guilty, and compassionate they felt towards a Muslim man who had been arrested by US forces and held in Guantanamo Bay prison. Then, two years later once Trump was in office, the participants repeated these measures and&nbsp; answered further questions about their political attitudes generally and support for Trump.</p>



<p>Participants did not, as a whole, increase or decrease in prejudice between the first and second survey. However, when the team looked at Trump supporters and opponents separately, this changed: supporters of Trump showed a significant increase in Islamophobia, while those opposed to Trump showed significant <em>decreases</em> in negativity towards Muslims. These findings were also replicated when participants read the story about the Muslim man imprisoned in a US military prison: Trump supporters reported significantly less concern for the man by the second survey.</p>



<p>Trump support was crucial here: this, rather than conservatism generally or membership of the Republican party, was the most important predictor of changes in prejudice. In fact, conservatives who opposed Trump did not display increases in prejudice.</p>



<p>The next set of studies looked at prejudice against African Americans, again surveying participants before and after Trump’s rise to power. The same patterns held: Trump support predicted increases in prejudice towards Black people, both in implicit and blatant forms. Trump supporters were more likely to agree with racist statements such as “Blacks are not as smart as Whites” by the second survey, for instance. And, again, this held when controlling for political conservatism more generally.</p>



<p>Data from a longitudinal study of American citizens conducted in 2016 and 2011 looked at prejudice against other minorities too. This data again showed that prejudice amongst Trump opponents decreased over this period, while supporters showed an increase in prejudice against some of these groups (for others, they didn’t show a significant increase but still didn’t show the <em>decrease</em> in bigotry seen in society on a broader scale).</p>



<p>What could account for these changes in prejudice? Shifts in social norms that occurred with the rise of Trump seem to be crucial. In a final set of studies looking at perception of other people’s attitudes, participants believed that Americans generally had become more critical of Muslims — something both Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters agreed on. And Trump supporters also reported that those they respected and admired in their own social group had become more critical of Muslims, too. In further experimental studies, the team found that leading people to believe that Trump supporters approved of his anti-immigrant rhetoric led Trump-supporting participants to express a greater degree of prejudice themselves.</p>



<p>While the earlier studies are merely correlational, these later studies provide evidence of some form of causation: that Trump supporters felt it was more acceptable to express prejudice after his election, and that this acceptance facilitated their own further expression. Creating social environments where such speech or action is not acceptable is, on a societal level, easier said than done — future research could look at ways to push back on hateful rhetoric even when it is being promoted by those in the public sphere.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-breed-individual-behavior-predictor-genetics">Dog breed is a surprisingly poor predictor of individual behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Turns out we may be unfairly stereotyping dogs.</p>



<p>Modern breeds are shaped around aesthetics: Chihuahuas’ batlike ears, poodles’ curly fur, dachshunds’ hot dog shape. But breeds are frequently associated with certain behaviors, too. For instance, the American Kennel Club describes border collies as “affectionate, smart, energetic” and beagles as “friendly, curious, merry.”</p>



<p>Now, genetic information from more than 2,000 dogs, paired with self-reported surveys from dog owners, indicates that a dog’s breed is a poor predictor of its behavior. On average, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0639">breed explains only 9 percent of the behavioral differences</a> between individual dogs, researchers report April 28 in <em>Science.</em></p>





<p>“Everybody was assuming that breed was predictive of behavior in dogs,” geneticist Elinor Karlsson of the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester said in an April 26 news briefing. But “that had never really been asked particularly well.”</p>



<p>Geneticists had asked the question before in different ways. One study in 2019 looked at whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-breed-behavior-genetics">genetics might explain collective variation between breeds</a> and found that genes could explain some of the differences between, say, poodles and chihuahuas (<em>SN: 10/1/19</em>). But Karlsson and her colleagues wanted to learn how much breed can predict variation in individual dogs’ behavior.</p>



<p>To study variation at the individual level, the team needed genetic and behavior data from a lot of dogs. So they developed <a href="https://darwinsark.org/">Darwin’s Ark</a>, an open-source database where more than 18,000 pet owners responded to surveys about their dog’s traits and behavior. The survey asked over 100 questions about observable behaviors, which the researchers grouped into eight “behavioral factors,” including human sociability (how comfortable a dog is around humans) and biddability (how responsive it is to commands).</p>



<p>The researchers also collected genetic data from 2,155 purebred and mixed-breed dogs, including 1,715 dogs from Darwin’s Ark whose owners sent in dog saliva swabs. The inclusion of mixed-breed dogs, or mutts, shed light on how ancestry affects behavior while removing the purebred stereotypes that could affect the way the dog is treated — and thus behaves.</p>



<p>Studying mutts also makes it easier to decouple traits from one another, says Kathleen Morrill, a geneticist in Karlsson’s lab. “And that means on an individual basis, you&#8217;re going to have a better shot at mapping a gene that is actually tied to the question you&#8217;re asking.”</p>



<p>Then the team combined the genetic and survey data for the individual dogs to identify genes associated with particular traits. The new study revealed that the most heritable behavioral factor for dogs is human sociability, and that motor patterns — such as howling and retrieving — are generally more heritable than other behaviors.</p>



<p>That makes sense, Kathryn Lord, an evolutionary canine biologist in Karlsson’s lab, said during the briefing. Before modern breeding started within the last couple hundred years or so, dogs were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/dog-dna-study-maps-breeds-across-world">selected for the functional roles</a> they could provide, such as hunting or herding (<em>SN: 4/26/17</em>). Today, these selections still show up in breed groups. For instance, herding dogs on average tend to be more biddable and interested in toys. It also follows that, within breed groups, individual breeds are more likely to display certain motor patterns: Retrievers, unsurprisingly, are more likely to retrieve.</p>



<p>Still, even though breed was associated with certain behaviors, it was not a reliable predictor of individual behavior. While retrievers are less likely to howl, some owners reported that their retrievers howled often; greyhounds rarely bury toys,&nbsp;except some do.</p>



<p>The research solidifies what people have observed: Dog breeds differ on average in behavior, but there&#8217;s a lot of variation within breeds, says Adam Boyko, a canine geneticist at Cornell University who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, size had even less of an effect — as in, virtually none — on an individual’s behavior, despite the yappiness commonly associated with small dogs. Boyko points out that small dogs may often behave worse than large dogs, but rather than that being built into their genetics, “I think it&#8217;s that we typically tolerate poor behavior more in small dogs than we do in big dogs.”</p>



<p>As a dog trainer, Curtis Kelley of Pet Parent Allies in Philadelphia says that he meets a dog where it’s at. “Dogs are as individual as people are,” he says. Breed gives a loose guideline for what kind of behaviors to expect,&nbsp;“but it’s certainly not a hard-and-fast rule.”</p>



<p>If a person is looking to buy a dog, he says, they shouldn’t put too much stock in the dog’s breed. Even within a litter, dogs can show very different personalities. “A puppy will show you who they are at eight weeks old,” Kelley says. “It&#8217;s just our job to believe them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mom-voice-kid-brain-teen-neuroscience">Mom’s voice holds a special place in kids’ brains. That changes for teens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Young kids’ brains are especially tuned to their mothers’ voices. Teenagers’ brains, in their typical rebellious glory, are most decidedly not.</p>



<p>That conclusion, described April 28 in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>, may seem laughably obvious to parents of teenagers, including neuroscientist Daniel Abrams of Stanford University School of Medicine. “I have two teenaged boys myself, and it’s a kind of funny result,” he says.</p>



<p>But the finding may reflect something much deeper than a punch line. As kids grow up and expand their social connections beyond their family, their brains need to be attuned to that growing world. “Just as an infant is tuned into a mom, adolescents have this whole other class of sounds and voices that they need to tune into,” Abrams says.</p>





<p>He and his colleagues scanned the brains of 7- to 16-year-olds as they heard the voices of either their mothers or unfamiliar women. To simplify the experiment down to just the sound of a voice, the words were gibberish: teebudieshawlt, keebudieshawlt and peebudieshawlt. As the children and teenagers listened, certain parts of their brains became active.</p>



<p>Previous experiments by Abrams and his colleagues have shown that certain regions of the brains of kids ages 7 to 12 — particularly those parts involved in detecting rewards and paying attention — respond more strongly to mom’s voice than to a voice of an unknown woman. “In adolescence, we show the exact opposite of that,” Abrams says.</p>



<p>In these same brain regions in teens, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2018-21.2022">unfamiliar voices elicited greater responses</a> than the voices of their own dear mothers. The shift from mother to other seems to happen between ages 13 and 14.</p>



<p>It’s not that these adolescent brain areas stop responding to mom, Abrams says. Rather, the unfamiliar voices become more rewarding and worthy of attention.</p>



<p>And that’s exactly how it should be, Abrams says. Exploring new people and situations is a hallmark of adolescence. “What we’re seeing here is just purely a reflection of this phenomenon.”</p>



<p>Voices can carry powerful signals. When stressed-out girls heard their moms’ voices on the phone, the girls’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moms-talk-daughters-hormones-listen">stress hormones dropped</a>, biological anthropologist Leslie Seltzer of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and colleagues found in 2011 (<em>SN: 8/12/11</em>). The same was not true for texts from their mothers.</p>



<p>The current results support the idea that the brain changes to reflect new needs that come with time and experience, Seltzer says. “As we mature, our survival depends less and less on maternal support and more on our group affiliations with peers.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear how universal this neural shift is. The finding might change across various mother-child relationships, including those that have different parenting styles, or even a history of neglect or abuse, Seltzer says.</p>



<p>So while teenagers and parents may sometimes feel frustrated by missed messages, take heart, Abrams says. “This is the way the brain is wired, and there’s a good reason for it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jogger-running-speed-pace-energy">Joggers naturally pace themselves to conserve energy even on short runs</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many recreational runners, taking a jog is a fun way to stay fit and burn calories. But it turns out an individual has a tendency to settle into the same, comfortable pace on short and long runs — and that pace is the one that minimizes their body’s energy use over a given distance.</p>



<p>“I was really surprised,” says Jessica Selinger, a biomechanist at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “Intuitively, I would have thought people run faster at shorter distances and slow their pace at longer distances.”</p>



<p>Selinger and colleagues <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00563-2">combined data from more than 4,600 runners</a>, who went on 37,201 runs while wearing a fitness device called the Lumo Run, with lab-based physiology data. The analysis, described April 28 in <em>Current Biology</em>, also shows that it takes more energy for someone to run a given distance if they run faster or slower than their optimum speed.</p>





<p>“There is a speed that for you is going to feel the best,” Selinger says. “That speed is the one where you&#8217;re actually burning fewer calories.”</p>



<p>The runners ranged in age from 16 to 83, and had body mass indices spanning from 14.3 to 45.4. But no matter participants’ age, weight or sex — or whether they ran only a narrow range of distances or runs of varying lengths — the same pattern showed up in the data repeatedly.</p>



<p>Researchers have thought that running was performance-driven, says Melissa Thompson, a biomechanist at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., who was not involved in the new study. This new research, she says, is “talking about preference, not performance.”</p>



<p>Most related research, Selinger says, has been done in university laboratories, with study subjects who are generally younger and healthier than the general population. By using wearable devices, the researchers could track many more runs, across more real-life conditions than is possible in a lab. That allowed the scientists to look at a “much broader cross section of humanity,” she says. Treadmill tests measuring energy use at different paces with people representative of those included in the fitness tracker data were used to determine optimum energy-efficient speeds.</p>



<p>Because the study includes a wide range of conditions and doesn’t control for things like fasting before running, it’s messier than data gathered in labs. Still, the sheer volume of real-world runs recorded by the wearable devices supports a convincing general rule about how humans run, says Rodger Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder not involved with the study. “I think the rule’s right.”</p>



<p>The results don’t apply to very long runs when fatigue starts to set in, or to race performance by elite athletes or others consciously training for speed. And a runner’s optimum pace can change over time, with training or age for instance.</p>



<p>There are quick tricks for those who want to speed up and go for a little more calorie burn to temporarily trump their body’s natural inclinations: Listen to upbeat music or jog alongside someone with a faster pace, Selinger says. “But it seems like your preference is actually to sink back into that optimum.”</p>



<p>The results match observations of optimum pacing from animals like horses and wildebeests, and also correspond to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-adjust-walking-style-energy-efficiency">the way humans tend to walk</a> at a speed that minimizes their individual energy use (<em>SN: 9/10/15</em>).</p>



<p>It does make sense that humans would be adapted to run at an optimum speed for minimizing energy use, says coauthor Scott Delp, a biomechanist at Stanford University. Imagine being an early human ancestor going out to hunt difficult prey. “It might be days before I get my next food,” he says. “So I want to spend the least energy en route to getting that food.”</p>

<p><strong>Cyclic AMP and psoriasis —</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/biological-sciences-4"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 29, 1972</p>



<p>[A team of dermatologists] discovered that cyclic AMP levels in psoriasis lesions are significantly lower than in healthy skin.… [The team] is now trying to find out if the cyclic AMP deficiency causes psoriasis and to develop a medication to increase cyclic AMP levels in psoriasis lesions.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Psoriasis, which affects 2 to 3 percent of the global population, is an inflammatory skin disease marked by red, scaly patches that itch or burn. Low levels of cyclic AMP — a chemical messenger key to cellular communication — haven’t been found to cause the disease. Psoriasis stems from an overactive immune response. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27883001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyclic AMP is just one player</a> alongside other chemical messengers and immune cells, and certain gene variants can make a person more susceptible. The choice among a range of treatment options today depends in part on the severity of the disease and the areas of the body affected. One drug, called apremilast, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014, increases levels of cyclic AMP, among other actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/27/extraverts-are-considered-to-be-poorer-listeners/">Extraverts are considered to be poorer listeners</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Extraverts are hugely sociable — they really care about their relationships, and possess outstanding social skills. Well, that’s how extraverts are generally portrayed. But, according to new work, that’s not exactly how other people see them. In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211072815?journalCode=pspc">series of studies</a> reported in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, Francis J. Flynn at Stanford University, US and colleagues consistently found that more extraverted people are considered to be <em>poorer</em> listeners. Their research also reveals a likely reason why.</p>



<span id="more-46094"></span>



<p>There is no academic consensus on what constitutes &#8220;good&#8221; listening. But, in line with some other researchers, the team conceptualises it as involving emotion-related processes (showing empathy, for example, and emotional engagement with what the other person is saying), cognitive processes (paying attention to and comprehending what they’re saying) and also behavioural processes (such as nodding and asking questions). In everyday life, it’s not necessarily easy to ascertain whether the person we’re talking to is really listening, however. They might be making plenty of eye contact, for example (which would suggest engagement), but it’s always possible that they’re just pretending to be listening well, in a bid to make a good impression. In this research, the team focused on only the participants’ <em>perceptions</em> of others’ listening skills.</p>



<p>In a preliminary study, 147 first-year business students, who met weekly in groups of six to work on leadership skills, rated the listening skills of everyone else in their group (rating how much that person seemed to listen while they spoke, and later remembered what they’d said, for example). The participants then completed a scale that assessed their own extraversion. The team found that those with higher self-reported extraversion got poorer marks for listening.</p>



<p>However, in this study, people’s perceptions could have been influenced by the actual social relationships they had with other members of their group. So in almost all of the subsequent studies, fresh groups of participants rated the listening skills of fictional people who were described as falling at various points on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Results from these studies supported the preliminary finding. Time and again, extraverted people were rated as being poorer listeners in social situations. As the team writes: “That is, despite the tendency for people to see extroverts as highly sociable, they tend to see this sociability as highly one-sided.”</p>



<p>An online study of 337 US-based adults suggested why this might be. Fictional people who were portrayed as highly extraverted were also perceived to be better at controlling and modifying how they come across to others. “To observers, this signal of malleable self-presentation suggests that extraverts are more interested in ‘looking the part’ than attending to what others have to say,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Are extraverts <em>actually</em> poorer listeners? Only further research will tell. But the team cautions that such work will be tricky to do, because of the difficulties in objectively evaluating listening. In any case, they add, the lack of objective information on a conversational partner’s listening means that we rely heavily on our pre-existing assumptions as well as limited behavioural cues. “Thus, although it might be an interesting exercise to test the validity of the lay belief that extraverts are worse listeners, it might not matter much. Instead, people may continue to rely on their lay beliefs to judge whether the other person is listening or merely pretending to listen.”</p>



<p>It would be really interesting, though, to see work on the real-world implications of this particular belief. “For example, listening has been identified as the ‘holy grail’ in sales roles,” the team notes — so perhaps it would be wise for highly extraverted sales people to try to modify their behaviour with clients. One important note is that of course that these findings are on US adults — they may not hold in other countries in which extraversion is either less or more socially desirable.</p>



<p>Still, for these assorted US participants, evidence for the belief that extraverts are worse listeners was found across the experiments. A vast amount of research has been done on extraversion itself. “Our findings contribute to the study of extraversion by examining <em>how people think about extraversion,</em>” the researchers write (their italics). And for understanding conversations and relationships, which of course are two-way, that’s clearly important, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leonardo-da-vinci-rule-tree-branch-wrong-limb-area-thickness">Leonardo da Vinci’s rule for how trees branch was close, but wrong</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci was wrong about trees.</p>



<p>The multitalented, Renaissance genius wrote down his “rule of trees” over 500 years ago. It described the way he thought that trees branch. Though it was a brilliant insight that helped him to draw realistic landscapes, Leonardo’s rule breaks down for many types of trees. Now, a new branching rule — dubbed “Leonardo-like” — <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/accepted/2b076Yf4X4911676758c4b78bc96a155d89129dfd">works for virtually any leafy tree</a>, researchers report in a paper accepted April 13 in <em>Physical Review E</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The older Leonardo rule describes the thickness of the branches, while the length of the branch was not taken into account,” says physicist Sergey Grigoriev of the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Gatchina, Russia. “Therefore, the description using the older rule is not complete.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>Leonardo’s rule says that the thickness of a limb before it branches into smaller ones is the same as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-14">the combined thickness of the limbs sprouting from it</a> (<em>SN: 6/1/11</em>). But according to Grigoriev and his colleagues, it’s the surface area that stays the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using surface area as a guide, the new rule incorporates limb widths <em>and</em> lengths, and predicts that long branches end up being thinner than short ones. Unlike Leonardo’s guess, the updated rule works for slender birches as well as it does for sturdy oaks, the team reports.</p>



<p>The connection between the surface area of branches and overall tree structure shows that it’s the living, outer layers that guide tree structure, the researchers say.&nbsp;“The life of a tree flows according to the laws of conservation of area in two-dimensional space,” the authors write in their study, “as if the tree were a two-dimensional object.” In other words, it’s as if just two dimensions — the width of each limb and the distance between branchings on a limb — determine any tree’s structure. As a result, when trees are rendered in two dimensions in a painting or on a screen, the new rule describes them particularly well.</p>

<p>The new Leonardo-like rule is an improvement, says Katherine McCulloh, a botanist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was not involved with this study. But she has her doubts about the Russian group’s rationale for it. In most trees, she says, the living portion extends much deeper than the thin surface layer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really species-dependent, and even age-dependent,” McCulloh says. “A giant, old oak tree might have a centimeter of living wood … [but] there are certainly tropical tree species that have very deep sapwood and may have living wood for most of their cross sections.”</p>



<p>Still, the fact that the Leonardo-like rule appears to hold for many trees intrigues McCulloh. “To me, it drives home the question of why are [trees] conserving this geometry for their external tissue, and how is that related to the microscopic level differences that we observe in wood,” she says. “It’s a really interesting question.”</p>



<p>To test their rule, Grigoriev and colleagues took photographs of trees from a variety of species and analyzed the branches to confirm that the real-world patterns matched the predictions. The photos offer “a direct measurement of the characteristics of a tree without touching it, which can be important when dealing with a living object,” Grigoriev says.</p>



<p>Though the team hasn’t studied evergreens yet, the rule holds for all of the deciduous trees that the researchers have looked at. “We have applied our methodology to maple, linden, apple,” Grigoriev says, in addition to oak, birch and chestnut. “They show the same general structure and obey the Leonardo-like rule.” </p>



<p>While it’s possible to confirm the rule by measuring branches by hand, it would require climbing into trees and checking all the limbs — a risky exercise for trees and scientists alike. “Note,” the researchers write, “that not a single tree was harmed during these experiments.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Na Helian is going to introduce a paper titled “Boosting Ant Colony Optimization with Reptile Search Algorithm for Churn Prediction” which is written by our PhD student Ibrahim Al-Shourbaji.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The telecommunications industry is greatly concerned about customer
churn due to dissatisfaction with service. This industry has started
investing in the development of machine learning (ML) models for churn
prediction to extract, examine and visualize their customers'
historical information from a vast amount of big data which will
assist to further understand customer needs and take appropriate
actions to control customer churn. However, the high-dimensionality of
the data has a large influence on the performance of the ML model, so
feature selection (FS) has been applied since it is a primary
preprocessing step. It improves the ML model's performance by
selecting salient features while reducing the computational time,
which can assist this sector in building effective prediction models.
This paper proposes a new FS approach ACO-RSA, that combines two
metaheuristic algorithms (MAs), namely, ant colony optimization (ACO)
and reptile search algorithm (RSA). In the developed ACO-RSA approach,
an ACO and RSA are integrated to choose an important subset of
features for churn prediction. The ACO-RSA approach is evaluated on
seven open-source customer churn prediction datasets, ten CEC 2019
test functions, and its performance is compared to particle swarm
optimization (PSO), multi verse optimizer (MVO) and grey wolf
optimizer (GWO), standard ACO and standard RSA. According to the
results along with statistical analysis, ACO-RSA is an effective and
superior approach compared to other competitor algorithms on most
datasets.</p>

Antibiotic use during that time was associated with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-052061">subpar immune responses to four vaccines babies receive</a> to ward off whooping cough, polio and other diseases, researchers report online April 27 in <em>Pediatrics</em>.</p>



<p>And the more rounds of antibiotics a child received, the more antibody levels to the vaccines dropped below what’s considered protective. Levels induced by the primary series of shots for the polio, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and pneumococcal vaccines fell 5 to 11 percent with each antibiotic course. In the children’s second year, antibody levels generated by booster shots of these vaccines dropped 12 to 21 percent per course.</p>





<p>“If anyone needed yet another reason why overprescription of antibiotics is not a good thing, this paper offers that reason,” says immunologist Bali Pulendran of Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Taking antibiotics disrupts the population of bacteria that live in the gut. That’s well known, but researchers are still learning about how that disruption can affect a person’s health. The new study adds to evidence that diminishing the amount and diversity of gut bacteria impacts vaccination. In studies in mice, antibiotics hampered the immune system’s response to vaccines. And a small study in humans found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750738/">antibiotics dampened adults’ response to the flu vaccine</a> in those whose prior immune memory for influenza had waned, Pulendran and colleagues reported in 2019.</p>



<p>The study in <em>Pediatrics</em> is the first to report an association between antibiotic use and compromised vaccine responses in children. Michael Pichichero, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the Rochester General Hospital Research Institute in New York, and colleagues collected blood samples taken from 560 children during routine visits with their pediatricians. Of those, 342 children had been prescribed close to 1,700 courses of antibiotics and 218 children had not gotten the drugs. The team analyzed whether antibody levels induced by the four vaccines met the threshold considered protective and found levels more often fell short for the kids who had gotten antibiotics.</p>



<p>The type and length of antibiotic treatment also made a difference. Broad spectrum drugs were associated with antibody levels below what is protective, while a more targeted antibiotic was not. Furthermore, a 10-day course, but not a five-day course, reduced vaccine-induced antibody levels.</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t look at whether children in the study with diminished antibody levels were more likely to develop vaccine-preventable diseases. But there has been concern about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whooping-cough-bounces-back">outbreaks of whooping cough</a>, says Pichichero, which have occurred in the United States despite vaccination (<em>SN: 4/4/14</em>). Perhaps antibiotic use can help explain these outbreaks, he says.</p>



<p>To see what kinds of changes are occurring in the gut bacteria, Pichichero and colleagues are beginning a study with a new group of children. The researchers will collect stool samples along with blood draws and antibiotic use records. They’d like to follow the children past age 5, beyond the time kids receive another round of booster shots, to learn whether antibiotics also interfere with this next opportunity to develop antibodies.</p>



<p>“Antibiotics are miracle medicines,” says Pichichero. “In no way does this study imply that children who need an antibiotic shouldn’t get it.” But if possible, it should be a narrowly targeted antibiotic for a shorter course, he says. Along with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimicrobial-resistance-cause-death-antibiotic-bacteria">risk of antibiotic resistance</a> that comes with overuse of the drugs (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>), the impact antibiotics could have on vaccine-induced immunity “has clinical implications for every individual child.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">All of the bases in DNA and RNA have now been found in meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>More of the ingredients for life have been found in meteorites.</p>



<p>Space rocks that fell to Earth within the last century <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29612-x">contain the five bases that store information in DNA and RNA</a>, scientists report April 26 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>These “nucleobases” — adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil — combine with sugars and phosphates to make up the genetic code of all life on Earth. Whether these basic ingredients for life first came from space or instead formed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">in a warm soup of earthly chemistry</a> is still not known (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>). But the discovery adds to evidence that suggests life’s precursors originally came from space, the researchers say.</p>





<p>Scientists have detected bits of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorites-contain-chemicals-linked-life">adenine, guanine</a> and other organic compounds in meteorites <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-first-glimpse-amino-acids-outer-space">since the 1960s</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/11</em>, <em>SN: 12/4/20</em>). Researchers have also seen hints of uracil, but cytosine and thymine remained elusive, until now.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve completed the set of all the bases found in DNA and RNA and life on Earth, and they&#8217;re present in meteorites,” says astrochemist Daniel Glavin of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>A few years ago, geochemist Yasuhiro Oba of Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, and colleagues came up with a technique to gently extract and separate different chemical compounds in liquified meteorite dust and then analyze them.</p>



<p>“Our detection method has orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than that applied in previous studies,” Oba says. Three years ago, the researchers used this same technique to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ribose-sugar-needed-life-has-been-detected-meteorites">discover ribose, a sugar needed for life, in three meteorites</a> (<em>SN: 11/22/19</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, Oba and colleagues combined forces with astrochemists at NASA to analyze one of those three meteorite samples and three additional ones, looking for another type of crucial ingredient for life: nucleobases.</p>



<p>The researchers think their milder extraction technique, which uses cold water instead of the usual acid, keeps the compounds intact. “We’re finding this extraction approach is very amenable for these fragile nucleobases,” Glavin says. “It’s more like a cold brew, rather than making hot tea.”</p>



<p>With this technique, Glavin, Oba and their colleagues measured the abundances of the bases and other compounds related to life in four samples from meteorites that fell decades ago in Australia, Kentucky and British Columbia. In all four, the team detected and measured adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, thymine, several compounds related to those bases and a few amino acids.</p>



<p>Using the same technique, the team also measured chemical abundances within soil collected from the Australia site and then compared the measured meteorite values with that of the soil. For some detected compounds, the meteorite values were greater than the surrounding soil, which suggests that the compounds came to Earth in these rocks.</p>



<p>But for other detected compounds, including cytosine and uracil, the soil abundances are as much as 20 times as high as in the meteorites. That could point to earthly contamination, says cosmochemist Michael Callahan of Boise State University in Idaho.</p>



<p>“I think [the researchers] positively identified these compounds,” Callahan says. But “they didn’t present enough compelling data to convince me that they’re truly extraterrestrial.” Callahan previously worked at NASA and collaborated with Glavin and others to measure organic materials in meteorites.</p>



<p>But Glavin and his colleagues point to a few specific detected chemicals to support the hypothesis of an interplanetary origin. In the new analysis, the researchers measured more than a dozen other life-related compounds, including isomers of the nucleobases, Glavin says. Isomers have the same chemical formulas as their associated bases, but their ingredients are organized differently. The team found some of those isomers in the meteorites but not in the soil. “If there had been contamination from the soil, we should have seen those isomers in the soil as well. And we didn&#8217;t,” he says.</p>



<p>Going directly to the source of such meteorites — pristine asteroids — could clear up the matter. Oba and colleagues are already using their extraction technique on pieces from the surface of the asteroid Ryugu, which Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">brought to Earth in late 2020</a> (<em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to return in September 2023 with similar samples from the asteroid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-sample-missions-hayabusa2-ryugu-osiris-rex-bennu">Bennu</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/19</em>).</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re really excited about what stories those materials have to tell,” Glavin says.</p>

<p>Welcome to our new <em>Research Highlights</em> blog series! A new post series in which we highlight recent noteworthy studies from across PLOS journals. This month, <em>PLOS ONE </em>author Sandra Mart&iacute;n-Pel&aacute;ez of the University of Granada, Spain and colleagues found that cardiovascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of depression in older adults. Learn more about the study design and authors&rsquo; findings below or jump to the full study on our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265079" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journal site</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Cardiovascular disease and depression are thought to be closely related due to similar risk factors, including inflammation and oxidative stress. Although it has been shown that depression could be a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, studies analyzing the potential impact of cardiovascular health on developing depression are scarce.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers used data from an ongoing 6-year multi-center randomized trial in Spain which analyzes the effect of a Mediterranean Diet on men aged 55-75 and women aged 60-75 with overweight or obesity. 6,545 individuals with no cardiovascular or endocrine disease at baseline were included in the current analysis. A cardiovascular risk score according to the Framingham-based REGICOR function was calculated for each person, dividing participants into low (LR), medium (MR), or high/very high (HR) cardiovascular risk groups. Depressive status was gauged using a questionnaire at baseline and after 2 years of follow-up.</p>



<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>



<p>At baseline, women in the HR group showed higher odds of depressive status than LR women (Odds Ratio* 1.78 95% Confidence Interval** 1.26-2.50). In addition, among all participants with baseline total cholesterol below 160 mg/mL, MR and HR individuals showed higher odds of depression than LR (MR: OR 1.77 95% CI 1.13-2.77; HR: OR 2.83 95% CI 1.25-6.42). On the contrary, among participants with total cholesterol of 280 mg/mL or higher, MR and HR individuals had a lower risk of depression than LR (MR: OR 0.26 95% CI 0.07-0.98; HR: OR 0.23 95% CI 0.05-0.95). After two years, during which time all individuals were instructed to follow a Mediterranean Diet as part of the trial, participants, on average, decreased their depressive status score, with the greatest decreases seen for MR and HR participants with high baseline cholesterol levels.</p>



<p><strong> Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The authors conclude that high and very high cardiovascular risk are associated with depressive symptoms, especially in women, and that the role of other factors, such as adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, deserves further research.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic there are still many open questions, including why some patients experience persistent symptoms weeks after first testing positive. In their recently published study researchers from the Gregorio Marañon Microbiology ID COVID 19 Study Group evaluate patients who report fatigue, muscle pain, dyspnea, inappropriate tachycardia and low-grade fever at least four weeks following initial diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2. Their results show that more than half of these patients experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms during their initial illness but still developed lasting symptoms. A significant number had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma, urine or stool samples several weeks post infection. The study further found that antiviral treatment strategies may be beneficial for patients with this possible systemic viral persistence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The importance of the microbiome on survival and fitness of animals has been increasingly recognised in the scientific community and in recent years we have seen a wealth of publications on different microbial communities within humans, mice and other animals. The intestinal microbiome in particular is highly dependent on the feeding status of the host organism and different phyla are differently affected by starvation periods. To study how starvation and refeeding impact on the composition of the microbiome as well as on host gene expression, researchers from Duke University used zebrafish in this recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Genomics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> publication. Interestingly, they find that the abundance of two core microbiome genera of zebrafish – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vibrio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Plesiomonas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – react in opposite ways to starvation, with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vibrio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> bacteria increasing and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Plesiomonas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> showing reductions. Concurrently, transcriptomics data of the host genes shows drastically altered expression of ribosome biogenesis early in starvation, followed by decreased expression of genes responsible for antiviral immunity as well as lipid transport in later stages. Both host transcription and microbiome were shown to recover quickly within only three days of refeeding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reproductive strategy describes how different animal species balance the trade-off between energetic costs and mortality associated with reproduction to maximise survival of both parents and offspring. European insectivorous bats such as the common noctule (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nyctalus noctula</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) make use of delayed fertilisation, where sperm is stored in the female reproductive organs during hibernation. In their recent publication, researchers from Brno assess what factors determine whether a female noctule gives birth to a single neonate or to twins, finding that high progesterone levels during early stages of gestation are a good indicator for successful twin pregnancies. Additionally, their results show that the longer the hibernation period, the shorter the gestation period.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last years have seen immense progress in researching musculoskeletal impairments in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Many CP patients show significant reduction in muscle volume, often with shorter muscles and fewer sarcomeres. Satellite cell numbers are also often reduced significantly leading to impaired muscle regeneration and thus stiffer and weaker muscles. Based on these differences, CP patients often participate less in physical activity which in turn increases their risk for secondary sarcopenia (muscle loss). Clinical phenotypes of cerebral palsy are very heterogeneous requiring individual treatment strategies. In their narrative review, Handsfield and colleagues summarise recent findings on the pathology and treatment strategies of CP, as well as highlighting areas where more work is needed.  </span></p>

In a recent article in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Ethics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> researchers assess the usefulness of different indicators of consciousness originally developed for determining the level of consciousness in artificial intelligence and animals for use in human patients, such as individuals in comas.

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/26/background-music-can-make-us-less-cautious/">Background music can make us less cautious</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Background music is a feature of most people’s everyday lives. Whether it’s while driving, at the gym, at home, or even at work, we often have music playing while we’re doing something else. Research into precisely how this affects our behaviour, emotions and cognitive processes have provided mixed findings, however. One of the reasons, argue Agustín Perez Santangelo at the University of Buenos Aires and colleagues, is there are so many variables, both in terms of the type of music used in the studies, and also the aspects of performance being measured — so it’s no wonder that results have been inconsistent.</p>



<p>Santangelo’s team decided, therefore, to explore changes in just one musical variable — tempo — and to look for effects on two individual aspects of decision-making: speed and accuracy. And they report in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-46608-001">their paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>, that background music did indeed have an effect: it made the participants less cautious.</p>



<span id="more-46066"></span>



<p>A total of 32 participants completed a series of tasks three times: in silence, and while listening to the classical, instrumental piece The Flight of the Bumblebee by Rimsky-Korsakov, at a tempo of 40 beats per minute and also at 190 beats per minute (with all other musical features unchanged). This was the biggest difference in tempo that the team felt it was reasonable to use. (And the participants did give pretty much the same liking ratings for both versions.)</p>



<p>The tasks were of different types and levels of difficulty. There were two perceptual tasks (the participants had to decide whether a cloud of dots on a screen was moving to the left or the right, for example), a general knowledge task; a lexical categorisation task (a string of five to eight letters was displayed, and they had to decide whether it was a word or not); and also a task that involved repeatedly choosing which they preferred of two snack options (they had earlier rated 100 snacks; picking the one they had earlier reported liking better was taken as a correct response). For every decision, they were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>



<p>In total, the researchers gathered data on just over 100,000 individual decisions. And the analysis threw up a few clear findings. First, the presence of music — vs silence — affected performance on all of the tasks. It led participants to make faster and also less accurate decisions.</p>



<p>Interestingly, tempo had no bearing on this: whether the music was fast or slow, this effect was the same. Some earlier studies have suggested that because a faster tempo increases physiological arousal, it &#8220;speeds&#8221; us up, too, quickening our responses. The participants in this study did report feeling more physiological arousal while listening to the fast vs slow version — but this did not translate into relatively faster responses.</p>



<p>So what might explain the findings? The researchers suspect that the background music caused a shift in the decision-making process itself — that it reduced the amount of data that the participants’ brains required to reach a decision. This would lead to what they found: quicker but less accurate responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is all background music likely to do this? The researchers used only one piece, so it’s impossible to know from this study. But the liking ratings did show that the participants weren’t too keen on it, whether it was fast or slow. It might be that the music induced a mildly negative emotional state, and it was this, rather than the music per se, that tweaked their decision-making. Other types of music might have different effects, then, as might other kinds of background noise.</p>



<p>One of the strengths of this study, compared with some others in the field, is that the team stripped the number of variables right down. This made it easier to explore the impacts of different experimental conditions. However, when we listen to background music in the real world, the variables are legion. The team suggests that perhaps background music has a negative impact on driving-related decisions, for example — but it’s not possible to directly extrapolate.</p>



<p>Still, the finding that background music can affect the process of reaching a decision is an interesting one. As the team writes, such music is “seemingly innocuous and ubiquitous” — but if, in some circumstances, it makes us less cautious, that’s worth exploring further.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324006596">The Insect Crisis</a><br><em>Oliver Milman<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $27.95</em></p>



<p>Imagine a world without insects. You might breathe a sigh of relief at the thought of mosquito-free summers, or you might worry about how agriculture will function without pollinators. What you probably won’t picture is trudging through a landscape littered with feces and rotting corpses — what a world devoid of maggots and dung beetles would look like.</p>



<p>That’s just a snippet of the horrifying picture of an insect-free future that journalist Oliver Milman paints in the beginning of <em>The Insect Crisis</em>. “The loss of insects would be an agonizing ordeal eclipsing any war and even rivaling the looming ravages of climate breakdown,” he writes. And yet, the threat of an impending “insect apocalypse” doesn’t get nearly the same level of attention as climate change.</p>





<p>Researchers have been observing declining insect populations for decades. For instance, a study of nearly 40 years of data from a protected rainforest in Puerto Rico found that insect biomass had decreased by 98 percent on the ground and 80 percent in the canopy since the mid-1970s.</p>



<p>The threats insects face are many: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">Light pollution</a>, the increasing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-piles-popular-pesticides-link-pollinator-problems">use of pesticides</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bumblebee-territory-shrinking-under-climate-change">climate change</a> are just a few (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>; <em>SN: 8/17/16</em>; <em>SN: 7/9/15</em>). And it’s not only rare species that are at risk — it’s also species that were once common around the globe.</p>



<p>The reality of the crisis isn’t as foreboding as Milman initially makes it seem. A world with no insects is unlikely, he acknowledges. Studies have found that while some species are in decline, others, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-apocalypse-declines-biodiversity">freshwater insects, are doing fine</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>). Rather than viewing the insect crisis as all insect populations on one downward-trending line on a graph, Milman suggests picturing lots of different lines — some holding steady, some sloping up or down, and some zigzagging. “Insects are being shifted to an unhappy state where there will be far more bedbugs and mosquitoes and far fewer bumblebees and monarch butterflies,” he writes.</p>



<p>Those changes in biodiversity come with consequences. Farmers may have to fend off more pests that attack soybeans, for instance, and insect-pollinated fruits and vegetables will become hard to grow at scale. Some insect-eating animals will decline as their food disappears, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/decline-birds-linked-common-insecticide">has already happened to some birds</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/14</em>), or even vanish. Water and soil quality could also be in jeopardy.</p>





<p>Milman investigates the crisis by sharing his own adventures with insects, along with those of researchers, taking readers from the United States to Mexico, across the Atlantic to Europe and all the way to Australia. By sharing scientists’ stories, he makes the plight of insects personal. There’s a researcher in Denmark who has spent 25 years surveying insect populations by driving his old Ford Anglia down the same country roads and counting the number of bugs squashed against the windshield. Back when he started, he’d regularly have to clean insect guts off his car. But in recent years, he has experienced a lot of “zero insect days.” As I read that, I struggled to remember the last time I had to scrape any dead insects off my car. Another researcher recalls the joy of catching fireflies on his family ranch in Texas as a child. I felt a wave of sadness as I thought about how I don’t see fireflies as much as I did when I was a kid. With more streetlights and the switch to LED bulbs, it’s becoming harder for fireflies to spot potential mates.</p>



<p>Amid the doom and gloom, the book still manages to spark awe and delight with fun facts about insects. Bumblebee wings, for instance, vibrate so fast that they can produce gravitational forces of up to 50 g’s — five times greater than what fighter jet pilots experience. Milman also offers hope, sharing how certain insects are adapting to the threats and how some people are fighting to protect the critters through political campaigns and changing farming habits.</p>



<p>By the book’s end, readers may find that their attitude toward some insects has shifted from loathing to love, or at the very least, appreciation. (I, for one, never cared much for flies — until I learned we wouldn’t have chocolate without them.) Milman makes clear how much we benefit from insects, and what we stand to lose without them. As one researcher puts it, our deeply woven reliance on insects is like the internet: When parts of the network are removed, the less internet there is, “until eventually it doesn’t work anymore.”</p>



<p> A world without the internet would be difficult but livable. The same can’t be said for a world without insects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camera-lens-trilobite-eye-focus-metalens">This camera lens can focus up close and far away at the same time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ben Franklin had nothing on trilobites.</p>



<p>Roughly 400 million years before the founding father invented bifocals, the now extinct trilobite <em>Dalmanitina socialis </em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/trilobite-eyes-impressive-feat-early-evolution">already had a superior version</a> (<em>SN: 2/2/74</em>). Not only could the sea critter see things both near and far, it could also see both distances in focus at the same time — an ability that eludes most eyes and cameras.</p>



<p>Now, a new type of camera sees the world the way this trilobite did. Inspired by <em>D. socialis</em>’ eyes, the camera can simultaneously focus on two points <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29568-y">anywhere between three centimeters and nearly two kilometers away</a>, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>“In optics, there was a problem,” says Amit Agrawal, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. If you wanted to focus a single lens to two different points, you just simply could not do it, he says.</p>



<p>If a camera could see like a trilobite, Agrawal figured, it could capture high-quality images with higher depths of field. A high depth of field — the distance between the nearest and farthest points that a camera can bring into focus — is important for the relatively new technique of light-field photography, which uses many tiny lenses to produce 3-D photos.</p>



<p>To mimic the trilobite’s ability, the team constructed a metalens, a type of flat lens made up of millions of differently sized rectangular nanopillars arranged like a cityscape — if skyscrapers were one two-hundredth the width of a human hair. The nanopillars act as obstacles that bend light in different ways depending on their shape, size and arrangement. The researchers arranged the pillars so some light traveled through one part of the lens and some light through another, creating two different focal points.</p>

<p>To use the device in a light-field camera, the team then built an array of identical metalenses that could capture thousands of tiny images. When combined, the result is an image that’s in focus close up and far away, but blurry in between. The blurry bits are then sharpened with a type of machine learning computer program.</p>



<p>Achieving a large depth of field can help the program recover depth information, says Ivo Ihrke, a computational imaging scientist at the University of Siegen in Germany who was not involved with this research. Standard images don’t contain information about the distances to objects in the photo, but 3-D images do. So the more depth information that can be captured, the better.</p>



<p>The trilobite approach isn’t the only way to boost the range of visual acuity. Other cameras using a different method have accomplished a similar depth of field, Ihrke says. For instance, a light-field camera made by the company Raytrix contains an array of tiny glass lenses of three different types that work in concert, with each type tailored to focus light from a particular distance. The trilobite way also uses an array of lenses, but all the lenses are the same, each one capable of doing all the depth-of-focus work on its own — which helps achieve a slightly higher resolution than using different types of lenses.</p>



<p>Regardless of how it’s done, all the recent advances in capturing depth with light-field cameras will improve imaging techniques that depend on that depth, Agrawal says. These techniques could someday help self-driving cars to track distances to other vehicles, for example, or Mars rovers to gauge distances to and sizes of landmarks in their vicinity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">These male spiders catapult away to avoid being cannibalized after sex</a></h4>

              
                <p>An act of acrobatics keeps males of one orb-weaving spider species from becoming their mates’ post-sex snack.</p>



<p>After mating, <em>Philoponella prominens</em> males <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00485-7">catapult away from females</a> at speeds up to nearly 90 centimeters per second, researchers report April 25 in <em>Current Biology</em>. Other spiders jump to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/slingshot-spider-web-acceleration">capture prey</a> or avoid predators (<em>SN: 3/16/19</em>). But <em>P. prominens</em> is unique among spiders in that males soar through the air to avoid sexual cannibalism, the researchers say.</p>



<p><em>P. prominens </em>is a social species that’s native to countries such as Japan and Korea. Up to 300 individual spiders can come together to weave an entire neighborhood of webs. While studying <em>P. prominens’ </em>sexual behavior, arachnologist Shichang Zhang and colleagues noticed that sex seemed to always end with a catapulting male. But the movement was “so fast that common cameras could not record the details,” says Zhang, of Hubei University in Wuhan, China.</p>





<p>High-resolution video of mating partners clocked the male arachnids’ speed from around 32 cm/s to 88 cm/s, the researchers report. That’s equal to just under 1 mile per hour to nearly 2 mph.</p>

</div><figcaption>A male <em>Philoponella prominens</em> spider avoids being eaten by a female after sex by leveraging hydraulic pressure to extend leg joints and fling himself away, seen here first at about one-fiftieth actual speed and then at normal speed.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The jump looks a little like the start of a backstroke swimming race, Zhang says. Males hold the tips of their front legs against a female’s body. The spiders then use hydraulic pressure to extend a joint in those legs, quickly launching a male off a female before she can capture and eat him.</p>



<p>Of 155 successful mating rituals that the researchers observed, 152 males catapulted to survival. The remaining three that didn’t fell victim to their partner. Female spiders also ate all 30 males that the team stopped from jumping to freedom with a paintbrush.</p>



<p>These male orb weavers probably acquired their jumping abilities to counter females’ cannibalistic tendencies, Zhang says. The spiders’ leap to survival is a “fantastic kinetic performance.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781250271044">The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</a><br><em>Riley Black</em><br><em>St. Martin’s Press, $28.99</em></p>



<p>Some 66 million years ago, give or take several millennia, a 10-kilometer-wide asteroid slammed into our planet. The impact blasted out an enormous crater and heaved large amounts of material into the atmosphere. Some of the sulfur-rich debris poisoned the sky, unleashing downpours of acid rain. Heat generated by ejecta falling back to Earth ignited wildfires worldwide that blazed for months, if not years. In the wake of the event, as many as 75 percent of all species were wiped out.</p>





<p>In <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em>, science writer Riley Black chronicles both the pre-apocalyptic idyll and the worldwide devastation that resulted from what some scientists have dubbed “Earth’s worst day.” The book is a compelling amalgamation of both new and old scientific information (and some science-based speculation).</p>



<p>Black begins her tale by exploring what happened in the Hell Creek area of today’s Montana, whose rocks offer what is perhaps the best record of a dinosaur habitat. This ancient ecosystem and others worldwide included far more than apex predators, such as <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, and their prey, of course; they also hosted a wealth of creatures, including lice and other parasites.</p>



<p>These ecosystems drastically changed once the space rock hit. Larger dinosaurs, as well as any smaller creatures unable to shelter in burrows, for example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killer-asteroid-chicxulub-spring-impact-fossils-fish">couldn’t escape the destruction</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Despite the title, the largest part of Black’s book recounts how life rebounded in the 1 million years after the impact. Forest floors served as natural seed banks to feed surviving insects, birds and small mammals. These seeds, some of which had previously evolved to withstand wildfires, were also the sources of forests that grew back. Those initial forests were stubby and dominated by ferns for years. Some ecosystems — especially freshwater lakes and rivers whose waters were chemically buffered from acid rain by dissolved carbonates derived from limestones — emerged relatively unscathed and so species persisted there.</p>





<p>Evolution is usually driven by gradual change, Black notes. But the dinosaur-killing impact was so abrupt and caused such extreme environmental changes that most species couldn’t adapt. In fact, she notes, animals and plants that weren’t already preadapted to the new state of affairs rapidly succumbed and thus left no descendants.</p>



<p>Yet in devastation lay opportunities: Ecological roles that had been occupied by dinosaurs for at least 100 million years were suddenly available, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-out-way-mammals-had-chance-thrive">setting the stage for the slow but steady rise of mammals</a> and the world we inhabit today (<em>SN: 2/4/17, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>While engaging and approachable, <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em> is scrupulously rooted in information gathered by paleontologists, geologists, astronomers, physicists and ecologists. In vignettes at the end of each chapter, Black explores what was unfolding at locales far from Hell Creek. In an extensive appendix, she painstakingly helps readers sort through what’s fact and what’s speculation in those scenes. For example, the behaviors of burrowing mammals during the impact and its aftermath are presumed to be similar to those inferred from the fossils of similarly sized mammals that lived a few million years earlier.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">Gravitational waves gave a new black hole a high-speed ‘kick’</a></h4>

              
                <p>This black hole really knows how to kick back.</p>



<p>Scientists recently observed two black holes that united into one, and in the process got a “kick” that flung the newly formed black hole away at high speed. That black hole <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/9f07dYb3A0719b7220a98c25dc34b66490fc218ab">zoomed off</a> at about 5 million kilometers per hour, give or take a few million, researchers report in a paper in press in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. That’s blazingly quick: The speed of light is just 200 times as fast.</p>



<p>Ripples in spacetime, called gravitational waves, launched the black hole on its breakneck exit. As any two paired-up black holes spiral inward and coalesce, they emit these ripples, which stretch and squeeze space. If those gravitational waves are shot off into the cosmos in one direction preferentially, the black hole will recoil in response.</p>





<p>It’s akin to a gun kicking back after shooting a bullet, says astrophysicist Vijay Varma of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany.</p>



<p>Gravitational wave observatories LIGO and Virgo, located in the United States and Italy, detected the black holes’ spacetime ripples when they reached Earth on January 29, 2020. Those waves revealed details of how the black holes merged, hinting that a large kick was probable. As the black holes orbited one another, the plane in which they orbited rotated, or precessed, similar to how a top wobbles as it spins. Precessing black holes are expected to get bigger kicks when they merge.</p>



<p>So Varma and colleagues delved deeper into the data, gauging whether the black hole got the boot. To estimate the kick velocity, the researchers compared the data with various predicted versions of black hole mergers, created based on computer simulations that solve the equations of general relativity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of gravity</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). The recoil was so large, the researchers found, that the black hole was probably ejected from its home and kicked to the cosmic curb.</p>



<p>Dense groups of stars and black holes called globular clusters are one locale where black holes are thought to partner up and merge. The probability that the kicked black hole would stay within a globular cluster home is only about 0.5 percent, the team calculated. For a black hole in another type of dense environment, called a nuclear star cluster, the probability of sticking around was about 8 percent.</p>



<p>The black hole’s great escape could have big implications. LIGO and Virgo detect mergers of stellar-mass black holes, which form when a star explodes in a supernova and collapses into a black hole. Scientists want to understand if black holes that partner up in crowded clusters could partner up again, going through multiple rounds of melding. If they do, that could help explain some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">surprisingly bulky black holes</a> previously seen in mergers (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). But if merged black holes commonly get rocketed away from home, that would make multiple mergers less likely.</p>



<p>“Kicks are very important in understanding how heavy stellar-mass black holes form,” Varma says.</p>



<p>Previously, astronomers have gleaned evidence of gravitational waves giving <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-gets-kicked-galactic-curb">big kicks to supermassive black holes</a>, the much larger beasts found at the centers of galaxies (<em>SN: 3/28/17</em>). But that conclusion hinges on observations of light, rather than gravitational waves. “Gravitational waves, in a way, are cleaner and easier to interpret,” says astrophysicist Manuela Campanelli of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>LIGO and Virgo data had already revealed some evidence of black holes getting small kicks. The new study is the first to report using gravitational waves to spot a black hole on the receiving end of a large kick.</p>



<p>That big kick isn’t a surprise, Campanelli says. Earlier theoretical predictions by Campanelli and colleagues suggested that such powerful kicks were possible. “It’s always exciting when someone can measure from observations what you predicted from calculations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glowing-spider-fossils-diatom-algae-goo">Glowing spider fossils may exist thanks to tiny algae’s goo </a></h4>

              
                <p>The secret ingredient for fossil preservation at a famous French site wouldn’t be found in a Julia Child cookbook. It was a sticky goo made by microalgae, researchers suggest.</p>



<p>An analysis of roughly 22-million-year-old spider fossils from a fossil-rich rock formation in Aix-en-Provence, France, reveals that the arachnids’ bodies were coated with a tarry black substance. That substance, a kind of biopolymer, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00424-7">was probably secreted by tiny algae called diatoms</a> that lived in the lake or lagoon waters at the ancient site, scientists report April 21 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>The biopolymer didn’t just coat the spiders’ bodies — it pickled them. By chemically reacting with the spiders’ carbon-rich exoskeletons, the goo helped preserve the bodies from decomposition, allowing them to more easily become fossils, the team hypothesizes.</p>





<p>A clue that this coating might play a role in fossilization came when the researchers, on a whim, placed a spider fossil under a fluorescence microscope. To their surprise, the substance glowed a bright yellow-orange. “It was amazing!” says geologist Alison Olcott of the University of Kansas in Lawrence.</p>



<p>The fluorescent imaging painted a bright, colorful palette onto what was otherwise a fairly faint spider fossil, Olcott says. In the original, she could barely tell the spider apart from the background rock. But under fluorescence, she says, the spider fossil glowed in one color, the background in another and the biopolymer in a third.</p>



<p>That discovery — along with an abrupt halt in early 2020 to any additional fossil-collecting plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic — swiftly shifted the focus of the team’s work. “Had it been normal times, this would have been a side note in a taxonomy study” classifying ancient spiders, Olcott says. Instead, “I really had to explore what I had,” she adds. “It was me and these images.”</p>



<p>The researchers next sought to identify the chemical makeup of the mysterious substance. The orange-yellow glow, the team found, comes from abundant carbon and sulfur in the coating. “That got me thinking about sulfurization,” Olcott says.</p>

<p>Sulfurization is the reaction of organic carbon with sulfur, which forms sturdy chemical bonds with the carbon, making it more resistant to degradation and breakdown — similar to how tire manufacturers harden rubber to make it more durable. The process requires a ready supply of sulfur available for bonding.</p>



<p>In modern times, such <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GB007062">a supply comes from the sulfur-rich gooey secretions of diatoms</a>, microalgae found floating in many waters around the world. When these secretions meet carbon-laden marine particles headed for the bottom of the ocean, this sulfurization process helps lock the carbon in place and possibly keep it buried in the seafloor.</p>



<p>Similarly, sulfurization might help to preserve delicate carbon-rich fossils, helping them to withstand the test of millions of years of geologic time, Olcott says. Scientists have often noted diatoms in the fossil-bearing rock formations of Aix-en-Provence, as well as at many similar fossil-rich sites, she adds. “Everyone’s seeing diatoms everywhere. Thinking about that and the chemistry, I was like, ‘Wait a minute. All the pieces are here to make this chemistry happen.’”</p>



<p>The arachnids’ preservation might have gone like this: A dead spider, floating in the water column, became covered in the diatoms’ sticky goo. The goo chemically reacted with the spider’s chitin exoskeleton, more or less pickling it and keeping the exoskeleton largely intact and ready for fossilization.</p>



<p>That scenario “makes sense based on what we know about organic sulfur cycling in modern environments so far,” says Morgan Raven, an organic geochemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Scientists still have a lot to learn about the conditions that allow materials like chitin to sulfurize, Raven says. “But this study highlights why that matters.”</p>



<p>For example, if sulfurization selectively helps preserve some types of organic matter — such as soft-bodied fossils — that “could be a crucial filter on our fossil record, influencing what we do and don’t know about plant and animal evolution,” she adds.</p>



<p>This process of diatom-assisted sulfurization may have been at work in other fossil-rich sites during the Cenozoic Era, Olcott says. That span of time began 66 million years ago, after an asteroid ended the Age of Dinosaurs, and continues to the present day. Before that era, diatoms were not widespread. That didn’t happen until <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hippo-poop-cycles-silicon-through-east-african-environment">silica-bearing grasses</a> sprouted around the world during the Cenozoic, offering a ready source of silica for the tiny creatures to build their delicate bodies (<em>SN: 5/1/19</em>).</p>



<p>It’s unknown if other biopolymer-producing algae might have helped fossilize soft-bodied creatures from even earlier, such as during <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites">the flourishing of Cambrian Period life</a>-forms beginning around 541 million years ago, Olcott says (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>). “But it would be really interesting to expand this further out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/large-hadron-collider-restart-upgrades">The Large Hadron Collider has restarted with upgraded proton-smashing potential</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a hiatus of more than three years, the Large Hadron Collider is back.</p>



<p>Scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cern-large-hadron-collider-shutting-down-2-years">shut down the particle accelerator</a> in 2018 to allow for upgrades (<em>SN: 12/3/18</em>). On April 22, protons once again careened around the 27-kilometer-long ring of the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, located at the particle physics laboratory CERN in Geneva.</p>



<p>The LHC is coming out of hibernation gradually. Researchers started the accelerator’s proton beams out at relatively low energy, but will ramp up to slam protons together at a planned record-high energy of 13.6 trillion electron volts. Previously, LHC collisions reached 13 trillion electron volts. Likewise, the beams are starting out wimpy, with relatively few protons, but will build to higher intensity. And when fully up to speed, the upgraded accelerator will pump out proton collisions more quickly than in previous runs. Experiments at the LHC will start taking data this summer.</p>





<p>Physicists will use this data to further characterize the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">Higgs boson</a>, the particle discovered at the LHC in 2012 that reveals the source of mass for elementary particles (<em>SN: 7/4/12</em>). And researchers will be keeping an eye out for new particles or anything else that clashes with the standard model, the theory of the known particles and their interactions. For example, researchers will continue the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">hunt for dark matter</a>, a mysterious substance that so far can be observed only by its gravitational effects on the cosmos (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>).</p>



<p>After several years of operations, the LHC will shut down again to prepare the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/large-hadron-collider-getting-upgrade">High-Luminosity LHC</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/18</em>), which will further boost the rate of proton collisions and allow for even more detailed studies of the fundamental constituents of matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">Muons spill secrets about Earth’s hidden structures</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza lies a mysterious cavity, its void unseen by any living human, its surface untouched by modern hands. But luckily, scientists are no longer limited by human senses.</p>



<p>To feel out the contours of the pyramid’s unexplored interior, scientists followed the paths of tiny subatomic particles called muons. Those particles, born high in Earth’s atmosphere, hurtled toward the surface and burrowed through the pyramid. Some of the particles imprinted hints of what they encountered on sensitive detectors in and around the pyramid. The particles’ paths <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-void-discovered-great-pyramid-giza">revealed the surprising presence of the hidden chamber</a>, announced in 2017 (<em>SN: 11/25/17, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>That stunning discovery sparked plans among physicists to use muons to explore other archaeological structures. And some researchers are using the technique, called muography, to map out volcanoes’ plumbing. “You can see inside the volcano, really,” says geophysicist Giovanni Leone of Universidad de Atacama in Copiapó, Chile. That internal view could give scientists more information about how and when a volcano is likely to erupt.</p>





<p>Muons are everywhere on Earth’s surface. They’re produced when high-energy particles from space, known as cosmic rays, crash into Earth’s atmosphere. Muons continuously shower down through the atmosphere at various angles. When they reach Earth’s surface, the particles tickle the insides of large structures like pyramids. They penetrate smaller stuff too: Your thumbnail is pierced by a muon about once a minute. Measuring how many of the particles are absorbed as they pass through a structure can reveal the density of an object, and expose any hidden gaps within.</p>



<p>The technique is reminiscent of taking an enormous X-ray image, says Mariaelena D’Errico, a particle physicist at the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Naples, Italy, who studies Mount Vesuvius with muons. But “instead of X-rays, we use … a natural source of particles,” the Earth’s very own, never-ending supply of muons.</p>



<p>Physicists have typically studied cosmic rays to better understand the universe from whence they came. But muography turns this tradition on its head, using these cosmic particles to learn more about previously unknowable parts of our world. For the most part, says particle physicist Hiroyuki Tanaka of the University of Tokyo, “particles arriving from the universe have not been applied to our regular lives.” Tanaka and others are trying to change that.</p>

<h4>No particle like it</h4>



<p>Awkward cousins of electrons, muons may seem like an unnecessary oddity of physics. When the particle’s identity was first revealed, physicists wondered why the strange particle existed at all. While electrons play a crucial role in atoms, the heavier muons serve no such purpose.</p>



<p>But muons turn out to be ideal for making images of the interiors of large objects. A muon’s mass is about 207 times as large as an electron’s. That extra bulk means muons can traverse hundreds of meters of rock or more. The difference between an electron and a muon passing through matter is like the difference between a bullet and a cannonball, says particle physicist Cristina Cârloganu. A wall may stop a bullet, while a cannonball passes through.</p>



<p>Muons are plentiful, so there’s no need to create artificial beams of radiation, as required for taking X-ray images of broken bones in the doctor’s office, for example. Muons “are for free,” says Cârloganu, of CNRS and the National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics in Aubière, France.</p>

<p>Protons and other high-energy particles from space hit Earth’s atmosphere and generate a deluge of other particles. Pions and kaons can decay into muons, some of which reach Earth’s surface, along with difficult-to-detect neutrinos. </p>

<p>Another crucial upside of muons: “They’re also very easy to detect,” says nuclear physicist Richard Kouzes of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. A simple detector made of strips of plastic and light sensors will do the trick. Other muon detectors require little more than a specialized version of photographic film. There’s no other particle like it, Kouzes says.</p>



<p>Muons have a negative electric charge, like an electron. Their antiparticles, antimuons, which also shower down on Earth, have a positive charge. Muon detectors capture tracks of both negatively and positively charged varieties. When these particles pass through material, they lose energy in various ways, for example, by colliding with electrons and knocking them loose from their atoms.</p>



<p>With that energy loss, muons slow down, sometimes enough to stop. The denser the material, the fewer muons will make it through to a detector placed underneath or to the side of the material. So large, dense objects such as volcanoes or pyramids cast a muon shadow. And any gaps within those structures will appear as bright spots within that shadow, because more muons can slip through. Interpreting such dappled shadows can open a vista into hidden worlds.</p>



<h4>Probing pyramids</h4>



<p>Muography proved itself in a pyramid. One of the first uses of the technique was in the 1960s, when physicist Luis Alvarez and colleagues looked for hidden chambers in Khafre’s pyramid in Giza, a slightly smaller neighbor of the Great Pyramid. Detectors found no hint of unexpected rooms, but proved that the technique worked.</p>



<p>Still, the idea took time to take off, because muon detectors of the era tended to be bulky and worked best in well-controlled laboratory conditions. To spot the muons, Alvarez’s team used detectors called spark chambers. Spark chambers are filled with gas and metal plates under high voltage, so that charged particles passing through create trails of sparks.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to advances in particle physics technologies, spark chambers have largely been replaced. “We can make very compact, very sturdy detectors,” says nuclear physicist Edmundo Garcia-Solis of Chicago State University. Those detectors can be designed to work outside a carefully controlled lab.</p>



<p>One type of resilient detector is built with plastic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particle-detector-matter-subatomic-images-physics">containing a chemical called scintillator</a>, which releases light when a muon or other charged particle passes through (<em>SN Online: 8/5/21</em>). The light is then captured and measured by electronics. Later this year, physicists will <a href="http://journals.andromedapublisher.com/index.php/JAIS/article/view/240">use these detectors to take another look at Khafre’s pyramid</a>, Kouzes and colleagues reported February 23 in the <em>Journal for Advanced Instrumentation in Science</em>. Compact enough to fit within two large carrying cases, the detector “can be carried into the pyramid and then operated with a laptop and that’s all,” Kouzes says.</p>

<h3>A look inside&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Scientists placed three different types of muon detectors in and around the Great Pyramid to map out the density of the structure and search for hidden chambers.</p>

<p>A different but particularly low-maintenance type of detector, called a nuclear emulsion film, was crucial to uncovering the Great Pyramid’s hidden void in 2017. Nuclear emulsions record particle tracks in a special type of photographic film. The detectors are left in place for a period of time, then brought back to a lab for analysis of the tracks imprinted in them.</p>



<p>Particle physicist Kunihiro Morishima of Nagoya University in Japan helped discover the secret chamber through work on an international project called <a href="http://www.scanpyramids.org/">ScanPyramids</a>. “Nuclear emulsions are lightweight, compact and do not require a power supply,” he explains. That meant that multiple detectors could be placed in prime viewing locations in one of the pyramid’s rooms, the Queen’s Chamber, and a small niche next to it. The detectors’ measurements were supplemented with plastic scintillator detectors inside the Queen’s Chamber, and gas-based detectors outside the pyramid.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of the void, Morishima and colleagues have been taking additional measurements to better sketch out its properties. The team placed emulsion detectors in 20 locations in the pyramid, as well as gas detectors in several different spots. Using their new array of instruments, the researchers determined that the void is over 40 meters long. Its purpose is still unknown.</p>



<p>A more extensive survey of the Great Pyramid, placing much larger detectors outside the pyramid, is being planned by another team of researchers. The detectors will be periodically moved to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08184">measure muons from multiple angles</a>, the team reported March 6 in the<em> Journal for Advanced Instrumentation in Science</em>. The result, says co­author and particle physicist Alan Bross of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">will offer a 3-D view of what’s inside</a> (<em><em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 44</em></em>).</p>



<p>Pyramids in other parts of the world are also getting closer scrutiny. Garcia-Solis and colleagues are now planning muography of the Maya pyramid known as El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico. Morishima and colleagues, as well, are planning work on Maya pyramids.</p>



<p>Scientists hope such studies might reveal new chambers, or features not visible with other techniques for peering inside of objects. Ultrasound, ground-penetrating radar or X-rays, for example, can only penetrate a short distance from the surface, Bross explains. Muons, on the other hand, give an in-depth picture. For studying pyramids, Bross says, “muons really are ideal.”</p>



<h4>Peering inside a volcano</h4>



<p>Vesuvius is a known menace in Naples and the surrounding municipalities that snuggle up against the volcano’s flanks. Infamous for destroying the ancient city of Pompeii in A.D. 79, the volcano has been quiescent since 1944, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mount-vesuvius-suffocated-not-vaporized-some-victims">a major eruption destroyed several nearby villages</a> (<em>SN: 2/29/20, p. 5</em>). But if it erupted, it would endanger the lives of roughly 600,000 people who live closest to it, and many others in the vicinity.</p>



<p>“Vesuvius always scared me,” D’Errico says. “I was born and I live under this volcano.” Now, as part of the Muon Radiography of Vesuvius experiment, or MURAVES, she seeks to better understand the volcano and its dangers.</p>

<p>Using muon detectors 1.5 kilometers from the volcano’s crater, the team is mapping out muon densities — and thus rock densities — at the top of Vesuvius’ cone. In a paper posted February 24 at arXiv.org, the researchers presented <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1033631/contributions/4529056/">preliminary hints of density differences</a> between the volcano’s northwestern and southeastern halves. MURAVES is still collecting data; future observations should help scientists understand finer details of the volcano’s internal structure, which is thought to be layered due to repeated eruptions.</p>



<p>Information about a volcano’s structure can help scientists predict what hazards to expect in an eventual eruption, such as where landslides might occur. And that could help scientists know what steps to take to reduce risks to people living nearby, says Cârloganu, who studied the dormant volcano Puy de Dôme near Clermont-Ferrand, France, with muography and is now working to image the aptly named island of Vulcano in Italy.</p>



<p>When Mount St. Helens in Washington erupted in 1980, for example, an entire flank of the volcano collapsed. The disaster killed 57 people and caused widespread damage. Knowing where a volcano’s structural weaknesses lie could help scientists better predict how an eruption might play out, and what areas sit inside the danger zone, Cârloganu says.</p>



<p>Cârloganu thinks muons will be useful for pointing out structural weaknesses, but not for giving a warning when the volcano is going to blow. Other researchers are more optimistic about muons’ capability for giving timely forewarnings.</p>



<p>Muography is ripe for <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2021.0320">inclusion in volcano early-warning systems</a>, Leone, Tanaka and colleagues wrote last November in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A.</em> But more work needs to be done to integrate muography with other established methods that help warn of an upcoming eruption, Leone says. These methods include seismic measurements, as well as observations of ground deformation and volcanic gas emissions.</p>



<p>Tanaka and colleagues are studying Sakurajima, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, near Kagoshima, Japan. One of the volcano’s craters, the Showa crater, erupted frequently until 2017 when the activity abruptly shifted to another crater, Minamidake. Comparing muography data taken before and after this shift revealed that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL084784">a new, dense region had formed below the Showa crater</a>, Tanaka and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. That hints at the reason Showa’s eruptions stopped: It was clogged with a dense plug of solidified magma, Tanaka says.</p>

<p>These results suggest that scientists can use muography to help predict volcanic eruptions, Tanaka says. In fact, using deep learning techniques on the muography data from Sakurajima, Tanaka and colleagues reported in <em>Scientific Reports</em> in 2020 that they were able to predict whether the volcano would erupt the next day, by analyzing the previous week’s data. The technique correctly predicted eruption days of the volcano more than 72 percent of the time, and correctly predicted non-eruption days more than 85 percent of the time.</p>



<p>Just as the discovery of X-rays unveiled a whole new way of seeing the world, harnessing muons could change our perspective on our surroundings. Attitudes toward a particle once thought to be unnecessary — unwanted and unloved by physicists — have been transformed. One day, perhaps, muons could save lives.</p>

<h3>Contraband revealed</h3>



<p>Superman’s X-ray vision was impressive. But some scientists might prefer muon vision. For example, muons could help officials peer inside closed shipping containers “to see if there is something suspicious inside,” says particle physicist Andrea Giammanco of the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. A European Union–funded project called <a href="https://silentborder.eu/">Silent Border</a> aims to develop a method to uncover dangerous contraband at customs checkpoints without having to physically open and inspect every container that passes through.</p>



<p>The key to this technique is measuring how muons scatter. When muons pass through a material, some are absorbed and some scatter, changing direction. Using detectors above and below an object, scientists can observe how a muon’s trajectory changes as it passes through the object. Since muons tend to scatter away at larger angles in materials made of heavier elements, this technique can reveal substances such as uranium.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">What experts told me to do after my positive COVID-19 at-home test</a></h4>

              
                <p>After two years of successfully evading getting COVID-19 — including a few brushes with close contacts, a couple of<em> are-they-just-colds?</em> scares and lots of negative tests — I recently tested positive.</p>



<p>It felt both inevitable and shocking. I somehow avoided testing positive during the omicron surge that infected most of my friends this winter, so I figured that either I was invincible or I was next. Staring at my at-home rapid antigen test, I had to acknowledge that the long game of high-stakes tag was finally over. I was now “it.”</p>



<p>COVID-19 snuck up on me when I least expected it. Cases are low where I live in Queens, N.Y. And riding the subway felt low risk thanks to the federal public transit mask mandate. (A federal judge struck down the mandate on April 18, although the Biden administration announced April 20 it would appeal the ruling and some places, including New York City, are keeping masking requirements in place for the time being.) I had dined indoors, but I <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mask-guidelines-community-risk">still wore my mask</a> inside public spaces (<em>SN: 3/25/22</em>). So when I woke up with a sore throat on a Wednesday, I chalked it up to needing more sleep. Before I tested Friday evening, I was still convinced it was just another cold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two thick lines on my <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-questions-vaccines-variants-accuracy">rapid test</a> said otherwise (<em>SN: 12/17/21</em>). OK, I thought, I definitely have COVID. Now what?</p>

Gibbs</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>I had a pretty good idea of the first few steps, which had been drilled into my head ad nauseam: Isolate immediately. Text close contacts from the 48 hours before first symptoms. Stay away from other people and pets in the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It got blurrier from there. Since I tested myself at home, my COVID-19 test wasn’t official. Surely I should report my positive test; after all, public health regulations are often based on case numbers. But it turns out that playing my part was a lot harder than I would have thought. </p>





<p>When it comes to reporting at-home tests, “there is no formal recommendation,” says Autumn Gertz, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who works on COVID-19 surveillance. Without a federal program for reporting at-home tests, states are left to their own devices, and it’s confusing to make sense of where to report, which means that many people won’t.&nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>That’s problematic: Now that at-home tests are <a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">free and easy to access</a>, at-home testing is becoming increasingly common. Gertz and colleagues are tracking at-home testing trends and say they have noticed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7113e1.htm?s_cid=mm7113e1_w">a gradual increase in their use to detect COVID-19</a>. In the coming weeks, Gertz says they expect 50 percent of people who get COVID-19 to find out from an at-home test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cases being underreported is nothing new. Even early on, asymptomatic and mild cases where the person never got tested wouldn’t make the case count. But at-home testing will make underreporting even more prevalent. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s data show that <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/state-of-affairs-can-we-trust-case?s=r">only an estimated 7 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 cases are being reported</a>, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas in Dallas who writes the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter, reports April 13 in a post titled “Can we trust case numbers?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make my case count, I donned two KN95 masks and walked to the COVID-19 testing booth on my street to get a PCR test that would be officially reported. (An official PCR test result may also be necessary for insurance coverage in cases that require medical care.) The downside is that I was contagious so there was a risk of exposing others to the virus, though I was masked for all but the swab. An alternative, Gertz suggests, is reporting your positive at-home test to a primary care provider. Some at-home test manufacturers also provide information about how to report results from that test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But until public health reporting catches up with the quick transition to at-home testing, we’re flying blind. There are ways to find clues about what’s going on in your community, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, become familiar with your local public health department website, says epidemiologist Michael Mina, the chief science officer at eMed, a company developing a system for at-home test reporting. Check to see if your community <a href="https://biobot.io/data/">monitors wastewater</a>, which is a better way to track the amount of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in communities than case numbers or hospitalizations. <a href="https://outbreaksnearme.org/us/en-US">Outbreaks Near Me</a>, a project Gertz works on, also collects results from volunteers to help track COVID-19 trends down to the local level.</p>





<p>In general, “be aware, and try to keep your eyes open for signals,” Mina says. That includes not discounting anecdotes: “If you start to hear, like, ‘Hey, you know, I&#8217;ve had a bunch of friends who are positive lately,’ that&#8217;s probably a really good indicator … that there&#8217;s a lot of COVID happening in our community right now.” And that it’s a good time to start taking extra precautions again.</p>



<p>Speaking of precautions, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html">isolation guidelines</a> put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I could have returned to the world without a mask on the 10th day after my symptoms started. But I learned from Mina that you can <a href="https://coviddatadispatch.com/2022/04/17/the-cdcs-isolation-guidance-is-not-based-on-data/">still be contagious</a> after 10 days. So how do I know if I can still infect others?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turns out it’s a complicated question. There’s no magic number of days in which all people will no longer be contagious. And you can still have symptoms and not be contagious, and vice versa. But rapid at-home tests are a great indicator — albeit imperfect — of current contagiousness. (That’s unlike PCR tests, which are extremely sensitive to any remaining virus in your system long after you stop shedding it.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How contagious a person is roughly relates to their viral load, or how many virus particles they have in their body. Early research suggested that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is at its highest just before or when symptoms emerge and then rapidly declines after onset of symptoms. That data informed the CDC’s decision to cut its isolation recommendation from 10 days to five days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But several recent studies suggest that people infected during the recent COVID-19 surge continue to be contagious after five days. A preprint that studied omicron infections in NBA players found that, after five days of symptoms,<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.13.22269257v1"> about half of the players still showed significant viral load</a>. In another preprint, Mina and researchers at the University of Chicago found that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.01.22269931v1">43 percent of rapid tests from 260 vaccinated health care workers were still positive</a> between five and 10 days after their symptoms appeared. Both studies have yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post">
<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>“This isn&#8217;t like a small fraction of people who are still positive and infectious at five days,” Mina says. One possible explanation for these observations is that people who are vaccinated or have been previously infected have a quicker immune system response to the virus. So initial symptoms are caused by your immune response, not a high viral load, which comes later. “I would highly, highly, highly recommend people not listen to the five-day-to-exit-isolation recommendation,” Mina says. “That was based on old data.”</p>



<p>Instead, experts say, the best way to figure out whether you’re contagious after day five is by taking a rapid at-home test, which measures the amount of viral proteins in your system in real time. You can even get a sense of how infectious you are by the intensity of the positive line on your test, and the speed at which it develops. If your positive line appears quickly, chances are you have an extremely high viral load. If it takes most of the allotted test time and the line is faint, there’s likely less virus in your body.</p>



<p>But because it takes a lot of virus for the tests to turn positive, &#8220;you should assume that you&#8217;re infectious&#8221; if any line shows up, Mina says. Even after you’ve tested negative (twice, if possible), still avoid high-risk activities, like visiting an elderly relative.</p>



<p>By my 12th day in, my symptoms were mostly gone but for a lingering cough and a new proclivity for napping. But I was still testing positive on my rapid test, even though the line was much fainter than it used to be.</p>



<p>I wish there was an on-off switch. But, like with most things in this pandemic, it’s a squishy gray area. For all the public health recommendations, personal navigation of this virus comes down to individual everyday decisions. We hold a lot of power, and often, it feels like, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-moral-judgment-activity-risk-behavior-bias">not enough knowledge</a> to make such decisions (<em>SN: 6/16/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s OK to be confused about all this,” Mina says. “I think a lot of people feel isolated right now and feel confused by this pandemic.” Even doctors have a hard time keeping up with the nuances and changes, he adds.</p>



<p>As for me, I finally tested negative 14 days after my symptoms started. Given Mina’s advice on testing negative twice, I’m still going to be careful, but I feel a little safer now.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Have you ever believed someone to be decent — but then they did something morally bad, which turned that belief on its head? It happens more often than we might think. And, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/19485506221076685">new work</a> in <em>Social Psychology and Personality Science</em>, the consequences are far-reaching.</p>



<span id="more-46055"></span>



<p>In two initial studies, Kate W. Guan and Steven J. Heine at the University of British Columbia recruited online participants who reported having had this type of experience. After reporting details about the event and the perpetrator, participants answered a series of questions about how they felt before, during and after it happened. These questions probed their perceptions of the perpetrator’s character, their general beliefs about the world and other people, and confidence in their ability to judge character.</p>



<p>The results suggest that the experience of a “good” person doing something immoral is so unsettling, it makes us doubt our ability to judge character and also makes the world feel like a more confusing place. The starker the contrast between the participants&#8217; impressions of the perpetrator’s moral character before versus after their bad behaviour, the bigger the dent in their sense of being able to comprehend the world and their place in it. In the second study (though not the first), Guan and Heine also found that this experience leads people to a dimmer view of the moral character of people in general.</p>



<p>The researchers also report that some people were more affected in this way than others. Those who reported liking closure in life — who find it hard to tolerate uncertain situations — and those who felt that a person’s moral character is fundamental and unchanging reported the biggest shifts in their own attitudes.</p>



<p>However, in these studies, the participants had to think back into the past, and try to recall how they felt at various points. This experimental approach is notoriously vulnerable to mis-remembering. So the researchers then attempted a more real-time investigation.</p>



<p>A fresh group of 446 online participants imagined meeting a new person. Some were told that this person seemed “like a kind and likeable person” who was “objectively caring, helpful and upstanding”; others were told that they seemed “like an unkind and dislikable person”, who was “objectively selfish, cruel and hateful”. The participants then read about this person doing something bad — either engaging in hate speech or committing domestic abuse. Finally, they answered questions about how this information would influence their own beliefs and perceptions, similar to those in the first studies.</p>



<p>The researchers report that those who’d been led to believe that the person was kind and likeable reported a bigger threat to their sense of meaning in the world, as well as to their confidence in judging character — and to their moral impressions of other people, in general. It’s notable that a shift from good-to-bad had a bigger negative impact on the participants than a bad person engaging in another example of bad behaviour, the researchers write. But there is an obvious weakness to this study too — the participants only <em>imagined </em>how they’d feel; perhaps they’d feel differently in real life. </p>



<p>If we set the various limitations of this study aside, why <em>should</em> witnessing someone going from &#8220;good&#8221; to &#8220;bad&#8221; have a bigger impact?</p>



<p>The pair’s pretty convincing argument is that we feel a strong need to work other people out. To succeed in a social environment, we really need to know if another person is likely to be a trustworthy, helpful ally — or a threat.</p>



<p>Of course countless books, TV series and movies that grip us do so because they on play on this drive. I<em>s</em> a character really a goodie or a baddie? The more we are made unsure, the more we just <em>have </em>to know, and we keep reading or binge-watching. It makes sense, then, that moral character violations should make us reconsider our ability to judge others, and make us more cautious. Guan and Heine conclude: “The present findings advance a novel reason why people may bemoan such experiences. They threaten a core way in which we make sense of our social landscapes.”</p>

                <p>At the <a class="reference external" href="https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2022/04/21/wg-meeting-11-april-2022.html">meeting in April</a>, members of the working group discussed how we can make it easier for us to keep up with the activities of the working group.
While we do use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues">GitHub tickets</a> and receive notifications from GitHub for these, given that a lot of working group members have many many projects/repositories on GitHub makes these notifications quite noisy.
This makes it easy for us to miss notifications related to the working group&#8217;s&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>So, we agreed that a mailing list for announcements is the best way to go.
Malin was kind enough to set up a mailing list for us on the <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.incf.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo"><span class="caps">INCF</span> Mailman instance</a>.
You can subscribe to it here: <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.incf.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/incf-ocns-software-wg">https://lists.incf.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/incf-ocns-software-wg</a>  and mail to it at <code>incf-ocns-software-wg AT incf.org</code>.</p>
<p>This mailing list does not replace our GitHub tickets for discussion.
GitHub tickets work very well for us because they allow us to organise and assign tasks to ourselves using all of GitHub&#8217;s features.
Instead, this new mailing list is for announcements only.
All announcements for events, or tickets that need input from working group members and the community will be sent here.
This should ensure that everyone only has one well established channel of communication that needs to be monitored for working group&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to the mailing list (and join&nbsp;us!).</p>
