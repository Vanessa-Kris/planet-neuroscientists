A new tool called the R-factor could help ensure that science is reproducible and valid, according to a preprint posted on biorxiv: Science with no fiction. The authors, led by Peter Grabitz, are so confident in their idea that they've created a company called Verum Analytics to promote it. But how useful is this new metric going to be?



Not very useful, in my view. The R-factor (which stands for "reproducibility, reputation, responsibility, and robustness") strikes me as a flawed idea.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Most brain imaging studies involving transexuals or people with gender dysphoria have focused on whether their brains look more like what’s typical for the gender they identify with, rather than the gender they were born with. For example, whether trans men have “masculine” brains, and trans women have more “feminine” brains.</p>
<p>The results have been mixed and if anything point towards trans people having brains with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhu194">distinct</a> <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085914">features</a> that are neither stereotypically male or female.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9578-6?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">study</a> in <em>Brain Imaging and Behaviour</em> adds to this trend, showing that trans men have unusual patterns of connectivity in brain networks involved in processing of the self, as compared with male and female controls. “The present data do not support the hypothesis that sexual differentiation of the brain of individuals with gender dysphoria is in the opposite direction as their sex assigned at birth,” the researchers said, adding that the unusual connectivity patterns they found in trans men “was detected in comparison with both male and female controls, and there were no differences between the control groups”.</p>
<p><span id="more-29026"></span></p>
<p>The research team led by Jamie Feusner at University of California, Los Angeles, scanned the brains of 27 trans men (whom they refer to as female-to-male persons with gender dysphoria) recruited via a gender dysphoria clinic at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden where they’d been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, specifically transsexualism (according to <a href="http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/F01-F99/F60-F69/F64-/F64.0">ICD 10 criteria</a>). The trans men had not yet undertaken the surgery and/or hormone treatment that they were seeking; they had no other current psychiatric or neurological diagnoses. There were also 27 male and 27 female cisgender controls.</p>
<p>This was a resting-state brain scan, so the participants simply lay in the scanner doing nothing. The researchers then analysed the participants’ patterns of neural activity at rest to look for signs of connectivity in various brain networks, including the “default mode network” (which is more active when we’re mind-wandering and thinking about the self rather than engaged with the outside world) and the “salience network” which processes internal bodily sensations, among other things.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the trans participants and some of the controls also completed a body morph test (see example photographs above): they looked at images of their own body, shown for either half a second or two seconds, that were morphed to varying degrees with the body of another man or woman, and they had to say to what degree the photo was of themselves.</p>
<p>The trans men showed weak connectivity in areas of the default mode network as compared with both the male and female controls. As you’d expect, they were also more likely to rate the body morph photos as being themselves when they were morphed with a man’s body, rather than a woman’s or unmorphed. Moreover, at longer viewing times, this identification with a masculinised version of their own body correlated with greater connectivity within pregenual anterior cingulate cortex – part of the default mode network that’s associated with feelings of self. The controls didn’t show this correlation, but at shorter viewing times they (but not the trans participants) showed a correlation between seeing their unmorphed body as their own and connectivity within the right insula – a region involved in the rapid processing of internal bodily signals.</p>
<p>The interpretation of these different brain activity patterns is highly speculative but the researchers said the results are consistent with the idea that in trans men “higher cortical systems” were modulating the activity of more reflex systems involved in self and own body processing. The researchers said: “Gender dysphoria individuals differ from controls with respect to connectivity within networks involved in self-directed thinking and that relate to own-body identification, which could represent a neurobiological correlate of their condition.”</p>
<p>Whether these unusual brain activity patterns play a role in causing gender dysphoria or are the consequence of it, or both, is not clear. It also remains to be seen how surgical or hormone treatment might interact with these neural patterns. More research, especially longitudinal that tests participants over time, is needed to tease out cause and effect; and research with trans women is also required to see if the current findings generalise.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a raging controversy regarding a new drug spilled into the pages of a leading medical journal: the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and another official publicly called for the retraction or correction of a peer-reviewed article about the drug.

<p>
 Stem cell fate can be influenced by metabolite levels in culture but it is unknown whether physiological variations in metabolite levels in normal tissues regulate stem cell function in vivo. We developed a metabolomics method for analysis of rare cell populations isolated directly from tissues and used it to compare haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to restricted haematopoietic progenitors. Each haematopoietic cell type had a distinct metabolic signature. Human and mouse HSCs had unusually high levels of ascorbate, which declined with differentiation. Systemic ascorbate depletion in mice increased HSC frequency and function, partly by reducing Tet2 function, a dioxygenase tumour suppressor. Ascorbate depletion cooperated with Flt3ITD leukaemic mutations to accelerate leukaemogenesis, though cell-autonomous and possibly non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, in a manner that was reversed by dietary ascorbate. Ascorbate acted cell-autonomously to negatively regulate HSC function and myelopoiesis through Tet2-dependent and Tet2-independent mechanisms. Ascorbate thus accumulates within HSCs to promote Tet function in vivo, limiting HSC frequency and suppressing leukaemogenesis.

While poking around the literature, I found a fascinating unclassified document from the Army Research Laboratory, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Olfaction_Warfare.html?id=Bmy4oQEACAAJ" target="_blank"><i>Olfaction Warfare: Odor as Sword and Shield</i></a> (<a href="http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2013/ARL-SR-0258.pdf">PDF</a>). The authors provide a sweeping overview of odor, from chemical tactics in the natural world to the use of scents in the beauty and entertainment industries. The primary military application discussed by Schmeisser et al. (2013) is the use of odor in stealth operations. These are designed to deceive the enemy by masking current location or projecting smells to a false location. Although the document does not propose putrid odor as an offensive weapon, the authors discuss the history of such efforts.<br /><br /><br /><b>Stink Bombs</b><br /><br />Stink bombs are “devices designed to create an unpleasant smell forcing people to leave an area or protecting off-limits areas against being entered.”<br /><br />One unsavory application during WWII was used to make German officers smell like rotten meat, but unfortunately, “this substance was so volatile that it could not be confined to specific targets and contaminated everything in the area.”<br /><br />Another unsuccessful project from 1966 tried to develop “culturally specific stink bombs, which would affect Vietnamese guerillas, leaving the U.S. troops unaffected. The project was abandoned due to technical barriers.”<br /><br />But a more contemporary program reached the pinnacle of olfactory deterrence:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In 2001 the U.S. announced the development of the ultimate stink bomb aimed at driving away hostile forces by a stench so foul that it results not only in disgust or aversion but also fear. The odorant used in the bomb has been developed by a team of researchers led by Dr. Pamela Dalton at the <a href="http://www.monell.org/" target="_blank">Monell Chemical Senses Center</a> in Philadelphia and is <span style="color: red;"><b>a mixture of two agents: the U.S. Government Standard Bathroom Malodor (a mixture of eight chemicals with a stench similar to human feces but much stronger) and the Who-Me?, a sulphur-based odorant that smells like rotting carcasses</b></span>...</blockquote><br /><b>Scratch-and-Sniff</b><br /><br />Schmeisser et al.'s technical report makes for surprisingly entertaining reading. It's highly unlikely that any other military document praises <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester_(film)" target="_blank"><i>Polyester</i></a>, John Waters' 1981 multimodal film event that provided viewers with scratch-and-sniff cards. <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The cards had 10 numbered spots (1.roses, 2.flatulence, 3.model airplane glue, 4.pizza, 5.gasoline, 6.skunk, 7.natural gas, 8.new car smell, 9.dirty shoes, and 10.air freshener) that the audience scratched and sniffed when the appropriate number flushed at the corner of the screen. This system, called Odorama, solved the problem with hanging odors that was the main problem of the early smell-distributing systems.</blockquote><br />Waters' Odorama succeeded where the older scent distributions systems had failed. Smell-O-Vision (1939) and AromaRama (1959) were financial disasters for movie theaters, because “the odors were weak, the smells persisted longer than was desired, and the molecules were distributed by noisy systems.”<br /><br /><br /><b>Olorama<sup>TM</sup></b><br /><br />Present day technology for odor delivery has advanced beyond scratch-and-sniff, of course, and <a href="http://www.olorama.com/en/smells-in-cinema/" target="_blank">Olorama</a> offers an enhanced cinematic experience (“the smells jump off the screen”). The kits feature “very compact, hidden aromatization devices that are <b>installed under seats</b> (1 device for every 5-7 seats, depending on their size).”<br /><br />They also sell a product for home use. Olfactory enhancement of virtual reality is <a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/people/tfurness/courses/inde543/reports/3doc/" target="_blank">not a new development</a>, but this VR system looks stylish, at the very least.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP6UdwVL8LM/WZkK2GB7BoI/AAAAAAAAMPY/oEzXI_C4PEMluR8yy-oEdM7DySGjwjrYACLcBGAs/s1600/Olorama.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="898" data-original-width="878" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uP6UdwVL8LM/WZkK2GB7BoI/AAAAAAAAMPY/oEzXI_C4PEMluR8yy-oEdM7DySGjwjrYACLcBGAs/s320/Olorama.jpg" width="312" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span><a href="http://www.olorama.com/en/" target="_blank">Olorama Technology</a><sup>TM</sup></span></b></div><br /><br />The company stocks over <a href="http://www.olorama.com/en/list-of-scents/" target="_blank">70 scents</a> in categories such as Fantasy, Food, Wild, and...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><h2 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 18px;">ACTION</h2><div style="color: #887878; font-size: 15px;">FIRE - RAIN - FOREST   <br /><br />(AND COMING SOON...): <br />GUNPOWDER - BLOOD - BURNING RUBBER </div></div><br /><br /><b>Reference</b><br /><br />Schmeisser E, Pollard KA, Letowski T. <a href="http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2013/ARL-SR-0258.pdf" target="_blank">Olfaction warfare: odor as sword and shield</a>.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phenotypic Screening Pioneer Launches Novel Analgesia Panel</span></h2>
<p><span class="aligncenter" style="font-weight: 400;">In this Provider Innovation Profile, we’re proud to feature <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/melior-discovery-inc">Melior Discovery</a>, a pioneer of <i>in vivo</i> phenotypic screening and a leader in the area of drug repositioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melior’s platform evaluates compounds through up to 40 different animal models representing 14 broad therapeutic areas, potentially uncovering therapeutic efficacy that might be undetected using traditional assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Melior made the news with its novel opioidTRACE® Analgesic Profiling Platform. Given the need to develop low-abuse analgesics to address the opioid crisis, Melior has configured an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vivo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform aimed at specifically profiling opioid therapeutics and related analgesics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opioidTRACE® platform addresses the multiple features characteristic of opioids, including rodent models that evaluate acute analgesia, chronic analgesia, respiratory depression, GI mobility, and abuse liability. In addition to opioid testing, Melior has a wide array of animal models of analgesia ranging models of acute pain to chronic neuropathy models. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by Expertise in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vivo </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screening</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melior’s new panel is just the latest demonstration of the team’s unique know-how in applying “production-mode” methods for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vivo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> screening across multiple therapeutic areas. Its proprietary theraTRACE® platform enables rapid and cost-effective identification of new therapeutic potential by systematically screening candidates in a diverse array of validated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vivo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disease models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fibrosis is another disease area for which Melior’s panels have exemplified the utility of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in vivo </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phenotypic screening. Melior has validated models of liver and lung fibrosis; </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/melior-discovery-inc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">download the validation data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for these models from the Resources section of Melior’s Science Exchange storefront.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Requesters are Choosing Melior for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In vivo </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melior’s capability directly translates to efficiencies combined with high levels of quality for their clients. Positive ratings and testimonials illustrate the benefits that attract repeat business for Melior:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High reproducibility and predictive power of in vivo methodologies, models, and assays assuring high quality of data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower overall costs resulting from the availability of highly cost effective preclinical services from Melior</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid responses to requests for service and quick turnaround times for preclinical studies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to rapidly customize, design, and modify models in response to requests for specialized in vivo services or changes in protocols or unexpected results at any stage of the study</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Sridharan Rajamani, Senior Research Scientist at Gilead Sciences, said that his team chose Melior Discovery because they were responsive and cost effective.  “We are staying with them as a chosen scientific partner because of their thoughtful scientific input to experimental design and attention to detail,” said Dr. Rajamani. “Their expertise and flexibility allowed us to quickly adapt the study design and evaluate additional outcome measures to pursue unexpected activity.”  </span></p>

<p>Have you seen those people who come out of an exercise class with a spring in their step and self-satisfied smile on their face? They really pushed themselves this time and now they’re riding that endorphin high. To them, the ache and burn feels good. But it’s not so for everyone. Others find exercise unpleasant and unrewarding – the aches just, well, ache. Psychologists call this difference the “affective response to exercise” and in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029216303119?utm_content=buffer6b41d&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">a paper</a> in <em>Psychology of Sport and Exercise</em> researchers in the Netherlands report new evidence that it is to a significant degree genetically inherited.</p>
<p><span id="more-28970"></span></p>
<p>Nienke Schutte at VU University Amsterdam and his colleagues recruited 115 pairs of identical twins who share the same genes, 111 pairs of non-identical siblings who share roughly half their genes, 35 of their non-twin siblings, and another 6 non-twin sibling pairs (aged 12 to 25). The participants completed a 20 minute non-vigorous ride on an exercise bike and a non-vigorous 20 minute treadmill run. Their breathing was monitored to ensure the exercise didn’t become vigorous. There were also warm up and warm down periods and there was a second brief exercise ride to exhaustion.</p>
<p>While exercising, participants periodically rated how they were feeling on a scale from very bad to very good, how much they felt they were exerting themselves, and how much they were feeling various adjectival states, such as energetic, lively, jittery or tense. From these measures the researchers established the participants’ affective response to exercise. The researchers also interviewed the participants about how much and how often they participated in voluntary sport and exercise in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>By looking to see if affective response to exercise was more similar between identical twins than non-identical twins, the researchers were able to deduce how much it is genetically inherited (its “heritability” – in other words, how much the differences in the subjective experience of exercise between people is due to genetic influences).</p>
<p>The heritability for the affective response to exercise was significant. For instance, using the simple feeling scale, heritability was 15 per cent for the moderate cycle; for perceived exertion during the treadmill it was 35 per cent; and for the adjectival rating scale, heritability varied from 17 to 37 per cent for non-vigorous exercise, and 12 to 37 per cent for the ride to exhaustion, with the figure depending on the adjectives looked at.</p>
<p>Moreover, and as logic would dictate, affective response to exercise correlated positively with how much exercise the participants did in their everyday lives: those who found exercise more pleasant engaged in more exercise. And the analysis suggested genetic overlap between these measures: in other words, many of the same genes that influence the affective experience of exercise seem to be the same genes that influence how active people are in their lives.</p>
<p>One caveat: causal direction hasn’t been established here. It’s possible that doing more exercise can change how we experience exercise. In which case perhaps it is the known heritability of inclination to do exercise that is driving the apparent heritability of the affective response to exercise. Likely the influences are mutual. Another possibility is genetic pleiotropy in which the same genes have separate effects on different outcomes.</p>
<p>This study has uncovered a point of principle – that whether we experience exercise as pleasant or unpleasant is to a significant degree influenced by our genes. Establishing what those specific genes are, and what their other functions might be, is for the future. One candidate gene that the researchers mention is the gene that codes for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a peptide that has been shown to moderate the influence of exercise on mood.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting is the practical implications this line of research could have for interventions to help people take up more exercise. If some of us are genetically inclined to find exercise less fun and rewarding we might especially benefit from personalised exercise programmes that aim to reduce its arduousness and make it as enjoyable as possible.</p>

<p>Researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122379/">reported</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573678/">recently</a> that MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine; also known as Ecstasy) can act as a catalyst for psychotherapy, apparently improving outcomes for clients with previously intractable PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Now <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881117711712">a study</a> from the same group in <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em> has uncovered what may be the key psychological mechanism: lasting positive personality change, especially increased trait Openness to Experience and reduced trait Neuroticism.</p>
<p>Speculating as to how MDMA might facilitate these trait changes, the research team, led by Mark Wagner at the Medical University of South Carolina, and including Ann Mithoefer and Michael Mithoefer who’ve conducted <a href="http://www.maps.org/research/mdma">a lot of the recent pioneering research on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy</a>, observed that “Qualitatively, a consistent subjective theme emerged, with our subjects reporting a profound cathartic experience, often described as going to a ‘place’ (in their mind) where they had never been before”.</p>
<p><span id="more-28767"></span></p>
<p>The data come from earlier research that involved twenty participants (17 women) with a diagnosis of PTSD related to crime or war-based traumatic experiences and which had so far been untreatable with either drugs or psychotherapy.</p>
<p>The participants took part in up to 12 sessions of psychotherapy with a pair of therapists working together. Crucially, during two key experimental eight-hour long sessions in the middle of the course of therapy, half the participants received a dose of MDMA (125mg, with the option of a 62.5mg supplement), the others received an inert placebo. Among its effects MDMA can increase feelings of love, empathy, trust and friendliness and reduce fear.</p>
<p>During these key sessions, all participants were encouraged to introspect and were helped to process traumatic memories and experiences using cognitive restructuring and other techniques (<a href="http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v23n1/v23n1_p10-14.pdf">more detail</a>). In a later phase of the trial, those participants previously in the placebo group were given the option to take part in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.</p>
<p>We know from earlier published reports that the participants who took MDMA during the experimental psychotherapy sessions showed significantly improved and lasting recovery from PTSD compared with participants who took placebo (and there was no apparent harm from the drug). What’s new is that the researchers have now reanalysed the data, adding personality trait scores taken through questionnaires at baseline and two-month follow-up as covariates – allowing them to see if changes in personality traits appeared to be important for the differences in symptom outcome for the two groups.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what they found. When adjusting the data to account for group differences in change to Openness to Experience scores, there was no longer a recovery outcome difference between the MDMA and placebo groups. This suggests MDMA is catalysing psychotherapy by facilitating increased Openness in clients. Indeed, across groups, greater increases in Openness correlated with greater symptom improvement. The same patterns were true for reduced Neuroticism but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The new results complement past research that has suggested in some cases the symptoms of PTSD, including chronic social withdrawal and mistrust and feelings of estrangement, can manifest as lasting harmful personality change. It seems MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may help reverse the harmful personality changes sometimes associated with trauma.</p>
<p>“Individuals scoring higher on Openness tend to seek out new experiences and be open to self-examination, factors that can serve to enhance therapeutic change in both behaviors and cognitions,” the researchers said. “Qualitatively, and consistently with previous work, therapeutic change seemed to be associated with an epiphany-type experience that subjects consistently reported following the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions and reiterated in the long-term follow-up.”</p>
<p>Obviously this was a small study and the findings are at a very early experimental stage;  larger replication attempts are needed. A methodological shortcoming was that sometimes the participants and clients were able to correctly guess which group (MDMA or placebo) they were in. The researchers also caution that MDMA may not have beneficial epiphany-related effects outside of a psychotherapy context, in fact the opposite could occur (they added that medically managed MDMA is not the same as street Ecstasy which will be of unknown strength and may contain other ingredients which may be harmful).</p>

Last year, psychologists B. Keith Payne and colleagues breathed new life into the debate over 'social priming' with a paper called Replicable effects of primes on human behavior.



Behavioral or social priming - the idea that subtle cues can exert large, unconscious influences on our behaviour - was a major topic of research for many years, but it's since been largely discredited. The field’s reputation suffered when Diederik Stapel, a leader in the field, was exposed as a fraud. Many resea

<p>Smart people tend to perform better at work, earn more money, be physically healthier, and be less likely to subscribe to authoritarian beliefs. But a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31437-001">new paper</a> reveals that a key aspect of intelligence – a strong “pattern-matching” ability, which helps someone readily learn a language, understand how another person is feeling or spot a stock market trend to exploit – has a darker side: it also makes that person more likely to learn and apply social stereotypes.</p>
<p>Previous studies exploring how a person’s cognitive abilities may affect their attitudes to other people have produced mixed results. But this might be because the questions asked in these studies were too broad.</p>
<p>In the new study, published in the<em> Journal of Experimental Biology</em>, David Lick, Adam Alter and Jonathan Freeman at New York University decided to home in on social stereotyping. “Because pattern detection is a core component of human intelligence, people with superior cognitive abilities may be equipped to efficiently learn and use stereotypes about social groups,” they theorised.</p>
<p><span id="more-28731"></span></p>
<p>To explore this, they conducted a total of six online studies involving 1,257 people recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. In the first two studies, volunteers saw pictures of aliens that varied on four dimensions (colour, face shape, eye size, ears), with most of the blue aliens  paired with an “unfriendly” behaviour (like “spat in another alien’s face”) and most of the yellow aliens paired with a friendly behaviour (like “gave another alien a bouquet of flowers”). The volunteers also completed items from Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices, which assesses pattern-matching ability.</p>
<p>A subsequent memory test involved the same participants attempting to pair previously seen faces with their earlier behaviours, but there were also some new blue and yellow faces that actually they hadn’t seen before.  Participants who were better at pattern-matching were more likely to attribute unfriendly behaviours to new blue aliens than to new yellow aliens – suggesting that they’d learned colour–behaviour stereotypes more readily, and applied them.</p>
<p>In studies three and four, volunteers were instead shown realistic pictures of male human faces. The displays were manipulated, so that most of the faces with a wide nose (for some participants) or a narrow nose (for others) were paired with negative behaviours – like “laughed and jeered at a homeless person”. Most of the faces with the other nose type were paired with friendly behaviours – like “sent flowers to someone who was sick”.</p>
<p>After viewing the faces, the volunteers played a trust game involving sharing money. They were led to believe this was an unrelated interlude in the study. Before the game began, they chose an avatar from a large group of faces to represent them online. They then played 12 rounds of what they believed was a real game, each time with a different partner who was represented by their own avatar.</p>
<p>In fact, the volunteers weren’t playing with real partners, and the experimenters manipulated the “partners’'” avatar photos, so that some had wider noses, and some had narrower noses (there were also female “partners” whose nose width did not systematically vary). The team found that volunteers who did better on the test of pattern detection gave less money to partners whose avatars had a nose width related, in the earlier trial, to unfriendly behaviour.</p>
<p>However, when these volunteers were given new information that contradicted the stereotype they had implicitly developed, the better pattern-detectors were also quicker to update their stereotype – to reverse their biases.</p>
<p>In a final experiment, the team used a real-world set of stereotypes, relating to traits they believe are often associated with men (such as being more authoritative) and with women (such as being more submissive). After counter-stereotype training – effectively being told that being authoritative is more associated with women rather than men, for example – good pattern-detectors showed a stronger decrease in stereotyping.</p>
<p>“To our knowledge, these findings are the first to systematically demonstrate that cognitive ability is associated with greater stereotyping,” the researchers write, before adding, “people with superior pattern detection abilities appear to act as naive empiricists, both learning and updating their stereotypes based on incoming information.”</p>
<p>While existing research tends to focus on the benefits of intelligence, these “findings join a small body of work guiding the field toward a more balanced understanding of the consequences of human aptitudes,” they note. For example, it’s also been suggested that superior, misguided, pattern-matching <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19969378">may play a role in obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD).</p>

<p>
 The clinical benefit for patients with diverse types of metastatic cancers that has been observed upon blockade of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 has highlighted the importance of this inhibitory axis in the suppression of tumour-specific T-cell responses. Notwithstanding the key role of PD-L1 expression by cells within the tumour micro-environment, our understanding of the regulation of the PD-L1 protein is limited. Here we identify, using a haploid genetic screen, CMTM6, a type-3 transmembrane protein of previously unknown function, as a regulator of the PD-L1 protein. Interference with CMTM6 expression results in impaired PD-L1 protein expression in all human tumour cell types tested and in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, through both a haploid genetic modifier screen in CMTM6-deficient cells and genetic complementation experiments, we demonstrate that this function is shared by its closest family member, CMTM4, but not by any of the other CMTM members tested. Notably, CMTM6 increases the PD-L1 protein pool without affecting PD-L1 (also known as CD274) transcription levels. Rather, we demonstrate that CMTM6 is present at the cell surface, associates with the PD-L1 protein, reduces its ubiquitination and increases PD-L1 protein half-life. Consistent with its role in PD-L1 protein regulation, CMTM6 enhances the ability of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells to inhibit T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that PD-L1 relies on CMTM6/4 to efficiently carry out its inhibitory function, and suggest potential new avenues to block this pathway.

<p>
 Developmental deconvolution of complex organs and tissues at the level of individual cells remains challenging. Non-invasive genetic fate mapping has been widely used, but the low number of distinct fluorescent marker proteins limits its resolution. Much higher numbers of cell markers have been generated using viral integration sites, viral barcodes, and strategies based on transposons and CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing; however, temporal and tissue-specific induction of barcodes in situ has not been achieved. Here we report the development of an artificial DNA recombination locus (termed Polylox) that enables broadly applicable endogenous barcoding based on the Cre–loxP recombination system. Polylox recombination in situ reaches a practical diversity of several hundred thousand barcodes, allowing tagging of single cells. We have used this experimental system, combined with fate mapping, to assess haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fates in vivo. Classical models of haematopoietic lineage specification assume a tree with few major branches. More recently, driven in part by the development of more efficient single-cell assays and improved transplantation efficiencies, different models have been proposed, in which unilineage priming may occur in mice and humans at the level of HSCs. We have introduced barcodes into HSC progenitors in embryonic mice, and found that the adult HSC compartment is a mosaic of embryo-derived HSC clones, some of which are unexpectedly large. Most HSC clones gave rise to multilineage or oligolineage fates, arguing against unilineage priming, and suggesting coherent usage of the potential of cells in a clone. The spreading of barcodes, both after induction in embryos and in adult mice, revealed a basic split between common myeloid–erythroid development and common lymphocyte development, supporting the long-held but contested view of a tree-like haematopoietic structure.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/AIpb0mJnXxs/nature23652">Mechanism of intracellular allosteric β2AR antagonist revealed by X-ray crystal structure</a></h4>

<p>
 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) pose challenges for drug discovery efforts because of the high degree of structural homology in the orthosteric pocket, particularly for GPCRs within a single subfamily, such as the nine adrenergic receptors. Allosteric ligands may bind to less-conserved regions of these receptors and therefore are more likely to be selective. Unlike orthosteric ligands, which tonically activate or inhibit signalling, allosteric ligands modulate physiologic responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, and may therefore have fewer adverse effects. The majority of GPCR crystal structures published to date were obtained with receptors bound to orthosteric antagonists, and only a few structures bound to allosteric ligands have been reported. Compound 15 (Cmpd-15) is an allosteric modulator of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) that was recently isolated from a DNA-encoded small-molecule library. Orthosteric β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, known as beta-blockers, are amongst the most prescribed drugs in the world and Cmpd-15 is the first allosteric beta-blocker. Cmpd-15 exhibits negative cooperativity with agonists and positive cooperativity with inverse agonists. Here we present the structure of the β2AR bound to a polyethylene glycol-carboxylic acid derivative (Cmpd-15PA) of this modulator. Cmpd-15PA binds to a pocket formed primarily by the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments 1, 2, 6 and 7 as well as intracellular loop 1 and helix 8. A comparison of this structure with inactive- and active-state structures of the β2AR reveals the mechanism by which Cmpd-15 modulates agonist binding affinity and signalling.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/A_4Jw-DOLws/nature23643">CMTM6 maintains the expression of PD-L1 and regulates anti-tumour immunity</a></h4>

<p>
 Cancer cells exploit the expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) to subvert T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. The success of therapies that disrupt PD-L1-mediated tumour tolerance has highlighted the need to understand the molecular regulation of PD-L1 expression. Here we identify the uncharacterized protein CMTM6 as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in a broad range of cancer cells, by using a genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screen. CMTM6 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds PD-L1 and maintains its cell surface expression. CMTM6 is not required for PD-L1 maturation but co-localizes with PD-L1 at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes, where it prevents PD-L1 from being targeted for lysosome-mediated degradation. Using a quantitative approach to profile the entire plasma membrane proteome, we find that CMTM6 displays specificity for PD-L1. Notably, CMTM6 depletion decreases PD-L1 without compromising cell surface expression of MHC class I. CMTM6 depletion, via the reduction of PD-L1, significantly alleviates the suppression of tumour-specific T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the biology of PD-L1 regulation, identify a previously unrecognized master regulator of this critical immune checkpoint and highlight a potential therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion by tumour cells.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5vrgDODtADk/nature23642">Stromal R-spondin orchestrates gastric epithelial stem cells and gland homeostasis</a></h4>

<p>
 The constant regeneration of stomach epithelium is driven by long-lived stem cells, but the mechanism that regulates their turnover is not well understood. We have recently found that the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori can activate gastric stem cells and increase epithelial turnover, while Wnt signalling is known to be important for stem cell identity and epithelial regeneration in several tissues. Here we find that antral Wnt signalling, marked by the classic Wnt target gene Axin2, is limited to the base and lower isthmus of gastric glands, where the stem cells reside. Axin2 is expressed by Lgr5+ cells, as well as adjacent, highly proliferative Lgr5− cells that are able to repopulate entire glands, including the base, upon depletion of the Lgr5+ population. Expression of both Axin2 and Lgr5 requires stroma-derived R-spondin 3 produced by gastric myofibroblasts proximal to the stem cell compartment. Exogenous R-spondin administration expands and accelerates proliferation of Axin2+/Lgr5− but not Lgr5+ cells. Consistent with these observations, H. pylori infection increases stromal R-spondin 3 expression and expands the Axin2+ cell pool to cause hyperproliferation and gland hyperplasia. The ability of stromal niche cells to control and adapt epithelial stem cell dynamics constitutes a sophisticated mechanism that orchestrates epithelial regeneration and maintenance of tissue integrity.

<p>
 Synaptotagmin, complexin, and neuronal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins mediate evoked synchronous neurotransmitter release, but the molecular mechanisms mediating the cooperation between these molecules remain unclear. Here we determine crystal structures of the primed pre-fusion SNARE–complexin–synaptotagmin-1 complex. These structures reveal an unexpected tripartite interface between synaptotagmin-1 and both the SNARE complex and complexin. Simultaneously, a second synaptotagmin-1 molecule interacts with the other side of the SNARE complex via the previously identified primary interface. Mutations that disrupt either interface in solution also severely impair evoked synchronous release in neurons, suggesting that both interfaces are essential for the primed pre-fusion state. Ca2+ binding to the synaptotagmin-1 molecules unlocks the complex, allows full zippering of the SNARE complex, and triggers membrane fusion. The tripartite SNARE–complexin–synaptotagmin-1 complex at a synaptic vesicle docking site has to be unlocked for triggered fusion to start, explaining the cooperation between complexin and synaptotagmin-1 in synchronizing evoked release on the sub-millisecond timescale.

<p>
 The folate-driven one-carbon (1C) cycle is a fundamental metabolic hub in cells that enables the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids and epigenetic modifications. This cycle might also release formaldehyde, a potent protein and DNA crosslinking agent that organisms produce in substantial quantities. Here we show that supplementation with tetrahydrofolate, the essential cofactor of this cycle, and other oxidation-prone folate derivatives kills human, mouse and chicken cells that cannot detoxify formaldehyde or that lack DNA crosslink repair. Notably, formaldehyde is generated from oxidative decomposition of the folate backbone. Furthermore, we find that formaldehyde detoxification in human cells generates formate, and thereby promotes nucleotide synthesis. This supply of 1C units is sufficient to sustain the growth of cells that are unable to use serine, which is the predominant source of 1C units. These findings identify an unexpected source of formaldehyde and, more generally, indicate that the detoxification of this ubiquitous endogenous genotoxin creates a benign 1C unit that can sustain essential metabolism.

<p>
 Sepsis in early infancy results in one million annual deaths worldwide, most of them in developing countries. No efficient means of prevention is currently available. Here we report on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an oral synbiotic preparation (Lactobacillus plantarum plus fructooligosaccharide) in rural Indian newborns. We enrolled 4,556 infants that were at least 2,000 g at birth, at least 35 weeks of gestation, and with no signs of sepsis or other morbidity, and monitored them for 60 days. We show a significant reduction in the primary outcome (combination of sepsis and death) in the treatment arm (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.48–0.74), with few deaths (4 placebo, 6 synbiotic). Significant reductions were also observed for culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis and lower respiratory tract infections. These findings suggest that a large proportion of neonatal sepsis in developing countries could be effectively prevented using a synbiotic containing L. plantarum ATCC-202195.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/L0wsjOLsXqQ/nature23465">CDK4/6 inhibition triggers anti-tumour immunity</a></h4>

<p>
 Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumours. Their primary mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Here we use mouse models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer. The enhanced anti-tumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer treatment.

<p>
 Fenethylline, also known by the trade name Captagon, is a synthetic psychoactive stimulant that has recently been linked to a substance-use disorder and ‘pharmacoterrorism’ in the Middle East. Although fenethylline shares a common phenethylamine core with other amphetamine-type stimulants, it also incorporates a covalently linked xanthine moiety into its parent structure. These independently active pharmacophores are liberated during metabolism, resulting in the release of a structurally diverse chemical mixture into the central nervous system. Although the psychoactive properties of fenethylline have been reported to differ from those of other synthetic stimulants, the in vivo chemical complexity it manifests upon ingestion has impeded efforts to unambiguously identify the specific species responsible for these effects. Here we develop a ‘dissection through vaccination’ approach, called DISSECTIV, to mitigate the psychoactive effects of fenethylline and show that its rapid-onset and distinct psychoactive properties are facilitated by functional synergy between theophylline and amphetamine. Our results demonstrate that incremental vaccination against a single chemical species within a multi-component mixture can be used to uncover emergent properties arising from polypharmacological activity. We anticipate that DISSECTIV will be used to expose unidentified active chemical species and resolve pharmacodynamic interactions within other chemically complex systems, such as those found in counterfeit or illegal drug preparations, post-metabolic tissue samples and natural product extracts.

<p>
 The transition from dominant bacterial to eukaryotic marine primary productivity was one of the most profound ecological revolutions in the Earth’s history, reorganizing the distribution of carbon and nutrients in the water column and increasing energy flow to higher trophic levels. But the causes and geological timing of this transition, as well as possible links with rising atmospheric oxygen levels and the evolution of animals, remain obscure. Here we present a molecular fossil record of eukaryotic steroids demonstrating that bacteria were the only notable primary producers in the oceans before the Cryogenian period (720–635 million years ago). Increasing steroid diversity and abundance marks the rapid rise of marine planktonic algae (Archaeplastida) in the narrow time interval between the Sturtian and Marinoan ‘snowball Earth’ glaciations, 659–645 million years ago. We propose that the incumbency of cyanobacteria was broken by a surge of nutrients supplied by the Sturtian deglaciation. The ‘Rise of Algae’ created food webs with more efficient nutrient and energy transfers, driving ecosystems towards larger and increasingly complex organisms. This effect is recorded by the concomitant appearance of biomarkers for sponges and predatory rhizarians, and the subsequent radiation of eumetazoans in the Ediacaran period.

<p>“Figures such as Princess Diana, Oprah Winfrey, Mahatma Gandhi, Ronald Reagan, and Adolf Hitler share this triumphant, mysterious, and fascinating descriptor”, write the authors of a new paper on charisma. And yet, they add, “the empirical study of charisma is relatively young and sparse, and no unifying conceptualization of charisma currently exists”. The research and theorizing that has been done has focused on charismatic leadership, they explain, neglecting the everyday variety. In <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31803-001">their paper</a> in <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> the University of Toronto researchers describe how they developed their new six-item measure “The General Charisma Inventory” (GCI), and they show how scores on the GCI are associated with people’s persuasiveness and likability.</p>
<p><span id="more-28606"></span></p>
<p>The team, led by Konstantin Tskhay, began by asking just over a hundred American volunteers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online survey website to come up with four characteristics of charismatic individuals. The researchers then whittled these suggestions down in various stages, which involved volunteers rating the suitability of the items and other volunteers rating themselves on the items. Removing any redundancy, the researchers ended up with a six-item self-report measure of charisma loading onto two main factors to do with having influence over others (including being able to guide them) and coming across as affable (being able to make others feel comfortable and at ease).</p>
<p>Participants taking the new test are asked to rate their agreement on a five-point scale from 1 Strongly Disagree to 5 Strongly Agree, whether “I am someone who…”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a presence in a room</li>
<li>Has the ability to influence people</li>
<li>Knows how to lead a group</li>
<li>Makes people feel comfortable</li>
<li>Smiles at people often</li>
<li>Can get along with anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>(The first three items tap the influence factor of charisma and the last three items tap the affability factor.)</p>
<p>Having devised their test, the researchers put it through its paces in a number of ways. For example, they asked volunteers to complete the new charisma measure plus lots of other established psychological measures, and were able to show that scores on the new test are related to but distinct from established psychological constructs such as the Big Five personality traits, emotional intelligence and political skill. For instance, people’s scores on the the affability factor of the new test correlated with their trait Agreeableness, which makes conceptual sense. On the other hand, charisma scores appeared to be completely separate from intelligence, suggesting that “individual differences in general charisma are not redundant with cognitive ability”.</p>
<p>In another study the researchers asked small groups of unacquainted students to chat to each other for five minutes and to rate themselves and other group members on the charisma test. This showed that individuals’ charisma self-ratings on the test correlated with the charisma ratings they received from others. In another similar study, students’ self-ratings on the charisma test correlated with ratings they received from friends or family.</p>
<p>The researchers also asked pairs of unacquainted students to chat to each other for ten minutes and then rate each other’s likability. The students also rated themselves on standard personality measures and on the new charisma measure. The higher the students scored on charisma (specifically the affability factor), the more likable they tended to be rated by their partners, even after taking into account their scores on the Big Five personality traits of Extraversion, Agreeableness etc.</p>
<p>In another demonstration of the tests’ validity, the researchers asked more student volunteers to read out either a weak or strong argument for wind energy and then to complete the charisma test. Next, participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk listened back to the recordings and rated how persuasive they found them. When it came to the weak arguments, they found participants who’d scored themselves higher on charisma (specifically the influence factor) to be more persuasive. In relation to the affability factor, women who scored higher on this were rated as more persuasive, whereas for men the affability scores were not relevant (the researchers speculated this has to do with cultural expectations for women to be warm).</p>
<p>“We believe that the investigation of charisma in daily life is important for disentangling a construct previously understood primarily in terms of its consequences for leadership,” Tskhay and his colleagues concluded, “and hope that other researchers will share our enthusiasm about the potential new lines of research that this new conceptualization may elucidate.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/08/14/the-evidence-for-multitasking-is-it-overrated/">Multitasking: is it Overrated?</a></h4>

<p>The ability to multitask is usually viewed positively. But does it help in improving productivity? New research indicates that this is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>For years we have been hearing and being allured by the term multitasking, with many of us unwittingly believing that it is something supernatural and too good to neglect, and we ought to develop it in ourselves to succeed. But the question arises, is it as good as it sounds? What does the new research say? Is it possible for a person to concentrate and remain productive on several tasks at once?</p>
<p>Going through research articles can be perplexing for most of us, but most of the research seems to favor doing one task at a time. There are several downsides to multitasking, often resulting in decreased overall productivity and quality of work. A person who tries to finish one job at a time seems to do more at the end of the day. Multitasking could be valuable only to a certain extent if you are doing some simple tasks, but after a certain threshold productivity decreases and quality of work suffers. Multitasking often fails to improve productivity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it depends on the kind of tasks you are doing. If a person is doing lots of jobs, that are simple and the person performing them is adept at them, then maybe yes. At least in some cases, multitasking may be good, but generally, this is not the case. Some people are inherently inferior to others when it comes to multitasking. One thing that most scientific research demonstrates is that multitasking results in significant loss of accuracy. The more you multitask, the more errors you are bound to make, thereby leading to reduced overall productivity. Considering that in some cases performance errors can even be catastrophic, improved performance with most multitasking is a mere illusion that comes at the price of poor results and a higher error rate.</p>
<h3>Multitasking leads to mental overloading</h3>
<p>When people are given various tasks, they need some time to switch to another function. This results in the loss of both time and productivity. This switching time is directly related to the complexity of the task. If the task being switched to is complicated and less familiar, one needs more time then when attending to the more familiar task. Thus multitasking can result in mental overloading in reconfiguring mental settings from switching between tasks. Also, more information has to be in working memory while switching between the various functions, like the progress status of the previous task. Research shows that these short mental blocks between the switching can bring down productivity by as much as 40%. Scheduling tasks can more efficiently increase productivity than multitasking.</p>
<h3>What about gender differences?</h3>
<p>Women may be better at juggling between several tasks, but this is true only when the tasks are simple in nature; the kind of tasks achieved on a daily basis that requires little mental processing. Examples include cleaning the house while talking on the phone. But when multitasking involves more complex tasks, this gender difference becomes irrelevant. Therefore, talking on the phone while driving is equally dangerous for both sexes. In fact, one study demonstrated that women dislike multitasking as much as men do. Given a choice, women don’t seem to switch between several tasks more often than men. When multitasking, both genders perform equally poorly. Moreover, whether multitasking is done by free will or it has been forced due to job constraints does not seem to have any effect on productivity.</p>
<h3>Who is multitasking and why?</h3>
<p>One study focused on finding personality differences between self-proclaimed multitaskers and non-multitaskers. The study tried to find out why some people opt to multitask while others may avoid, and if the multitaskers are actually any good at multitasking. Results of the research were quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Most of the people who multitask are not necessarily good at it. In fact, the results pointed to the opposite: people who are good at multitasking usually avoid doing it. Generally, those who are impulsive sensation seekers tend to multitask. By multitasking, some of these people seem to gain pleasure. Another reason why certain people multitask is due to overbloated self-assessment. Individuals who more regularly multitask often overrate their capabilities and fail to understand that they are not better than others in multitasking.</p>
<p>Multitaskers make mistakes more often, and they seem to be less self-critical about their abilities, and they have a lowered understanding of their errors and losses. Furthermore, multitaskers are often people with attention deficits who have difficulty focusing on a single given task.</p>
<h3>What we know so far about multitasking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multitasking decreases productivity in most cases, by as much as 40%.</li>
<li>Multitasking results in much higher error rates, which reduces productivity and can be harmful in some cases.</li>
<li>There are no proven gender differences in complex multitasking.</li>
<li>Multitasking is often related to certain personality traits like being impulsive and sensation seeking.</li>
<li>Those that consider themselves as multitaskers are not typically the people who are good at it.</li>
<li>Multitaskers often lack the ability to concentrate properly on a given task.</li>
<li>Effectiveness of multitasking depends on the complexity of the job, with multiple complex jobs being harder to do at the same time than multiple easy jobs.</li>
<li>Scheduling the various tasks can increase productivity relative to multitasking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the existing research studies seem to favor doing tasks sequentially or one by one, rather than multitasking. Multitasking increases the risk of making mistakes, and this rule applies equally to both genders. Therefore, understanding the downsides of multitasking not only improves productivity but might also save us from catastrophic errors.</p>
