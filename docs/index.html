<h4>Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have revealed a special input pathway that holds the key to coding sensory information in the Cerebellum</h4>
<p>As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly bombarded by a steady stream of sensory information. Take a typical morning routine for example- roused from sleep by a shrill alarm, the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the brake lights and traffic horns of rush hour. In the course of a single day, we experience thousands of different cues across all senses.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous chaotic cues we encounter, our brains do a remarkable job assembling and processing them; allowing us to make sense of the world around us. This processing can take shape in very noticeable ways, such as our vision and hearing, but also occurs more subtly and unexpectedly. For instance, when learning a new movement, our brain is constantly keeping track of the sensory cues around us. This sensory snapshot helps to instruct and guide motor learning so that when we encounter the same context again, we’ll be more likely to perform the movement in better way.</p>
<p>Though there is a wealth knowledge supporting the idea that sensory cues benefit motor learning, the precise brain circuitry and mechanisms tying these two together has been debated in recent years. Shedding new light on this topic, a recently published paper in Neuron from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has revealed that a special input pathway into the cerebellum seems to hold the key to coding sensory information.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is a unique structure within the brain that plays a critically important role in motor coordination and learning that improves movements. By receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single neuron type called a Purkinje cell. One significant input to the Purkinje cells, are long-range projections called climbing fibers.</p>

The change in Purkinje cell response size closely parallels that of Climbing Fibers across modalities.</p></div>
<p>“Climbing fibers are very well-known and extensively studied in the field.” describes Dr. Michael Gaffield, Research Fellow in the Christie Lab and first author of the publication. “These fibers form long-range connections with the cerebellum and are thought to deliver instructive motor signals and relay sensory information. But in the past few years it’s been suggested that local circuits within the cerebellum, such as parallel fibers or molecular layer interneurons, may also play a part in coding of sensory information.”</p>
<p>To investigate, the team used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum of mice while presenting various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual and somatosensory). They then isolated and assessed changes in Purkinje cell activity that directly corresponded to the timing of each individual stimulus and climbing fiber input.</p>
<p>“Within each Purkinje cell, we saw a consistent enhancement of activity whenever a sensory stimulus was presented. But the enhancement wasn’t the exact same across all three sensory types, it varied depending on the type of stimulus presented” explains Gaffield.</p>
<p>Next MPFI scientists examined if other cell types besides climbing fibers, contributed directly to the sensory enhanced activity seen in the Purkinje cells. Using the techniques of optogenetic inactivation (suppression of neural activity using light) and chemogenetic inhibition (suppression of neural activity using drugs), the team was able to inhibit individual cell types in the local cerebellar circuitry. Despite altering the local activity, no change occurred to the sensory enhanced activity of the Purkinje cells. However, by inhibiting climbing fiber activity directly, the enhancement was abolished; indicating that climbing fibers alone are responsible for conveying sensory information to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Taking their investigation a step further, the Christie lab pioneered a novel technique allowing them to monitor the activity of climbing fiber axonal projections themselves. They discovered that when presenting sensory stimuli, the graded changes in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers was accurately represented in the Purkinje cells; stronger activity in the climbing fiber was precisely mirrored by stronger activity in the Purkinje cells they connect with.</p>
<p>“Our results actually came as a bit of a surprise” notes Dr. Christie. “Traditionally it was thought that sensory signals arriving in the cerebellum were integrated and processed by Purkinje cells using local connections. Our findings demonstrate that Purkinje cells are merely reflecting what the climbing is doing. This means that a more distal region of the brain is doing the actual processing of sensory information and simply relaying it to the cerebellum. “</p>
<p>“Since Purkinje cell activity is critically important for motor learning, we are now in the process looking at sensory-derived activity during more complex motor behaviors” describes Dr. Christie. “Hopefully we will be able to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie the climbing fiber’s unique ability to convey sensory information and how learning benefits from this coding scheme.”</p>

<p>Heather Holman is a member of the 2018-2019 Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Before coming to MPFI, Heather graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a double major in Biomedical Sciences and Sport &amp; Exercise Science. She will be attending the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) where she will pursue both an MD and PhD with a focus in neuroscience.</p>
<h4>Why was the Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program right for you?</h4>
<p>I chose to apply to the PRE program since I was looking for a post-baccalaureate program with a focus on basic neuroscience research and career development. Max Planck was a perfect fit since I not only got the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge research, but I also learned coding and professional skills through the PRE meetings.</p>
<h4>How has taking a year between undergrad and grad school helped your career focus?</h4>
<p>Having the opportunity to pursue research full-time solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD and conduct research throughout my career. The experiences I have gained through the PRE program have further developed my critical thinking skills and broadened my research knowledge which will certainly be beneficial during graduate school.</p>
<h4>What experiences did you have in the PRE program that stand out to you?</h4>
<p>My year at Max Planck has far exceeded my expectations. I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined. The equipment and resources available at Max Planck are phenomenal, giving students the opportunity to utilize technology they probably would never be able to access anywhere else. The PRE meetings are led by researchers at the institute which gives students the ability to learn first-hand about what it is like to pursue a career in science and obtain useful advice about career development. Additionally, we were able to attend the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting which exposed us to the latest neuroscience research and provided an awesome networking experience. We were also given the opportunity to take a course in Matlab coding which was not only useful for our projects in the lab, but will also be helpful throughout our careers.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to someone who is getting ready to complete their undergraduate degree but isn’t sure exactly what they want to do next?</h4>
<p>I would recommend taking a gap year to truly figure out what you are passionate about and want to pursue as a career. The PRE program is a fantastic opportunity if you are considering research as a career. It definitely solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD as well as boosted my application since it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where I was fortunate to learn about high-profile research being conducted throughout the Max Planck Institute.</p>

<p>Psychology’s replication crisis receives a lot of airtime, with plenty of examples of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/">failed replications</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/18/widely-used-neuroimaging-analyses-allow-almost-any-result-to-be-presented-as-a-successful-replication-paper-claims/">methodological issues</a> that cast doubt on past research findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But there is also good news: several key results in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/">cognitive psychology</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/06/theres-another-area-of-psychology-where-most-of-the-results-do-replicate-personality-research/">personality research</a>, for example, have been successfully replicated.</p>
<p>Now researchers have reproduced the results of another highly-cited study. Back in 2002, Emily Pronin and colleagues first described the “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202286008">bias blind spot</a>”, the finding that people believe they are less biased in their judgments and behaviour than the general population – that is, they are “blind” to their own cognitive biases. And while that study kick-started a whole line of related research, no one had attempted to directly replicate the original experiments.</p>
<p>But in a preregistered preprint <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331431431_Agency_and_self-other_asymmetries_in_perceived_bias_and_shortcomings_Replications_of_the_Bias_Blind_Spot_and_extensions_linking_to_free_will_beliefs">published recently to ResearchGate</a>, Prasad Chandrashekar, Siu Kit Yeung and colleagues report reproducing the original study, first in a small group of Hong Kong undergraduates, and then in two larger samples of 303 and 621 Americans who completed online surveys.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36768"></span></p>
<p>Each group was given detailed descriptions of eight cognitive biases such as “hostile media bias” (where people view neutral media reports as hostile towards their own point of view) and “self-serving bias” (where people take responsibility for their successes but not failures). They were also given descriptions of three visible “personal shortcomings”, like procrastination and fear of public speaking.</p>
<p>The participants rated the extent to which they thought they exhibited these biases and shortcomings, before rating how much other people generally show these tendencies. Consistent with Pronin’s original result, across all three studies participants thought that their own susceptibility to biases was lower than that of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When it came to rating personal shortcomings, the results diverged from the original study. While Pronin had found no difference in how people rated their own and others’ shortcomings, the new research found that participants rated their own shortcomings as less severe. However, this difference was small, suggesting that people are more “blind” to their cognitive biases – which remain invisible – than to personal weaknesses which may have much more obvious effects (e.g. being late to hand in an assignment due to procrastination).</p>
<p>Chandrashekar’s team also added a new spin to the original study by investigating whether participants’ blind spot bias was influenced by their belief in free will (rated by their agreement with statements like “I am in change of the decisions I make”), which is known to affect how people judge themselves and others.</p>
<p>Participants with a stronger belief in free will had a greater blind spot when it came to personal shortcomings. That is, the gap between how they rated their own and others’ shortcomings was larger than the gap for people with a weaker belief in free will. The authors suggest that this is because people who believe more strongly that someone’s behaviours and decisions are completely under their own control are less likely to see such shortcomings in themselves: for them, such an admission would imply they have some innate weakness that can’t be overcome through their own choices. Belief in free will did not have any effect on the blind spot for cognitive biases, however.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors write that their results “provide reasonable support” for the findings of the original study, suggesting that the bias blind spot is a robust phenomenon. But it’s perhaps surprising that it is reportedly the first direct replication of a piece of research that is more than 15 years old and has received nearly 1,000 citations. Hopefully, the new effort is a sign that the field is increasingly recognising the value in well-designed replication attempts – something the authors themselves acknowledge. “The study contributes to the recent call for systematic, large-scale, and preregistered replication and validation studies,” they write.</p>

<p>Having more testosterone makes men more aggressive – right? It’s a popular lay belief that’s supported by animal studies, but there’s been very little relevant research in humans. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619826970">study</a>, published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, reveals a more nuanced picture: some men are more affected by raised levels of testosterone than others.</p>
<p><span id="more-36761"></span></p>
<p>Shawn Geniole at Nipissing University in Canada and colleagues studied 308 men aged 18 to 40. After completing a personality questionnaire, the participants gave a saliva sample, so their baseline testosterone level could be measured, and also a mouthwash sample, for DNA extraction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants were told they would soon be paired with a partner for an online “decision making game”. But first they received a nasal gel, which was either a placebo or contained 11 mg of testosterone, and then they were videoed answering general personal questions, which they were told would be shown to their “partner” who was currently located in another room. To add even more realism to this cover story, the men then watched a video of their partner being interviewed in the same way (actually a researcher who provided scripted answers to the questions). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next came the “decision-making game”, which the men started half an hour after receiving the gel, and which was actually the well-validated “point-subtraction aggression paradigm”, which measures aggressive behaviour in response to provocations. (Points can be stolen from the other player, with no benefit to the participant themselves other than the satisfaction of penalising their partner; the number of points stolen is taken as a measure of behavioural aggression.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After this, the participants completed a questionnaire that asked about their impressions of the game and the other player. It asked, for example, “Did it make you feel good when you stole points from your game partner?” And “To what extent did you become angry when your game partner stole points from you?”</p>
<p>Earlier studies have suggested that testosterone has bigger effects on aggression among men who rank high on a personality measure of dominance. In this study, the researchers considered men who scored higher for dominance, higher for “independent self-construal” (which involves defining yourself in terms of internal attributes, such as traits, rather than in terms of relationships with others), and lower for self-control, as having high “personality risk” for the dose of testosterone making them more aggressive – and this is what they found</p>
<p>However, this personality effect was even stronger for the more than 200 men in the sample whose DNA analysis showed that they have a variation of the androgen receptor gene (that codes for the receptor that testosterone binds to) that makes the receptor more efficient. This “provides the clearest, albeit correlational, evidence to date that testosterone’s effects on human aggression are likely AR [androgen receptor] dependent,” the researchers write. They added that this is the first time that such fast-acting effects of testosterone on human social behaviour have been observed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Further analysis revealed that for the men with the more efficient androgen receptor, testosterone didn’t enhance the anger that they felt in response to being provoked — but it did boost the pleasure they derived from being aggressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This suggests that the dopaminergic system is involved in testosterone-promoted aggression. The high-risk personality traits noted in this study have also previously been linked to increased reward-related dopaminergic function, the researchers note. “If dopamine-mediated, testosterone may more strongly promote aggression among individuals with this personality profile because the profile may be indicative of an underlying hypersensitive dopaminergic system,” Geniole and his colleagues write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are some caveats in relation to the work. One, of course, is that it shows correlations between personality and the androgen receptor gene on the one hand and testosterone-linked increases in aggression on the other,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rather than demonstrating causal relationships between these factors. It also doesn’t look at the effects of testosterone on aggression levels in individual men, but rather across the experimental groups. As the researchers note, further work will be needed to rule out other explanations for their findings. It will also need to look at groups other than white men, who were used in this study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, potentially there could be significant real-world implications. For example: “It will also be important to determine whether these interactive personality-risk effects extends to more chronic doses of testosterone, such as those used in the treatment of hypogonadism [testosterone deficiency],” the researchers note. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Discussions between patients and clinicians to decide on goals of care can lead to fewer unwanted interventions, better patient outcomes, and lower costs, but few clinicians initiate or encourage these discussions.</p>
<p>The barriers that prevent clinicians from having goals of care discussions have not been studied, so the authors of this paper conducted a survey among physicians and nurses at one hospital. The survey asked oncology clinicians to rate the importance of possible barriers to goals of care discussions. Barriers related to the patient and their family, such as the patient (or a family member) not accepting a poor prognosis or lack of patient capacity to make decisions, rated as the highest barriers. Among other categories of barriers, lack of time also received a high rating.</p>
<p>The importance of the identified barriers highlights the need for specialized training for oncology clinicians to have goals of care discussions with patients who may need support to make decisions throughout the course of illness.</p>

The lifestyle habits that affect the later development of these diseases are formed in early adulthood. A focus on prevention is needed in this population, but few studies have examined the association of specific lifestyle habits and disease risk factors in young adults.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper on Swedish young adults, ages 18-26, studied adherence to dietary recommendations and associations with metabolic risk markers such as insulin resistance and body fat. They found that more than half of the participants ate more sweets than recommended while approximately 85% ate less fruits and vegetables and 90% ate less whole grain or fish/seafood than recommended.</p>
<p>When they studied the association between meeting each dietary recommendation and specific risk markers, they found that eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables was associated with lower body fat in all participants. A similar association was seen in women eating the recommended amount of fish/seafood. They also saw lower insulin resistance in all participants meeting recommendations for fish/seafood, fruits and vegetables, and sweets. These results highlight the importance of helping young adults bring their dietary habits closer to recommendations in order to prevent diabetes and other diseases later in life.</p>

An analysis of salary disparities between health workers working in the Caribbean and popular destination countries</strong></a></h3>
<p>Shortages of health workers in high-income English-speaking countries such as the US, the UK, and Canada have led to recruitment of trained health workers from poorer countries, including in the Caribbean. Poor working conditions and the perception of better standards of living elsewhere have led to high migration of health workers from the Caribbean. For example, approximately half of all doctors trained in Jamaica since 1991 have migrated to find work elsewhere. Understanding in detail the financial incentive to migrate could help Caribbean governments design policies to retain health workers.</p>
<p>To build an accurate picture of the increased salaries of health workers in high-income countries, the authors of this study used purchasing power parity (PPP) to compare salaries for nurses, doctors and specialists in the US, the UK, and Canada to those in four Caribbean countries. PPP exchange rates provide a more realistic comparison of salaries between countries by equalizing the cost of living between those countries.</p>
<p>They found that salary gaps were lowest with the UK, ranging from 85% higher for nurses with little experience to 184% for doctors with over ten years experience, and highest with the US, ranging from 123% for doctors with little experience to over 500% for specialists. This evaluation highlighted the financial incentive for health workers to migrate, even those with little experience, draining the resources of Caribbean countries.</p>

<p>Hospital-acquired infections are a serious risk, especially for vulnerable patients. Medical staff need to be aware of the risk and know how to minimize them, but time for practical lessons is limited in nursing school curricula.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper sought to demonstrate the importance of hand hygiene to nursing students by adding two short practical sessions, totaling three hours, to a basic microbiology course at their institution. During the first session, the students touched bacterial culture plates to leave a sample of the bacteria normally found on their hands. In the second session, seven days later, the students examined the bacterial colonies that had grown on the culture plates, noting the number and characteristics of the bacterial colonies.</p>
<p>In order to measure the impact of this practical demonstration, the students were asked to fill out questionnaires before and after the pair of sessions testing their awareness of surfaces that could carry bacteria and actions that could facilitate infection. Awareness scores increased after the sessions, showing that a brief, simple addition to nursing school curricula could improve nursing students’ awareness of infection risk.</p>

Nerd Food: On Product Backlog<div id="content"><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%"><p class="verse" style="text-align: left;"><small>Would be be good to have a better bug-tracking setup? Yes. But I think it takes man-power, and it would take something *fundamentally* better than bugzilla. <i>-- <a href="http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/bug_tracking.html">Linus</a></i></small></p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Many developers in large companies tend to be exposed to a strange variation of agile which I like to call "Enterprise Grade Agile", but I've also heard it called "Fragile" and, most aptly, "Cargo-Cult Agile". However you decide to name the phenomena, the gist of it is that these setups contain nearly all of the ceremony of agile - including stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives and so on - but none of its spirit. Tweets such as this are great at capturing the essence of the problem: </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Top tip: if you need to bring a notepad to the daily stand up to tell us what you did yesterday that's too many details</p>— Fran Buontempo (@fbuontempo) <a href="https://twitter.com/fbuontempo/status/686856528696086528">January 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  <p>Once you start having that nagging feeling of doing things "because you are told to", and once your stand-ups become more of a status report to the "project manager" and/or "delivery manager" - the existence of which, in itself, is rather worrying - your Cargo Cult Agile alarm bells should start ringing. As I see it, agile is a toolbox with a number of tools, and they only start to add value once you've adapted them to your personal circumstances. The fitness function that determines if a tool should be used is how much value it adds to all (or at least most) of its users. If it does not, the tool must be further adapted or removed altogether. And, crucially, you learn about agile tools by using them and by reflecting on the lessons learned. There is no other way. </p> <p>This post is one such exercise and the tool I'd like to reflect on is the <i>Product Backlog</i>. Now, before you read through the whole rant, its probably worth saying that this post takes a slightly narrow and somewhat "advanced" view of agile, with a target audience of those already using it. If you require a more introductory approach, you are probably better off looking at other online resources such as <a href="http://zerodollarbill.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-learn-scrum-in-10-minutes-and.html">How to learn Scrum in 10 minutes and clean your house in the process</a>. Having said that, I'll try to define terms best I can to make sure we are all on the same page. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">Working Definition</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>Once your company has grokked the basics of agile and starts to move away from those lengthy specification documents - those that no one reads properly until implementation and those that never specified anything the customer wanted, but everything we thought the customer wanted and then some - you will start to use the product backlog in anger. And that's when you will realise that it is not quite as simple as memorising text books. </p> <p>So what do the "text books" say? Let's take a fairly typical definition - this one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>The agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. When applying Scrum, it's not necessary to start a project with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all requirements. Typically, a Scrum team and its product owner begin by writing down everything they can think of for agile backlog prioritization. This agile product backlog is almost always more than enough for a first sprint. The Scrum product backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote> <p>This is a good working definition, which will suffice for the purposes of this post. It is deceptively simple. However, as always, one must remember Yogi Berra: "In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is." </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Potmenkin Product Backlogs</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>Many teams finish reading one such definition, find it amazingly inspiring, install the "agile plug-in" on their bug-tracking software of choice and then furiously start typing in those tickets. But if you look closely, you'd be hard-pressed to find any difference between the bug tickets of old versus the "stories" in the new and improved "product backlog" that apparently you are now using. </p> <p>This is a classic management disconnect, whereby a renaming exercise is applied and suddenly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village">Potemkin village-style</a>, we are now in with the kool kids and our company suddenly becomes a modern and desirable place to work. But much like Potemkin villages were not designed for real people to live in, so "Potmenkin Product Backlogs" are not designed to help you manage the lifecycle of a real product; they are there to give you the <i>appearance</i> of doing said management, for the purposes of reporting to the higher eschelons and so that you can tell stakeholders that "their story has been added to the product backlog for prioritisation". </p> <p>Alas, very soon you will find that the bulk of the "user stories" are nothing but glorified one-liners that no one seems to recall what exactly they're supposed to mean, and those few elaboratedly detailed tickets end up rotting because they keep being deprioritised and now describe a world long gone. Soon enough you will find that your sprint planning meetings will cover less and less of the product backlog - after all, who is able to prioritise this mess?  Some stories don't even make any sense! The final act is when all stories worked on are stories raised directly on the sprint backlog, and the product backlog is nothing but the dumping ground for the stories that didn't make it on a given sprint. At this stage, the product backlog is in such a terrible mess that no one looks at it, other than for the occasional historic search for valuable details on how a bug was fixed. Eventually the product backlog is zeroed - maybe a dozen or so of the most recent stories make it through the cull - and the entire process begins anew. Alas, enlightenment is never achieved, so you are condemned to repeat this cycle for all eternity. </p> <p>As expected, the Potmenkin Product Backlog adds very little value - in fact it can be argued that it detracts value - but it must be kept because "agile requires a product backlog". </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Bug-Trackers: Lessons From History</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>In order to understand the difficulties with a product backlog, we turn next to their logical predecessors: bug-tracking systems such as <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. This post starts with a quote from the kernel's Benevolent Dictator that illustrates the problem with these. Linus has long taken the approach that there is no need for a bug-tracker in kernel development, although he does not object if someone wants to use one for a subsystem. You may think this is a very primitive approach but in some ways it is also a <i>very</i> modern approach, very much in line with agile; if you have a bug-tracking system which is taking time away from developers without providing any value, you should <i>remove</i> the bug-tracking system. In kernel development, there simply is no space for ceremony - or, for that matter, for anything which slows things down<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2">2</a></sup>. </p> <p>All of which begs the question: what makes bug-tracking systems so useless? From experience, there are a few factors: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>they are a "fire and forget" capture system. Most users only care about entering new data, rather than worrying about the lifecycle of a ticket. Very few places have some kind of "ticket quality control" which ensures that the content of the ticket is vaguely sensible, and those who do suffer from another problem: </li><li>they require dedicated teams. By this I don't just mean running the bug-tracking software - which you will most likely have to do in a proprietary shop; I also mean the entire notion of Q&amp;A and Testing as separate from development, with reams of people dedicated to setting "environments" up (and keeping them up!), organising database restores and other such activities that are incompatible with current best practices of software development. </li><li>they are temples of ceremony: a glance at the myriad of fields you need to fill in - and the rules and permutations required to get them exactly right - should be sufficient to put off even the most ardent believer in process. Most developers end up memorising some safe incantation that allows them to get on with life, without understanding the majority of the data they are entering. </li><li>as the underlying product ages, you will be faced with <a href="http://tinyletter.com/programming-beyond-practices/letters/the-sad-graph-of-software-death">the sad graph of software death</a>. The main problem is that resources get taken away from systems as they get older, a phenomena that manifests itself as a growth in the delta between the number of open tickets against the number of closed tickets. This is actually a <i>really</i> useful metric but one that is often ignored.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. </li></ul> <p>And what of the newest iterations on this venerable concept such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>? Well, clearly they solve a number of the problems above - such as lowering the complexity and cost barriers - and certainly they do serve a very useful purpose: they allow the efficient management of user interactions. Every time I create an issue - such as this <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/852">one</a> - it never ceases to amaze me how easily the information flows within GitHub projects; one can initiate comms with the author(s) or other users with <i>zero setup</i> - something that previously required mailinglist membership, opening an account on a bug-tracker and so forth. We now take all of this for granted, of course, but it is important to bear in mind that many open source projects would probably not even have <i>any</i> form of user interaction support, were it not for GitHub. After all, most of them are a one-person shop with very little disposable time, and it makes no sense to spend part of that time maintaining infrastructure for the odd person or two who may drop by to chat. </p> <p>However, for all of its glory, it is also important to bear in mind that GitHub Issues is <b>not</b> a product backlog solution. What I mean by this is that the product backlog must be owned by the team that owns the product and, as we shall see, it must be carefully groomed if it is to be continually useful. This is at loggerheads with allowing free flow of information from users. Your Issues will eventually be filled up with user requests and questions which you may not want to address, or general discussions which may or may not have a story behind it. They are simply different tools for different jobs, albeit with an overlap in functionality. </p> <p>So, history tells us what does not work. But is the product backlog even worth all this hassle? </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-4"><h2 id="sec-4">Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"><p>One of the great things about agile is how much it reflects on itself; a strange loop of sorts. Presentations such as Kevlin Henney's <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/architecture-uncertainty">The Architecture of Uncertainty</a> are part of this continual process of discovery and understanding, and provide great insights about the fundamental nature of the development process. The product backlog plays - or should play - a crucial role exactly because of this uncertain nature of software development. We can explain this by way of a device. </p> <p>Imagine that you start off by admitting that you know very little about what it is that you are intending to do and that the problem domain you are about to explore is vast and complex. In this scenario, the product backlog is the sum total of the knowledge gained whilst exploring this space that has yet not been transformed into source code. Think of it like the explorer's maps in the fifteen-hundreds. In those days, "users" knew that much of it was incorrect and a great part was sketchy and ill-defined, but it was all you had. Given that the odds of success were stacked against you, you'd hold that map pretty tightly while the storms were raging about you. Those that made it back would provide corrections and amendments and, over time, the maps eventually converged with the real geography. </p> <p>The product backlog does something similar, but of course, the space you are exploring does not have a fixed geometry or topography and your knowledge of the problem domain can actively <i>change</i> the domain itself too - an unavoidable consequence of dealing with pure thought stuff. But the general principle applies. Thus, in the same way <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">a code base is precious</a> because it embodies the sum total knowledge of a domain - heck, in many ways it <i>is</i> the sum total knowledge of a domain! - so the product backlog is precious because it captures all the known knowledge of these yet-to-be-explored areas. In this light, you can understand statements such as this: </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When your product backlog is empty, your product is dead - <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">@KevlinHenney</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/agileotb?src=hash">#agileotb</a></p>— Marc Johnson (@marcjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcjohnson/status/507522331900915712">September 4, 2014</a></blockquote> <p>So, if the backlog is this important, how should one manage it? </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-5"><h2 id="sec-5">Works For Me, Guv!</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"><p>Up to this point - whilst we were delving into the problem space - we have been dealing with a fairly general argument, likely applicable to many. Now, as we enter the solution space, I'm afraid I will have to move from the general to the particular and talk only about the specific circumstances of my one-man-project <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Dogen</a>. You can find Dogen's product backlog <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org">here</a>. </p> <p>This may sound like a bit of a cop out, you may say, and not without reason: how on earth are you supposed to extrapolate conclusions from a one-person open source project to a team of N working on a commercial product? However, it is also important to take into account what I said at the start: agile is what you make of it. I personally think of it as a) the smallest amount of processes required to make your development process work smoothly and b) and the continual improvement of those processes. Thus, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions; all one can do is to look at others for ideas. So, lets look at my findings<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. </p> <p>The first and most important thing I did to help me manage my product backlog was to use a simple text file in <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> notation. Clearly, this is not a setup that is workable for a development team much larger than a set of one, or one that doesn't use Emacs (or <a href="https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer">Vim</a>). But for my particular circumstances it has worked <i>wonders</i>: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>the product backlog is close to the code, so wherever you go, you take it with you. This means you can always search the product backlog and - most importantly - add to it <i>wherever</i> you are and <i>whenever</i> an idea happens to come by. I use this flexibility frequently. </li><li>the Org Mode interface makes it really easy to move stories up and down (order is taken to mean priority here) and to create "buckets" of stories according to whatever categorisation you decide to use, up to any level of nesting. At some point you end up converging to a reasonable level of nesting, of course. It is surprising how one can manage <b>very</b> large amounts of stories thanks to this flexible tree structure. </li><li>it's trivial to move stories in and out of a sprint, keeping track of all changes to a story - they are just text that can be copy and pasted and committed. </li><li>Org Mode provides a very capable <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html">tagging system</a>. I first started by overusing these, but when tagging got too fine grained it became unmaintainable. Now we use too few - just <code>epic</code> and <code>story</code> - so this will have to change again in the near future. For example, it should be trivial to add tags for different components in the system or to mark stories as bugs or features, etc. <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-searches.html#Tag-searches">Searching</a> then allows you to see a subset of the stories that match those labels. </li></ul> <p>A second decision which has proven to be a very good one has been to groom the product backlog <i>very often</i>. And by this I don't just mean a cursory look, but a deep inspection of <i>all</i> stories, fixing them where required. Again, the choice of format has proved very helpful: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>it is easy to mark all stories as "non-reviewed" or some other suitable tag in Org Mode, and then unmark them as one finishes the groom - thereby ensuring all stories get some attention. As the product backlog becomes larger, a full groom could take multiple sprints, but this is not an issue once you understand its value and the cost of having it rot. </li><li>because the product backlog is with the code, any downtime can be used for grooming; those idle weekends or that long wait at the airport are perfect candidates to get a few stories looked at. Time spent waiting for the build is also a good candidate. </li><li>you get an HTML representation of the Org Mode file for free in GitHub, meaning you can read your backlog from your phone. And with the new editing functionality, you can also edit stories too. </li></ul> <p>Thirdly, I decided to take a "multi-pass" approach at managing the story lifecycle. These are some of the key aspects of this lifecycle management: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>stories can only be captured if they are aligned with the <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/vision.org">vision</a>. This filter saves me from adding all sorts of ideas which are just too "out of the left field" to be of practical use, but keeps <a href="https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#visionary">those that may sound crazy</a> are but aligned with the vision. </li><li>stories can only be captured if there is no "prior art". I always perform a number of searches in the backlog to look for anything which covers similar ground. If found, I append to that. </li><li>new stories tend to start with very little content - just the minimum required to allow resetting state back to the idea I was trying to capture. Due to this, very little gets lost. At this point, we have a "proto-story". </li><li>as time progresses, I end up having more ideas on this space, and I update the story with those ideas - mainly bullet points with one liners and links. </li><li>at some point the story begins to mature; there is enough on it that we can convert the "proto-story" to a full blown story. After a number of grooms, the story becomes fully formed and is then a candidate to be moved to a sprint backlog for implementation. It may stay in this state <i>ad-infinitum</i>, with periodic updates just to make sure it does not rot. </li><li>A candidate story can still get refined: trimmed in scope, re-targeted, or even cancelled because it no longer fits with the current architecture or even the vision. Cancelled stories are important because we may come back to them - its just very unlikely that we do. </li><li>every sprint has a "sprint mission"<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. When we start to move stories into the sprint backlog, we look for those which resonate with the sprint mission. Not all of them are fully formed, and the work on the sprint can entail the analysis required to create a full blown story. But many will be implementable directly off of the product backlog. </li><li>some times I end up finding related threads in multiple stories and decide to merge them. Merging of related stories is done by simply copying and pasting them into a single story; over time, with the multiple passes done in the grooms, we end up again with a single consistent story. </li></ul> <p>What all of this means is that a story can evolve over time in the product backlog, only to become the exact thing you need at a given sprint; at that point you benefit from the knowledge and insight gained over that long period of time. Some stories in Dogen's backlog have been there for years, and when I finally get to them, I find them extremely useful. Remember: they are a map to the unknown space you are exploring. </p> <p>With all of this machinery in place, we've ended up with a very useful product backlog for Dogen - one that certainly adds a lot of value. Don't take me wrong, the cost of maintenance is high and I'd rather be coding instead of maintaining the product backlog, especially given the limited resources. But I keep it because I can see on a daily basis how much it improves the overall quality of the development process. It is a price I find worth paying, given what I get in return. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-6"><h2 id="sec-6">Final Thoughts</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6"><p>This post was an attempt to summarise some of the thoughts I've been having on the space of product backlogs.

<p>It is not too long ago that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/">mirror neurons</a> were touted as one of the most exciting discoveries in neuroscience (or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/brain-myths/201212/mirror-neurons-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience">most hyped</a>, depending on your perspective). First discovered in monkeys, these brain cells fire when an individual performs a movement <em>or</em> when they see someone else perform that movement. This automatic neural mirroring of other’s actions was interpreted by some scientists as the seat of human empathy. The cells’ most high-profile champion, US neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran, described them as “the neurons that shaped civilisation” and, in 2000, he (in)famously said they would do for psychology what DNA did for biology. Nearly 20 years on, what evidence do we have that mirror neurons provide the basis for human empathy? According to a new meta-analysis and systematic review <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6bu4p/">released as a preprint at <em>PsyArXiv</em></a>, the short answer is “not a lot”.</p>
<p><span id="more-36755"></span></p>
<p>The research team, led by Soukayna Bekkali and Peter Enticott at the University of Deakin, searched the literature for all English language studies conducted in humans that had investigated whether mirror neuron activity was correlated with empathy.</p>
<p>This search led to the identification of 52 relevant papers involving over 1000 participants. These studies had used a range of methods to measure mirror neuron activity (including fMRI brain scanning, EEG recording of brain activity and TMS –  magnetic stimulation typically applied to the motor cortex, to check how much it had already been activated by witnessing movement by others). There were also various measures of empathy: mostly self-report questionnaires, but also measures of “motor empathy” (the automatic mimicry of other people’s movements) and the recognition of other’s facial emotions.</p>
<p>There was a notable lack of objective measures of empathy, such as looking at participants’ heart rate or skin conductance (the involuntary production of sweat as part of an emotional response). Overall, participant samples were small and there was great inconsistency in methods.</p>
<p>Bekkali and her colleagues broke down the literature according to whether the papers had investigated motor empathy, emotional empathy (feeling what someone else is feeling), and/or cognitive empathy (knowing what someone else is feeling or thinking).</p>
<p>Regarding motor empathy, the accumulated evidence pointed to no association with mirror neuron activity. Regarding emotional empathy, there was no evidence for a link with mirror neuron activity in one key brain region where these cells are thought to reside (the inferior parietal lobule; IPL) and only weak evidence for an association with postulated mirror neuron activity in another key brain area, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). “It remains unclear how the mirror neuron system relates to the experience of emotional empathy,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of cognitive empathy, there was no evidence for a mirror neuron link in the IPL and weak evidence of a link with activity in the IFG. “The current results suggest mirror neuron activity may play a role in cognitive empathy,” the researchers said, adding that “the mirror neuron system may potentially be one neurophysiological mechanism subserving cognitive empathy.”</p>
<p>One problem with interpreting the existing evidence base is that the results tended to vary according to the methods used, not only in terms of how mirror neuron activity and empathy were measured, but also according to the stimuli presented to participants, such as whether they viewed real images of people performing actions, or cartoons, and whether the images were dynamic or static. There is no currently accepted “gold standard” measure of mirror neuron activity in humans, the review authors also noted, and some evidence of a file-drawer problem in the literature, in which positive results are more likely to be published.</p>
<p>Finally, although this thorough investigation of the existing evidence base uncovered some modest evidence that mirror neurons may be involved in empathy – especially cognitive empathy (or understanding other people’s perspectives) – to date there is no evidence that mirror neurons play a causal role in empathy or are necessary for empathy.</p>
<p>When excitement about mirror neurons was at its peak, it was common for newspaper columnists and media commentators to reference these cells with confidence when discussing empathy. “It’s thanks to these cells that we are willing to help strangers in need”; “the best rom coms trigger our mirror neurons”; “altruists have more mirror neurons”, and so on. We were getting ahead of ourselves. After more than two decades of research, this new review provides a sober reminder that our understanding of the neural basis of empathy, and especially the role played by mirror neurons, remains far from complete.</p>

<p>Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he presents results from his Ph.D. research on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It is now well established that the brain retains its capacity to form and remove whole synapses in adulthood.
This type of plasticity, termed structural plasticity, is capable of altering connectivity, and therefore function, of neuronal networks of the brain over periods of days and months.
Although reports of disruptive effects of structural plasticity remain scarce, a number of lesion experiments have described the time course of synaptic structures during network reorganisation by homeostatic structural plasticity in great detail.
The underlying mechanisms that drive these changes, however, are yet to be explained.
To investigate the dynamics of synaptic structures reported in these lesion studies, we replicated a peripheral lesion in a biologically plausible spiking network model that exhibits cortical asynchronous irregular firing.
Here, we present results from our computational modelling study.</p>
<p>Results from our simulations suggest that for activity to be restored to deprived neurons in the lesion projection zone (LPZ), excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic structures must exhibit opposite activity dependent growth behaviours.
Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they contribute to the maintenance of optimal activity levels in individual neurons.
Where a reduction in neuronal activity results in the sprouting of new excitatory post-synaptic structures, it is accompanied by the retraction of their inhibitory counterparts.
Extra activity is similarly countered by a retraction of excitatory post-synaptic structures and sprouting of inhibitory ones.
Our simulations also reproduce the ingrowth of excitatory axons into, and the outgrowth of inhibitory axons out from the LPZ that have been observed in lesion experiments.
We find that the ingrowth of excitatory axons requires that sprouting of excitatory pre-synaptic structures be stimulated by extra excitatory neuron activity.
The outgrowth of inhibitory axons, on the other hand, necessitates the sprouting of inhibitory pre-synaptic structures to be prompted by a loss in inhibitory neuron activity.
In conclusion, by modelling repair following deafferentation that is faithful to experimental findings, we make testable predictions on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>

<p>Psychologists have devoted much time over the last two decades documenting <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/">the dark side of human nature</a> as encapsulated by the so-called Dark Triad of traits: psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism. People who score highly in these traits, who break the normal social rules around modesty, fairness and consideration for others, seem to fascinate as much as they appall. But what about those individuals who are at the other extreme, who through their compassion and selflessness are exemplars of the best of human nature? There is no catchy name for their personality traits, and while researchers have studied altruism, forgiveness, gratitude and other jewels in our behavioural repertoire, the light side of human personality has arguably not benefited from the same level of attention consumed by the dark side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full">Writing in the journal <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a>, a team led by US psychologist and author Scott Barry Kaufman at Barnard College, Columbia University says it is high time we redressed this imbalance. “Too much focus on one aspect of human nature at the expense of the other misrepresents the full capacities of humanity,” they write. Through four studies featuring more than 1,500 online participants, Kaufman and his team have created a new questionnaire that taps what they are calling the Light Triad (see example items below, and you can take the test <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/">online</a>). They’ve also provided preliminary evidence for the kind of personal characteristics and psychological outcomes that are associated with being a high scorer on the light side of personality – or what they call an “everyday saint”.</p>
<p><span id="more-36727"></span></p>
<p>The research involved participants rating their agreement with statements designed to tap into the more positive, compassionate and selfless aspects of human personality. Kaufman’s team took inspiration for these items from surveys used to measure the Dark Triad, but they made sure that their new items were not simply the Dark Triad questionnaire items in reverse; they also sought advice from experts in positive psychology and personality psychology to help them with the compilation. Participants also completed established measures of the Dark Triad, of the Big Five personality traits, and various other measures of psychological outcomes, well-being, values and characteristics.</p>
<p>The new 12-item Light Triad scale that the researchers settled on after removing redundant items taps three light traits: <strong>Kantianism</strong> (“treating people as ends unto themselves, not as mere means to an end”, as measured by agreement with statements like “I don’t feel comfortable overtly manipulating people to do something I want”); <strong>Humanism</strong> (“valuing the dignity and worth of each individual”, as measured by agreement with statements like “I tend to treat others as valuable”); and <strong>Faith in Humanity</strong> (i.e. “believing in the fundamental goodness of humans”, as measured by agreement with statements like “I think people are mostly good”).</p>
<p>The participants’ scores on the Light Triad traits were negatively correlated with their scores on the Dark Triad traits, but only modestly, suggesting that each is not merely the mirror opposite of the other, and that we all have varying levels of both light and dark traits. On an uplifting note, Kaufman and his colleagues found that their participants’ scores were skewed more towards scoring higher on the Light Triad than the Dark (see below). “Extreme malevolence was rare in the samples we studied,” they write.</p>

<p>Overall, and consistent with past research, younger participants, men, those motivated by power, sex, and selfish ambitions, were more likely to score higher on the Dark Triad. In turn, high scorers on the Dark Triad also tended to score lower on life satisfaction, agreeableness, self-transcendent values, compassion, empathy and belief in the good of humanity. More advantageously (in certain contexts), higher scorers on the Dark Triad also reported more casual sexual partners, greater creativity, bravery, assertiveness and leadership.</p>
<p>On the other hand, older people, women, those with more stable childhoods, and the more religious and spiritual, tended to score higher on the Light Triad. In turn, scoring highly on the Light Triad was associated with various appealing and beneficial sequelae, such as higher life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, feelings of autonomy and competence, higher conscientiousness, compassion, empathy, openness, humility and belief in the goodness of others.</p>
<p>There were also some possible downsides of being too much of an “everyday saint”, such as having weaker motives for achievement and self-enhancement (potentially impeding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/23/have-you-got-a-self-actualised-personality-a-new-test-brings-maslows-ideas-into-the-21st-century/">the pursuit of self-actualisation</a>, or being the best version of oneself); a proclivity for interpersonal guilt; and excessive trust and compassion that could leave one open to exploitation. Overall, though, Kaufman and his colleagues said that scoring higher on the Light Triad than Dark is associated with a greater quality of life, and they added “we believe that Light Triad individuals are more enjoyable to be around and likely to exert a more positive net effect on the world.”</p>
<p>The researchers do stress that this is exploratory work. It involved participants from mostly the US and UK, and relied almost exclusively on people rating themselves. There was one exception – an economic game, in which higher Light Triad scorers were, unsurprisingly, more generous to others.</p>
<p>I also put it to lead author Scott Barry Kaufman that sceptics may accuse his team of falling for the “jangle fallacy” – that is, relabelling the existing, well-established psychological concepts of agreeableness (a Big Five trait) and humility and honesty (from the HEXACO model of personality). Kaufman said it’s fair to suggest that the Light Triad traits are facets of agreeableness, but he believes there is value in digging deeper into these facets or sub-traits, as well as finding ways to measure them, so as to better predict outcomes that would be missed by only measuring the main, overarching positive personality traits.</p>
<p>“What I believe the light triad captures, and is not fully represented by existing facets of agreeableness, is a fundamental humanistic worldview, which includes a belief in the fundamental goodness of humans, and the motivation to treat individuals as valuable and worthy, regardless of what they can provide for you personally,” Kaufman added. “We live in such a world where everyone thinks their own problems and causes are more important than everyone else’s central causes, and we have lost an appreciation for the fundamental dignity of each other, even if they have very different political beliefs or come from a very different culture. The light triad worldview is desperately needed in the world today.”</p>
<p>Given this need, as well as the positive characteristics and wellbeing measures that the new research suggests is associated with scoring highly on the Light Triad, I also asked Dr Kaufman if there is anything the less saintly among us can do, to try to drag our personality traits out of the shadows and into the light. “Interventions that shift perspective, and increase a sense of universal love and self-transcendence,” could have this effect, he said. “This could include engaging regularly in a loving-kindness meditation, using new virtual reality technologies to engage in self-transcendent experiences (see <a href="https://davidbryceyaden.com/publications/">David Yaden’s work</a>) – such as awe (e.g., viewing images that are beautiful or inspiring), and even intentionally engaging in the perspectives of others that are very different from ours with rational compassion (see <a href="https://minddevlab.yale.edu/publications">Paul Bloom’s work</a>), curiosity, and loving-kindness.”</p>
<p>Increasing <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/05/27/no-being-kind-to-yourself-does-not-make-you-weak-or-immodest/">self-compassion</a> could be another route to increase Light Triad traits, Kaufman added, considering the strong correlation he and his colleagues found “between thinking that one’s own self is good and thinking that others are basically good”.</p>
<p>Kaufman and his colleagues, David Yaden, Elizabeth Hyde and Eli Tsukayama, conclude their new paper by acknowledging that the Dark Triad traits are certainly worthy of study when you consider the harm, at an individual and societal level, that is caused by high scorers on these traits. “However,” they write, “we believe that the light side of personality is also worth understanding. We hope that the current investigation stimulates further research on the good that those with Light Triad characteristics create in the world.”</p>

<p>Smartphone addiction (SA) is a controversial concept that is not recognised by psychiatry as a formal diagnosis. Critics say that a problematic relationship with one’s phone is usually a symptom of deeper underlying issues and that it is inappropriate to apply the language of addiction to technology. Nonetheless, other mental health experts believe SA is real and they’ve accumulated evidence suggesting it is associated with reductions in academic and work performance, sleep disorders, <a href="http://www.neuroregulation.org/article/view/18189">symptoms of depression and loneliness</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">declines in wellbeing</a> – and an increased risk of road traffic accidents. According to a group of psychiatry and psychology researchers at one of the largest universities in Brazil, to that list can now be added: poorer decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Studies suggest that the numbers of people with notional SA (defined by difficulty in controlling use of the smartphone, constant <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/05/07/a-new-questionnaire-measures-peoples-no-mobile-phone-phobia-or-nomophobia/">preoccupation with the possibility of being without it</a>, and poor mood when it is taken away) are high – about 25 per cent of the population in the US; <a href="http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/28421/1/5974_Lopez-Fernandez.pdf">10 per cent of adolescents</a> in the UK; and a massive 43 per cent of people in Brazil, where the new research, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00073/full">published in <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i></a>, was conducted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36724"></span></p>
<p>Previous work has found that people with other forms of dependency, including drug and gambling addiction, show impaired decision-making in ambiguous situations, though not when the risks associated with making a decision are clearly outlined. Julia Machado Khoury at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and her colleagues, including lab head Frederico Duarte Garcia, wanted to know whether the same might be true for people with SA.</p>
<p>Using a Brazilian version of the Smartphone Addiction Inventory, which was created in 2014, the researchers identified 47 graduate students aged 18 to 25 who scored high enough to qualify as having an addiction (according to the developers of the Inventory). The researchers then compared these students’ performance with those of 43 matched controls on two widely-used decision-making tasks. In the Iowa Gambling Task, which is meant to simulate real-life decision-making, participants must make as much money as possible by selecting face-down cards from four different decks, with each card indicating whether they’ve earned or lost money. Two decks are more advantageous in the long term, but the participants have to work this out for themselves through trial and error. In contrast, the Game of Dice Task requires participants to make as much money as possible through a series of dice throws in which the rules and the probabilities of winning different amounts are stable and so predictable throughout.</p>
<p>The high scorers on notional smartphone addiction performed about the same as the controls on the Game of Dice task. But they were worse, on average, at the Iowa Gambling Task – and the greater the severity of their purported addiction, as indicated by their SA inventory results, the worse their performance. As the researchers note: “Decision-making under ambiguity reflects more strongly the reality of daily decisions, which are made without prior certainty of the probability of each outcome.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers monitored all the participants’ skin conductance data throughout, they could also look for changes in arousal, which they took to indicate responsiveness to perceived rewards or punishments. Compared with the controls, the high scorers on smartphone addiction showed lower skin conductance responsiveness before disadvantageous choices, higher responsiveness after rewards (winning) and lower responsiveness after punishments. This “suggests difficulty in recognising disadvantageous alternatives, high sensitivity to rewards and low sensitivity to punishments,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They argue that the decisions of those scoring high in smartphone addiction are guided more by the search for rewards than the avoidance of punishments. They add that this could help to maintain and even worsen their addiction, and contribute to sliding academic performance and deteriorating social relationships.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Machado Koury and her colleagues suspect that people with pre-existing tendencies to favour gaining rewards over avoiding punishments may be more likely to develop smartphone addiction, which could then make these tendencies worse. Sceptical readers will note that the new research provides no evidence for this worsening effect, and may wonder about the other underlying psychological differences between the groups that could account for the findings.</p>
<p>For their part, the researchers argue that not only does this study help to bolster the argument that SA is a genuine addiction (the “same disease with another face”), but that the findings also have some clinical implications: “preventative strategies can focus on the development of emotional regulation, awareness of bodily signs/symptoms and postponement of rewards.” There are already effective strategies for helping people with all these things, including physical exercise, focused attention training, mindfulness, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Arguably then, these strategies may help people with an unhealthy relationship with their smartphone, and even prevent it from becoming problematic, whether we call that an addiction or something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

According to a new paper from Michael S. Avidan, John P. A. Ioannidis and George A. Mashour, this "second discussant" system could help ensure more balanced and objective inference in science.

<p>Edward Wakelam's journal club session, where he will present his work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student’s likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those at risk of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, though data mining and machine learning approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. Ed describes an experiment conducted on a final year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data is limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. Ed found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially at risk.</p>

<p>Millions of people around the world spend time and money on healthcare remedies that mainstream science considers ineffective (in the sense of being no more effective than a placebo), like homeopathy and acupuncture. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2018.1508685">study published recently in <i>Psychology and Health</i></a> investigated how to address this issue in the context of multivitamins, which evidence suggests provide no benefit for healthy people – and may even cause harm in some contexts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Despite this research evidence, huge numbers of healthy people take multivitamins because they appear to be helpful. Scientists refer to this as the “illusion of causality”: when someone takes a vitamin and then their cold goes away, for example, they may believe it was the vitamin that cured them, even though they would have recovered just as quickly anyway. Past research has shown that simply giving people the raw outcomes of clinical trials that show remedies to be ineffective does<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>not necessarily help combat this problem, perhaps because the data can involve large numbers and complex findings, which are difficult for the public to interpret.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Douglas MacFarlane and colleagues from the University of Western Australia have explored how to better inoculate people against this illusion. The researchers report that people need to be told clearly about the proportion of people who benefit from the remedy versus taking a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/11/the-placebo-effect-digested-10-amazing-findings/">placebo</a> – <i>and</i> this data has to be accompanied by a scientific explanation for why the remedy is ineffective.</p>
<p><span id="more-36712"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 245 undergrad participants and split them into several groups, which were each given different levels of information about the effectiveness of a multivitamin. At one extreme, a control group received no information about the number of people who benefited from the remedy, and was simply told that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against using it. At the other extreme, another group was told that 3 out of 4 people benefitted from the pills, but that 3 out of 4 people also benefitted from a placebo, so the evidence showed that the remedy doesn’t have any health benefit. This group was also given a scientific explanation for why this should be: healthy people already receive enough vitamins in their diet.</p>
<p>There were also various intermediate groups, such as one that received information about the proportion of people who get a benefit from the pills, but no information on the effects of placebo, and another that received information about the pills and placebo, but no scientific explanation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Afterwards, all participants were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a tube of the multivitamins. The only group who showed a reduced willingness to pay for the pills was the one given full information on the pills’ efficacy compared with a placebo <i>and</i> the scientific explanation of why they are not effective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results suggest that simplified frequencies showing how many people have and haven’t benefited from a remedy compared with placebo could help prevent the illusion of causality. This strategy could be used by health authorities to assist people making healthcare decisions, say the authors. At the moment, they write, bodies like the National Institutes of Health in the United States often frame disclaimers about ineffective remedies in diplomatic language about “insufficient clinical evidence”, rather than giving people this kind of simple, explicit data.</p>
<p>Importantly though, the new findings suggest these frequencies are only useful when given alongside a scientific explanation. “This component may serve to fill the mental gap created when a prior belief is challenged by scientific evidence,” write the authors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This conclusion comes with a hefty caveat, however. Because only one group was actually given the scientific explanation, it remains unclear based on the current results whether the explanation and the simple frequencies are <i>both</i> necessary. A scientific explanation about why a remedy is ineffective could, in theory, reduce a person’s willingness to pay regardless of how much they know about the underlying data. Of course, scientific explanations alone <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-persuade-people-with-facts/">can be pretty unsuccessful at changing people’s minds</a>, so this possibility seems unlikely – but it would be nice to see this question incorporated into the design of a future study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<strong>Mindfulness is everywhere these days, but is it really as beneficial as it’s often made out to be?</strong> Our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com">Ginny Smith</a> hears from clinical psychologist <a href="https://www.catherinewikholm.com">Dr Catherine Wikholm</a> (co-author of <em>The Buddha Pill: Can Meditation Change You?</em>); she visits the <a href="https://www.cambridgebuddhistcentre.com">Cambridge Buddha Centre</a> to meet people who have taken up mindfulness meditation; and she discusses some of the latest mindfulness research trials with <a href="http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=barney_dunn">Professor Barney Dunn</a>, a clinical psychologist at Exeter University. Some of the evidence is indeed promising, and mindfulness meditation could offer a cost-effective way to help many people with mental health problems. However, Ginny also discovers that many trials are ongoing, mindfulness is not risk free, and it may not suit everyone.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/max-planck-florida-institute-names-two-new-max-planck-research-fellows/">Max Planck Florida Institute Names Two New Max Planck Research Fellows</a></h4>

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience announces the appointment of two Max Planck Society Fellows, Drs. Michael Halassa and Yi Zuo. The fellowship program is supported by Germany’s Max Planck Society to promote cooperation between outstanding university professors and Max Planck Society researchers for a five-year period. The fellowship program is a longstanding hallmark of Max Planck Society collaborations, with more than 100 fellows being placed into collaborations with Max Planck Institutes around the world since the program began in 2005. Dr. Hallassa and Dr. Zuo are the first researchers to be awarded a Max Planck Society Fellowship at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, which was established in 2010 as the first and only Max Planck Institute in North America.</p>
<p>Michael Halassa is an associate investigator at the <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/">McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT </a>and an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences. During his fellowship, he will focus on research that provides new insights into the functional organization of the neural circuits underlying higher cognitive function that will have a significant impact on the field, and may be relevant for understanding conditions such as autism and attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>Dr. Halassa well known for his pioneering work on the neural circuits that give rise to cognitive processes like attention and executive function. His work focuses on understanding the role of the thalamus in cognition. He is the recipient of numerous awards and prizes, including the 2017 Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in the Biomedical Sciences and the 2015 Daniel X. Freedman Prize for Exception Research in Basic Brain &amp; Behavioral Science. He was also awarded the 2017 Takeda/New York Academy of Science Innovator Award, was recognized as the 2017 NYU Langone Medical Center Next Generation Star and was named the 2015 Allen Institute Next Generation Leader.</p>
<p>Dr. Yi Zuo is a professor in the <a href="https://mcd.ucsc.edu/">Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz</a>. She will work with MPFI researchers to develop and apply microscopy techniques to study how synaptic plasticity and brain circuits are affected in mouse models of mental illnesses and stress. The projects addressed through this fellowship are expected to provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic reorganization during learning and in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Zuo is a distinguished neuroscientist and one of the pioneers of chronic imaging of synapses in live animals. She is internationally recognized for her work on synaptic remodeling in development and learning. Over the past three years, Dr. Zuo has worked closely with Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in developing and organizing the advanced course <a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/education/short-course">“Neuro-Imaging Techniques”</a> together with Dr. Yasuda. In addition to teaching the course, Dr. Zuo has initiated a collaboration with Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Yasuda to develop new technologies for correlative light- and electron microscopy (CLEM). Dr. Zuo is the recipient of numerous awards and prizes, including the 2007 award from the Ellison Medical Foundation and the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR). She was also a 2015 National Award finalist for the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists.</p>

<p>In the first study of its kind, researchers have asked people to describe in their own words what it’s like to live with Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) – a diagnosis defined by psychiatrists as “a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation”. Like all personality disorder diagnoses, AVPD is controversial, with some critics questioning whether it is anything other than an extreme form of social phobia.</p>
<p>To shed new light on the issue, lead author Kristine D. Sørensena, a psychologist, twice interviewed 15 people receiving outpatient treatment for AVPD: 9 women, 6 men, with an average age of 33, and none of them in work. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jclp.22740">Writing in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em></a>, Sørensena and her colleagues said the overarching theme to emerge from the in-depth interviews was the participants’ <strong>struggle to be a person</strong>. “They felt safe when alone yet lost in their aloneness,” the researchers said. They “longed to connect with others yet feared to get close.” In the researchers’ opinion, the participants’ profound difficulties with their “core self” and in their dealings with others do indeed correspond to “a personality disorder diagnosis”.</p>
<p><span id="more-36689"></span></p>
<p>Beneath the overarching theme of struggling to be a person, there emerged two main themes, the first being “<strong>fear and longing</strong>“. This included participants’ descriptions of having to put on a mask when socialising and their difficulty feeling normal.  “<em>I notice that you spend incredible amounts of energy. You just spend your entire consciousness in just not … trying not to make a fool out of yourself and appear normal.</em>” (Steve). This constant performance meant they felt other people never really knew them. “<em>I have never felt seen. Not even my mother knew me like that. I know I have missed it. I never felt loved.</em>” (Lily). There were some rare exceptions to these difficulties. For instance, one participant said they felt authentic when with their young daughter, yet other participants described how, as their children grew older, their usual insecurities returned even when in their company.</p>
<p>Another difficulty that was mentioned repeatedly was the dread of getting close to others. “<em>I am very, very suspicious of people. Not that they would harm me physically, but what are their intentions? Or they seem nice, but really, they are not.</em>” (Eva). Coping measures included only interacting through email or text message, and when in physical company, avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>The participants also described a conundrum – the solitude that brought them comfort and safety was also suffocating. They were “feeling sad, almost grieving when they were alone”, the researchers said. “<em>There comes a heaviness, like ‘now you are alone again little man, and you will never manage this; you will die alone’</em>” (Peter). To cope, the participants said they kept busy playing computer games and listening to music. Most effective in this regard were physical sports and hobbies like making music, yet sadly the relief evaporated as soon as thoughts of being evaluated crept into mind.</p>
<p>The second main theme was “<strong>A doubting self” – </strong>including chronic insecurity and a fleeting sense of self. Participants had the perception that other people breeze through life and have no trouble being themselves. Related to this, the participants were constantly struggling to make sense of their own persistent insecurities. “<em>There is always something grinding in my head, so there is no rest. I do not know how to answer myself to make it better</em>” (Anita).</p>
<p>The constant acting and pretense when in company led to feelings “<em>like one is not even there</em>” (Amanda). Sometimes this developed into an emotional hollowness. “<em>I think that it is real fun or should be, but I do not feel anything</em>” (Eva). After wearing a mask for so many years, some participants feared they had forgotten who they truly were underneath. “<em>I feel like I do not know myself anymore</em>” (Amanda). On the positive side, participants found time in nature was therapeutic, especially when immersed in a physical challenge. “<em>There it is only me. I do not have to perform something for others to see. I find enormous pleasure from reaching the mountaintop. Then, you are kind of free”</em> (Elsa).</p>
<p>In short, the researchers said that their participants spend so much time “<span>reflecting on themselves that it seemingly disrupted their everyday life functioning”. They also lacked feelings of belonging, attachment and intimacy. Their suspicion of others and the burden of keeping up appearances “caused the participants to retreat from and thus miss social experiences that might have provided more trustworthy and comforting answers to questions related to the inner mental lives of themselves or others.”</span></p>
<p>Sørensena and her colleagues said these insights could be useful for therapists. The therapeutic alliance (a warm, trusting relationship between therapist and client) – always important – will be even more critical for clients with avoidant personality disorder. “The therapeutic relationship provides an opportunity for persons diagnosed with AVPD to experience being met with acceptance and understanding,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>They added that “through a reflective process, patients might begin to make sense of why they do not manage what seems easy for most people. With this realization, their motivation to encounter new social learning might increase, together with a beginning of acceptance of life’s inherent uncertainties. Research on treatment of AVPD has been scarce and inconclusive, but the suggestions above do align with promising recommendations emphasizing the importance of social skills training and drawing on findings from social cognition research on mentalization, self‐other differentiation, interpersonal grounding for building a self‐concept, and affect consciousness.”</p>

<p>Table 1. The APOSTEL trials performed to date</p>
<p>For decades, it was thought that tocolytics improved perinatal outcome, since tocolytics could prolong pregnancy. However, in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no effectiveness of tocolytic therapy on perinatal outcome has been proven so far and that randomized placebo-controlled trials on this topic are urgently needed. Our project group completely agreed with this statement and believes that tocolytics should only be administered in routine care when it has been proven to be effective. Prolongation of pregnancy should not be the main goal of tocolytic therapy; the main goal should be improvement of perinatal outcome. Threatened preterm birth could be a sign of a problem within the uterine environment and therefore tocolytic therapy may be harmful by exposing the fetus longer to a suboptimal uterine environment. In several countries it is unusual to administer tocolytic therapy in threatened preterm birth in view of a possible harmful effect or lack of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Therefore we designed the APOSTEL 8 trial, which is currently open for recruitment, to solve the question whether administration of tocolytic drugs improves neonatal outcome in cases of threatened preterm birth. This trial investigates the effectiveness of 48 hours of tocolytics with atosiban versus placebo in women with threatened preterm labor between 30 and 34 weeks. The standard treatment of corticosteroids is administered to all participants. They will be randomized to either 48 hours of atosiban or 48 hours of placebo. The choice for atosiban was made as no significant difference in effectiveness was present between nifedipine and atosiban in the APOSTEL III trial and because of the favorable safety profile of atosiban. In addition, it is registered for the indication of tocolysis in many countries in Europe.</p>
<h3><strong>Current status of APOSTEL 8</strong></h3>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10898" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-10898" height="80" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/A8.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">APOSTEL#8</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Power analysis shows that we need to recruit 1514 participants in this study. All perinatal centers in the Netherlands will participate, together with many large secondary hospitals. Since several countries in Western Europe were interested in this trial, the APOSTEL 8 study will also be performed in the UK, Ireland and possibly Belgium.</p>
<p>To date, recruitment is slow due to a number of factors. Doctors are often too busy treating newly admitted patients to be able to take the time to invite them to participate in the trial and provide enough information. And even if there is sufficient time to explain the trial, the pregnant woman and her partner have to make a difficult and urgent decision whether to participate or not at a time which is very scary and insecure for them. To quickly introduce the trial to possible participants, we created a <a href="http://www.zorgevaluatienederland.nl/apostel8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">short animation video</a> in which the dilemma on this topic and the necessity for this trial is explained. Furthermore, we approach doctors and midwives to raise awareness of their attitudes when it comes to recruitment of pregnant women for a randomized trial, as these may be hindering recruitment.</p>
<h3><strong>Stakeholders’ views on recruitment of pregnant women</strong></h3>
<p>For decades, stakeholders involved in the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical research, such as bioethicists, researchers, and clinicians, have argued that research participation of pregnant women is essential in order to increase the evidence base for treatment of pregnant women and fetuses. In this <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2209-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">qualitative study</a>, we interviewed various stakeholders, including pregnant women themselves, in order to understand their opinions on including pregnant women in clinical trials.</p>
<p>For this study, we made use of the APOSTEL trials in the Netherlands, specifically the APOSTEL VI study (see Table 1).</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed four themes that characterized stakeholders’ views on inclusion of pregnant women in the APOSTEL VI study:</p>
<p>First, pregnant women participated in the APOSTEL VI study primarily for potential individual benefit and secondarily for altruistic motives, as this quotation illustrates: <em>“I like to participate when it is positive for me, when participation makes me feel like I do something good, but that it is also positive for myself and that nothing can go wrong.” (pregnant woman, participating in APOSTEL VI) </em>This finding is in contrast with <a href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2431-13-53" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hypothetical studies</a>, where altruistic motives are usually mentioned as the primary reason for participation.</p>
<blockquote><p>While pregnant women may be willing to participate …, an underlying protective sentiment, resulting in gate-keeping and directive counselling, sometimes hampered recruitment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, a gate-keeping tendency hampered recruitment of pregnant women who might be eligible and willing.  Alarmingly, questions about pregnant women’s decision-making capacities sometimes surfaced, as demonstrated in this quotation<em>: “I think they [pregnant women] are behaviorally more vulnerable. I think they have some sort of black, blind spot: everything for the child. […] They are not sufficiently competent.” (gynecologist-in-training)</em></p>
<p>Third, healthcare professionals may have used the counselling conversation to steer pregnant women towards a particular decision, which was called counseling positive or counseling negative: <em>“Sometimes you know that it is not the right candidate. That it will be a mess. And then you counsel slightly more negatively.” (gynecologist-in-training)</em></p>
<p>Fourth, all stakeholders were hesitant about inclusion of pregnant women in clinical research in general due to a protective sentiment, although this related mostly to trials that are not pregnancy-specific and in which there are risks: <em>“</em><em>You should not expose pregnant women to medications of which the effects on the baby are unknown, if you have an alternative. It’s different if it is pregnancy-specific. In that case you don’t have an alternative, and then I have fewer objections.” (Research Ethics Committee member and clinician)</em></p>
<p>What these findings show us is that while pregnant women may be willing to participate for potential individual benefit and altruistic motives, an underlying protective sentiment, resulting in gate-keeping and directive counselling, sometimes hampered recruitment. These results apply to the APOSTEL VI study in particular, but it may be that these views have affected the recruitment in past trials.</p>
<p>In order to improve recruitment, it is therefore important to invest in educating and training of those involved in recruiting participants. This could be done by asking healthcare professionals to assess the logistics and potential risks and benefits of a study before discussing it with potential participants or by making stakeholders aware of their protective attitude and the resulting effects.</p>

I just came across a paper with an interesting title: The Mutant Says in His Heart, “There Is No God”.

The conclusions of this work are even more interesting. According to the authors, Edward Dutton et al., humans evolved to be religious and atheism is caused (in part) by mutational damage to our normal, religious DNA. Atheists, in other words, are genetic degenerates.





Despite the talk of mutations, there is no genetics in this paper. No atheist genomes were sequenced and found to

<p>It’s well known that teenagers’ moods go through drastic changes. In particular, depressive symptoms – like feelings of low mood or self-loathing – tend to increase as they grow older. Now researchers have plotted out the exact trajectory of these depressive symptoms. In their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-018-0976-5">recent paper</a> in <i>Journal of Youth and Adolescence</i>, Alex Kwong and colleagues from the University of Bristol report for the first time the points during teen development when symptoms increase most rapidly, on average – and they find that these timings differ between young men and women.</p>
<p><span id="more-36685"></span></p>
<p>The timing of symptom increases is of more than theoretical interest. Having more serious depression symptoms in adolescence is a known risk factor for developing depression later on in life, suggesting it could be useful to intervene and treat symptoms when they are at their worst. But when is that exactly? Past research has shown that, on average, depressive symptoms peak at <i>some point</i> in mid-to-late adolescence before decreasing again, but findings have been inconsistent: Scientists have suggested that peak depressive symptoms could occur as early as age 15 or as late as 20. And few studies have pinpointed other potentially important periods, such as the point at which depressive symptoms are increasing most rapidly, rather than simply when they have reached a peak.</p>
<p>To better characterise these critical points, Kwong’s team examined data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. This study has been following children from birth in the 1990s through to today, providing an overview of development from childhood all the way through to adulthood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The team looked at participants’ scores on the short mood and feelings questionnaire from the ages of 10 to 22. This questionnaire measures depressive symptoms over the previous two weeks, asking participants to indicate whether statements like “I felt miserable or unhappy” are true for them. Over the 12 year time period, participants had been given the questionnaire on eight separate occasions (although not everyone had completed every questionnaire: 7,335 participants completed the first questionnaire, decreasing to 3,850 by the final one).</p>
<p>The researchers fit a model to this data, showing the path of depressive symptoms for each individual through adolescence and early adulthood. They then averaged these curves across males and females, to give the general trajectory for each sex.</p>
<p>The team found that there were key differences between male and female participants. Females had higher depressive symptoms in general throughout their adolescence, except for between ages 10 and 11, when symptoms were higher for males. The symptoms didn’t peak until around age 20 for both sexes, but there were sex differences in the age at which symptoms increased most rapidly: for females this occurred at 13.7 years old, while for males it was much later, at 16.4 years old.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>The researchers say that these sex differences in the trajectories could relate partly to puberty. Girls generally go through puberty earlier, which could explain why their depressive symptoms increase most rapidly almost 3 years earlier than boys’ symptoms. This also suggests that girls could benefit earlier than boys from interventions designed to prevent the increase of depressive symptoms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, this study is the first to estimate the age at which depressive symptoms increase most rapidly, so the findings should be considered preliminary. It’s also not yet clear whether it’s possible to slow or reverse these rapid increases in teen depression symptoms – or what the later effects of doing so would be. Nevertheless, the authors say, “if this can be used for clinical purposes, it may be possible to treat individuals at this age, which may help reduce depressive symptoms or depression at a later stage.”</p>

												SMAB  Bispecific Antibody: From Rational Design to Preclinical Development					</h2>
					<div class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="1" id="elementor-tab-content-1631"><p style="font-weight: 400;">Therapeutic antibody drugs have recently experienced explosive growth. Within oncology research alone, more than 20 therapeutic antibody drugs received FDA approval for new treatments or indications during 2015 to 2017. Additionally, more than 300 therapeutic antibody drugs are in ongoing clinical trials. Most recently the success of cancer immunotherapy, by blocking immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, created a hope for a “cancer cure” and triggered a second revolution so that the majority of pharmaceutical companies are investing many research resources in antibody therapeutics.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst fierce competition together with many unmet medical needs, there is an urgent demand for new therapeutic strategies, such as combination therapy, and novel modalities, such as bispecific antibodies.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>GenScript’s proprietary SMAB (single-domain antibody fused to monoclonal antibody) bispecific antibody platform</strong> minimizes the immunogenicity and manufacturing concerns of current bispecific antibody platforms while enabling bivalent and multi-valent therapeutics.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Major advantages of the SMAB platform include superior bioavailability and excellent developability for high yield and stability. Molecules generated on the SMAB platform have the ability to bind to hidden epitopes, such as enzymes and ion channels. Also, the platform is flexible enough to enable construction of multivalent molecules in a plug-and-play fashion. SMAB bispecific antibodies have demonstrated high efficacy and and high affinity to target cells in many models.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>To build a new Biologics GMP Facility, GenScript has invested $75 million </strong>to establish a modern biologics discovery, development, clinical and commercial manufacturing center in the city of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, China. The Manufacturing Center is scheduled to come into use by 2020.</p></div>

<p>Most people find it easy to infer the emotional state underlying a scowl or beaming smile. But not all facial emotional signals are so obvious. Sensitivity to these less obvious emotional signals varies from one person to another and is a useful skill, improving relations with other people and benefiting psychological wellbeing. As well as varying between individuals, are there also shifts in this ability during a typical person’s life? And, if so, might these age-related changes be relevant to known high-risk periods for psychological problems and the onset of mental illness? A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000559">new study</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, provides some answers.</p>
<p><span id="more-36680"></span></p>
<p>Lauren Rutter at Harvard Medical School and her colleagues analysed data on 9,190 people aged 10 to 85 from the US, the UK, Canada, India, Australia and Germany. These participants completed the<a href="https://www.testmybrain.org/tests/start"> Emotion Sensitivity test</a> on the <a href="http://testmybrain.org">testmybrain.org</a> website. They were shown 56 pairs of faces, and each time, they were asked which of the pair was “more angry”, “more happy”, or “more fearful”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The faces had been carefully manipulated so that the difficulty level in making these judgements was “easy”, “medium” or “hard”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that sensitivity to facial cues of anger increased steeply from age 10 to age 14, then increased at a slower rate until age 30, followed by a gradual decrease in sensitivity into late age. From an evolutionary perspective, the sharp rise in anger sensitivity through early to mid adolescence makes sense: “As adolescents are learning to navigate their social worlds, knowing if their actions are inciting anger in others is a particularly adaptive skill,” the team notes. Other work on adolescents in the UK found that while bullies didn’t differ from others in their emotion recognition skills, victims of bullying were less able to recognise anger and fear in particular. “Thus, learning to discriminate anger and change actions accordingly may serve an important social function,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Fear sensitivity showed a marked increase at around age 19, with a peak at about 34 years. It then remained relatively high until around 45–50, then reduced. Being able to spot fear in others is clearly useful for avoiding dangerous situations, and for protecting children from danger – but hyper-sensitivity to other people’s fear could play a role in the development of anxiety disorders. Agoraphobia, OCD, PTSD, panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27310233">tend to develop</a> between the ages of around 21 and 35, which is when the data indicated that sensitivity to fearful expressions rises, the team noted. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, happiness sensitivity showed a different lifespan pattern: after increasing between the ages of 10 and 22, there was “a very mild decline or plateau”, with sensitivity remaining relatively undimmed even into older age. The preservation of happiness sensitivity – combined with less awareness of other people’s anger and fear – may help to explain the results of studies finding that older adults (at least those with adequate social relationships) tend to report feeling happier more of the time than younger people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also noted some possible gender differences: the data suggested that men’s anger sensitivity may continue to increase relatively steeply for a few more years, compared with women’s, and that their fear sensitivity improves more rapidly during adolescence, for example. However, these age-gender differences were not statistically significant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are some limitations of the study: most notably the participants were self-selecting and so may not be representative of the general population. But the large sample size is an advantage. Overall, the data certainly suggests that sensitivities to different emotions don’t develop in the same way across the lifespan, and that this may be relevant to age-related changes in psychological wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Olga Tveretina's journal club session, where she will present herself and Andrei Sandler's work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A hybrid system is a dynamic system that exhibits both continuous and discrete behaviour, and the number of its dimensions is determined by the number of the continuous variables. The hybrid system paradigm is a useful tool for describing a wide range of real-world applications. Examples come from robotics, avionics, biological networks, chemical processes, etc. Most of the hybrid systems are safety critical. Formally, verifying safety properties of hybrid systems consists of construction of a set of reachable states and checking whether this set intersects with a set of unsafe states. Therefore, one of the most fundamental problems in the analysis of hybrid systems is the reachability problem. The reachability problem is known for being difficult, and it is only decidable for special kinds of hybrid systems. Even though many attempts have been made to define the boundary between decidable and undecidable hybrid systems, it is far from being resolved. Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider defined some classes of low dimensional hybrid systems lying on the boundary between decidable and undecidable systems in their seminal paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0890540112000028/1-s2.0-S0890540112000028-main.pdf?_tid=9f466a86-e73b-4b4c-9dd9-84ef605373a7&amp;acdnat=1552504249_aa972217ec2e75d11dcc518467361ca5">Low dimensional hybrid systems – decidable, undecidable, don’t know (Asarin et al., 2012)</a>", and for which decidability is unknown. In this talk, Olga will present an overview of the area and discuss the recent work on the decidability of reachability for a class of hybrid systems due to Asarin, Mysore, Pnueli and Schneider.</p>

We will make sure this is a wide-ranging, dynamic and visible journal.</p>
<p><em>BMC Molecular and Cell Biology</em> is built on the firm foundations of its predecessor <em>BMC Cell Biology,  </em>which was one the earliest BMC journals, launching in November 2000 and publishing its first article in the same year. For nearly 20 years this journal consistently published articles that are important to the community. We would like to take forward the key aspects of <em>BMC Cell Biology</em> – the importance of integrity in research, fairness to authors, and the evaluation of research without consideration of the impact – to the relaunched <em>BMC Molecular and Cell Biology</em>. In addition, we are expanding the scope to cover that of <em>BMC Biochemistry</em>, <em>BMC Structural Biology</em>, <em>BMC Biophysics</em> and <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em>, and we are in the process of closing these journals. Our mission is to bring all members of the molecular and cellular biology community together, irrespective of organism or technique.</p>

<p>Research using human cells and mammalian cells is of course vital for understanding disease. These studies will always be important to the community, but we would especially like to welcome researchers who work on a broader range of cells – whether eukaryotic such as plants or yeast, or prokaryotic such as bacteria, viruses, or archaea.  There is a wealth of research and exciting insights being generated in many organisms and we would like to ensure these results are shared.</p>
<p>We also know that understanding the molecular biology of a cell requires multiple techniques. Structural biology, for example, provides powerful insights into molecular mechanisms, but sometimes because of the technical nature of crystallography, NMR, or electron microscopy, these insights are not readily apparent. For <em>BMC Molecular and Cell Biology</em> we want to ensure that these results are understandable to other researchers. We wish to take a similar approach with other biophysical techniques.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the heated subject of differences between how men and women behave, debate in psychology has centered on mate preferences and general interests. The available research shows that when it comes to (heterosexual) mating preferences, men are relatively more interested in physical beauty, while women are relatively more interested in earning capacity. As for general interests, men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the staunchest evolutionary psychologists would acknowledge these are partially overlapping bell curves: There are plenty of men who are fascinated by other people, and plenty of women looking for physical beauty in a partner above all else. Yet the findings have been met with fierce resistance in some quarters. One of the more sophisticated rejoinders is known as social roles theory: The differences </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exist, but they’re entirely or largely the result of gender roles imposed by society on individuals. However, a new study released as a </span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/mtsx8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at <em>PsyArXiv</em> and involving participants from 36 countries has failed to replicate a key finding that’s previously been cited in support of social roles theory. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36662"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its purest form social roles theory can be seen as sitting at the Nurture end of a Nature/Nurture spectrum, according to which sex differences in behaviour arise through cultural tradition. At the Nature end, on the other hand, are various evolutionary psychology accounts which posit that sex differences in behavior were carved into place by evolution. That is, since reproduction means such different things for men and women – men can pass along their genes at very little “cost,” while for women doing so entails gestation and childbirth at the very least – men and women have evolved different preferences for mates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most noteworthy studies published in support of social roles theory came out in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Psychologist</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1999. Alice H. Eagly and Wendy Wood reinterpreted data </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889"><span style="font-weight: 400;">originally published by the evolutionary psychologist David Buss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (showing average sex differences in mate preferences across cultures) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they </span><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/545/docs/Wendy_Wood_Research_Articles/Evolutionary_Origins_of_Mens_and_Womens_Behavior/Eagly_Wood_1999_the_origins_of_human_sex_differences.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in countries with more egalitarian gender relations, the male-female differences were smaller. This suggested that gender equality gives women room to pursue their </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">true</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> romantic and sexual preferences, which aren’t all that far off from mens’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for the new preprint, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lingshan Zhang and Benedict Jones, and their colleagues at the University of Glasgow, have posed the exact same questions about mate preferences to a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new sample (this one featuring 910 men and 2350 women from 36 countries, all of whom had ranked a number of traits in partners from most to least important, or rated those same traits numerically, or both) and their analysis casts serious doubt on the ability of social roles theory to explain these disparities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors explain that in “contrast with Eagly and Wood (1999), who used aggregated data to calculate sex-difference scores at the country level, we used multilevel models to analyze the mate preferences for individual participants,” and they point to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092392"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899065"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which argue, in their words, that “the latter approach is preferable because it takes into account variability in preferences within each country.” (In all three studies – Buss; Eagly and Wood; and the new research – participants completed the same tasks, so it’s an apples-to-apples-to-apples comparison in that sense.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhang and his team found, as per their abstract, that “Although women preferred mates with good earning capacity more than men did and men preferred physically attractive mates more than women did, we found little evidence that these sex differences were smaller in countries with greater gender equality,” as defined by United Nations statistics.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was “one analysis [which] suggested that the sex difference in preferences for good earning capacity was smaller in countries with greater gender equality, [but] this effect was not significant when controlling for Galton’s problem or when correcting for multiple comparisons.” Galton’s problem is a statistical error that can occur when treating things as statistically independent that in fact aren’t – in this case, cultural practices in countries that are in close geographic proximity to one another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, after controlling for Galton’s problem, the researchers found just one mate characteristic that has been the subject of some evo-psych theorising – domestic skills like cooking and cleaning – for which the previously documented greater appeal to men than women effectively disappeared in more gender equal countries. Elsewhere, though, the differences were robust, both in the ranked- and rated-trait data, even controlling for gender equality.</span></p>
<p>In terms of how to interpret these new findings, Benedict Jones – co-author on the new preprint – <a href="https://twitter.com/Ben_C_J/status/1105775767332491264">clarified on Twitter</a> that “the work doesn’t rule out social roles playing a role in mate preferences” and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ben_C_J/status/1105776379289837568">that</a> “we don’t provide any direct evidence for evolutionary explanations of mate preferences and some of our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513818302368">recent work</a> has challenged them. It’s complicated!”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the new analyses match up, at least partially, with those of an </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important 2010 article published by Richard Lippa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who asked a similar set of questions pertaining to sex differences in personality and interests. Summarising “two meta-analyses and three cross-cultural studies on gender differences in personality and interests,” Lippa found “small” to “moderate” sex differences with regard to Big Five personality traits, but “very large” ones with regard to the person–thing divide. “Gender differences in personality tend to be larger in gender-egalitarian societies than in gender-inegalitarian societies,” he found, “a finding that contradicts social role theory but is consistent with evolutionary, attributional, and social comparison theories. In contrast, gender differences in interests appear to be consistent across cultures and over time, a finding that suggests possible biologic influences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very least, Lippa’s study and the new one from Zhang and Jones et al make it harder for advocates of social roles theory to explain what’s going on. If sex differences in mate attraction were as simple as “Men are conditioned to seek out attractive women, and women to seek out high-earning men,” one would expect gender equality to have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effect on that dynamic. Nature and nurture surely intertwine and interact in myriad ways that humans may never fully disentangle, but for now these new results make it harder, as per Lippa, to rule out a strong role for “biologic influences.”</span></p>

<p>Implementation science can be defined as the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice. The necessary use of theory to inform implementation programs is recognized, but clinicians and researchers are often unfamiliar with these theories and behavioral change. Although they are interested in such approaches, clinicians and researchers find it difficult to navigate the expanding number of theories, frameworks, and models. In addition, they are often unfamiliar with the language as well as the inconsistencies in nomenclature.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10863" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Overworked doctor doing paperwork" class="wp-image-10863 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/AdobeStock_150177913-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© baranq / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The debate article by Lynch<em> et al</em> discusses the implementation of evidence-based practice in health care and can be used as a pragmatic guide to help clinicians and clinical researchers understand implementation theories, models and frameworks; what are they, how can they be used, and what prompts to consider when selecting a theoretical approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3376-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>A bitter pill to swallow</strong></a></p>
<p>Health systems are pressured to deliver efficient, effective, and affordable care. Patient-related factors such as malnutrition, anemia, and delirium affect efficiency and affordability of health care by increasing the length of stay and cost per patient. Another symptom common in patients with complex medical conditions is difficulty in swallowing, also known as oropharyngeal dysphagia. Although dysphagia is a symptom of a range of critical head and neck conditions, it is often reported as a secondary measure, and as a result the associated resource utilization costs to treat this condition are inconsistently reported</p>
<blockquote><p><em>overall expenditure measured via monetary cost increased by 40.36% in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The systematic review by Attrill <em>et al</em> investigated studies reporting on costs data and length of stay data related to oropharyngeal dysphagia. They report that dysphagia increases length of stay by nearly 3 days, and increases the health care costs per patient by more than 40%, suggesting that oropharyngeal dysphagia should be recognized as an important contributor to pressure on health care systems.</p>

<p>Following the recent surge of asylum seekers entering the European Union, questions have been raised about the ability of member states to integrate the newcomers into their societies and economy. This is particularly the case for individuals that have been subjected to torture. For torture is not only a socio-political phenomenon with severe psychological ramifications, it is also financially costly to society, in terms of both treatment and reduced productivity of the victim. In their study, Bager <em>et al</em> investigate if rehabilitation of traumatized refugees is economically beneficial in long term economic and social perspectives.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10865" style="width: 320px;"><img alt="Mental health assessment" class="wp-image-10865 " height="209" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Blog-on-treatment-of-torture-victims-300x202.jpg" width="310" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">@Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The study describes a cost evaluation comprised of cost-utility analysis and partial cost-benefit analysis described for refugees treated at the <em>Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims</em>. The results suggest that productivity gains by family members lead to positive net social benefit after as little as 3 years, and these gains persisted over the study period. The authors suggest that multidisciplinary intervention to treat refugees provides “value-for-money” and is economically sustainable.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>They can make life very difficult, refuse to help you, and most likely change your diagnosis to personality disorder so that no one will want to treat you.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Patient and carer involvement is a crucial tool to facilitate patient safety improvements. Despite serious failures in service provision, limited research has been carried out to identify these issues in the service provision of mental health care in the UK. Berzins <em>et al</em> address these issues in their study, wherein they discuss mental health service users’ and carers’ experiences of raising concerns about safety in mental health care services, and their views on the potential for service user and carer involvement in future safety interventions.</p>
<p>The study suggests that mental health service users and carers experience great difficulties in raising concerns about the safety of these services. Reasons for not providing feedback on the services include unresponsiveness to complaints and fear of repercussions. The authors suggest that not collecting the user and carer feedback is a missed opportunity for learning and improvement of mental health services.</p>

<p>Implementation of new interventions into complex health care environments can prove to be a problematic and complicated matter. Factors that may affect implementation include interoperability, cost, fit with existing systems, disruptions to interactions between medical personnel and service users, and poor implementation planning. Despite the complexity of the process of implementation, there is limited evidence on how to successfully implement new interventions into health care environments. The paper by Ross <em>et al</em> provides an example of a successfully implemented digital health intervention.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/SPL_11960128-e1552393013256-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Despite the constant improvement in operation techniques, intensive care and standardized antibiotic use, postoperative complications are still a significant problem in daily clinical practice. Knowing which patients are at the most risk of developing these is vital for achieving the best possible outcomes.</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has changed our perception and understanding of the structure and function of the microbiome in various organ systems. The use of NGS allows new insights into the complex composition of the intestinal flora and its reaction to external influences.</p>
<p>We wanted to figure out if the gut microbiome experiences major changes in the perioperative setting, and if changes in bacterial diversity or composition might have an impact on the incidence of postoperative complications.</p>
<p>We analyzed 116 stool samples of 32 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery using 16S-rRNA gene next-generation sequencing. Based on the structure of the gut microbiome, the samples could be allocated into three different microbial communities (A, B and C).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10904" style="width: 380px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10904" height="364" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/figure-1.png" width="370" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of outcomes</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The composition of community B was characterised, among others, by an increase in <em>Akkermansia </em>that belongs to the <em>Verrucomicrobia </em>phylum which degrade intestinal gut mucin as their sole carbon and nitrogen source. The mucin layer of the intestinal gut has an important function as it acts as a physical barrier to protect epithelial cells from pathogen invasion.</p>
<p>Animal experiments have shown a rise in mucin production, along with an increase in <em>Akkermansia</em> in the gut microbiome under pro-inflammatory conditions and a protective effect on the epithelium.</p>
<p>In contrast <em>Lachnospiraecae</em> were decreased, normally associated with resistance against colonisation by more pathogenic bacteria including <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, which might indicate an increased susceptibility of the intestinal flora.</p>
<p>Interestingly patients showing a microbial composition resembling community B at least once during the observation period were found to have a significantly higher risk for developing postoperative complications (e.g., anastomotic insufficiency or pancreatic fistula). Patients with a complicated course showed significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a higher leucocyte count, prolonged hospital stay and longer time in the intensive care unit (ICU). Six patients were treated with percutaneous drainage and two patients underwent re-operation.</p>
<p>Our results showed that differences in the gut microbiome are associated with the development of postoperative complications. Thus, methods that take into account differences in the NGS-defined microbial communities might represent a useful diagnostic tool in future clinical practice.</p>
<p>NGS could improve our daily diagnostic procedures, especially in comparison to the mostly imprecise microbiologic culture based methods. But this requires clinical trials with large numbers of different patients with multiple diseases to evaluate which changes in the microbiome really need a therapeutic intervention and which are just a laboratory phenomenon.</p>
