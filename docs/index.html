              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-pill-mucus-gut-deliver-medicine">This robotic pill clears mucus from the gut to deliver meds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mucus-wicking robotic pill may offer a new way to deliver meds.</p>



<p>The multivitamin-sized device houses a motor and a cargo hold for drugs, including ones that are typically given via injections or intravenously, such as insulin and some antibiotics. If people could take such drugs orally, they could potentially avoid daily shots or a hospital stay, which would be “a huge game changer,” says MIT biomedical engineer Shriya Srinivasan.</p>



<p>But drugs that enter the body via the mouth face a tough journey. They encounter churning stomach acid, raging digestive enzymes and sticky slicks of mucus in the gut. Intestinal mucus “sort of acts like Jell-O,” Srinivasan says. The goo can trap drug particles, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.</p>





<p>The new device, dubbed RoboCap, whisks away this problem. The pill uses surface grooves, studs and torpedo-inspired fins to scrub away intestinal mucus like a miniature brush whirling inside a bottle. In experiments in pigs, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abp9066">RoboCap tunneled through mucus lining the walls of the small intestine</a>, depositing insulin or the IV antibiotic vancomycin along the way, Srinivasan and colleagues report September 28 in <em>Science Robotics.</em> After churning for about 35 minutes, the pill continued its trip through the gut and eventually out of the body.</p>



<p>RoboCap is the latest pill-like gadget made to be swallowed.&nbsp; In 2019, some of the same researchers who developed RoboCap debuted a different device­ — one that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pills-needles-injection-medication">injects drugs by pricking the inside of the stomach</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/19</em>). That pea-sized injector was not designed to work in the small intestine, where some drugs are most easily absorbed. The RoboCap may also be able to deliver larger drug payloads, Srinivasan says.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-young-adults-personality-development">The pandemic may be stunting young adults’ personality development</a></h4>

              
                <p>The psychological development of young adults may have taken a hit, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>In typical times, people tend to become more conscientious and agreeable and less neurotic with age, a process known as psychological maturation. But in the United States, the pandemic seems to have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274542">reversed that personality trajectory</a>, especially among adults under 30, researchers report September 28 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. If those patterns persist, that could spell long-term trouble for this cohort, the researchers say.</p>





<p>“You get better as you go through life at being responsible, at coping with emotions and getting along with others,” says personality psychologist Rodica Damian of the University of Houston, who was not involved with this study. “The fact that in these young adults you see the opposite pattern does show stunted development.”</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Personalities shape how people think, feel and behave. Researchers often assess a person’s personality profile along five core traits: neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">openness to experience</a> (<em>SN: 9/1/21</em>). Over time, these traits change slightly in individuals; neuroticism tends to decrease, for example, while agreeableness typically improves.</p>



<p>The pandemic, though, may be upending those typical trend lines. Even after factoring out expected changes, researchers in the new study observed about a decade’s worth of personality change, averaged across all study participants, in just three years — but going in the opposite of the expected direction. Young adults showed the greatest change in certain traits. Middle-aged adults — 30 to 64 years old — showed more change across all traits. The personalities of older adults, meanwhile, stayed largely unchanged.</p>



<p>Such age differences make intuitive sense to personality psychologist Wiebke Bleidorn of the University of Zurich. “The density of experiences in adolescence and young adulthood is so much higher” than in later life, says Bleidorn, who was not involved with the study. “If you miss out on your senior year of high school, you can’t get that back.”</p>





<p>To look at personality change in the United States before and during the pandemic, personality psychologist Angelina Sutin and colleagues analyzed data from the <a href="https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php">Understanding America Study</a>.</p>



<p>This survey looks at how attitudes and behaviors in the country change in response to major events, such as the 2020 presidential election and the ongoing pandemic. Among those surveyed, roughly 7,000 people — ranging in age from 18 to 109 — took a personality inventory at least once in the six years prior to the pandemic and once during the pandemic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on those responses, neuroticism overall in the United States dropped slightly in 2020, during the first year of the pandemic. That finding mirrors what the researchers found with a different dataset two years ago, when they reported that neuroticism <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237056">declined in adults during the first six weeks of the pandemic</a>. But the new findings include data from 2021 and 2022, which show that the dip was fleeting.</p>



<p>That initial dip was probably due to the sense of solidarity that emerged in the health crisis’s earlier months, along with people attributing their worries to the crisis rather than their own internal state, says Sutin, of Florida State University in Tallahassee. “In the second year, all that support fell apart.”</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Average neuroticism scores have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. But the picture is nuanced, the researchers found. The 2020 dip was driven almost entirely by middle-aged participants and older adults. For those two groups, neuroticism scores continued to fall over the following years, albeit more slowly than before the pandemic. Neuroticism scores among young adults in 2021 and beyond, however, surpassed pre-pandemic levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, conscientiousness and agreeableness scores also declined among middle-aged adults in 2021 and early 2022, but the drop wasn’t nearly as steep as the one observed among young adults.</p>



<p>The findings are troubling, Sutin says. “We know these traits predict all sorts of long-term outcomes.”</p>



<p>For instance, high neuroticism links to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness. And low conscientiousness is linked to poor educational, work, health and relationship outcomes.</p>



<p>Still, whether these personality changes persist remains to be seen. It could be that young adults “missed the train” during a critical development period, Damian says. Maybe they would have gotten a college degree or pursued a more lucrative career without the pandemic. Or maybe these people can still reach their designated stop, just behind schedule.</p>



<p>“There are critical developmental periods and then there is plasticity,” Damian says. “We don’t know how it’s going to play out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-fossils-china-jaws-vertebrates">Ancient fish fossils highlight the strangeness of our vertebrate ancestors</a></h4>

              
                <p>My, what small teeth they had.</p>



<p>A newfound treasure trove of ancient fish fossils unearthed in southern China is opening a window into the earliest history of jawed vertebrates — a group that encompasses 99 percent of all living vertebrates on Earth, including humans. The fossil site, dated from 439 million to 436 million years ago, includes a revealing variety of never-before-seen small, toothy, bony fish species.</p>



<p>The diversity of the fossils at this one site not only <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05136-8">fills a glaring gap</a> in the fossil record, but also highlights the strangeness that such a gap exists, researchers report September 29 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>Genetic analyses had previously pointed to this time period, known as the early Silurian Period, as an era of rapid diversification of jawed vertebrates. But the toothy fishes seemed to have left few traces in the fossil record. Instead, as far as the fossil record was concerned, jawless fishes appeared to rule the waves at the time. And what jawed fishes have been preserved were rarely bony; most have been chondrichthyans, ancient cartilaginous ancestors of modern sharks and rays.</p>



<p>The Chongqing Lagerstätte — paleontologists’ word for a rich assemblage of diverse species all preserved together at one site — “fundamentally changes that picture,” write paleontologist You-an Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues in the study. The site is teeming with toothy, bony fishes, particularly armored placoderms, but bears just one chondrichthyan.</p>

<p>The first creatures to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-vertebrates-earth-arose-shallow-coastal-waters">develop a backbone</a> were fish, and they did it around 480 million years ago (<em>SN: 10/25/18</em>). Genetic analyses have suggested that by about 450 million years ago, those fish also developed jaws, the better to chomp each other with. But the earliest complete fossils of such jawed fish appear relatively late in the fossil record, about 425 million years ago. By the Devonian Period, which spanned from 419 million to 359 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devonian-swimming-revolution-oceans-may-have-never-happened">jawed fishes were a global phenomenon</a>, earning that era the nickname “Age of Fishes” (<em>SN: 7/17/18</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at a few of the newly discovered fishy denizens of the Chongqing Lagerstätte.</p>



<h4>Little but fierce</h4>



<p>About 20 separate specimens of a little fish that the researchers have called <em>Xiushanosteus mirabilis</em> were found at the Chongqing site. Those finds make the animal the most abundant type of fish in that fossil assemblage.</p>



<p><em>X. mirabilis</em> was only about 30 millimeters long, about the length of a paper clip, but it bears a strong resemblance to larger armored placoderms to come in the future: It had a broad, bony head shield and a body covered in small, diamond-shaped scales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2.jpg" alt="illustration of Xiushanosteus mirabilis" class="wp-image-3117816" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117816">The head-to-tail preservation of fossils of <em>Xiushanosteus mirabilis</em> (shown in an artist’s rendition) has allowed researchers to reconstruct the fish’s anatomy in detail.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117816">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The surprising abundance of this type of fish at a site from the early Silurian Period might just be due to lucky fossilization conditions — the small, delicate bones of <em>X. mirabilis</em> and the other jawed fishes found at Chongqing would be harder to preserve than the larger jawless specimens of the time, or the more robust toothy bony fishes of the later Devonian Period. But another possibility is that this site is an outlier in its time that just happened to be popular with the placoderms.</p>



<h4>A heavily armored, diminutive shark</h4>



<p>Two types of jawed fish arose around 450 million years ago — and both make an appearance at the Chongqing site. The new site is remarkable for its diversity of osteichthyans, bony jawed fishes like <em>X. mirabilis</em>. But cartilaginous <em>Shenacanthus vermiformis</em> also spent some time in this environment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3.jpg" alt="reconstruction of Shenacanthus vermiformis" class="wp-image-3117817" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117817"><em>Shenacanthus vermiformis </em>(shown in this reconstruction) was a tiny, but armored cartilaginous fish found alongside its bony neighbors at the new Chinese fossil site.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117817">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>S. vermiformis </em>is represented by only a single specimen at Chongqing, but like <em>X. mirabilis</em>, it is excellently preserved from head to tail. It was diminutive too, just 22 millimeters long. Though it had a similar body plan to other chondrichthyans, it did differ in one key way: Like <em>X. mirabilis</em>, <em>S. vermiformis</em> was heavily armored, with extensive plates on its underside and back.</p>



<h4>A time of transition</h4>



<p>The Chinese site isn’t just shedding light on ancient jawed fish — it offers a window into the evolutionary transition of body features from jawless to jawed species. One newly discovered jawless creature, dubbed <em>Tujiaaspis vividus</em>, turns out to be closely related to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04897-6">a group of jawed fishes called galeaspids</a>, researchers report in a separate paper in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>

<p>The well-preserved fossils of <em>T. vividus</em> open up new opportunities to learn how its jawed relatives acquired their arrangements of fins, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02973-5">a transition for which there has been little previous evidence</a>, writes Matt Friedman, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a commentary in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. That’s because galeaspids have distinctive head shields, but scientists haven’t previously been able to peer beneath these fossilized shields to study the hidden anatomy.</p>



<p>Thanks to these close relatives, the researchers pieced together how paired fins in the jawless fish evolved in stages to become separate pectoral and pelvic fins in their jawed cousins. Such fins are the precursors of arms and legs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-tetrapods-may-have-emerged-salty-estuaries">in later tetrapods</a> (<em>SN: 5/30/18</em>).</p>

<p>Acceleration of human impact on the environment and biodiversity loss, are two mutually reinforcing issues. Commonly considered as pests, rodents are the largest group of mammals in the world; and yet, their crucial role in the maintenance of the ecosystem they inhabit is largely underappreciated. Due to their large abundance and wide distribution, rodent population can be a beneficial indicator of ecosystem function.</p>
<p>Research conducted by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution,</em> have monitored 115 rodent populations in China with durations ranging from 20 to 33 years. Nearly half of the populations studied (54 of 115), are in decline. The authors demonstrated that accelerated climate warming and human disturbance might be the driving factor of this sustained decline in rodent species. Strikingly, in high-latitude regions which experienced more climate warning, and in habitats with intensified human disturbance such as cities and farmlands, these sustained decline are more pronounced.</p>
<p>These findings may provide relief to pest management programs in rodent-infested regions; however, as a keystone species in many ecosystems, the decline in rodent species may be a signal of an ecosystem transition or dysfunction.</p>

<p>The venture into space, although exciting, can be a life threatening expedition for many life forms. One of the aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, is the condition in which objects or people appear to be weightless. Responsible for its vital role in evolution of life forms on earth, gravity or lack thereof can result in long-term, physiological disturbances to space explorers.</p>
<p>In this study published in <em>BMC Microbiology</em>, researchers at the University of Florida explored the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by microbes. By looking at the effects of simulated microgravity and beneficial association between the bobtail squid, <em>Euprymna scolopes </em>and the gram-negative bacterium, <em>Vibrio fischeri, </em>the researchers reported that spaceflight might cause disturbance to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. The mechanisms of communication used by <em>E. scolopes </em>and <em>V. fischeri </em>are present in other animals and thus these findings may shine a light on how spaceflight may alter normal physiological responses.</p>
<p>With the acceleration in the number of space explorations, understanding the impact of microgravity is crucial for maintaining long-term health of space explorers. This study demonstrates that mutualistic animal-microbe interactions have significant implications upon spaceflight-induced physiological changes on life forms, and that maintenance of a healthy microbiome during long-duration spaceflights, is essential.</p>

<p>Originating from the Latin word &#8216;<em>plagiarius&#8217;</em> which translates to &#8216;kidnapper&#8217;, plagiarism is a fundamental breach of ethics and research integrity. Coupled with the blurred definition of plagiarism, culture and education also plays a role in people’s perceptions and understanding of plagiarism. Integrity is one of the foundations of scientific research, thus, differences in perceptions of plagiarism may have larger implications for the scientific community.</p>
<p>In an effort to better understand the differences in perceptions of plagiarism across Europe, researchers from Southeast University, and KU Leuven conducted a survey aimed at biomedical researchers about their perception on plagiarism. Despite responders agreeing on the universally obvious examples of plagiarism, such as copying text from someone else’s publication without crediting the source; there appears to be differences in perceptions on less straightforward examples such as copying text from someone else’s publication and crediting the source without quotation marks. Compared to southern and northwestern European researchers, Nordic researchers scored higher sensitivity to plagiarism-related/like examples. The researchers argue that policy and research training across Europe might play a factor in these differences.</p>
<p>Establishing a clear-cut definition on what constitutes plagiarism, can benefit the scientific community and foster better collaboration. These findings also emphasises the importance in synchronising approaches and training surrounding research integrity across different regions.</p>

<p>To ensure blood banks are equipped with adequate blood supply, improving donor retention is crucial. Among other factors such as discovering an illness and fear of needles, fainting is an important factor that discourages blood donors from returning. Being the most common adverse events during, or after blood donations, vasovagal reactions often affect young-first time donors.</p>
<p>Recent study published in <em>BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, </em>employed seven machine-learning algorithms to investigate factors associated with adverse incidents during blood donation. Suessner and co-authors observed 1,715 fainting reactions in 228,846 blood donations from 88,003 donors over a 2-year study period. They reported that their machine-learning algorithms had high potentials of predicting fainting reactions during blood donations, which may prove to be beneficial for detecting high-risk donors. Compared to height, weight and gender, their machine learning prediction model found that systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ambient conditions, humidity and barometric pressure are essentially the most important predictors for fainting reactions.</p>
<p>Alleviating barriers that contribute to reduced retention rates for further donations is essential. This study demonstrates that employing predictive machine-learning algorithms can be beneficial in reducing adverse reactions during blood donation, and thereby, improving donor retention rates.</p>

<p>Lack of trust in research, accelerated by low reproducibility, abundant research waste, and spread of misinformation can jeopardise advancement in the field of biomedical research. The QUEST Centre for Responsible Research, operating within the Berlin Institute of Health, aims to develop and facilitate change in the culture and practice of research and enhance transparent, reproducible research practices.</p>
<p>In this commentary published in <em>BMC Research Notes, </em>members of the QUEST Centre shared their experiences based on challenges and opportunities that they have encountered and learned, over their first five years. The authors report that, improvement in research practise does not constitute a singular endpoint, but rather a constant communication and adaptation. It is important that, in championing reproducibility, organisations should remain open minded to novel approaches. There is not one-size-fits-all approach in the fight towards a more reproducible science. The authors identified that stakeholder engagement, identifying important incentives, effective communication, united bottom-up and top-down approaches, support of key decision makers, employment of expertise and support of decision-makers are a few of the factors that can lead to advancement in reproducible research.</p>
<p>In the continued fight towards reproducible science, we can learn from experiences of members at The QUEST Centre, on how we can further improve, and advocate, for increased reproducibility in research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/false-teeth-hearing-aids-jaw-bone-sound">False teeth could double as hearing aids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Prosthetic teeth could make great hearing aids.</p>



<p>Vibrations applied to replacements for lost teeth <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/10.0013898">travel well through jawbones to the inner ear</a>, researchers report in the September <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>. The finding could lead to discreet alternatives to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-hearing-has-come-long-way-1960s">conventional hearing aids and cochlear implants</a> that people with hearing impairments often use (<em>SN: 7/7/16</em>).</p>



<p>Previous tooth-based hearing aids designs clipped onto molars and received sound wirelessly from a microphone placed behind the ear. Dental researcher Jianxiang Tao and colleagues want to take the concept a step further, turning tooth implants into hearing aids. The electronics that impart sound vibrations would be built into the portion of a false tooth anchored into the jawbone, says Tao, of Tongji University in Shanghai.</p>





<p>But first, the team had to determine how well dental implants transmit sound compared with natural teeth and the mastoid bone behind the ear, which other types of hearing aids rely on to work. So the researchers applied sound tones to the implants, natural teeth and mastoid bones of 38 people with hearing loss and a single dental implant. For a wide range of frequencies, the volunteers could hear sounds through implants as well as, or better than, through natural teeth or mastoid bones, the team reports.</p>



<p>Front-tooth implants appeared to work slightly better than dental implants toward the back of the jaw. That may be because jawbone at the front of the mouth is harder than jawbone at the back, the team speculates. Lower teeth and implants worked as well as uppers for transmitting sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with traditional hearing aids, dental implant hearing aids could offer “excellent concealment, good comfort and improved quality of sound,” the researchers write.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982173357">Fen, Bog &amp; Swamp</a><br><em>Annie Proulx</em><br><em>Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.99</em></p>



<p>A recent TV ad features three guys lost in the woods, debating whether they should’ve taken a turn at a pond, which one guy argues is a marsh. “Let’s not pretend you know what a marsh is,” the other snaps. “Could be a bog,” offers the third.</p>



<p>It’s an exchange that probably wouldn’t surprise novelist Annie Proulx. While the various types of peatlands — wetlands rich in partially decayed material called peat — do blend together, I can’t help but think, after reading her latest book, that a historical distaste and underappreciation of wetlands in Western society has led to the average person’s confusion over basic peatland vocabulary.</p>





<p>In<em> Fen, Bog &amp; Swamp: A Short History of Peatland Destruction and Its Role in the Climate Crisis</em>, Proulx seeks to fill the gaps. She details three types of peatland: fens, which are fed by streams and rivers; bogs, fed by rainwater; and swamps, distinguishable by their trees and shrubs. While all three ecosystems are found around most of the world, Proulx focuses primarily on northwestern Europe and North America, where the last few centuries of modern agriculture led to a huge demand for dry land. Wet, muddy and smelly, wetlands were a nightmare for farmers and would-be developers. Since the 1600s, U.S. settlers have drained more than half of the country’s wetlands; just 1&nbsp;percent of British fens remains today.</p>





<p>Only recently have the consequences of these losses become clear. “We are now in the embarrassing position of having to relearn the importance of these strange places,” Proulx writes. For one, peatlands have great ecological value, supporting a variety of wildlife. They also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bogs-peatlands-fire-climate-change">sequester huge amounts of carbon dioxide</a>, and some peatlands prevent shoreline erosion, while buffering land from storm surges (<em>SN: 3/17/18, p. 20</em>). But the book doesn’t spend too much time on nitty-gritty ecology. Instead, Proulx investigates these environments in the context of their relationship with people.</p>



<p>Known for her fiction, Proulx, who penned <em>The Shipping News</em> and “Brokeback Mountain,” draws on historical accounts, literature and archaeological digs to imagine places lost to time. She challenges the notion that wetlands are purely unpleasant or disturbing — think Shrek’s swamp, where only an ogre would want to live, or the Swamps of Sadness in <em>The Neverending Story </em>that swallow up Atreyu’s horse.</p>



<p>Proulx jumps back as far as 20,000 years ago to the bottom of the North Sea, which at the time was a hilly swath called Doggerland. When sea levels rose in the seventh century B.C., people there learned to thrive on the region’s developing fens, hunting for fish and eels. In Ireland, “bog bodies” — many thought to be human sacrifices — have been preserved in the peat for thousands of years; Proulx imagines torchlit ceremonies where people were offered to the mud, a connection to the natural world that is hard for many people to comprehend today. These spaces were integrated into the local cultures, from Renaissance paintings of wetlands to British lingo such as <em>didder</em> (the way a bog quivers when stepped on). Proulx also reflects on her own childhood memories — wandering through wetlands in Connecticut, a swamp in Vermont — and describes how she, like writer Henry David Thoreau, finds beauty in these places. “It is … possible to love a swamp,” she says.</p>



<p>Fens, bogs and swamps are technically distinct, but they’re also fluid; one wetland may transition into another depending on its water source. This same fluidity is reflected in the book, where Proulx flits from one wetland to another, from one part of the world to another, from one millennium to another. At times didactic and meandering, Proulx will veer off to discuss humankind’s destructive tendency not just in wetlands, but nature in general, broadly rehashing aspects of the climate crisis that most readers interested in the environment are probably already familiar with. I was most enthralled — and heartbroken — by the stories I had never heard before: of “Yde Girl,” a redheaded teenager sacrificed to a bog; the zombie fires in Arctic peatlands that burn underground; and the ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird missing from southern U.S. swamps for almost a century.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saba-caribbean-island-species-conservation">A Caribbean island gets everyone involved in protecting beloved species</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The coral reef, once bustling with more than 5,000 long-spined sea urchins, became a ghost town in a matter of days. White skeletons with dangling spines dotted the reef near the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba, the water cloudy from the disintegrating corpses. In just a week last April, half of the urchins, <em>Diadema antillarum</em>, in a section of reef called “Diadema City” had died. In June, only 100 remained.</p>



<p>The mysterious die-off started sweeping across the Caribbean in February. It’s eerily similar to a mass mortality event in 1983 that wiped out as much as 99 percent of the Caribbean <em>Diadema</em> population — a huge blow to not only the urchins, which have not fully recovered four decades later, but also the reefs. Without urchins grazing, algae can overwhelm a reef, damaging adult coral and leaving nowhere for new coral to settle.</p>





<p>Before the die-off, Saba’s coral cover — the part of a reef that consists of live hard coral rather than sponges, algae or other organisms — hovered around 50 percent. Today, that number is down to 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s just downhill, downhill, downhill,” says Alwin Hylkema, a marine ecologist at Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences and Wageningen University in the Netherlands who is based in Saba (pronounced “say-bah”).</p>



<p>I learned about Saba’s sea urchin problem only shortly after I learned that the island existed. Saba is a blip in the Caribbean; at 13 square kilometers, it’s about a quarter the size of Manhattan, with the towering Mount Scenery volcano at its center. Its reefs attract scuba divers, but a lack of beaches shields it from regular Caribbean tourist traffic — hence its nickname, “the unspoiled queen.” What the island lacks in size and sand it makes up for with its great variety of species, its biodiversity. Steep cliffs support several micro­climates. In just a few hours, a visitor can hike from volcanic rock to grassy field to misty cloud forest.</p>



<p>This diversity makes Saba the perfect spot for Sea &amp; Learn, an annual educational program that brings scientists from around the world to the island. Former dive shop owner Lynn Costenaro launched the program in 2003 to encourage more divers to visit Saba during the off-season. But the event has grown to play an important role in educating the island’s 2,000 residents about their home’s unique wildlife and ecosystems.</p>



<p>Throughout October, the scientists present their research on everything from biology and geology to astronomy at restaurants and in plazas. Several researchers also host public research trips underwater and on shore, so attendees can see the lobsters, or rock formations or stars for themselves.</p>

<p>This kind of local engagement with the environment comes at a time when many species are at risk, and not just on Saba, says Severin Irl, an island ecologist at Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. Although islands cover only about 7 percent of the world’s landmass, they are home to an estimated 20 percent of all species — and 75 percent of all documented extinctions.</p>



<p>Some island species occupy only one island; others are spread out in small populations across several islands. Species within small populations can develop a very narrow, island-specific set of adaptations, which spells trouble when humans and invasive species arrive. Today, any given plant or animal on an island is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989421003978#fig0025">12 times as likely to go extinct as species on the mainland</a>, Irl and an international group of researchers reported in the November 2021 <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em>. And the decline is speeding up at an unprecedented rate. As biodiversity decreases, islands lose the complexity that helps keep the ecosystem stable and less vulnerable to disruptions, such as climate change.</p>



<p>“We’re in the midst of a biodiversity crisis … and islands are really bearing the brunt of that global change,” says arachnologist Lauren Esposito of the California Academy of Sciences, who has <a href="https://www.seaandlearn.org/lauren-esposito">presented research</a> on spiders and scorpions at Sea &amp; Learn.</p>



<p>The features that put island inhabitants at risk — their small size and isolation — also make them wonderful laboratories. Like the famous Galápagos Islands that turned Charles Darwin on to natural selection, islands present opportunities to study individual species as well as ecosystem dynamics, in a relatively small microcosm. In 2021, the California Academy of Sciences launched Islands 2030, co-led by Esposito, in five tropical archipelagos, including the Lesser Antilles where Saba is located. The aim is to conduct biodiversity research as well as train local communities to become guardians of their environments. The program took its inaugural trip to Saba’s Sea &amp; Learn last October.</p>



<p>I attended that Sea &amp; Learn and tagged along on field trips to see what progress and pitfalls researchers had experienced while working on Saba to protect a tiny orchid, a bright-billed bird and those dying urchins.</p>



<h4>Counting orchids</h4>



<p>On my first night, I joined locals and tourists at the Brigadoon restaurant to hear Mike Bechtold talk about Saba’s orchids. Bechtold, a retired nuclear arms expert from Virginia who fell in love with orchids while serving in Korea, first traveled to the island in 2003 to study the flowers. He’s since presented several times at Sea &amp; Learn. This was his first time back in seven years.</p>



<p>After defining an orchid as a flowering plant with three petals and a laundry list of unusual attributes, Bechtold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIGqOKm_jNI">described the disorganized history of orchid research on Saba</a>, including a series of miscommunications that has resulted in count discrepancies. A recently published book identifies 22 species, while Bechtold counts 32.</p>



<p>“To know what we have to preserve, well, we at least have to know what is there,” says Michiel Boeken, a former secondary school teacher from the Netherlands who studied orchids on Saba during his 2010 to 2012 tenure as principal of the island’s only secondary school.</p>



<p>The morning after his presentation, Bechtold led a hike to Spring Bay to look for orchids. We walked along the island’s only major road — aptly named The Road. At the trailhead, we descended into a swath of trees laden with mosses and other plants. We’d only walked for about 10 minutes when Bechtold pointed out an <em>Epidendrum ciliare</em>, the most common orchid on Saba, perched on a tree.</p>

BOEKEN</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Stepping carefully over hermit crabs, we looked for the pile of rocks that marked where to leave the trail to find another species, <em>Brassavola cucullata</em>. Bechtold, Boeken and colleagues had surveyed the Spring Bay population from 2011 to 2014 to see if Saba’s numbers were declining. As we lowered ourselves down the steep hillside, we eventually spied the tiny white and yellow flowers of <em>B. cucullata</em> atop a tall tree with a metal tag glued beneath it; it was #582 of 834 <em>B. cucullata </em>plants that Bechtold helped tag a decade earlier.</p>



<p>We counted the plant’s leaves and measured them. Bechtold’s team had found that larger plants with more leaves had a better chance of survival than smaller plants, as did plants that were higher off the ground, like #582. Plants close to the ground were often munched on by wild goats.</p>



<p>The orchid is found from Mexico to northern South America. But here, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/709399">the <em>B. cucullata</em> population was indeed declining</a>, with small plants dying and not many new plants starting to grow, the researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>International Journal of Plant Sciences</em>. Without counting flowers for many more years, if not decades, it will be hard to know if the decline reflects natural population dynamics or if it’s a troublesome trend.</p>



<p>Regardless of cause, the population’s small size makes the island’s<em> B. cucullata </em>vulnerable. A recent hurricane knocked over several trumpet trees hosting large orchid plants. Some of the plants were crushed; others, lowered to the ground when their tree toppled, faced death by goat chomping.</p>



<h4>Tracking red-billed tropicbirds</h4>



<p>A week after the orchid hike, I found myself perched on a boulder high up on a cliff at Tent Bay on the island’s southern coast, looking for nests tucked into narrow rock crevices. German ecologist Lara Mielke, another volunteer and I started out at dawn to beat the heat, climbing hand over foot up the exposed hill. Overhead, red-billed tropicbirds, with long white tails and bright crimson beaks, swooped out across the sea.</p>



<p>About 1,500 breeding pairs of <em>Phaethon aethereus mesonauta</em>, one of the three subspecies of red-billed tropicbirds, breed on Saba, as much as a quarter of the subspecies’s global population. Tropic­birds spend most of their lives at sea, only coming to land for a few months each year to breed and raise a single chick. Their cliffside nesting spot makes the birds hard to study even when they’re on land. Fortunately, on Saba and the neighboring island Saint Eustatius, or “Statia,” the terrain is tough but not impossible to scale.</p>

<p>While climbing, I was startled by an abrasive squawk coming from a deep crevice hiding a nest. But the birds are more squawk than bite, and Mielke was able to reach her arm into the small opening and extract the bird to wrap a band around its leg.</p>



<p>Tameness, helpful when it comes to banding, makes these birds vulnerable to invasive predators. Tropicbird chicks are often eaten by feral cats that roam the island’s cliffs. Over the years, the Saba Conservation Foundation has set up cat eradication programs with mixed success.</p>



<p>After banding the bird, Mielke handed me a warm egg she’d pulled from the nest. I held it in my palm as she filled a plastic bin with water. An egg’s buoyancy indicates how far along it is. We knew, though, that once the chick hatched, it probably wouldn’t live long. In past years, researchers have observed the disappearance of every chick at Tent Bay, presumably snatched by the feral cats.</p>



<p>Chicks have much better odds on the other side of the island. In 2011 and 2012, Boeken — involved in several conservation efforts on Saba — <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-104/issue-3/arde.v104i3.a8/Breeding-Success-of-Red-Billed-Tropicbirds-iPhaethon-aethereus-i-on/10.5253/arde.v104i3.a8.short">found that 62 of 83 hatchlings, or 75 percent</a>, at Old Booby Hill near Spring Bay to the north survived to fledge the nest. And on Statia, which has no cat problem, as many as 90 percent of chicks survive after they’ve hatched. Though, for reasons still unknown, <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-107/issue-3/arde.v107i3.a2/----Custom-HTML----Reproductive/10.5253/arde.v107i3.a2.short">their colonies produce much fewer chicks </a>because many eggs simply never hatch.</p>



<p>Tropicbirds are faithful to both their mate and nest site, sometimes even returning to the same rock cavity each year, says ecologist Hannah Madden of the Caribbean Netherlands Science Institute, who moved from the Netherlands to Statia in 2006 and has spearheaded Statia and Saba’s tropicbird research. But the birds may be loyal to a fault. If a nest is repeatedly robbed or eggs fail to hatch, the chances of successfully raising chicks may be increased by relocating or finding a new mate.</p>

<p>Madden and Mielke, working as an independent researcher, are now analyzing GPS data of the subspecies’s foraging patterns. The last Caribbean-wide assessment of seabirds <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E-Schreiber-2/publication/272791650_West_Indian_Seabirds_a_Disappearing_Natural_Resource/links/5ea2fa5492851c87d1b13492/West-Indian-Seabirds-a-Disappearing-Natural-Resource.pdf#page=37">happened over two decades ago</a>, so Madden has been hosting webinars to teach people on other islands how to collect such data during next year’s nesting season.</p>



<p>“In 2023, we want people from as many islands as possible in the Caribbean to get out there and monitor the seabirds on their islands,” she says.</p>

<h4>Hitting home</h4>



<p>Peter Johnson, an 11th-generation Saba resident, teaches math and physics at the secondary school. Sometimes after class he sits outside the school and listens to the red-billed tropicbirds flying overhead.</p>



<p>“Their birdcall is so unique,” he says. “They’re certainly something that reminds me of home.”</p>



<p>Johnson was a kid when Sea &amp; Learn started in 2003. He still remembers when, in the fifth grade, scientists came to his classroom and let him try on a spelunking helmet used for cave exploration. Years later, he returned to Saba after earning degrees in engineering in Virginia. “You’re more inclined to be proud of where you’re from, the more you know about it,” he says.</p>



<p>Esposito, of the Islands 2030 initiative, recalls being impressed by the fluency of Saban youth when talking about nature. Sea &amp; Learn scientists visit Saba’s schools to teach about the island’s unique species. When Esposito asks students if they’ve seen the island’s local snake — its only snake, the red-bellied racer — they usually say yes. She doesn’t get the same answer on Statia or neighboring islands.</p>



<p>“I have seen the direct effect of Sea &amp; Learn,” she says. “There is this connection between the people coming to do research and the local population and communities that doesn’t exist in most other places.”</p>



<p>Sea &amp; Learn coordinator Emily Malsack hopes the program encourages locals to stay on Saba to work in conservation. It’s already having an impact. Johnson is now the president of the Saba Conservation Foundation. Saban native Dahlia Hassell-Knijff got a degree in biology in Mississippi, then returned to the island, where she oversees projects at the regional Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance. She also grew up attending Sea &amp; Learn.</p>



<p>“It was a very tiny organization [at the time], but it didn’t seem tiny to me,” Hassell-Knijff says. “It was like a dream come true for a little kid.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="491" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8.jpg" alt="Alwyn Hylkema talks about sea urchins to a crowd on Saba island" class="wp-image-3117522" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8-530x383.jpg 530w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8-623x450.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8-258x186.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117522">A crowd gathered on a Saba plaza last October to hear researcher Alwin Hylkema talk about sea urchins.

<p>Hassell-Knijff’s story is “an indication of progress that’s to come,” Esposito says. Islands 2030 plans to recruit early-career scientists from five archipelagoes to attend the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, where they can work toward an advanced degree and become part of a network of scientists from their archipelago. The hope is that this next generation will return to their home islands to become leaders in biodiversity science and conservation.</p>



<p>There’s a need for this support. Many researchers who study island biology travel from abroad, spend some time and leave, causing research to sputter and disrupting long-term studies that are crucial to understanding population trends of, say, orchids and tropicbirds. Mielke recently ended her six months on Saba to return to Germany, and after 16 years on Statia, Madden moved back to the Netherlands this summer.</p>



<p>“It’s just tough,” Madden says. “At this point, I don’t know who will take over the projects that I’m working on.” Bechtold, too, worries about who will track the orchids after he and Boeken retire from research and can no longer travel to Saba.</p>



<h4>Saving the urchins</h4>



<p>The night that marine ecologist Alwin Hylkema <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seaandlearn/videos/569244107627656">presented his research about <em>Diadema</em></a>, the plaza was packed with over 100 adults and children. Hylkema has become something of a local celebrity. At first, he conducted his urchin research from the Netherlands, visiting Saba twice a year, until he realized it made more sense to do his studies on site. He moved his family to Saba in 2019.</p>



<p>Since then, Hylkema has worked on restoring <em>Diadema</em> to the reefs around Saba. But it’s a challenge: After urchin larvae settle onto a reef, they are easily eaten by queen triggerfish and spiny lobsters. To help more of the animals survive to adulthood, Hylkema’s team has been collecting the youngsters, known as settlers, and growing them in a lab on Saba. Once the animals are a few centimeters wide and less likely to become a meal, the team returns them to the reefs.</p>



<p>In October 2021, things were starting to look up for the animals. That same week, <a href="https://www.saba-news.com/great-news-for-coral-reef-restoration-first-diadema-sea-urchins-cultured-on-saba/">Hylkema’s team bred <em>Diadema</em> in captivity for the first time in Caribbean history</a>.</p>



<p>The lab-grown urchin success came just in time. Hylkema anticipates producing 1,000 to 2,000 juveniles by the end of this year, which he hopes to use for restocking the devastated population at Diadema City. But that will have to wait until whatever is causing the die-off dissipates. Researchers at Cornell University are analyzing <em>Diadema</em> tissue sent by Hylkema and others to try to determine the cause, likely a pathogen.</p>

<p>One afternoon, I hitchhiked south from the town of Windwardside in the middle of the island to the harbor in Fort Bay, where Hylkema’s lab is located. I wanted to see the captive-bred <em>Diadema</em>. The crates in the lab were organized by urchin size: The youngest ones looked like inch-long pom-poms; older urchins resembled plums covered in long, black sewing needles.</p>



<p>In an air-conditioned storage container out back, specks of urchin larvae swirled in glass jars on a vibrating metal plate. After 50 or so days, the larvae will settle and eventually be transferred to the crates. If all goes well, the animals will grow in the lab until they’re big enough to be taken out to the reefs, where they’ll begin the next generation of <em>Diadema</em>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">NASA’s DART spacecraft just smashed into an asteroid — on purpose</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mission control rooms rarely celebrate crash landings. But the collision of NASA’s DART spacecraft with an asteroid was a smashing success.</p>



<p>At about 7:15 p.m. EDT on September 26, the spacecraft hurtled into Dimorphos, an asteroid moonlet orbiting a larger space rock named Didymos. The mission’s goal was to bump Dimorphos slightly closer to its parent asteroid, shortening its 12-hour orbit around Didymos by several minutes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-moon-name-nasa-course-deflection-mission">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, or DART, is the world’s first attempt to change an asteroid’s motion by ramming a space probe into it (<em>SN: 6/30/20</em>). Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a threat to Earth. But seeing how well DART’s maneuver worked will reveal how easy it is to tamper with an asteroid’s trajectory — a strategy that could protect the planet if a large asteroid is ever discovered on a collision course with Earth.</p>



<p>“We don’t know of any large asteroids that would be considered a threat to Earth that are coming any time in the next century,” says DART team member Angela Stickle, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. “The reason that we are doing something like DART is because there are asteroids that we haven’t discovered yet.”</p>

<p>Astronomers have spotted almost all the kilometer-size asteroids in the solar system that could end civilization if they hit Earth, says Jessica Sunshine, a planetary scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park who’s also on the DART team. But when it comes to space rocks around 150 meters wide, like Dimorphos, “we only know where about 40 percent of those are,” Sunshine says. “And that is something that, if it did hit, would certainly take out a city.”</p>



<p>Dimorphos is a safe asteroid to give an experimental nudge, says Mark Boslough, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico who has studied planetary protection but is not involved in DART. “It’s not on a collision course” with Earth, he says, and DART “can’t hit it hard enough to put it on a collision course.” The DART spacecraft weighs only as much as a couple of vending machines, whereas Dimorphos is thought to be nearly as hefty as Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>



<p>After a 10-month voyage, DART met up with Didymos and Dimorphos near their closest approach to Earth, about 11 million kilometers away. Up until the very end of its journey, DART could see only the larger asteroid, Didymos. But about an hour before impact, DART spotted Dimorphos in its field of view. Using its onboard camera, the spacecraft steered itself toward the asteroid moonlet and slammed into it at some 6.1 kilometers per second, or nearly 14,000 miles per hour.</p>

This image of the space rock was taken by DART just seconds before the spacecraft smashed into it.  <br><br>NASA</figcaption></figure>



<p>DART’s camera feed went dark after impact. But another probe nearby caught the collision on camera. The Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids rode to Dimorphos aboard DART but detached a couple of weeks before impact to watch the event from a safe distance. Its mission was to whiz past Dimorphos about three minutes after DART’s impact to snap pictures of the crash site and the resulting plume of asteroid debris launched into space. The probe&#8217;s first images of DART&#8217;s demise were released September 27.</p>

<p>“I was absolutely elated, especially as we saw the camera getting closer and just realizing all the science that we’re going to learn,” said Pam Melroy, NASA Deputy Administrator, after the impact. “But the best part was seeing, at the end, that there was no question there was going to be an impact, and to see the team overjoyed with their success.”</p>



<p>DART’s impact is expected to shove Dimorphos into a closer, shorter orbit around Didymos. Telescopes on Earth can clock the timing of that orbit by watching how the amount of light from the double asteroid system changes as Dimorphos passes in front of and behind Didymos.</p>

<p>“It’s really a beautifully conceived experiment,” Boslough says. In the coming weeks, dozens of telescopes across every continent will watch Dimorphos to see how much DART changed its orbit. The Hubble and James Webb space telescopes may also get images.</p>







<p>“It’ll be really interesting to see what comes out,” says Amy Mainzer, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who is not involved in DART. “Asteroids have a way of surprising us,” she says, because it’s hard to know a space rock’s precise chemical makeup and internal structure based on observations from Earth. So Dimorphos’ motion post-impact may not exactly match researchers’ expectations.</p>



<p>The DART team will compare data on Dimorphos’ new orbit with their computer simulations to see how close those models were to predicting the asteroid’s actual behavior and tweak them accordingly. “If we can get our models to reproduce what actually happened, then you can use those models to [plan for] other scenarios that might show up in the future” — like the discovery of a real killer asteroid, says DART team member Wendy Caldwell, a mathematician and planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>



<p>“No matter what happens,” she says, “we will get information that is valuable to the scientific community and to the planetary defense community.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-cacao-ceramics-royals-currency-ritual">In Maya society, cacao use was for everyone, not just royals</a></h4>

              
                <p>In ancient Maya civilization, cacao wasn’t just for the elites.</p>



<p>Traces of the sacred plant <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2121821119">show up in ceramics</a> from all types of neighborhoods and dwellings in and around a former Maya city, researchers report September 26 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding suggests that, contrary to previous thinking, cacao was consumed at every social level of Maya society.</p>



<p>“Now we know that the rituals the elite depict with cacao were likely played out, like Thanksgiving, like any other ritual, by everyone,” says Anabel Ford, an archaeologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>





<p>Cacao — which chocolate is made from — was sacred to the ancient Maya, consumed in rituals and used as a currency. The cacao tree (<em>Theobroma cacao</em>) itself was linked to Hun Hunahpu, the maize god. Previous research found cacao in ceremonial vessels and elite burials, suggesting that its use was restricted to those at the top.</p>



<p>To explore the extent to which cacao was used in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">broader Maya society</a>, Ford and colleagues examined 54 ceramic shards dating from A.D. 600 to 900 (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>). The shards come from jars, mixing bowls, serving plates and vases thought to be drinking vessels. All the pieces were found in residential and ceremonial civic areas of varying size and status from city centers, foothills, upland areas and the valley around the former Maya city of El Pilar, on the present-day border of Guatemala and Belize.</p>



<p>To identify cacao, the researchers searched for theophylline, a compound found in trace amounts in the plant. The team found the compound on more than half of the samples, on all types of ceramics and distributed throughout social contexts.</p>



<p>Future research will move beyond who consumed cacao and explore the role of farmers in managing the critical resource. “A better question is to understand who grew it,” Ford says, because those people probably had greater access to the prized commodity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangrove-forest-grow-moon-orbit-lunar-cycle">Mangrove forests expand and contract with a lunar cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>The glossy leaves and branching roots of mangroves are downright eye-catching, and now a study finds that the moon plays a special role in the vigor of these trees.</p>



<p>Long-term tidal cycles <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo6602">set in motion by the moon</a> drive, in large part, the expansion and contraction of mangrove forests in Australia, researchers report in the Sept. 16 <em>Science Advances</em>. This discovery is key to predicting when stands of mangroves, which are good at sequestering carbon and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">could help fight climate change</a>, are most likely to proliferate (<em>SN: 11/18/21</em>). Such knowledge could inform efforts to protect and restore the forests.</p>





<p>Mangroves are coastal trees that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">provide habitat for fish and buffer against erosion</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>). But in some places, the forests face a range of threats, including coastal development, pollution and land clearing for agriculture. To get a bird’s-eye view of these forests, Neil Saintilan, an environmental scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, and his colleagues turned to satellite imagery. Using NASA and U.S. Geological Survey Landsat data from 1987 to 2020, the researchers calculated how the size and density of mangrove forests across Australia changed over time.</p>



<p>After accounting for persistent increases in these trees’ growth — probably due to rising carbon dioxide levels, higher sea levels and increasing air temperatures — Saintilan and his colleagues noticed a curious pattern. Mangrove forests tended to expand and contract in both extent and canopy cover in a predictable manner. “I saw this 18-year oscillation,” Saintilan says.</p>



<p>That regularity got the researchers thinking about the moon. Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor has <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/tides/">long been known to help drive the tides</a>, which deliver water and necessary nutrients to mangroves. A rhythm called the lunar nodal cycle could explain the mangroves’ growth pattern, the team hypothesized.</p>



<p>Over the course of 18.6 years, the plane of the moon’s orbit around Earth slowly tips. When the moon’s orbit is the least tilted relative to our planet’s equator, semidiurnal tides — which consist of two high and two low tides each day — tend to have a larger range. That means that in areas that experience semidiurnal tides, higher high tides and lower low tides are generally more likely. The effect is caused by the angle at which the moon tugs gravitationally on the Earth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Saintilan and his colleagues found that mangrove forests experiencing semidiurnal tides tended to be larger and denser precisely when higher high tides were expected based on the moon’s orbit. The effect even seemed to outweigh other climatic drivers of mangrove growth, such as El Niño conditions. Other regions with mangroves, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, probably experience the same long-term trends, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Having access to data stretching back decades was key to this discovery, Saintilan says. “We’ve never really picked up before some of these longer-term drivers of vegetation dynamics.”</p>



<p>It’s important to recognize this effect on mangrove populations, says Octavio Aburto-Oropeza, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Scientists now know when some mangroves are particularly likely to flourish and should make an extra effort at those times to promote the growth of these carbon-sequestering trees, Aburto-Oropeza says. That might look like added limitations on human activity nearby that could harm the forests, he says. “We should be more proactive.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/olivine-deep-earthquake-mineral-pressure-temperature">Here’s how olivine may trigger deep earthquakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cocooned within the bowels of the Earth, one mineral’s metamorphosis into another may trigger some of the deepest earthquakes ever detected.</p>



<p>These cryptic tremors — known as deep-focus earthquakes — are a seismic conundrum. They violently rupture at depths greater than 300 kilometers, where intense temperatures and pressures are thought to force rocks to flow smoothly. Now, experiments suggest that those same hellish conditions might also sometimes transform olivine — the primary mineral in Earth’s mantle — into the mineral wadsleyite. This mineral switch-up can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32923-8">destabilize the surrounding rock</a>, enabling earthquakes at otherwise impossible depths, mineral physicist Tomohiro Ohuchi and colleagues report September 15 in <em>Nature Communications.</em></p>





<p>“It’s been a real puzzle for many scientists because earthquakes shouldn’t occur deeper than 300 kilometers,” says Ohuchi, of Ehime University in Matsuyama, Japan.</p>



<p>Deep-focus earthquakes usually occur at subduction zones where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">tectonic plates</a> made of oceanic crust — rich in olivine — plunge toward the mantle (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Since the quakes’ seismic waves lose strength during their long ascent to the surface, they aren’t typically dangerous. But that doesn’t mean the quakes aren’t sometimes powerful. In 2013, a magnitude 8.3 deep-focus quake struck around 609 kilometers below the Sea of Okhotsk, just off Russia’s eastern coast.</p>



<p>Past studies hinted that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/348720a0">unstable olivine crystals could spawn deep quakes</a>. But those studies tested other minerals that were similar in composition to olivine but deform at lower pressures, Ohuchi says, or the experiments didn’t strain samples enough to form faults.</p>



<p>He and his team decided to put olivine itself to the test. To replicate conditions deep underground, the researchers heated and squeezed olivine crystals up to nearly 1100° Celsius and 17 gigapascals. Then the team used a mechanical press to further compress the olivine slowly and monitored the deformation.</p>



<p>From 11 to 17 gigapascals and about 800° to 900° C, the olivine recrystallized into thin layers containing new wadsleyite and smaller olivine grains. The researchers also found tiny faults and recorded bursts of sound waves — indicative of miniature earthquakes. Along subducting tectonic plates, many of these thin layers grow and link to form weak regions in the rock, upon which faults and earthquakes can initiate, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>“The transformation really wreaks havoc with the [rock’s] mechanical stability,” says geophysicist Pamela Burnley of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the research. The findings help confirm that olivine transformations are enabling deep-focus earthquakes, she says.</p>



<p>Next, Ohuchi’s team plans to experiment on olivine at even higher pressures to gain insights into the mineral’s deformation at greater depths.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-rings-new-image-james-webb-telescope">Here is the first direct look at Neptune’s rings in more than 30 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humankind is seeing Neptune’s rings in a whole new light thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>In an infrared image released September 21, Neptune and its gossamer diadems of dust <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-046/">take on an ethereal glow</a> against the inky backdrop of space. The stunning portrait is a huge improvement over the rings’ previous close-up, which was taken more than 30 years ago.</p>



<p>Unlike the dazzling belts encircling Saturn, Neptune’s rings appear dark and faint in visible light, making them difficult to see from Earth. The last time anyone saw Neptune’s rings was in 1989, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgic-voyager-documentary-relives-first-exploration-solar-system">NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft</a>, after tearing past the planet, snapped a couple grainy photos from roughly 1 million kilometers away (<em>SN: 8/7/17</em>). In those photos, taken in visible light, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.246.4936.1422">the rings appear as thin, concentric arcs</a>.</p>



<p>As Voyager 2 continued to interplanetary space, Neptune’s rings once again went into hiding — until July. That’s when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, or JWST, turned its sharp, infrared gaze toward the planet from roughly 4.4 billion kilometers away (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>).</p>

<p>Neptune itself appears mostly dark in the new image. That’s because methane gas in the planet’s atmosphere absorbs much of its infrared light. A few bright patches mark where high-altitude methane ice clouds reflect sunlight.</p>



<p>And then there are the ever-elusive rings. “The rings have lots of ice and dust in them, which are extremely reflective in infrared light,” says Stefanie Milam, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and one of JWST’s project scientists. The enormity of the telescope’s mirror also makes its images extra sharp. “JWST was designed to look at the first stars and galaxies across the universe, so we can really see fine details that we haven’t been able to see before,” Milam says.</p>



<p>Upcoming JWST observations will look at Neptune with other scientific instruments. That should provide new intel on the rings’ composition and dynamics, as well as on how Neptune’s clouds and storms evolve, Milam says. “There’s more to come.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphafold-ai-protein-structure-folding-prediction">Has AlphaFold actually solved biology’s protein-folding problem?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As people around the world marveled in July at the most detailed pictures of the cosmos snapped by the James Webb Space Telescope, biologists got their first glimpses of a different set of images — ones that could help revolutionize life sciences research.</p>



<p>The images are the predicted 3-D shapes of more than 200 million proteins, rendered by an artificial intelligence system called AlphaFold. “You can think of it as covering the entire protein universe,” said Demis Hassabis at a July 26 news briefing. Hassabis is cofounder and CEO of DeepMind, the London-based company that created the system. Combining several deep-learning techniques, the computer program is trained to predict protein shapes by recognizing patterns in structures that have already been solved through decades of experimental work using electron microscopes and other methods.</p>





<p>The AI’s first splash came in 2021, with predictions for 350,000 protein structures — including almost all known human proteins. DeepMind partnered with the European Bioinformatics Institute of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory to make the structures available in a public database.</p>



<p>July’s massive new release expanded the library to “almost every organism on the planet that has had its genome sequenced,” Hassabis said. “You can look up a 3-D structure of a protein almost as easily as doing a key word Google search.”</p>



<p>These are predictions, not actual structures. Yet researchers have used some of the 2021 predictions to develop <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493318v1">potential new malaria vaccines</a>, improve understanding of Parkinson’s disease, work out how to protect honeybee health, gain insight into human evolution and more. DeepMind has also focused AlphaFold on neglected tropical diseases, including Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, which can be debilitating or lethal if left untreated.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Expanding the protein universe&nbsp; </h4>



<p>Decades of slow-going experiments have revealed the structure of more than 194,000 proteins, all housed in the Protein Data Bank. In 2021, the AlphaFold project released predicted structures for about 1 million proteins, including almost all known human proteins. This year, the AlphaFold database exploded with predicted structures for more than 200 million proteins.</p>

<p>The release of the vast dataset was greeted with excitement by many scientists. But others worry that researchers will take the predicted structures as the true shapes of proteins. There are still things AlphaFold can’t do — and wasn’t designed to do — that need to be tackled before the protein cosmos completely comes into focus.</p>



<p>Having the new catalog open to everyone is “a huge benefit,” says Julie Forman-Kay, a protein biophysicist at the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto. In many cases, AlphaFold and <a href="https://www.ipd.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Baek_etal_Science2021_RoseTTAFold.pdf">RoseTTAFold</a>, another AI researchers are excited about, predict shapes that match up well with protein profiles from experiments. But, she cautions, “it’s not that way across the board.”</p>



<p>Predictions are more accurate for some proteins than for others. Erroneous predictions could leave some scientists thinking they understand how a protein works when really, they don’t. Painstaking experiments remain crucial to understanding how proteins fold, Forman-Kay says. “There’s this sense now that people don’t have to do experimental structure determination, which is not true.”</p>

<h4>Plodding progress</h4>



<p>Proteins start out as long chains of amino acids and fold into a host of curlicues and other 3-D shapes. Some resemble the tight corkscrew ringlets of a 1980s perm or the pleats of an accordion. Others could be mistaken for a child’s spiraling scribbles.</p>



<p>A protein’s architecture is more than just aesthetics; it can determine how that protein functions. For instance, proteins called enzymes need a pocket where they can capture small molecules and carry out chemical reactions. And proteins that work in a protein complex, two or more proteins interacting like parts of a machine, need the right shapes to snap into formation with their partners.</p>



<p>Knowing the folds, coils and loops of a protein’s shape may help scientists decipher how, for example, a mutation alters that shape to cause disease. That knowledge could also help researchers make better vaccines and drugs.</p>



<p>For years, scientists have bombarded protein crystals with X-rays, flash frozen cells and examined them under high­powered electron microscopes, and used other methods to discover the secrets of protein shapes. Such experimental methods take “a lot of personnel time, a lot of effort and a lot of money. So it’s been slow,” says Tamir Gonen, a membrane biophysicist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.</p>

<p>Such meticulous and expensive experimental work has uncovered the 3-D structures of more than 194,000 proteins, their data files stored in the Protein Data Bank, supported by a consortium of research organizations. But the accelerating pace at which geneticists are deciphering the DNA instructions for making proteins has far outstripped structural biologists’ ability to keep up, says systems biologist Nazim Bouatta of Harvard Medical School. “The question for structural biologists was, how do we close the gap?” he says.</p>



<p>For many researchers, the dream has been to have computer programs that could examine the DNA of a gene and predict how the protein it encodes would fold into a 3-D shape.</p>



<h4>Here comes AlphaFold</h4>



<p>Over many decades, scientists made progress toward that AI goal. But “until two years ago, we were really a long way from anything like a good solution,” says John Moult, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland’s Rockville campus.</p>



<p>Moult is one of the organizers of a competition: the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP. Organizers give competitors a set of proteins for their algorithms to fold and compare the machines’ predictions against experimentally determined structures. Most AIs failed to get close to the actual shapes of the proteins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“Structure doesn’t tell you everything about how a protein works.”</p><cite>Jane Dyson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Then in 2020, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">AlphaFold</a> showed up in a big way, predicting the structures of 90 percent of test proteins with high accuracy, including two-thirds with accuracy rivaling experimental methods.</p>



<p>Deciphering the structure of single proteins had been the core of the CASP competition since its inception in 1994. With AlphaFold’s performance, “suddenly, that was essentially done,” Moult says.</p>



<p>Since AlphaFold’s 2021 release, more than half a million scientists have accessed its database, Hassabis said in the news briefing. Some researchers, for example, have used AlphaFold’s predictions to help them get closer to completing a massive biological puzzle: the nuclear pore complex. Nuclear pores are key portals that allow molecules in and out of cell nuclei. Without the pores, cells wouldn’t work properly. Each pore is huge, relatively speaking, composed of about 1,000 pieces of 30 or so different proteins. Researchers had previously managed to place about 30 percent of the pieces in the puzzle.</p>

<p>Researchers previously solved about 30 percent of the 1,000-piece puzzle that is the nuclear pore complex. AlphaFold helped make sense of experimental data to complete 60 percent of the structure.</p>

<p>That puzzle is now <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm9506">almost 60 percent complete</a>, after combining AlphaFold predictions with experimental techniques to understand how the pieces fit together, researchers reported in the June 10 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Now that AlphaFold has pretty much solved how to fold single proteins, this year CASP organizers are asking teams to work on the next challenges: Predict the structures of RNA molecules and model how proteins interact with each other and with other molecules.</p>



<p>For those sorts of tasks, Moult says, deep-learning AI methods “look promising but have not yet delivered the goods.”</p>



<h4>Where AI falls short</h4>



<p>Being able to model protein interactions would be a big advantage because most proteins don’t operate in isolation. They work with other proteins or other molecules in cells. But AlphaFold’s accuracy at predicting how the shapes of two proteins might change when the proteins interact are “nowhere near” that of its spot-on projections for a slew of single proteins, says Forman-Kay, the University of Toronto protein biophysicist. That’s something AlphaFold’s creators acknowledge too.</p>



<p>The AI trained to fold proteins by examining the contours of known structures. And many fewer multiprotein complexes than single proteins have been solved experimentally.</p>

<p>Forman-Kay studies proteins that refuse to be confined to any particular shape. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disorder-work-2">intrinsically disordered proteins</a> are typically as floppy as wet noodles (<em>SN: 2/9/13, p. 26</em>). Some will fold into defined forms when they interact with other proteins or molecules. And they can fold into new shapes when paired with different proteins or molecules to do various jobs.</p>



<p>AlphaFold’s <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.18.481080v1">predicted shapes</a> reach a high confidence level for about 60 percent of wiggly proteins that Forman-Kay and colleagues examined, the team reported in a preliminary study posted in February at bioRxiv.org. Often the program depicts the shapeshifters as long corkscrews called alpha helices.</p>



<p>Forman-Kay’s group compared AlphaFold’s predictions for three disordered proteins with experimental data. The structure that the AI assigned to a protein called alpha-synuclein resembles the shape that the protein takes when it interacts with lipids, the team found. But that’s not the way the protein looks all the time.</p>



<p>For another protein, called eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2, AlphaFold predicted a mishmash of the protein’s two shapes when working with two different partners. That Frankenstein structure, which doesn’t exist in actual organisms, could mislead researchers about how the protein works, Forman-Kay and colleagues say.</p>

<p>AlphaFold may also be a little too rigid in its predictions. A static “structure doesn’t tell you everything about how a protein works,” says Jane Dyson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Even single proteins with generally well-defined structures aren’t frozen in space. Enzymes, for example, undergo small shape changes when shepherding chemical reactions.</p>



<p>If you ask AlphaFold to predict the structure of an enzyme, it will show a fixed image that may closely resemble what scientists have determined by X-ray crystallography, Dyson says. “But [it will] not show you any of the subtleties that are changing as the different partners” interact with the enzyme.</p>



<p>“The dynamics are what Mr. AlphaFold can’t give you,” Dyson says.</p>



<h4>A revolution in the making</h4>



<p>The computer renderings do give biologists a head start on solving problems such as how a drug might interact with a protein. But scientists should remember one thing: “These are models,” not experimentally deciphered structures, says Gonen, at UCLA.</p>



<p>He uses AlphaFold’s protein predictions to help make sense of experimental data, but he worries that researchers will accept the AI’s predictions as gospel. If that happens, “the risk is that it will become harder and harder and harder to justify why you need to solve an experimental structure.” That could lead to reduced funding, talent and other resources for the types of experiments needed to check the computer’s work and forge new ground, he says.</p>

<p>Harvard Medical School’s Bouatta is more optimistic. He thinks that researchers probably don’t need to invest experimental resources in the types of proteins that AlphaFold does a good job of predicting, which should help structural biologists triage where to put their time and money.</p>



<p>“There are proteins for which AlphaFold is still struggling,” Bouatta agrees. Researchers should spend their capital there, he says. “Maybe if we generate more [experimental] data for those challenging proteins, we could use them for retraining another AI system” that could make even better predictions.</p>



<p>He and colleagues have already reverse engineered AlphaFold to make a version called OpenFold that researchers can train to solve other problems, such as those gnarly but important protein complexes.</p>



<p>Massive amounts of DNA generated by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/dna-genetics-genome-code-medicine-diversity">Human Genome Project</a> have made a wide range of biological discoveries possible and opened up new fields of research (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 22</em>). Having structural information on 200 million proteins could be similarly revolutionary, Bouatta says.</p>



<p>In the future, thanks to AlphaFold and its AI kin, he says, “we don’t even know what sorts of questions we might be asking.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">How ghostly neutrinos could explain the universe’s matter mystery</a></h4>

              
                <p>The answer to one of the greatest mysteries of the universe may come down to one of the smallest, and spookiest, particles.</p>



<p>Matter is common in the cosmos. Everything around us — from planets to stars to puppies — &nbsp;is made up of matter. But matter has a flip side: antimatter. Protons, electrons and other particles all have antimatter counterparts: antiprotons, positrons, etc. Yet for some reason antimatter is much rarer than matter — and no one knows why.</p>





<p>Physicists believe the universe was born with equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since matter and antimatter counterparts annihilate on contact, that suggests the universe should have ended up with nothing but energy. Something must have tipped the balance.</p>



<p>Some physicists think lightweight subatomic particles called neutrinos could point to an answer. These particles are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-max-possible-mass-tiny-new-estimate-particle-physics">exceedingly tiny</a>, with less than a millionth the mass of an electron (<em>SN: 4/21/21</em>). They’re produced in radioactive decays and in the sun and other cosmic environments. Known for their ethereal tendency to evade detection, neutrinos have earned the nickname “ghost particles.”&nbsp; These spooky particles, originally thought to have no mass at all, have a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-identity-shift-snares-physics-nobel">healthy track record</a> of producing scientific surprises (<em>SN: 10/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>Now researchers are building enormous detectors to find out if neutrinos could help solve the mystery of the universe’s matter. The <a href="https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/hk/">Hyper-Kamiokande</a> experiment in Hida City, Japan, and the <a href="https://www.dunescience.org/">Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</a> in Lead, S.D., will study neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts, antineutrinos. A difference in neutrinos’ and antineutrinos’ behavior might hint at the origins of the matter-antimatter imbalance, scientists suspect.</p>



<p>Watch the video below to find out how neutrinos might reveal why the universe contains, well, anything at all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/face-mask-sensor-airborne-virus-detection-covid">This face mask can sense the presence of an airborne virus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Face masks — the unofficial symbol of the COVID-19 pandemic — are leveling up.</p>



<p>A mask outfitted with special electronics can detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and other airborne viruses <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00477-5">within 10 minutes of exposure</a>, materials researcher Yin Fang and colleagues report September 19 in <em>Matter</em>.</p>



<p>“The lightness and wearability of this face mask allows users to wear it anytime, anywhere,” says Fang, of Tongji University in Shanghai. “It’s expected to serve as an early warning system to prevent large outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases.”</p>

<p>Airborne viruses can hitch a ride between hosts in the air droplets that people breathe in and out. People infected with a respiratory illness can expel thousands of virus-containing droplets by talking, coughing and sneezing. Even those with no signs of being sick can sometimes pass on these viruses; people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 can start infecting others <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">at least two to three days before showing symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). So viruses often have a head start when it comes to infecting new people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fang and his colleagues designed a special sensor that reacts to the presence of certain viral proteins in the air and attached it to a face mask. The team then spritzed droplets containing proteins produced by the viruses that cause COVID-19, bird flu or swine flu into a chamber with the mask.</p>



<p>The sensor could detect just a fraction of a microliter of these proteins — a cough might contain 10 to 80 times as much. Once a pathogen was detected, the sensor-mask combo sent a signal to the researchers informing them of the virus’s presence. Ultimately, the researchers plan for such signals to be sent to a wearer’s phone or other devices. By combining this technology with more conventional testing, the team says, health care providers and public health officials might be able to better contain future pandemics.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_300375879.jpeg.iCeovfbJMUANAA.5Kb7mJqTKJ-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>John Ioannidis’ 2005 article <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a> was an uncomfortable wake-up call for many in the scientific community. The paper has led many to take a more critical eye to published research, leading to a wave of high-profile retractions and several major studies warning of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">reproducibility</a><u> </u>crisis in science. So great is this concern that it has moved out of the academic sphere with governments and regulators taking an interest, such as the 2021 call from the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/562">UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee </a>for evidence on reproducibility and research integrity across research institutions.</p>
<p>Alongside the reproducibility crisis the meaning of the term ‘Research Integrity’ has evolved. Originally used to define a governing ethos for best practice in scientific research and the practices it encompasses, Research Integrity has become a research field in its own right spanning sociology, philosophy, statistics, science education and meta-research. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> recently closed its collection on <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/reproducibility">Reproducibility and Research Integrity</a>, launched in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/">UK Reproducibility Network</a>. The submissions reflect how this field has matured, shifting focus from identifying problems – to offering solutions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">A popular solution to improving research integrity is to educate aspiring researchers on the importance of robust, reproducible scientific practice. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05862-8#auth-Andreas_D_-Meid">Andreas Meid</a> describes a pilot lecture series created to equip their students with this understanding and gives an honest account of what worked and what did not. Dr Meid’s lectures placed focus on developing statistical skills, an approach supported by <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05965-w">Penny Reynolds</a>. In her commentary, she lays out her case for better statistical education for all investigators as a solution to the pervasive reproducibility issues found in translating pre-clinical research stating <em>“Properly designed and analyzed experiments are a matter of ethics as much as procedure&#8230;reducing the numbers of animals wasted in non-informative experiments and increasing overall scientific quality and value of published research.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Properly designed and analyzed experiments are a matter of ethics as much as procedure&#8230;reducing the numbers of animals wasted in non-informative experiments and increasing overall scientific quality and value of published research.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Technical education alone is not enough, argue <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06065-5">Ilinca Ciubotariu and Gundula Bosch</a>. They highlight the importance of science-communication to ratify research quality and promote trust in researchers. In their commentary, they showcase the framework of responsible science communication taught to students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. They hope fostering this ethos will promote more transparent and accountable science in the future. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06098-w">Daniel Pizzolato and Kris Dierickx</a> also consider ways to stimulate responsible research practices across the hierarchies of academic institutions. They advocate turning traditional ideas of pedagogy on their head through reverse mentoring, where a junior academic shares their scientific insights with a senior colleague. Such approaches are well established across many other industries; it seems high time for academia to catch up.</p>

<p>Across the collection, many call for change at the institutional level. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05999-0">Olivia Kowalczyk</a> describes how institute heads can cultivate an environment of reproducible, open research by changing funding and hiring criteria to align with such principles. Sweeping changes in how we value research are called for by Stephen Bradley. He argues that funders should stop using citations and impact factors to assess research and instead make judgements based on quality, reproducibility, and societal value. Scientific publishers must also play their part in the pursuit of better science. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05875-3">Patrick Diaba-Nuhoho and Michael Amponsah-Offeh</a> call for journals to promote the publication of unexpected results and null findings to help dispel the distinctly unscientific taboo of publishing null and negative data*.</p>
<h2>Peer Review<img class="wp-image-12982 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-300x300.png" alt="" width="70" height="70" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-300x300.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-125x125.png 125w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px" /></h2>
<p>Peer review also comes under critique. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06080-6">Robert Schultz</a> ponders the potential of automated screening tools to aid manuscript assessment, hoping it might help to screen a growing influx of new submissions more quickly, allowing reviewers more time to consider the papers they receive. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06016-0">Alexandru Marcoci</a> advocates a total overall to the traditional peer review system. He proposes it be treated like an expert elicitation process, applying methods from mathematics, psychology, and decision theory to mitigate biases and enhance the transparency, accuracy, and defensibility of the resulting judgment. In this way, he argues, peer review will become an intrinsically more transparent and reliable process. An ambitious initiative but perhaps it is time to think big.</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-12986 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-300x300.png" alt="" width="69" height="69" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-300x300.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation-125x125.png 125w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/cooperation.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 69px) 100vw, 69px" />Collaboration</h2>
<p>I contacted two contributors to the collection with the question, ‘If money were no object – what one initiative would about the greatest improvement in research integrity? One wanted the methods section to be mandated as open access across all journals, believing that transparent methods can lead to better science. The other wished to begin a longitudinal study of academic supervisors and their students to identify the best means to promote reproducible science across generations of researchers. Clearly, potential solutions to the reproducibility crisis are manifold, transcending fields and institutions. In a sentiment echoed across the collection, <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05883-3">Andrew Stewart</a> of the UK Reproducibility Network argues that the only way to improve research integrity is to drive systematic change across the key scientific stakeholders: academic institutions, research organizations, funders, publishers, and the government. In agreement, <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06108-x">Natasha Drude</a> emphasizes that the research community should <em>&#8220;view initiatives that promote reproducibility not as a one-size-fits-all undertaking, but rather as an opportunity to unite stakeholders and customize drivers of cultural change.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Overall the view of the collection seems cautiously optimistic. Now that we have established the issues of reproducibility and research integrity, perhaps we have a chance to change science for the better. An attitude well summarized in the title of Guest Editor <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05942-3">Marcus Munafò&#8217;s</a> article &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>“The reproducibility debate is an opportunity, not a crisis”.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sincere thanks to my predecessor Dr. Tamara Hughes for instigating this collection and to Professor. Marcus Munafò for putting it together.</p>
<p>*I feel I must note that <em>BMC Research Notes</em> welcomes submissions presenting null and negative results.</p>
