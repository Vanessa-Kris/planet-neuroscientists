Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are progressive neurodegenerative conditions that unfold over time. Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify prodromal states have included automated analysis of spontaneous<div class="feedflare">

A peculiar new paper proposes the idea of "connecting two spinal cords as a way of sharing information between two brains". The author is Portuguese psychiatrist Amílcar Silva-dos-Santos and the paper appears in Frontiers in Psychology.



Frontiers are a publisher with a troubled history of publishing dubious science. But this paper is unusual, even by Frontiers' standards, because it contains virtually no science at all.

In a nutshell, Silva-Dos-Santos suggests that it would be interest

<p>An editor at two European Geophysical Union journals has resigned following revelations that he or she engaged in citation manipulation — boosting citations to his or her own papers and associated journals. Here’s a letter announcing the news, signed by EGU publication committee chair Hubert Savenije, that ran in several EGU journals earlier this week: […]</p>

<p>True gender equality may be a work in progress, but since the Women’s Liberation Movement beginning in the 1950s and 60s, there has been a lot of positive change, at least in most industrialised nations: a shift towards women having more control over whether and when to have children, for example, and increased opportunities in education and careers, and less tolerance of sexism (though of course it hasn’t gone away). How might these cultural and social changes have influenced women, in terms of how much they act in stereotypically “feminine” ways?</p>
<p>A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10804-016-9243-8/fulltext.html?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">new study</a> by Constance Jones and her colleagues at California State and San Francisco State Universities in the <em>Journal of Adult Development</em> tried to find out by comparing two cohorts of women, one born in the 1920s and the other featuring “Baby Boomers” born in the 1950s. The findings support past work that’s shown how women tend to change through their lives, and they provide evidence for a generation effect: over time, at least in California, women seem to be becoming less stereotypically feminine – that is, less deferential, and more confident and ambitious.</p>
<p><span id="more-19249"></span></p>
<p>The 180 women born in the 1920s took the same California Psychological Inventory five times over as many decades, beginning when they were in their 30s and through into their 80s. The researchers were particularly interested in how they scored on the 32 items of the Inventory that measure femininity defined “as being gentle and warm, but also being dependent, and needing reassurance from others”, and how they scored on the 36 items measuring dominance, defined as “being confident, ambitious, assertive, and enterprising”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 190 women born in the 1950s (actually daughters of the older participants) answered the same questions about their own femininity and dominance, first in 1980s when they were in their 30s, then twice more in their 40s and 50s/60s (taking us up to 2006).</p>
<p>Jones and her team found evidence of lifespan changes in both cohorts. Women in both groups tended to become less stereotypically feminine as they got older (with some return to more femininity later in life) and both groups showed signs of greater dominance with increasing age. Statistically speaking, the magnitude of change was modest in effect size. “[The] women appeared to drop constraining negative aspects of the feminine gender role and take on positive cross-gendered qualities with age,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Comparing across the two cohorts, the women born in the second half of the twentieth century scored lower on femininity when they first completed the inventory in their 30s as compared with the femininity scores of the women born in the 1920s when they were the same age (a modest group difference in terms of effect size). “Most likely reacting to the Women’s Movement zeitgeist, [the younger cohort] entered young adulthood with less obligation to take on feminine gender constraints in the first place,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rate of increase in dominance shown by the second generation women through their lives was more rapid than that shown by their mothers. Because of this difference in speed of change, the researchers said “we can expect the younger cohort women to be higher than the older cohort women in dominance when they reach later adulthood.”</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to see if and how these trends have continued in Generation X and Millenials. If you reflect on your own family – for example, how you or your sisters compare in femininity and dominance (as defined in this study) with your mother – bear in mind the implications of the parallel changes in these traits through lives and across generations. A young woman today might not seem a lot more dominant and less feminine than her mother is today, but that might be because of the way her mother has changed through her life. The chances are that the young woman is more dominant and less feminine than her mother was at the same age.</p>
<p>The study has some issues, including a reliance on how participants rated themselves and missing data from some of the survey points, which meant the researchers sometimes had to extrapolate from the scores they did have. Also both cohort samples were fairly small, and perhaps the observed generational changes are unique to the Bay Area of California. That said, Jones and her team pointed out that it was “rare to be able to examine personality change across such as expansive portion of the lifespan (age 20s through the 80s) and to be able to tie two historically important cohorts together.”</p>

<img alt="Lemur fig 5" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-5-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Picking a face out of a crowd</strong></p>
<p>As our closest relatives, primates have long been a focus of research into their behavior and evolution. As many primate species become threatened with extinction, research on wild populations has become even more important, being crucial to conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Long-term studies, following primate social groups over many years, can be especially informative. However, a key requirement for such studies is to consistently and accurately identify different individuals: not always an easy task.</p>
<p>The traditional way of identifying individuals is to capture them and attach a tag or collar. This has proven to be an effective technique on a number of successful long-term field studies. However it also comes with drawbacks. Capturing animals can be hard enough with birds or small mammals like rodents; for large primates, it usually involves darting them with a blow-gun or air rifle.</p>
<p>This is both expensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of individuals that can be tagged. Of even greater concern, the act of capture itself can be harmful to the animals, whether through damage caused during capture (anything from stress to broken bones), or by disrupting group dynamics.</p>
<p>An alternative to capturing and tagging is to identify individuals via natural variation in their features, such as scars or skin patterns. This does, however, require considerable skill on the part of observers. Even with extensive training, it is still inevitable that errors will occur in identification both within and between observers.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8581" style="width: 2000px;"><img alt="Lemur fig 1" class="wp-image-8581 size-full" height="1442" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-1.jpg" width="1990" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Examples of different lemur species, demonstrating the facial features that can allow individuals to be accurately identified.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">David Crouse, Rachel Jacobs, Stacey Tecot</div></figure>
<p>What is really needed is a non-invasive identification method that relies less on human perception. The developing field of animal biometrics offers a potential solution, with automated recognition systems showing promise in a number of mammal species. New research, <a href="http://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-016-0011-9">published today </a>in <em>BMC Zoology</em>, describes the development of such an automated facial recognition system for lemurs: LemurFaceID.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s that lemur?</strong></p>
<p>The study is the result of collaboration between a number of US-based scientists, led by lemur researchers <a href="http://rachellynjacobs.weebly.com/">Rachel Jacobs</a> and <a href="http://stecot.weebly.com/">Stacy Tecot</a> and biometrics researchers David Crouse and <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/~jain/">Anil Jain</a>.</p>
<p>Their work takes advantage of a well-studied population of red-bellied lemurs. Like all lemurs, the red-bellied lemur is found only on the island of Madagascar. The study population, living in Ranomafana National Park, has been the subject of multiple research projects since the 1980s.</p>
<p>In recent years, a substantial database of known individuals has been built up, based on variation in facial patterns. However, substantial training is required to identify individuals in this way, which led the researchers to develop this new system that can automatically match a photo of a lemur’s face to a database of known individuals.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8582" style="width: 1700px;"><img alt="Lemur fig 2" class="wp-image-8582 size-full" height="1129" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-2.png" width="1690" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Red bellied lemurs. The individual on the right is female, on the left a male, with distinctive white patch of skin around the eyes. Facial patterns are individually variable, allowing researchers to identify individuals</div><div class="attachment-image--source">J. Falinomenjanahary</div></figure>
<p>In all, the researchers had access to 462 images of 80 red-bellied lemur individuals. LemurFaceID requires a researcher to manually locate the eyes in the picture, the critical aspect of this recognition system, as with most human facial recognition systems. Various other alterations are then made to the image (see below for a basic outline of the process) before LemurFaceID automatically compares and matches it to the database of known individuals.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8584" style="width: 4985px;"><img alt="Flowchart of how LemurFaceID works." class="size-full wp-image-8584" height="3430" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lemur-fig-6.png" width="4975" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Flowchart of how LemurFaceID works.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Crouse et al. 2017</div></figure>
<p>The results show that LemurFaceID has a relatively high level of accuracy (98.7%) in ‘closed set’ mode – i.e. when only tested with pictures of known individuals already included in its database. Accuracy was lower in an ‘open-set’ mode when it was tested with pictures of lemurs not already included in the database. This suggests that, for now, LemurFaceID would be most useful for captive or well-studied wild populations (like this one) where all individuals are known.</p>
<p>However, the researchers are confident that the system can be further improved by the addition of larger datasets of photos and individuals, along with further field testing, eventually improving its ability to distinguish between known and novel individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Facing the potential</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a non-invasive method to recognise lemurs that does not require extensive training. The potential benefits of such a system are considerable. By reducing the difficulty and cost of long-term monitoring of wild lemur populations, the scope of such studies could be increased with more and better quality data generated in less time.</p>
<p>This would have considerable benefit for our knowledge of the evolution of this unique primate radiation, endemic to just a single island, and help us learn more about their social systems. It would also enable improved monitoring of lemur population numbers and demographic structures, helping conservationists better model extinction risk; an important consideration when many lemur species (including the red-bellied lemur) are threatened by human encroachments into their habitat. It could even help fight the illegal pet-trade in lemurs taken from the wild, by allowing law enforcement and tourists to rapidly report sightings and determine the origin of captive lemurs.</p>

<p>These methods could also be adapted to other primates or even other large mammal species with variable facial or skin patterns, such as bears, red pandas, or sloths. Already similar automated facial recognition systems have been developed for <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-5281-2013-49">chimps</a> and <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1802/20142284">guenons</a>. Such systems could even be combined with automated remote camera traps, increasingly used to monitor populations of hard-to-track wildlife.</p>
<p>While the researchers’ caution there is no “one size fits all” approach to automated animal facial recognition, it is clearly a technique that will play an ever larger part in our understanding of, and attempts to preserve, the large mammals of our world.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2017/02/16/an-introduction-to-meta-analysis/">An introduction to meta-analysis</a></h4>

<p>I just finished reading an excellent book on meta-analysis, Introduction to Meta Analysis by Borenstein et al.</p>
<div class="embed-amazon"></div>
<p>The book starts with the motivating example of streptokinase, a <em>blood clot buster.</em> Early studies showed conflicting evidence of efficacy of the drug in preventing death following a heart attack. These early studies were small, and the main outcome was often not significantly different from zero; it took very large scale studies in 1986 and 1987 to confirm the protective effect of streptokinase, which could reduce deaths by 20%.</p>
<p><span id="more-6788"></span></p>
<p>The book makes the convincing case that the protective role of streptokinase could have been confirmed <em>ten years prior</em> by aggregating the information from early studies. Early results were not truly contradictory; the studies were simply underpowered for the effect of interest – the ratio of the survival rates in the experiment and control arms. As you can see in this forest plot, the error bars in the early studies were huge, and overlapped 0, but many more studies showed a protective effect than not:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/hta101/a_images_hta101/04_image01.png" /></p>
<p>That the effect could have been uncovered earlier is obvious from the plot on the right, which shows a cumulative meta-analysis; what happens when we aggregate all the studies up to a certain study? It’s clear from this result that the evidence was already overwhelming by 1977.</p>
<p>A good meta analysis, such as this one, can:</p>
<ul>
<li>aggregate disparate information from different studies in an easily digestable from</li>
<li>get precise estimates of effect sizes, allowing decisions to be centered around whether a treatment shows a <em>clinically</em> significant effect, as opposed to a simply <em>statistically</em> significant one</li>
<li>identify points of agreement and disagreements between studies</li>
<li>identify factors that moderate effect size through subgroup analysis and meta-regression</li>
<li>guide the design of follow-up studies – for example, by identifying what is currently unclear in the extant data, or by furnishing an effect size estimate for power analysis</li>
</ul>
<h1>The mechanics of meta-analysis</h1>
<p>The goal of a meta-analysis is to estimate an aggregate effect size. Now, different studies differ in substantive details – the target population, the randomization process, the practices of the institutions that perform the study – and so one cannot simply integrate data from different studies <em>as though</em> they’re coming from the same study.</p>
<p>Instead, one assumes that the true underlying effect – on survival, blood pressure, choice probability, etc. – differs from study to study. Even if each study had an infinite number of subjects, there would still be measurable discrepancies between the measured effect sizes between studies. These differences in effect sizes would then reflect substantive differences between the studies.</p>
<p>Under this <em>random effects</em> model, bigger studies count more, but smaller studies are still informative about the range of effects that one would measure in real life. The mean effect size is just as interesting as the range of effect sizes. An heterogeneity statistic, $I^2$, can help one judge whether studies generally agree or disagree, and whether this has substantive implications.</p>
<p>To identify the source of heterogeneity, one can use subgroup analysis and meta-regression. In subgroup analysis, you slice the data along dimensions of interest, e.g. smokers vs. non-smokers, or different treatment arms. In meta-regression, you instead regress a continuous variable against the outcome.</p>
<p>These approaches can be useful in identifying future directions of research, but they must be carefully interpreted, as they are correlational; even if each study was double-blinded, subgroup analysis and meta-regression will break randomization, and should not be interpreted causally.</p>
<h1>Philosophical issues</h1>
<p>The book goes into considerable detail into the manual computation of random effects models using a spreadsheet program, but in all honesty, you’re better off skipping these chapters, going straight into R and <code>install.packages("meta")</code>. I’m using this package for an ongoing meta-analysis I’m running; <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/phaco-meta">you can take a peek at what the code looks like here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in the discussion chapters, on philosophical issues and interpretation and <em>gotchas</em> that the book really shines. One chapter I really liked is on identifying publication bias. Studies can suffer from the <em>file drawer problem</em>: studies with negative results never get published because of a lack of incentive to do so.</p>
<p>There’s some techniques that have been developed to deal with publication bias. The underlying model is that large studies get published no matter their result, because they require so much resources and collaboration and are guaranteed a publication slot.  However, smaller studies are much more prone to publication bias; who wants to publish a tiny study with negative results?</p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 522px;"><img alt="Figure 5: Funnel plot analysis[4]" class=" aligncenter" height="403" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.ijmm.org/articles/2014/32/3/images/IndianJMedMicrobiol_2014_32_3_229_136547_u6.jpg" width="522" />A funnel plot showing no sign of publication bias [<a href="http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2014;volume=32;issue=3;spage=229;epage=235;aulast=Pabalan">Source</a>]</figure>The funnel plot is a graphical tool to diagnose the presence of missing studies, which plots effect size on the x axis and study size on the y axis. Large studies are shown at the top, smaller studies at the bottom. Studies should be organized in an orderly funnel – more consistency for larger studies, and less so for the smaller studies. But if smaller studies are missing because of the file drawer problem, the funnel will be <em>asymmetric; </em>small studies with null results will be missing from the results.<p></p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 524px;"><img alt="Figure 6: Simulated funnel plot analysis indicating publication bias" class=" aligncenter" height="406" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.ijmm.org/articles/2014/32/3/images/IndianJMedMicrobiol_2014_32_3_229_136547_u7.jpg" width="524" />A funnel plot showing clear asymmetry, a potential sign of publication bias [<a href="http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2014;volume=32;issue=3;spage=229;epage=235;aulast=Pabalan">Source</a>]</figure>The authors a very nice, pragmatic method to estimate publication bias. The idea is to sort studies by descending size, and perform a cumulative meta-analysis; what happens if I analyze only the largest study? the two largest studies? the top 3? and so on. Mechanically, it’s the same analysis to the one that was applied to study when streptokinase could have been shown to be efficacious, but sorting by decreasing study size rather than date.<p></p>
<p>If the analysis suffers from publication bias, the effect size estimate should drift as one adds smaller and smaller studies to the meta-analysis. Rather than try and correct for the bias, one can simply highlight the <em>sensitivity</em> of the analysis to publication bias.</p>
<h1>Closing thoughts</h1>
<p>I highly recommend picking up this book as a first-line reference. I just wish it had a better discussion of dealing with missing data. I’m running a meta-analysis on glaucoma treatments with Dr. Masis these days and it seems like every other cell in my worksheet is <code>NA</code>. That’s unavoidable in a world where multiple researchers do independent studies without consulting each other; they’re going to measure slightly different things.</p>
<p>To deal with missing data in a principled way, we can use multiple imputation, or go full Bayesian. Each of these is its own large area of research, and I’ll follow up this post with my experiences with this.</p>

<p>Imputation of missing attribute-values is an important data pre-processing
step. Missing of the attribute values are an inevitable problem in real-world
data collection. However, most of the data processing models don’t have any
mechanism to deal with missing values. One of the solutions to this problem is
to have an imputation step added in data pre-processing. Imputation model
relays on the initial prediction of the missing values and has no mechanism to
distinguish the observed and imputed values. But, the imputed values are only
as good as the assumption used to create them. In this research, we introduce
an unsupervised cluster-dependent feature weighing imputation model. This model
uses the feature weighing factor to rescaled the data to nullify the effect of
initial prediction of the missing attribute-values.</p>

<p>When you get a great piece of news, who do you tell? Do you get on the phone to your best friend? Launch the news onto Facebook to sail the sea of Likes? Do you congratulate yourself in front of someone you know doesn’t enjoy the same fortune or ability? Or do you keep it to yourself? Let me share some good news with you: according to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/jid/37/4/250/">research</a> published recently in the <em>Journal of Individual Differences</em>, your answers to these questions may say something about you.</p>
<p><span id="more-19218"></span></p>
<p>Cara Palmer and her colleagues had 251 US undergrads take a personality questionnaire, then asked them to imagine they’d experienced a number positive events like getting a good grade or hosting a great party, and to say how likely it is that they would share this news in one of three ways.</p>
<p>One way was to tell a good friend or family member about the news, to <em>capitalise</em> on the event, squeezing the juice out of the good experience by revisiting it with an encouraging audience. The women in the sample more often than the men said that they would probably do this. The personality trait Agreeableness, and having more empathy, were also associated with capitalising on good news.</p>
<p>Another way of sharing that the researchers asked the participants about was whether they would <em>brag </em>about the event, enhancing their self-image by announcing their achievement to someone liable to be envious, like a classmate who struggled on the exam that they themselves had aced. Bragging is normally considered more prototypically masculine, but overall rates of hypothetical bragging were similar across genders.</p>
<p>However, Palmer’s team drilled into the data to find different clusters of responses, and found that only men showed a propensity to fall into a distinct “bragger” group whose other forms of hypothetical news sharing were unremarkable – 30 per cent of men fitted this description versus just five per cent of women. The women braggers, by contrast, tended to be big sharers all round, being more likely than average to say they would share their news in other ways too. Regardless of gender, braggers tended to be less agreeable and conscientious: this is consistent with the idea that to brag you have to be insensitive to the reactions of others and not careful enough to restrict your decisions to avert conflicts in the future.</p>
<p>The final type of sharing that the researchers asked about was mass-sharing of events on social media. Palmer’s team expected to find gender effects here, as women spend more time on social sites like Facebook than men, and they often cite a major reason for using such sites is to mass-share information, but in this dataset there were no gender differences. In terms of personality, the researchers found that those who said they would mass-share were more likely to score high on narcissism (conversely, those participants who said they were least likely to share in any way tended to be less narcissistic).</p>
<p>Extraversion played a small role in these findings: it was correlated with capitalising but otherwise unrelated to the sharing types or clusters. This is consistent with the familiar experience of being on the receiving end of good news stories from an extravert friend –  studies show they tend to experience more positive events to begin with.</p>
<p>Sharing is generally a good thing, especially one-to-one capitalising that allows you to reflect on and process experiences. The positive psychology movement also suggests that acknowledging and noting good experiences is, at least in moderation, beneficial for our psychological health and wellbeing. Bragging, in contrast, can generate resentment and ostracise acquaintances, and is a behaviour better discouraged. This research suggests that male braggers may stand out more obviously, whereas women may brag as part of their share-heavy style where it blends in more – but may be no less corrosive. Next time you want to share something great that’s happened to you, have a think about what you are trying to get out of this – and whether your audience really need to hear it. Don’t let your good news be another’s bad.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Exercising with the use of an interactive environment might be an interesting alternative to traditional methods of training. In this study, Barry and colleagues examined exercise using an interactive computer-generated environment (exergaming) compared with traditional gym-based exercise for postural control, flow and technology acceptance in healthy adult participants. A total of 44 participants were allocated to either the exergaming group or a traditional gym-based exercise group. The results suggested that exergaming had a bigger potential to improve postural control compared with standard exercise. Therefore exergaming might be employed as a great way of achieving rehabilitation goals and improving postural control.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="http://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-016-0095-3">The benefits of menu labeling</a></strong></h3>
<p>Is menu labeling a potential solution to the obesity epidemic? To investigate this question, Reale and Flint determined the effect of menu labeling on food choice among obese adults. They examined a sample of 61 obese adults motivated to lose weight in order to find out which menu labeling format was the most effective method of promoting healthy eating choices. The first form of menu labeling provided calorie content, the second form supplied information in grams for all seven categories (fat, saturated-fat, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, salt and fiber), and the third provided the energy expenditure. Interestingly, participants underestimated calorie content by an average of 303 kcal per meal. The study demonstrates that menu labeling had a positive impact on healthy food choices, with calorie labeling having the strongest impact of the three tested.</p>

<p>Low carbohydrate diets (LCDs) are commonly recommended approaches for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. This study by Barabas et al. investigated the knowledge of healthcare professionals about LCDs in obesity treatment in a Swedish primary healthcare setting. Although an LCD is suggested to have a positive effect in both diabetes care and weight loss, surprisingly a low number of healthcare professionals recommended an LCD for weight loss. Physicians and diabetes nurses were more eager to recommend the diet, whereas trained lifestyle counselors were the least keen. The study showed that healthcare professionals had differing attitudes towards a diet low in carbohydrates with their main concerns being a lack of scientific knowledge of the side- and long-term effects of such a diet. The authors suggest that additional education and medical training might have a positive impact on the awareness of LCDs in obesity treatment.</p>

<p>In the past three decades the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased significantly. The consumption of outside-the-home prepared meals is believed to be one of the obesity contributors. Using data from the University of Toronto Restaurant Database, this article reports the nutritional quality of kids’ meals from seven sit-down restaurants and ten fast food chains in Canada. The results indicated that kids’ meals from both types of restaurant contain high levels of sodium and saturated fat as well as being high in calories. Portions served in sit-down restaurants were bigger compared with fast-food places; however, when standardized per 100 g, sit-down restaurants served meals of a lower calorie and sodium content. These findings suggest that dealing with the poor nutritional quality of restaurant kids’ meals should be regarded as part of an obesity battle and a major public health goal.</p>

<p>People suffering from various cardiac diseases might employ pedometers to set activity goals, measure walking activity and improve their overall physiological and psychological health. In this study, Thorup and colleagues enrolled patients involved in a cardiac telerehabilitation program to investigate pedometer use and self-determined motivation for walking. A total of 11 patients, five nurses and six physiotherapists took part in the study and, thanks to the pedometer, the patients could tailor physical activity to their needs and lifestyle. Visible steps enhanced the awareness of walking activity and enabled them to set realistic goals and thus pedometers helped the patients to change their lifestyle into a healthier one, where walking activity became a daily routine.</p>

<h3><a href="https://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-016-0125-1"><strong>A crucial time in the life of students</strong></a></h3>
<p>‘Freshman 15’ refers to the phenomenon that students gain on average 15lbs (6.8kg) over their first academic year. In this study, Vadeboncoeur and colleagues evaluated weight change among first year university students. They recruited 215 students from 23 universities in England asking them to report their weight at three time points: (i) at the beginning of academic year, (ii) before Christmas, and (iii) at the end of academic year. They observed an increase in weight by 0.98 kg over the period of an academic year and, interestingly, there was no significant difference in mean weight change rate between females and males (+1.04 kg and +0.85 kg respectively). These findings suggest that the first year at university appears to be a crucial time when people tend to gain weight; therefore universities must acknowledge their role in promoting healthy behaviors among students in order to prevent the obesity epidemic.</p>

<p>Most research into the emotion of awe – a response to something vast or overwhelming – has focused on its positive upsides, classing it alongside delight or pleasure. But the University of California’s Greater Good research programme recently published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> the first <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-59114-001/">full investigation</a> of what they call “threatening awe” defined as a strong feeling of wonder and fear.</p>
<p>Amie Gordon and her team looked at times where people felt awe in response to overwhelming stimuli like huge storms or the vastness of the universe, or were exposed for the first time to accounts of historical horrors such as the Vietnam war. Skin conductance and heart rate measures showed that feeling the threatening version of awe activated the sympathetic autonomic nervous system, which is associated with negative emotional states. The data also suggested that feeling threatening awe rather than the positive kind may be influenced by thoughts which make us actively feel powerless – the prospect of being trapped on the pitiless ocean – rather than simply small, such as reflecting on the vastness of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Whereas previous work has shown awe to be associated with wellbeing and life satisfaction, one of the new experiments involving 603 participants found that an ominous video with swirling tornadoes, associated with threat-based awe, produced lower wellbeing compared to a positive awe-filled video and even a neutral one. Gordon’s team pointed out that the word awe produces two offspring with very different connotations: awesome and awful. Gazing into the face of God, or the vastness of the cosmos, isn’t a sunshine and kittens experience: awe exists in the “upper reaches of pleasure and on the boundary of fear”.</p>

<img alt="Montecincla fairbanki" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Montecincla-fairbanki-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>India is a biogeographic crossroads — a meeting place of different regions with distinct types of species. Although India is biodiverse, the high species richness of the subcontinent is often attributed to the fact that groups from the surrounding regions have been able to colonize and occupy various ecosystems. Furthermore, the conventional wisdom held that most animals in the Indian subcontinent were representatives of groups that were more diverse in other regions and that there were few, if any, distinctly Indian groups — ones that originated and speciated within the landmass.</p>
<p>Recent studies are beginning to challenge these ideas, particularly in some groups of amphibians and reptiles. In our recent study, we now show that there are in fact two groups of birds, <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em>, that have also diversified within India. This is surprising because birds are thought to be really well-studied and these species have been know to science for a long time. Nevertheless, scientists had underestimated the true diversity of these groups and therefore the uniqueness of the avifauna of this region.</p>
<blockquote><p>conventional wisdom held…there were few, if any, distinctly Indian groups</p></blockquote>
<p>To address the history of taxonomic confusion surrounding these birds, we devised a strategy to examine their evolutionary relationships. Using a combination of modern analyses and gathering a suite of data – genetic, morphometric, song, and plumage – we examined the distinct differences between populations across their range and determined their phylogenetic position to decipher their closest relatives.</p>
<p>Our results conclusively showed that these two groups were older and more distinct than previously thought and had diversified into multiple species. These two groups of birds, now referred to as <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em>, represent the first known examples of birds that have speciated within the Indian subcontinent as endemic radiations.</p>
<p>Our results have substantial implications for our knowledge of biodiversity and biogeography. First, it indicates that there is still much to be discovered about birds, even in well-inhabited regions. Second, the divergence patterns of these birds reveal the history of the Indian landscape and the role of climatic events in driving diversification. Finally, the dramatic increase in unique species with narrower ranges pushes the urgency of conservation in this vulnerable ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity hiding in plain sight</strong></p>
<p>Both <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em> are endemic to the Western Ghats, a coastal mountainous region in southwestern India. Their specific habitat is restricted to the highest elevation zone in what is called Shola forest — a unique form of evergreen forest interspersed with natural grassland that is found only on this mountain range. Species like <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em>, which are restricted to these high montane areas, have patchy distributions within and across these ‘sky islands’ where montane habitat is similar to oceanic islands separated by deep valleys of unsuitable areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>…there are still many mysteries to be uncovered in birds.</p></blockquote>
<p>We conducted detailed field surveys across all the sky islands over a period of eight years and examined an unprecedented number (800) of individual birds for this project. Over this period, we measured body features, recorded song, noted plumage variation, and collected blood for genetic analysis.</p>
<p>Whereas previously each group was thought to be one or two species (taxonomists disagreed), we show with ample evidence each group had diversified across the mountain range and had more species than currently recognized. This meant we had to revise and describe new species – an exciting yet daunting challenge given the debate amongst ornithologists on how to recognize distinct species (species concepts). There were multiple opinions, even amongst our co-authors, but we ultimately converged on an approach to delimit species that fulfilled the requirements of multiple species concepts.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8572" style="width: 1610px;"><img alt="Sholicola ashambuensis" class="size-full wp-image-8572" height="1143" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Sholicola-ashambuensis.jpg" width="1600" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>Sholicola ashambuensis</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source">Shashank Dalvi.</div></figure>
<p>To complicate matters further, our phylogenetic analyses showed that neither of the two groups we studied belonged with the genera in which they were traditionally placed. Although they were originally thought to be shortwings and laughingthrushes respectively, <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em> do not belong with these groups. Their new positions in the bird tree of life, as distinct lineages and highly divergent from their closest relatives (and not near the genera they were previously classified in), make it imperative to place them into new genera.</p>
<p>Why so much excitement about new genera and species of birds? Some of this is due to expectation. For some other groups, like beetles, the rate of new species discovery is still steep and therefore adding new species to the list is fairly commonplace. For birds, on the other hand, many believe we have already discovered 99% of all the living species. New studies like this one highlight that there are still many mysteries to be uncovered in birds. This study also shows the value of phylogenetics and systematic analyses. We may have described the vast majority of species, but the taxonomy of birds is far from being clear, and this can mislead subsequent studies.</p>
<p><strong>Past connections and current isolation</strong></p>
<p>One of the big mysteries of Indian biogeography is how organisms got to the Western Ghats. The closest mountain range, the Himalayas, is several hundred miles to the north and intervening is a large expanse of dry, seasonal, lowland habitat. One theory, known as the Satpura Hypothesis, proposes that montane groups were able to migrate from the Himalayas using the hill ranges in central India as a corridor. Although wetter than other parts of peninsular India, the Satpura hills are much lower and many high elevation species do not currently occur on them. However, we know that suitable habitat for these species might have existed in the past when global temperatures were cooler and India was covered in moist forest. One way to test the Satpura Hypothesis was to examine the origin of the Western Ghats birds.</p>
<p>Remarkably, our analyses showed that the pattern and timing of divergence in these two groups of birds were nearly identical and occurred at similar times. This lends support to the idea that landscape level changes, as implied by the Satpura Hypothesis, led to the isolation of these populations on their respective sky islands. Both <em>Sholicola</em> and <em>Montecincla</em> diverged from their closest relatives in the Himalayas and Southeast Asia around 11 million years ago. This coincides with a period of heightened tectonic activity in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau that led to the aridification of the Indian subcontinent, thereby shifting from moist to dry forest. We hypothesize that due to this drying, these cool-adapted birds were isolated in the Western Ghats, the only suitable habitat at the time. Subsequent climate shifts, which limited dispersal across the sky islands, lead to further isolation events across the deep valleys of this mountain range.</p>

<p><strong>A biodiversity hotspot becomes hotter</strong></p>
<p>India, being a developing nation with over a billion people, has to reconcile tremendous pressures on natural ecosystems and its extraordinary biodiversity. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Western Ghats where the interests of people, agriculture, and wildlife collide. This biodiversity hotspot is home not just to unique species but also a diversity of cultures, all of which are threatened by anthropogenic impacts such as economic development and climate change.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were the first research team in decades to obtain permissions to handle birds across this landscape</p></blockquote>
<p>The crucial need for additional scientific studies to study this distinct region is becoming increasing apparent as modern studies like ours uncover dramatically more biodiversity. The type of study we conducted is rare in India and was only possible with persistence and some luck in acquiring the necessary permissions to handle birds, which is challenging in a country that is apprehensive about interference with wildlife. Nevertheless, the field crew, led by Robin and Vishnudas, were supported by a long-term research permit specifically from the Forest Department in the state of Kerala that was able to grasp the importance of this work. We were thus the first research team in decades to obtain permissions to handle birds across this landscape. We hope the results of our study makes the need to facilitate scientific studies an important and urgent venture across all states in the face of increasing threats.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope our study will help to highlight this exceptional and diverse region in terms of the need for more conservation efforts. In additional to their scientific value, birds can generate enormous interest in non-scientists from avid bird-watchers to casual nature observers. We gave our new taxa names inspired by local words for these birds and their habitat. This has already aroused national pride –our publication was released on Republic Day and enthusiastically picked up by supporters and newspapers with the hashtag #MadeInIndia! We hope these new discoveries will not only elevate the protective status of these birds and their shrinking habitat but also encourage interest in studying and preserving the long-term survival of other Western Ghats fauna and flora.</p>

<p>
 The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is composed of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. In mice that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Notably, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/jhEBnWDO8tw/nature21407">Mechanical stretch triggers rapid epithelial cell division through Piezo1</a></h4>

<p>
 Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that later die. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions and cell division in sparse regions.

<p>
 Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B-cell-specific enzyme that targets immunoglobulin genes to initiate class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. In addition, through off-target activity, AID has a much broader effect on genomic instability by initiating oncogenic chromosomal translocations and mutations involved in the development and progression of lymphoma. AID expression is tightly regulated in B cells and its overexpression leads to enhanced genomic instability and lymphoma formation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) pathway regulates AID by suppressing its expression in B cells. Drugs for leukaemia or lymphoma therapy such as idelalisib, duvelisib and ibrutinib block PI3Kδ activity directly or indirectly, potentially affecting AID expression and, consequently, genomic stability in B cells. Here we show that treatment of primary mouse B cells with idelalisib or duvelisib, and to a lesser extent ibrutinib, enhanced the expression of AID and increased somatic hypermutation and chromosomal translocation frequency to the Igh locus and to several AID off-target sites. Both of these effects were completely abrogated in AID-deficient B cells. PI3Kδ inhibitors or ibrutinib increased the formation of AID-dependent tumours in pristane-treated mice. Consistently, PI3Kδ inhibitors enhanced AID expression and translocation frequency to IGH and AID off-target sites in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, and patients treated with idelalisib, but not ibrutinib, showed increased somatic hypermutation in AID off-targets. In summary, we show that PI3Kδ or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors increase genomic instability in normal and neoplastic B cells by an AID-dependent mechanism. This effect should be carefully considered, as such inhibitors can be administered to patients for years.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/rayeaT1DL8k/nature21378">SZT2 dictates GATOR control of mTORC1 signalling</a></h4>

<p>
 Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) integrates nutrient signals to control cell growth and organismal homeostasis across eukaryotes. The evolutionarily conserved GATOR complex regulates mTORC1 signalling through Rag GTPases, and GATOR1 displays GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity for RAGA and RAGB (RAGA/B) and GATOR2 has been proposed to be an inhibitor of GATOR1. Furthermore, the metazoan-specific SESN proteins function as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for RAGA/B, and interact with GATOR2 with unknown effects. Here we show that SZT2 (seizure threshold 2), a metazoan-specific protein mutated in epilepsy, recruits a fraction of mammalian GATOR1 and GATOR2 to form a SZT2-orchestrated GATOR (SOG) complex with an essential role in GATOR- and SESN-dependent nutrient sensing and mTORC1 regulation. The interaction of SZT2 with GATOR1 and GATOR2 was synergistic, and an intact SOG complex was required for its localization at the lysosome. SZT2 deficiency resulted in constitutive mTORC1 signalling in cells under nutrient-deprived conditions and neonatal lethality in mice, which was associated with failure to inactivate mTORC1 during fasting. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 in SZT2-deficient cells could be partially corrected by overexpression of the GATOR1 component DEPDC5, and by the lysosome-targeted GATOR2 component WDR59 or lysosome-targeted SESN2. These findings demonstrate that SZT2 has a central role in dictating GATOR-dependent nutrient sensing by promoting lysosomal localization of SOG, and reveal an unexpected function of lysosome-located GATOR2 in suppressing mTORC1 signalling through SESN recruitment.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/GGKY-mCGCkg/nature21372">Untimely expression of gametogenic genes in vegetative cells causes uniparental disomy</a></h4>

<p>
 Uniparental disomy (UPD), in which an individual contains a pair of homologous chromosomes originating from only one parent, is a frequent phenomenon that is linked to congenital disorders and various cancers. UPD is thought to result mostly from pre- or post-zygotic chromosome missegregation. However, the factors that drive UPD remain unknown. Here we use the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model to investigate UPD, and show that defects in the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery or in the YTH domain-containing RNA elimination factor Mmi1 cause high levels of UPD in vegetative diploid cells. This phenomenon is not due to defects in heterochromatin assembly at centromeres. Notably, in cells lacking RNAi components or Mmi1, UPD is associated with the untimely expression of gametogenic genes. Deletion of the upregulated gene encoding the meiotic cohesin Rec8 or the cyclin Crs1 suppresses UPD in both RNAi and mmi1 mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Rec8 is sufficient to trigger UPD in wild-type cells. Rec8 expressed in vegetative cells localizes to chromosomal arms and to the centromere core, where it is required for localization of the cohesin subunit Psc3. The centromeric localization of Rec8 and Psc3 promotes UPD by uniquely affecting chromosome segregation, causing a reductional segregation of one homologue. Together, these findings establish the untimely vegetative expression of gametogenic genes as a causative factor of UPD, and provide a solid foundation for understanding this phenomenon, which is linked to diverse human diseases.

<p>
 Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and has a role in the regulation of metabolism through the release of adipokines. Here we show that mice with an adipose-tissue-specific knockout of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer (ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, exhibit a substantial decrease in levels of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of both white and brown adipose tissue—brown especially—into ADicerKO mice restores the level of numerous circulating miRNAs that are associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance and a reduction in hepatic Fgf21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene regulation can be mimicked by the administration of normal, but not ADicerKO, serum exosomes. Expression of a human-specific miRNA in the brown adipose tissue of one mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3′ UTR reporter in the liver of another mouse through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue constitutes an important source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which can regulate gene expression in distant tissues and thereby serve as a previously undescribed form of adipokine.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/W05Yh9sx76A/nature21063">Whole-genome landscape of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours</a></h4>

<p>
 The diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) is increasing owing to more sensitive detection methods, and this increase is creating challenges for clinical management. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 102 primary PanNETs and defined the genomic events that characterize their pathogenesis. Here we describe the mutational signatures they harbour, including a deficiency in G:C &gt; T:A base excision repair due to inactivation of MUTYH, which encodes a DNA glycosylase. Clinically sporadic PanNETs contain a larger-than-expected proportion of germline mutations, including previously unreported mutations in the DNA repair genes MUTYH, CHEK2 and BRCA2. Together with mutations in MEN1 and VHL, these mutations occur in 17% of patients. Somatic mutations, including point mutations and gene fusions, were commonly found in genes involved in four main pathways: chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair, activation of mTOR signalling (including previously undescribed EWSR1 gene fusions), and telomere maintenance. In addition, our gene expression analyses identified a subgroup of tumours associated with hypoxia and HIF signalling.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/keU46FiwJm4/nature21060">Sterile protection against human malaria by chemoattenuated PfSPZ vaccine</a></h4>

<p>
 A highly protective malaria vaccine would greatly facilitate the prevention and elimination of malaria and containment of drug-resistant parasites. A high level (more than 90%) of protection against malaria in humans has previously been achieved only by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) inoculated by mosquitoes; by intravenous injection of aseptic, purified, radiation-attenuated, cryopreserved PfSPZ (‘PfSPZ Vaccine’); or by infectious PfSPZ inoculated by mosquitoes to volunteers taking chloroquine or mefloquine (chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites). We assessed immunization by direct venous inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, non-irradiated PfSPZ (‘PfSPZ Challenge’) to malaria-naive, healthy adult volunteers taking chloroquine for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (vaccine approach denoted as PfSPZ-CVac). Three doses of 5.12 × 104 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge at 28-day intervals were well tolerated and safe, and prevented infection in 9 out of 9 (100%) volunteers who underwent controlled human malaria infection ten weeks after the last dose (group III). Protective efficacy was dependent on dose and regimen. Immunization with 3.2 × 103 (group I) or 1.28 × 104 (group II) PfSPZ protected 3 out of 9 (33%) or 6 out of 9 (67%) volunteers, respectively. Three doses of 5.12 × 104 PfSPZ at five-day intervals protected 5 out of 8 (63%) volunteers. The frequency of Pf-specific polyfunctional CD4 memory T cells was associated with protection. On a 7,455 peptide Pf proteome array, immune sera from at least 5 out of 9 group III vaccinees recognized each of 22 proteins. PfSPZ-CVac is a highly efficacious vaccine candidate; when we are able to optimize the immunization regimen (dose, interval between doses, and drug partner), this vaccine could be used for combination mass drug administration and a mass vaccination program approach to eliminate malaria from geographically defined areas.

<img alt="Coffee break, pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Coffee-break-pixabay-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Greetings from <em>BMC Proceedings</em>.</p>
<p>Before we talk about anything else, an introduction is probably in order. My name’s Tom Rowles and, as of October 2016, I’m the Editor of <em>BMC Proceedings</em>. I’ve spent the last few months getting to know the journal and coming up with plans for the future, and I’d like to use this post to update you on some exciting changes which are currently happening.</p>
<p><strong>What is <em>BMC Proceedings?</em></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, <em>BMC Proceedings</em> is an academic journal whose sole purpose is to publish conference proceedings, including full-length articles, abstracts and meeting reports. Our aim is to widely disseminate the valuable material that is collected and presented at academic meetings, as well as to try and capture and distil the essence of the conference, and to provide exposure to the valuable meetings and conversations that take place during the conference, though meeting reports.</p>
<p>Conferences are where research and medical communities come together, and we want to serve those communities by offering a service whereby conferences can extend their reach beyond the few days upon which the meeting takes place. Proceedings can do this, indefinitely extending the life of a conference, and providing a resource both for attendees, and those unable to make it.</p>
<p>We also feel that, for all of their worth, conferences tend to operate as a closed system. All of the valuable information that is presented at a meeting, however useful and relevant to your own research, is for naught if you are unable to attend. We therefore see our role as making conferences open-access, in the same manner that BioMed Central has done for full research publications, and ensuring that cutting-edge scientific research and debate, as well as the guidelines and consensus reports that are often debated at international meetings, reach the researchers and practitioners that need it, wherever they might be in the world.</p>
<p><strong>New scope</strong></p>
<p>Up until this point, <em>BMC Proceedings</em> has, similarly to all other journals in the BMC series, published only articles and proceedings dealing with either the biological or medical sciences. However, from February 14<sup>th</sup> 2017, both<em> BMC Proceedings </em>and <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Research Notes</em></a> will be considering submissions from all scientific and clinical disciplines. You can find out more about the change of scope in <em>BMC Research Notes</em>, as well as other exciting ongoing developments in that journal <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/02/14/bmc-research-notes-goes-back-roots/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What will this mean in practice? Well, from now on <em>BMC Proceedings </em>will consider publishing articles, abstracts and reports from meetings in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology and life sciences</li>
<li>Clinical and medical</li>
<li>Medical and scientific education</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Bioethics and international health &amp; human rights</li>
<li>Research methodology</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
<li>Geo-sciences and environmental/earth sciences</li>
<li>Marine biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Materials sciences</li>
<li>Psychology</li>
<li>Paleontology</li>
</ul>
<p>With such an extensive list of subject areas now suitable for consideration, is there anything that we won’t be considering? Well yes; we will still be unable to consider meetings on law (except for when they are directly related to international health &amp; human rights), humanities and arts. However, if you are unsure as to whether your conference would be suitable for consideration as a proceeding then I would encourage you to <a href="mailto:supplements@biomedcentral.com">contact us</a>, and either myself or one of our supplements team will be able to advise you further.</p>
<p>Over the coming months and years we hope that <em>BMC Proceedings </em>can become a hub for research communities to present and share their conferences. We therefore hope that you can join us and, if you are organising a conference and looking for a means to broaden its impact, then please do get in touch at <a href="mailto:supplements@biomedcentral.com">supplements@biomedcentral.com</a>.</p>

<img alt="Featured image" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Featured-image-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Within scholarly publishing, the phrase dark data has been used to describe research outputs that are not usually considered in traditional research journals such as single observations. As a result, these research outputs often never see the light of day and remain hidden in researchers’ notebooks or buried as some extra data to be considered further one day in the future. However, there are many advantages in helping researchers to publish their dark data such as the reduction in duplicating research and the dissemination of fragmented findings or null results potentially useful to the research community.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our vision for <em>BMC Research Notes</em> is to build a unique, high profile journal focusing on short research notes</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Research Notes</em></a> was launched in 2008 as part of the <em>BMC</em> series with the aim to help free up dark data and provide a home for material that lacked a suitable publication outlet. In 2011, as the journal had begun to receive full-length research articles, both as direct submissions and transfers from other journals, we broadened its remit to include such articles. Whilst there has clearly been a need for <em>BMC Research Notes</em> to consider full-length research articles, doing so has masked the original vision of the journal as something different; a place where short observations, which might otherwise be unknown, can be made available to the global research community.</p>
<p>We are still committed to providing a home for all scientifically valid research outputs across the <em>BMC</em> series. Full-length research articles which would previously have been considered by <em>BMC Research Notes</em> can find a home in the relevant <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/">subject specific journals</a> in the <em>BMC</em> series as outlined in a <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/12/05/vital-importance-inclusive/">recent blog</a> discussing the editorial threshold for these journals.</p>
<p><strong>The “new” <em>BMC Research Notes</em></strong></p>
<p>We are bringing the journal back to its roots with a focus on shorter research notes that aim to bring dark data out of the shadows. The journal will once again focus on less conventional research outputs such as updates to previous work, additions to established methods, single observations and null results that are often overlooked. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> will publish articles without bias and will take the focus away from story-telling to making all valid research outputs freely and openly accessible.<img alt="subjects" class="wp-image-8566 aligncenter" height="375" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/subjects.jpg" width="584" /></p>
<p>To increase clarity and simplicity, we have reduced the number of article types and created <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-note">‘Research note’</a>, the journals’ main article format. ‘Research note’ has a word limit making it a true note article, structured in introduction, main text and limitations. We believe our new article type will ensure research is easy to digest for readers while being of maximum benefit by clearly stating the objective of the work presented as well as its limitations.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>BMC Research Notes</em> will publish articles without bias and will take the focus away from story-telling</p></blockquote>
<p>Dark data is being generated by researchers of all disciplines across the world. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> aspires to serve a broad and global research community. As a result, the journal will expand its scope to include all scientific and clinical disciplines, i.e. health sciences and medicine, life sciences, physical sciences including all engineering disciplines, computer science and mathematics as well as related disciplines such as science education, bioethics and research methodology.</p>
<p>Our vision for <em>BMC Research Notes</em> is to build a unique, high profile journal focusing on short research notes that will serve as a dedicated open access forum for research outputs which would otherwise remain unknown. As part of the established <em>BMC</em> series, the journal’s primary goal is to serve the global scientific and clinical research communities.</p>

<p>Studies show that when heterosexual women look at other women’s bodies, they, just like men, tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time looking at their waists, hips and breasts, as if estimating how much they will appeal to men. This is consistent with “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/11/03/david-buss-derogation-of-competitors/">mate selection theory</a>” which argues, among other things, that women have evolved strategies to monitor potential love rivals. However, psychologists are interested in this topic, not only from an evolutionary perspective, but also because women who feel dissatisfied with their bodies, and who are vulnerable to developing eating disorders, may be especially pre-occupied with comparing their body against others, potentially exacerbating their anxieties.</p>
<p>Past research is mixed: some studies suggest women with body dissatisfaction and/or eating disorders pay disproportionate attention to the bodies of thin women, other studies suggest the opposite. A new <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-015-0726-1?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">exploratory paper</a> in <em>Psychological Research</em> says hang on a minute, we don’t actually know much about how healthy, confident women behave when they look at other women, nor whether their attention is influenced by their feelings about their own bodies.</p>
<p><span id="more-19105"></span></p>
<p>Amelia Cundall and Kun Guo at the University of Lincoln asked 33 female heterosexual psychology undergrads to don eye-tracking equipment while they looked at several realistic female computer avatars of different body shapes (from size 6 to size 18 based on UK high-street dress sizes), wearing either tight-fitting or loose clothing, and while they rated each one in terms of attractiveness and estimated dress size. The participants also rated their satisfaction with their own bodies (separately for face, breast, waist, hips, arms and legs); answered questions about how much they tend to compare their physical appearance to others; and the researchers also recorded their body-mass index (BMI), dress and cup size.</p>
<p>Somewhat consistent with past research, overall the participants spent more time looking at the waist and hip region of the models’ bodies. After that, they spent an equal amount of time looking at their head, upper-body and legs, and the least amount of time looking at their arms. “As women tend to deposit a larger amount of fat onto the lower body parts … these regions may contain more diagnostic cures for body attractiveness and body size assessment than other body regions such as the arms,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of attractiveness ratings, the participants rated the slimmer models as more attractive and the size 18 women as least attractive. But “thinner is not necessarily more attractive”, the researchers pointed out, because size 6 was rated as less attractive than 8, 10, and 12, and seen on a par with size 14. The participants gave slimmer women the same attractiveness ratings regardless of whether they wore tight-fitting or loose clothing, but they rated women of size 12 and up as being more attractive, and estimated them as having a smaller dress size, when they wore loose clothes.</p>
<p>Contrary to past findings, there was no link between participants’ own body satisfaction or their body size and the relative amounts of time they spent looking at the on-screen models that they considered more or less attractive, indicating a lack of either a harmful or self-protective bias, respectively. This may be because the participants were all generally confident in their own bodies and they had healthy below-average BMIs whereas past research that’s revealed these kind of viewing biases has studied women with body satisfaction concerns and eating disorders.</p>
<p>However, the participants in the current research who reported lower overall satisfaction with their own bodies did tend to say that they were more inclined to compare themselves against others. And in terms of where they looked when looking at the women on-screen, the more satisfied the participants were with a particular body area of their own, the less they tended to look at that area on the models. “Self-satisfaction with a body region means the need for comparing that region is reduced and thus gaze is allocated at the neighbouring body areas that are also informative for body attractiveness and size assessment,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Irrespective of their body satisfaction ratings, the researchers also found a general pattern for participants’ with smaller chests to spend less time looking at the chest area of the models. “It seems having a smaller chest size may result in an unconscious avoidance of viewing other women’s chest area, possibly to preserve self esteem,” the researchers said. Meanwhile, there was also a tendency for the participants with a higher BMI to spend more time looking at the legs of the slim on-screen models, the opposite of a protective habit. “BMI … is a more changeable construct [than chest size]” the researchers said, “and therefore [one explanation is that] upward comparisons occur in an attempt for healthy self-improvement.”</p>
<p>This is a small, exploratory study with young students which obviously limits the broader conclusions that can be drawn. Some readers may also feel that research of this kind risks feeding the tendency for our culture to objectify women’s bodies. In its defence, the study has highlighted several interesting patterns in how women view and appraise other women’s bodies, each of which could be followed up by future research to potentially further our understanding of how and why, for some people, body dissatisfaction can develop into a more serious psychological problem.</p>

<img alt="1459055735_8121219fb4_o" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/02/1459055735_8121219fb4_o-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Imagine an existence without the ability to communicate. You cannot speak, gesture or even blink an eye. All means to share your thoughts, emotions and basic needs are entirely lost. For those in the advanced stages of <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Fact-Sheet" target="_blank">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS), a debilitating and eventually fatal degenerative motor neuron disease, this nightmare can become reality. At the most severe disease stages when all motor control is lost, the individual enters a completely locked-in state (CLIS), in which they retain full consciousness and cognitive function but are unable to communicate with the outside world. Prior attempts to develop tools to enable communication in those suffering from CLIS have failed, but a new study published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a> used a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows, for the first time, accurate communication in CLIS patients.</p>
<p><strong>Probing communication with a <em>f</em>NIRS BCI</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824406" target="_blank">Past efforts</a> to communicate with CLIS patients employed BCIs using electrical brain signal from EEG or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography" target="_blank">electrocorticography</a> that depended upon voluntary control by patients over their neural responses. The authors of the new <em>PLOS Biology</em> study speculate that this requirement of at least partially intact somato-motor function for attention and learning may explain the failure of these BCIs in CLIS. They therefore tested whether a BCI based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_near-infrared_spectroscopy" target="_blank">functional near-infrared spectroscopy</a> (<em>f</em>NIRS), which measures brain oxygenation levels and does not involve voluntary modulation of neuroelectric responses during BCI training, may avoid these pitfalls and be a more effective communication tool.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, the team enrolled four advanced-stage ALS patients aged 24-76 who had entered a CLIS (or nearly-CLIS) 3-4 years after diagnosis. The patients had lost all ability to communicate and all motor function including eye movement, and were supported by ventilation and tube feeding. With the exception of one patient whose unique condition (a rare genetic mutation causing 1-2% of ALS cases) prevented her from completing training, all other participants performed a series of 46-60 sessions. During BCI training, patients were asked questions with known answers (i.e., <em>Paris is the capital of France</em>) and were prompted to mentally respond “yes” or “no.” A classifier was trained to recognize <em>f</em>NIRS brain signals associated with responses to positive versus negative questions. Training was followed by feedback sessions, in which patients responded to personal questions (i.e., <em>You were born in Berlin</em>) and were given feedback as to whether the BCI interpreted their response as “yes” or “no.” Finally, open sessions asked questions probing the patient’s quality of life (i.e., <em>You have back pain</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Breaking communication barriers</strong></p>
<p>The change in oxygenation during the response periods significantly differed between positive and negative questions. For comparison, neither the EEG signal nor eye movements reliably distinguished “yes” and “no” conditions, confirming that <em>f</em>NIRS was able to detect brain representations of the patients’ answers not measurable through neuroelectric or motor signals. Accuracy of the <em>f</em>NIRS classifier exceeded chance over 70% of the time, and was significantly more accurate than either the EEG or eye movement classifiers. Furthermore, BCI-determined answers between semantically paired questions were concordant for 67% or more of cases, highlighting consistency of the classifier. Why a change in brain oxygenation better informs about cognitive state than an electrical brain response isn’t entirely clear. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169323" target="_blank">study in animals</a> by the research team showed that increased oxygenation is associated with multiunit neural activity, suggesting that oxygenation measurable with <em>f</em>NIRS may reflect increased neural activation or coherence.</p>

(From Chaudhary et al., 2017)</figure>
<p>The <em>f</em>NIRS classifier was impressively accurate at decoding the patients’ responses, but what might explain its failure at some questions? Looking to the EEG for further insight, the researchers noted differences in middle frequency (theta/alpha) oscillations between the question and response periods, confirming that the patients are in distinct brain states when listening to and answering questions. Critically, theta power–a rhythm that increases during states of low arousal–was reduced when BCI classification of the patients’ responses was successful. This suggests that when low frequency activity dominates, the brain response is more obscure due to the patient’s low vigilance, and the BCI therefore fails to decode the patient’s answer. To ensure more accurate readings, an <em>f</em>NIRS classifier could theoretically be paired with EEG to identify when a patient is sufficiently alert to communicate.</p>
<p><strong>A bright future for the CLIS</strong></p>
<p>Before an <em>f</em>NIRS-based BCI will become commonplace for enabling communication in CLIS patients, there are important practical considerations. An <em>f</em>NIRS-EEG system would be financially costly and would require either extensive training of caretakers or the presence of a trained technician. Study coauthor Niels Birbaumer admits that the BCI may be prohibitively costly, but they recently fought and won for insurance coverage in Germany. He says that although “we have to make it more simple to avoid need of a technician,” with assistance from first author Ujwal Chaudhary, “one husband of a patient is using it already.” Furthermore, the cost/benefit ratio depends on how accurately the BCI can read the mental state of the CLIS individual. Birbaumer shares that they are refining their BCI to decode more complex brain signals, and explains that “EEG and invasive recordings have to be exploited in the future. EEG and <em>f</em>NIRS will be compared and if useful combined, we hope that other laboratories will join in.”</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles to implementing <em>f</em>NIRS for everyday use in non-communicative individuals, these successful case studies offer hope not only for restoring communication in advanced ALS, but also for understanding the cognitive and emotional states of those bound by a CLIS. Although the authors warn that they must “remain cautious about our judgments to open questions’ answers, particularly if it comes to quality of life,” the patients responded overwhelming positively to such questions. Birbaumer is optimistic about the potential of their findings to improve quality of life:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We hope that the attitude of patients, doctors and families may change and that more patients will decide for life when breathing becomes difficult and invasive ventilation necessary.”</p></blockquote>
