Using S2O, a publisher offers a journal’s current subscribers continued access. If all current subscribers participate in the S2O offer (simply by not opting out) the publisher opens the content covered by that year’s subscription. If participation is not sufficient – for example, if some subscribers delay renewing in the expectation that they can gain access without participating – then that year’s content remains gated.”</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The web site adds, “</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The offer is repeated every year, with the opening of each year’s content contingent on sufficient participation.

A senior figure at one OA-pioneering research funding agency told me that he regarded writing review articles to be an out-of-hours activity that did not qualify for APC support.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The lack of recognition of reviews was understandable given the relatively small numbers published each year, but it was also frustrating because I felt that, from a practical point of view, reviews should be among the top priorities for open access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"></span></p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><i><b><span style="color: #660000;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 16px;">“</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Usage increased in that one year by a factor of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">4, and these were readers, not bots</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 16px;">”</span></span></b></i></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Our big break came with the 2017 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant that you mentioned.

We assessed how far through articles users were scrolling and there was no difference between the open journal and our most similar paywalled journals; if bots had had an impact, the scroll patterns would have been different.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">To help develop a business model we hired </span><a href="https://sparcopen.org/people/raym-crow/?msclkid=3f0c968bcc5211ec82e6c15867ab1b92"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Raym Crow</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> as a consultant at the suggestion of </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamran-naim-phd-20605012/?msclkid=568583e3cc5211ec953df16aea075b41&amp;originalSubdomain=ch"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Kamran Naim</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, my co-grantee and then Annual Reviews’ Director of Partnerships and Initiatives. Raym had a track record in collective funding logic, and in the very first meeting with him I realized that he was laying out a practical approach that we could try. That was in June 2017.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It took time to generate a proposal that seemed robust enough to take to our Board, Editorial Committees, select customers (and our staff!) but for the 2020 sales cycle (i.e., by mid-2019), we were ready for an S2O pilot project.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In addition to the </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Annual Review of Public Health</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> (which had remained freely accessible in the meantime), a mix of established and newer titles in the physical, biomedical, biological and social sciences were selected.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We discussed the project openly, outlined our thinking in </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1262"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Learned Publishing</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> and opted not to copyright the Subscribe to Open name in the hope that others pursuing similar programs would also use it.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Subscription levels were maintained for the five S2O journals in 2020 and this, combined with usage that ranged between double and quadruple that seen when the journals were paywalled, encouraged us to expand the pilot program to eight journals for 2021 and 2022.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">To date, we have results from offering 15 volumes of Annual Reviews journals under S2O, and all have been successful (five in 2020, eight in 2021, and both of the 2023 volumes published so far; the remaining six are on track).</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It’s promising but it isn’t a full proof-of-concept because most of our customers take multi-journal packages, and it would not have been in their financial interests to exclude the S2O titles.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Nonetheless, I believe that now is the right time to offer the entire Annual Reviews portfolio under S2O. This is partly because of an action taken in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In March 2020, we temporarily removed the paywall on all 51 journals to ensure that subscribers would have seamless access, and usage increased by a minimum of three-fold and a maximum (for the </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Annual Review of Virology</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">) of more than 20-fold. That experience generated urgency to move forward.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Whether all 51 titles are published OA in 2023 is, of course, in the hands of the customers.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-buzz-sounds-mimick-wasps-bees-owls">These bats buzz like wasps and bees. The sound may deter hungry owls</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some bats buzz like wasps and bees when grasped, and the sound seems to deter predatory owls.</p>



<p>The findings reveal what may be the first known case <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00486-9?utm_source=EA">of a mammal mimicking an insect</a>, researchers report May 9 in <em>Current Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 1998 to 2001, animal ecologist Danilo Russo was conducting field studies on greater mouse-eared bats (<em>Myotis myotis</em>) in Italy, which involved capturing the live animals in mist nets. When he and his colleagues removed the bats, they made a buzzing noise in the scientists’ hands that was reminiscent of wasps or bees.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“When you hear them, that’s what comes to your mind immediately,” says Russo, of the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, Russo and his team decided to test the idea that the uncanny buzzing wasn’t mere coincidence, but instead a type of defense mechanism called Batesian mimicry. Batesian mimics are themselves harmless, but have a resemblance — visually, acoustically or chemically — to a different species that is distasteful or dangerous. When wary predators can’t distinguish harmless mimics from the noxious originals that the predators typically avoid, the mimics are protected.</p>



<p>The researchers caught more of the bats, recording their buzzing cries as they were being handled. The team also recorded the buzzing sounds of four stinging insect species (two wasps and two bees) commonly found in European forests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Russo and his team compared the audio profiles of the insect and bat buzzing in the laboratory, the researchers found that their analyses could distinguish between the two sound sources most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But audience matters. Tawny owls (<em>Strix aluco</em>) and barn owls (<em>Tyto alba</em>) commonly hunt bats, so Russo’s team wondered if the birds could be the target for the buzzing performance. When the researchers limited their sound analysis to just the frequencies that an owl hears, the buzzes became much harder to tell apart — particularly for comparisons involving the buzzing of European hornets (<em>Vespa crabro</em>).</p>

<p>The team then played recordings of bat and insect buzzes — and bat social calls — to eight birds from each owl species in captivity at a wildlife rehabilitation center. The owls reacted to the insect and bat buzzing the same way — by moving away from the speaker. In contrast, they approached the speaker when it played the social calls, potentially associating them with prey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Birds tend to avoid stinging insects, Russo says. “When nest boxes or tree cavities are colonized by hornets, birds do not even attempt to explore them, not to mention nest there.” Russo and his team think that this negative association may be evoked in nature if an owl grasps a bat and receives an indignant buzz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This scenario may be the first known example of Batesian mimicry — acoustic or otherwise — where a mammal copies an insect, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, most examples of Batesian mimicry involve visual signals, so finding potential acoustic mimicry is exciting, says David Pfennig, an evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfennig, who was not involved with the research, points to a few examples of acoustic mimicry, such as burrowing owls <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1986.tb00605.x">imitating a rattlesnake rattle</a> or Congolese giant toads <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/congolese-giant-toads-may-mimic-venomous-snakes-trick-predators">hissing like Gaboon vipers</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 10/25/19</em>). But these don’t involve a mammal and insect pairing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new study makes behavioral ecologist Anastasia Dalziell think of other birds besides owls. Songbirds are fairly regular acoustic mimics, says Dalziell, of the University of Wollongong in Australia who was also not involved with the research. “I&#8217;ve been waiting for a study like this because bats are a lot alike, in many ways, to songbirds,” she says. “They learn their vocalizations like songbirds — at least in some cases — and they can even sing, so it makes sense to me that they would mimic as well.”</p>



<p>But behavioral ecologist Matthew Bulbert of Oxford Brookes University in England isn’t convinced this is a case of mimicry. The owls are encountering stinging insects and bats in totally different contexts (resting vs. hunting), which doesn’t make it probable that the owls are fooled, he says. Instead, the buzzing could be generally startling to an owl, increasing the chance the bat is released.</p>



<p>“That in itself is still pretty cool,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/raw-chicken-wash-safety-physics-kitchen-germs">How to wash chicken in the kitchen more safely, according to physics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Health experts recommend against washing chicken before cooking it because that can spread harmful bacteria. But if you’re among the nearly <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfp/article/78/1/180/174434/Consumer-Reported-Handling-of-Raw-Poultry-Products">70 percent of people</a> who do, according to a survey of U.S. grocery shoppers, there are ways to make it safer.</p>



<p>Instead of admonishing people not to wash chicken, says mathematician Scott McCalla of Montana State University in Bozeman, the goal of a study published in the March <em>Physics of Fluids</em> was to “recommend <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0083979">how to do it safely</a>, or more carefully.”</p>



<p>The researchers placed raw chicken under running faucets and monitored the spray of water and bacteria to nearby surfaces. The outcomes changed dramatically depending on a few factors.</p>





<p>The height of the faucet above the chicken had the largest effect. If the water fell 40 centimeters (about 16 inches) before hitting a chicken breast or thigh, the germs traveled farther than for faucets just 15 centimeters (about 6 inches) above the chicken.</p>



<p>In tests involving the higher faucets, droplets of water splashed more than 22 centimeters in the air, contaminating much of the surrounding area. For lower faucets, droplets splashed only about 5 centimeters high, and there was comparatively little sign of contamination making it to nearby surfaces. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also found that if they flicked on a faucet, the initial burst of water sent contaminated spray flying. Turning it on gradually reduced the spray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pliability of chicken was also important. Water hitting the chicken creates a small divot in the soft surface, which shoots the splatter farther than it would if the chicken didn&#8217;t deform. Keeping the water pressure turned down reduces the dimpling and resulting germ spread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raw chicken can be fouled by <em>Salmonella</em> and other bacteria that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/chicken-poses-significant-drug-resistant-salmonella-threat">can cause foodborne illnesses</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/10</em>). Even minor splashing will contaminate sinks with germs that can spread through contact with other foods and hands, says food safety researcher Ellen Shumaker of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who wasn’t part of the study.</p>



<p>Reducing splashing, though, can still be part of what Shumaker describes as a multipronged approach to keeping germs in check in the kitchen. “We do know that there are always going to be people who always wash” poultry, she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h5>Tips to minimize contamination from washing raw chicken</h5>



<p>To prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause foodborne illnesses, experts recommend not washing chicken before cooking it. But if you do, here are some ways to make it safer, according to a new study:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/09/heres-why-phrases-like-rowdy-bowels-and-moose-ooze-seem-funny/">Here’s why phrases like “rowdy bowels” and “moose ooze” seem funny</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Which is funnier:</p>



<p><em>Sell bargain</em> — or <em>nymph piss</em>?</p>



<p><em>Roof darkness</em> — or <em>gravy orgy</em>?</p>



<p><em>Large small</em> — or <em>moose ooze</em>?</p>



<p>If you went for the second each time, you’d be in good company. In a new study, participants gave word pairs in the second set the highest humour ratings, while those in the first languished near the bottom. One very obvious difference is that those in the second set reference sex or bodily excretions, while the others don’t. But Cynthia S. Q. Siew at the National University of Singapore, along with Tomas Engelthaler and Thomas T. Hills at the University of Warwick, also identified broader factors at play. In <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-51465-001">their paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em>, they argue that these factors explain why <em>gangster pasta</em>, for example, is funnier than <em>insult nickname</em>.</p>



<span id="more-46159"></span>



<p>In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-27729-018">2018 study on 4,977 individual English words</a>, Engelthaler and Hills found that words that are encountered less frequently in English, such as <em>humbug </em>or <em>czar</em>, tended to be rated as funnier. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-52097-001">Work published the following year</a> by a separate group built on this finding. It revealed that words with a less common structure (with relatively rare letter sequences, for example — think <em>talc </em>vs <em>code</em>) tended to be deemed funnier than those with more familiar, predictable structures.</p>



<p>The findings from both these earlier studies on single words are consistent with a popular theory of humour that holds that the more something violates our expectations — but at the same time is not threatening — the funnier it is.</p>



<p>In the new paper, Siew and her colleagues looked instead at how humorous people find <em>pairs</em> of words. “Now,” the team writes, “instead of facing our participants with the task of rating individual words, like <em>cage</em> (which is not particularly funny on its own) or <em>cabbage</em> (only mildly funnier), our participants are faced with rating the humour of <em>cabbage cage</em>, which is arguably funnier than either word alone. But why?&#8221;.</p>



<p>The first online study was open to anyone who accessed the researchers’ web app. These participants were presented with a series of word pairs made up from individual words used in the 2018 study. Each time, they had to choose whether the word pair was &#8220;humorous&#8221; or &#8220;humourless&#8221;.</p>



<p>Participants rated as many pairs as they wanted. After about two and a half years, the team had gathered a total of 55,100 ratings from 597 unique sessions. (In theory, the same person could access the app multiple times, so they don’t know the number of unique participants).</p>



<p>They found that word pairs participants considered funny tended to contain individual words that were emotionally arousing; that were concrete (referring to something easily visualised, like <em>gravy</em>, vs something abstract, like <em>nifty</em>); that were less dominating (less threatening); and that were less frequently encountered in English. But relationships between the two words were also important in determining how funny the phrase was.</p>



<p>Pairs made up of individual words with completely unrelated meanings were more likely to be found funny (<em>crab ghetto</em> vs <em>insult nickname</em>, for example). The results also showed that pairs of more similar-<em>sounding</em> words (like <em>moose ooze</em>) were also more likely to be deemed funny.  But overall, when the 2018 data and the new data were compared, the meaning was more important in determining whether a word <em>pair</em> was funny, while other factors (such as how frequently the word is encountered in English and the presence of particular sounds or letters) was more important in determining whether a single word was funny.</p>



<p>The team then ran a second study using 732 fresh word pairs. A total of 32 online participants viewed each of these pairs in sets of four. Each time, they had to pick the funniest and the least funny.                          </p>



<p>The top ten most humorous were:</p>

<p>Clearly, pairs containing sex- and excretion-related words scored highly. Again, though, the analysis showed that other meaning-related variables, including concreteness, dominance and level of induced emotional arousal had an effect. As in the first study, words that sounded similar also tended to be rated as funnier, though this time the team did not find a significant link between the relatedness of the meaning of the individual words and humour ratings.</p>



<p>What does all of this mean for our understanding of what makes something funny?</p>



<p>The team thinks that the findings fit with the expectation-violation theory of humour. “Given our prior experience of language, word pairs that contain semantic leaps (such as ‘knapsack rapist’) as well as word pairs that are phonological tongue twisters (such as ‘moose ooze’) are surprising and (benignly) violate our own experience with language and multiword phrases,” the team explains. However, there’s nothing surprising (in terms of meaning) about the single word <em>backpack</em>, for example — and this explains why meaning is less important for the humorousness, or otherwise, of single words.  </p>



<p>The team also point to the &#8220;rule of three&#8221; in comedy writing, in which the first two items set up context and expectations, which are then violated by a humorous punchline. Perhaps, they write, the funniest comedy writers are those who are best at exploiting and integrating both general language-based and context-specific violations “to create multiple pathways to humour.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-climate-future-nutrition-millet-seaweed-cassava-mussels">These six foods may become more popular as the planet warms</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">No matter how you slice it, climate change will alter what we eat in the future. Today, just 13 crops provide 80 percent of people’s energy intake worldwide, and about half of our calories come from wheat, maize and rice. Yet some of these crops may not grow well in the higher temperatures, unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events caused by climate change. Already, drought, heat waves and flash floods are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">damaging crops</a> around the world<em>.</em></p>



<p>“We must diversify our food basket,” says Festo Massawe. He’s executive director of Future Food Beacon Malaysia, a group at the University of Nottingham Malaysia campus in Semenyih that studies the impact of climate change on food security.</p>



<p>That goes beyond what we eat to how we grow it. The trick will be investing in every possible solution: breeding crops so they’re more climate resilient, genetically engineering foods in the lab and studying crops that we just don’t know enough about, says ecologist Samuel Pironon of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London. To feed a growing population in a rapidly changing world, food scientists are exploring many possible avenues, while thinking about how to be environmentally friendly.</p>





<p>Consumer preferences are part of the equation as well. “It does have to be that right combination of: It looks good, it tastes good and it’s the right price point,” says Halley Froehlich, an aquaculture and fisheries scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>



<p>Here are six foods that could check all those boxes and feature more prominently on menus and grocery shelves in the future.</p>



<h4>1. Millet</h4>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Carbohydrates, protein, minerals (potassium, phosphorus and magnesium)<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Whole grain; gluten-free flour, pasta, chips, beer</p>



<p>The United Nations has declared 2023 the International Year of Millets (a handful of varieties exist). Quinoa earned the same honor in 2013, and its sales skyrocketed. First cultivated in Asia some 10,000 years ago, millet is a staple grain in parts of Asia and Africa. Compared with wheat, maize and rice, millet is much <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0958166922000039">more climate resilient</a>; the crop needs little water and thrives in warmer, drier environments. Some more good news: Millet is one of many ancient grains — including teff, amaranth and sorghum — that are similarly sustainable and resilient (not to mention capable of being turned into beer).</p>



<h4>2. Bambara groundnut</h4>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Protein, fiber, minerals (potassium, magnesium and iron)<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Roasted or boiled; gluten-free flour; dairy-free milk</p>



<p>You’ve heard of almond milk and soy milk. The next alternative at your coffee shop could be made from Bambara groundnuts, a drought-tolerant legume native to sub-Saharan Africa. Like other legumes, the Bambara groundnut is packed with protein. And bacteria on the plant convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia so the groundnut grows well in nutrient-poor soil without chemical fertilizers. A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00425-019-03191-6">better understanding of the plant</a>, says Festo Massawe of Future Food Beacon Malaysia, could pave the way for breeding programs to help the Bambara groundnut become as popular as the soybean, a legume that produces high yields but is less drought tolerant.</p>



<h4>3. Mussels</h4>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Protein, omega-3, vitamin B12, minerals (iron, manganese and zinc)<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Steamed; added to pasta dishes, stews, soups</p>



<p>A delicious mussel linguine might someday become a weeknight regular on the family menu. Mussels and other bivalves, including oysters, clams and scallops, could make up about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2616-y">40 percent of seafood by 2050</a>, according to a 2020 report in <em>Nature</em>. With no need to be watered or fertilized, bivalve farms are prime for scaling up, which would lower prices for consumers. All bivalves have merit, but Halley Froehlich of UC Santa Barbara singles out mussels as “super hardy,” “super nutritious” and underhyped. One downside: Shell-forming creatures are threatened as rising carbon levels boost ocean acidification. Kelp might be able to help.</p>



<h4>4. Kelp</h4>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Vitamins, minerals (iodine, calcium and iron), antioxidants<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Salads, smoothies, salsa, pickles, noodles and chips; also found in toothpaste, shampoo and biofuels</p>



<p>Kelp has a few cool climate-friendly tricks. For one, by taking in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, it can <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00100/full">lower the acidity</a> of its watery surroundings. Farmers in Maine and Alaska grow kelp and bivalves together so that the shelled critters can benefit from the less acidic water. Kelp also sequesters carbon, like underwater trees. That means growing and eating more kelp could be good for the environment. While kelp and other seaweeds have been widely consumed in Asia for thousands of years, they’re still an acquired taste in many Western countries.</p>



<h4>5. Enset</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="3113220" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-climate-future-nutrition-millet-seaweed-cassava-mussels/050722_future-foods_inline_enset" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset.jpg" data-orig-size="1030,610" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="050722_future-foods_inline_enset" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-647x383.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-760x450.jpg" loading="lazy" width="760" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-760x450.jpg" alt="Enset or “false banana”" class="wp-image-3113220" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-760x450.jpg 760w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-647x383.jpg 647w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-314x186.jpg 314w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-768x455.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset-979x580.jpg 979w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/050722_future-foods_inline_enset.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3113220">MIKE GOLDWATER/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Carbohydrates, calcium, potassium and zinc<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Porridge or bread; also used to make rope, plates and building materials</p>



<p>The drought-tolerant enset, cultivated in Ethiopia, is nicknamed the “false banana” because the plant resembles a banana tree, though its fruit is inedible. It’s also called “the tree against hunger” because its starchy stems can be harvested at any time of year, making it a reliable buffer food crop during dry periods. A 2021 report in <em>Environmental Research Letters</em> suggests that the enset’s range could be expanded to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac40b2/meta">other parts of Africa</a>, and possibly beyond. The processing required to make enset edible is complex, says study author James Borrell of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. So any expansion would have to be led by the communities who hold that Indigenous knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Carbohydrates, potassium, vitamin C<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Whole cooked root; gluten-free flour; tapioca pearls in bubble tea</p>



<p>Cassava, a starchy root vegetable from South America, checks the boxes for climate resilience, sustainability and nutrition. Now grown in over 100 countries, cassava can withstand temperatures of up to 40° Celsius and is salt and drought tolerant. An added plus: Higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels enhance the plant’s tolerance to stress and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12042-020-09255-2">can lead to higher yields</a>. Raw cassava can contain toxic levels of cyanide, but the chemical can be removed by peeling, soaking and cooking the root.</p>

<p><strong>Cometary evidence of a planet beyond Pluto </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cometary-evidence-planet-beyond-pluto"><em>Science News</em></a>, May 6, 1972</p>



<p>There have been suggestions that our solar system might have a tenth planet…. In the April <em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific</em>, a mathematician … presents what he says is “some very interesting evidence of a planet beyond Pluto.” The evidence comes from calculations of the orbit of Halley’s comet.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The 1972 evidence never yielded a planet, but astronomers haven’t stopped looking — though it became a search for Planet 9 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">with Pluto’s 2006 switch to dwarf status</a>. In the mid-2010s, scientists hypothesized that the tug of a large planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-clues-search-planet-nine">500&nbsp;to 600 times as far from the sun as Earth</a> could explain the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-may-lurk-far-beyond-neptune">peculiar orbits of some objects</a> in the solar system’s debris-filled Kuiper Belt (<em>SN: 7/23/16, p. 7</em>). But that evidence <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hidden-planet-nine-solar-system-evidence-may-not-hold-up">might not stand up to further scrutiny</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 9</em>). Researchers using the Atacama C­osmology Telescope in Chile to scan nearly 90 percent of the Southern Hemisphere’s sky <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2307">had no luck finding the planet</a>, the team reported in December 2021.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milk-cow-alternative-plant-based-taste-sustainability-nutrition">Oat and soy milks are planet friendly, but not as nutritious as cow milk</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">If you’ve got milk, you’ve got options. You can lighten your coffee or soak a cookie, ferment a cheese or bestow yourself a mustache. You can float some cereal or mix a shake. Replacing such a versatile substance is a tall order. And yet there is ample reason to pursue alternatives.</p>



<p>Producing a single liter of cow’s milk requires about 9 square meters of land and about 630 liters of water. That’s the area of two king-size beds and the volume of 10.5 beer kegs. The process of making a liter of dairy milk also generates about 3.2 kilograms of greenhouse gases.</p>



<p>With milk’s global popularity, those costs are enormous. In 2015, <a href="https://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/CA2929EN/">the dairy sector generated 1.7 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases</a>, roughly 3 percent of human-related greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.</p>





<p>Making plant-based milks — including oat, almond, rice and soy — <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216">generates about one-third of the greenhouse gases</a> and uses far less land and water than producing dairy milk, according to a 2018 report in <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Fueled by a growing base of environmentally conscious consumers, a slew of plant-based milks has entered the market. According to SPINS, a company that collects data on natural and organic products, $2.6 billion of plant-based milks were sold in the United States in 2021. That’s a 33 percent growth in dollar sales since 2019. “Food industries have realized that consumers… want change,” says food scientist David McClements of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>



<p>Although plant milks by and large are better for the environment and the climate, they don’t provide the same nutrition. As the iconic dairy campaign of the 1980s said, “Milk, it does a body good.” The creamy beverage contains 13 essential nutrients, including muscle-building protein, immune-boosting vitamin A and zinc, and bone-strengthening calcium and vitamin D. Plant-based milks tend to contain smaller amounts of these nutrients, and even when plant milks are fortified, researchers aren’t yet sure how well the body absorbs those nutrients.</p>



<p>Dairy is very challenging to try and replace, says Leah Bessa, chief science officer of De Novo Dairy, a biotechnology company in Cape Town, South Africa, that produces dairy proteins without the animals. “You don&#8217;t really have a good alternative that&#8217;s sustainable and has the same nutritional profile and functionality.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>Milk&#8217;s footprint</h4>



<p>Producing one liter of dairy milk uses more land and water and emits more greenhouse gases than the production of one liter of oat, soy, almond or rice milk. Among plant-based milks, water use is highest for almond and rice milks.</p>

<h4>Room for improvement</h4>



<p>What even is milk?</p>



<p>By its classic definition, milk is a fluid that comes from the mammary gland of a female mammal. But Eva Tornberg, a food scientist at Lund University in Sweden who has developed a potato milk, prefers to focus on milk’s chemical structure. That is the essence of its nourishing nature, she says. “It’s an emulsion…many tiny oil droplets that are dispersed in water.”</p>



<p>That emulsion imbues milk with its signature creaminess and makes milk the ideal vehicle for transporting nutrients, McClements notes. The duality of oil and water means milk can carry both water-soluble nutrients, such as riboflavin and vitamin B12, and oil-soluble ones, such as vitamins A and D.</p>



<p>And with the fat content separated into a multitude of oil droplets — rather than a single layer — human digestive enzymes have a vast amount of surface area to react with. This makes the nutrients packed inside the droplets easy and quick to absorb.</p>



<p>Most plant-based milks are also emulsions, McClements says, so they too have the potential to serve as excellent nutrient-delivery systems. But for the most part, plant-based milk producers have focused much more on providing the right flavor and mouthfeel to appeal to consumers’ tastes, he says. “We need much more work with the nutritional aspects.”</p>



<h4>What’s missing?</h4>



<p>When it comes to nutrition, the closest competitor among the plant-based milks available today is probably soy milk, says Megan Lott, a registered dietitian with Healthy Eating Research, a Durham, N.C.-based program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Soy milk contains almost as much protein as cow milk and that protein is similarly complete — containing all the essential amino acids. “It’s actually approved by the USDA in child nutrition programs and school meal programs as a substitute for dairy milk,” she says.</p>



<p>But soy milks and other plant-based milks fall short on other important nutrients. Parents often think they can give their children one cup of just plant-based milk in place of one cup of cow’s milk, and they’ll be getting everything they need, Lott says. “That’s just not the case.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>Many producers fortify plant-based milks with vitamin D and calcium to rival or exceed the level in dairy milk. But whether the body can absorb those added nutrients is another story.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Vitamin D and calcium — especially important for a growing child — are the hardest nutrients to get when dropping dairy. Most of milk’s other important components can be obtained from a healthy diet of whole grains, vegetables, fruits and lean meats, Lott says. “If you&#8217;re a parent looking to find an alternative for your child, it&#8217;s probably the calcium and vitamin D … where you should focus your decision.”</p>



<p>Many producers fortify plant-based milks with vitamin D and calcium to rival or exceed the level in dairy milk. But whether the body can absorb those added nutrients is another story. What consumers read on the Nutrition Facts label does not necessarily reflect how much their body will actually be able to absorb and use, Lott says.</p>



<p>That’s because plant-based milks may contain naturally occurring plant molecules that hinder the absorption of nutrients. For example, some plant milks, including oat and soy milks, contain phytic acid, which binds to calcium, iron and zinc and reduces the body’s absorption of these nutrients.</p>



<p>And adding too much of one good thing can backfire. For instance, introducing high levels of calcium into almond milk may <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c01525">interfere with the body’s absorption of vitamin D</a>, McClements and colleagues reported in 2021 in the <em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</em>.</p>



<p>More research is needed to better understand how compounds interact in plant milks and how those interactions affect nutrient absorption in the body, McClements says. Homing in on the ideal balance of ingredients will help producers of plant-based milks craft more nutritious products that taste good too, he says. “What we’re trying to do is find that sweet spot.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latin-america-culture-theory-east-west-comparisons">Latin America defies cultural theories based on East-West comparisons</a></h4>

              
                <p>When Igor de Almeida moved to Japan from Brazil nine years ago, the transition should have been relatively easy. Both Japan and Brazil are collectivist nations, where people tend to value the group’s needs over their own. And research shows that immigrants adapt more easily when the home and new country’s cultures match.</p>



<p>But to de Almeida, a cultural psychologist now at Kyoto University, the countries’ cultural differences were striking. Japanese people prioritize formal relationships, such as with coworkers or members of the same “bukatsu,” or extracurricular club, for instance, while Brazilian people prioritize friends in their informal social network. “Sometimes I try to find [cultural] similarities but it’s really hard,” de Almeida says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, new research helps explain that disconnect. For decades, psychologists have studied how culture shapes the mind, or people’s thoughts and behaviors, by comparing Eastern and Western nations. But two research groups working independently in Latin America are finding that a cultural framework that splits the world in two is overly simplistic, obscuring nuances elsewhere in the world.</p>





<p>Due to differences in methodology and interpretation, the teams’ findings about how people living in the collectivist nations of Latin America think are also contradictory. And that raises a larger question: Will overarching cultural theories based on East-West divisions hold up over time, or are new theories needed?</p>



<p>However this debate unfolds, cultural psychologists argue that the field must expand. “If you make most of the cultures of the world … invisible,” says Vivian Vignoles, a cultural psychologist at the University of Sussex in England, “you will get all sorts of things wrong.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Such misconceptions can jeopardize political alliances, business relationships, public health initiatives and general theories for how people find happiness and meaning. “Culture shapes what it means to be a person,” says Stanford University behavioral scientist Hazel Rose Markus. “What it means to be a person guides all of our behavior, how we think, how we feel, what motivates us [and] how we respond to other individuals and groups.”</p>

<h4>Culture and the mind</h4>



<p>Until four decades ago, most psychologists believed that culture had little bearing on the mind. That changed in 1980. Surveys of IBM employees taken across some 70 countries showed that attitudes toward work largely depended on workers’ home country, IBM organizational psychologist Geert Hofstede’s wrote in <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/cultures-consequences/book9710"><em>Culture’s Consequences</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Markus and Shinobu Kitayama, a cultural psychologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, subsequently fleshed out one Hofstede’s four cultural principles: Individualism versus collectivism. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-23978-001">Culture does influence thinking</a>, the duo claimed in a now widely cited paper in the 1991 <em>Psychological Review</em>. By comparing people in mostly the East and West, they surmised that living in individualist countries (i.e. Western ones) led people to think independently while living in collectivist countries (the East) led people to think interdependently.</p>



<p>That paper was pioneering at the time, Vignoles says. Before that, with psychological research based almost exclusively in the West, the Western mind had become the default mind. Now, “instead of being only one kind of person in the world, there [were] two kinds of persons in the world.”&nbsp;</p>





<h4>Latin America: A case study</h4>



<p>How individualism/collectivism shape the mind now undergirds the field of cross-cultural psychology. But researchers continue to treat the East and West, chiefly Japan and the United States, as prototypes, Vignoles and colleagues say.</p>



<p>To expand beyond that narrow lens, the team surveyed 7,279 participants in 33 nations and 55 cultures. Participants read such statements as “I prefer to turn to other people for help rather than solely rely on myself” and “I consider my happiness separate from the happiness of my friends and family.” They then responded to how well those comments reflected their values on a scale from 1 for “not at all” to 9 for “exactly.”</p>



<p>That analysis allowed the researchers to identify seven dimensions of independence/interdependence, including self-reliance versus dependence on others and emphasis on self-expression versus harmony. Strikingly, Latin Americans were as, or more, independent as Westerners in six out of the seven dimensions, the team reported in 2016 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers’ subsequent analysis of four studies comprising 17,255 participants across 53 nations largely reaffirmed that surprising finding. For instance, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916211029632">Latin Americans are more expressive</a> than even Westerners, Vignoles, de Almeida and colleagues report in February in <em>Perspectives in Psychological Science</em>. But that finding violates the common view that people living in collectivist societies suppress their emotions to foster harmony, while people in individualistic countries emote as a form of self-expression.</p>

<h3>More mentions for East and West</h3>



<p>Researchers identified 558 articles investigating thinking patterns or “self-construals.” The team counted countries mentioned in the articles’ titles and abstracts. Western countries, such as the United States and Germany, received 42 percent of all mentions while East Asian countries, such as China and Japan, received 39 percent. Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, received 1/15th the mentions that East Asian countries did.</p>

<p>Latin American nations are collectivist, as defined by Hofstede and others, but the people think and behave independently, the team concludes.</p>



<p>Kitayama’s team has a different take: Latin Americans are interdependent, just in a wholly different way than East Asians. Rather than suppressing emotions, Latin Americans tend to express positive, socially engaging emotions to communicate with others, says cultural psychologist Cristina Salvador of Duke University. That fosters interdependence, unlike the way Westerners express emotions to show their personal feelings. Westerners’ feelings can be negative or positive and often have little to do with their social surroundings — a sign of independence.</p>



<p>Salvador, Kitayama and colleagues had more than 1,000 respondents in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Japan and the United States reflect on various social scenarios, instead of asking explicit questions like Vignoles’ team. For instance, respondents were asked to imagine winning a prize. They then picked what emotions — such as shame, guilt, anger, friendliness or closeness to others — they would express with family and friends.</p>



<p>Respondents from Latin America and the United States both expressed strong emotions, Salvador reported in February at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference in San Francisco. But people in the United States expressed egocentric emotions, such as pride, while people in Latin America expressed emotions that emphasize connection with others.</p>



<p>Because Latin America’s high ethnic and linguistic diversity made communication with words difficult, people learned how to communicate in other ways, Kitayama says. “Emotion became a very important means of social communication.”</p>



<h4>Decentering the West &nbsp;</h4>



<p>More research is needed to reconcile those findings. But how should that research proceed? Though a shift to a broader framework has begun, research in cultural psychology still hinges on the East-West binary, researchers from both teams say.</p>



<p>Psychologists who peer review studies for acceptance into scientific journals still “want a mainstream, white, U.S. comparison sample,” Salvador says. “[Often] you need an Asian sample, as well.”</p>



<p>The primacy of the East and West means that psychological differences between those two regions dominate research and discussions. But both teams are expanding the scope of their research despite those challenges.</p>



<p>Kitayama’s team, for instance, maps out how interdependence, which it argues <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-catholic-church-may-have-helped-spark-western-individualism">precedes the emergence of independence</a>, might have morphed as it spread around the globe, in a theory paper also presented at the San Francisco conference (<em>SN: 11/7/19</em>).

<p>This research started with a “West and the rest” mentality, Kitayama says. His work with Markus created an “East-West and the rest” mentality. Now finally, psychologists are grappling with “the rest,” he says. “The time is really ready to expand this [research] to cover the rest of the world.”</p>



<p>De Almeida imagines decentering the West yet further. What if researchers had started off by comparing Japan and Brazil instead of Japan and the United States, he wonders. Instead of the current laser focus on individualism/collectivism, some other defining facet of culture would have likely risen to prominence. “I would say emotional expression, that’s the most important thing,” de Almeida says.</p>



<p>He sees a straightforward solution. “We could increase the number of studies not involving the United States,” he says. “Then we could develop new paradigms.”</p>

We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members‘.</i></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>In this blog, Raffaella tells us more about how her research relates to Sustainable Development Goal 3 &#8211; Good Health and Well-being</strong>.</p>
<p>I was trained in pharmacy in Italy, and later completed my education itinerary with a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium, that has meanwhile become my second home country. Over a 30-year journey, I worked in commercial and non-commercial clinical research, medical humanitarian programs, and academia; and developed strong professional and personal interest for pharmaceutical policies, access to medicines, and research ethics, particularly in relation to resource-constrained settings and vulnerable communities. Herein, I will only focus on the journey through medical research, reflecting on how it fostered my concern for ethics and on how it shaped a part of my research, which is linked to SDG3.8, i.e. the achievement of “<em>universal health coverage</em>”.</p>
<p>At the start of my career, I was a young clinical research coordinator in a pharmaceutical company based and (mainly) operating in the Global North. Later on, after having worked as pharmacist in different humanitarian programs, I became the head of the ITM Clinical Trials Unit, that co-managed collaborative clinical trials addressing the health problems of low- and middle-income countries, in collaboration with local research partners. Observing the world of clinical research from the prospective of the Global North and, some years later, of the Global South, has been a privileged and challenging experience to me. It was immediately very clear, for instance, that in low-income settings prospective participants who do not have a health insurance, will almost inevitably see research participation as a way to temporarily secure free medical care; as such, they will be much more eager to be recruited, and much more at risk of being exploited in non-ethical research. Furthermore, I gradually realized that the concept of “non-ethical research” was much broader and much more complex than what I had learnt from traditional trainings in Good Clinical Practices (GCP) in the ‘90s. By sure, a medical research is unethical if conducted without the approval of an independent Ethics Committee, or without participants informed consent. But is this enough? Can we call a research “ethical” if its governance is not fairly co-owned by the “local” researchers in the study country? Or if it is not accompanied by a meaningful engagement with the concerned community, or with patients&#8217; representatives? Or if there is not a reasonable likelihood that any intervention developed by the research can timely become accessible and affordable in the country(ies) that hosted it? Our group has been documenting the importance of these aspects, and advocated for an update of the international GCP guidelines, which still ignore key-concepts such as fair research partnership, benefit sharing and community engagement (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28588969/">It is time to revise the international Good Clinical Practices guidelines: recommendations from non-commercial North-South collaborative trials &#8211; PubMed (nih.gov)</a>).</p>

<p>Research institutions and individual researchers are responsible to build ethics and integrity in their institutional policies and in their personal values and behaviors. Thanks to my experience in two committees that review a lot of collaborative global health research, I understood to what extent the research ethics committees can play a key-role in protecting individuals and communities from unethical research. In particular, they could and should push researchers to incorporate principles such as fair research partnership, benefit-sharing, community engagement, fair policies and practices for sharing research data and biosamples, etc, in their protocols, and in their practices. We joined forces with like-minded researchers to understand how the role of ethics review can be strengthened, particularly during public health emergencies, when reviewers need to reconciliate the quality of reviews with the required rapidity. A lot has been learnt from the experience of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28567113/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28567113/</a>) &#8211; recommendations were published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em>  <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x">https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x</a>). Last (for now), ethics challenges are nowadays more and more linked also to the post-study phase, when findings should be timely disseminated, without omissions nor inaccuracies or distortions. This pushed us toward analyzing how the research community should engage in responsible dissemination of research, and toward advocating for improved practices, in particular for a correct use of pre-prints (<a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00667-7">https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00667-7</a>).</p>
<p>Research ethics remains a rapidly evolving field, that should listen to the voices of all researchers (having in mind the power unbalances that still exist across them in global health research) and to the voices of the communities, for effectively responding to emerging concerns in ethics, integrity and global health. I am more and more persuaded that medical research will not be able to adequately address the global health priority needs and contribute to the achievement of “<em>universal health coverage</em>” (SDG3.8) if it is not ethically sound, from the conceptualization to the dissemination phase.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meat-microbial-protein-climate-change-deforestation-fungi-algae">Replacing some meat with microbial protein could help fight climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Fungi Fridays” could save a lot of trees — and take a bite out of greenhouse gas emissions. Eating one-fifth less red meat and instead munching on microbial proteins derived from fungi or algae could cut <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04629-w">annual deforestation in half</a> by 2050, researchers report May 5 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Raising cattle and other ruminants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">contributes methane and nitrous oxide</a> to the atmosphere, while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">clearing forests for pasture lands</a> adds carbon dioxide (<em>SN: 4/4/22</em>; <em>SN: 7/13/21</em>). So the hunt is on for environmentally friendly substitutes, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/can-science-build-better-burger">lab-grown hamburgers</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-insect-cricket-farming-food-agriculture">cricket farming</a> (<em>SN: 9/20/18</em>; <em>SN: 5/2/19</em>).</p>



<p>Another alternative is microbial protein, made from cells cultivated in a laboratory and nurtured with glucose. Fermented fungal spores, for example, produce a dense, doughy substance called mycoprotein, while fermented algae produce spirulina, a dietary supplement.</p>





<p>Cell-cultured foods do require sugar from croplands, but studies show that mycoprotein produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and uses less land and water than raising cattle, says Florian Humpenöder, a climate modeler at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. However, a full comparison of foods’ future environmental impacts also requires accounting for changes in population, lifestyle, dietary patterns and technology, he says.</p>



<p>So Humpenöder and colleagues incorporated projected socioeconomic changes into computer simulations of land use and deforestation from 2020 through 2050. Then they simulated four scenarios, substituting microbial protein for 0 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent or 80 percent of the global red meat diet by 2050.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Microbial diet scenarios</h4>



<p>Swapping some meat in our diet for protein derived from microbes could slash deforestation rates over the next three decades. If no change is made (red line), then about 8 million hectares of forest could be lost per year to pastureland. Replacing 20 percent (blue) of meat for microbial protein could cut that loss by more than half by 2050. Substituting even greater amounts (green, purple) could reduce forest loss even further.</p>

<p>A little substitution went a long way, the team found: Just 20 percent microbial protein substitution cut annual deforestation rates — and associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions — by 56 percent from 2020 to 2050.</p>



<p>Eating more microbial proteins could be part of a portfolio of strategies to address the climate and biodiversity crises — alongside measures to protect forests and decarbonize electricity generation, Humpenöder says.</p>

This personal vector of topics is the key to sorting new arXiv articles according to each reader’s preferences. (Papers opened directly on arXiv.org will not be included in IArxiv’s algorithm.)</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re very enthusiastic and motivated in integrating IArxiv into arXiv, which we consider one of the most outstanding sites on the web,” said Alvarez, who <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02460">co-authored a paper on the development of the tool</a>. “We have many important improvements on our horizon. On the one hand, we are going to add all arXiv categories to IArxiv. And on the other hand, we seek to exploit AI to the fullest so that the AI-powered scientists&#8217; access to their relevant literature takes a key step on the way to solving the fundamental problem of ‘finding all the relevant literature before finishing a paper.’”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunscreen-damage-coral-reef-oxybenzone">How some sunscreens damage coral reefs</a></h4>

              
                <p>One common chemical in sunscreen can have devastating effects on coral reefs. Now, scientists know why.</p>



<p>Sea anemones, which are closely related to corals, and mushroom coral can turn oxybenzone — a chemical that protects people against ultraviolet light — <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo4627?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D28054377212393946580000347528961973964%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1651580891&amp;_ga=2.185173482.298136209.1651497148-1084540128.1593714421">into a deadly toxin</a> that’s activated by light. The good news is that algae living alongside the creatures can soak up the toxin and blunt its damage, researchers report in the May 6 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>But that also means that bleached coral reefs lacking algae may be more vulnerable to death. Heat-stressed corals and anemones can eject helpful algae that provide oxygen and remove waste products, which turns reefs white. Such bleaching is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">becoming more common as a result of climate change</a> (<em>SN: 4/7/20</em>).</p>





<p>The findings hint that sunscreen pollution and climate change combined could be a greater threat to coral reefs and other marine habitats than either would be separately, says Craig Downs. He is a forensic ecotoxicologist with the nonprofit Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Amherst, Va., and was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Previous work suggested that oxybenzone can kill young corals or prevent adult corals from recovering after tissue damage. As a result, some places, including Hawaii and Thailand, have banned oxybenzone-containing sunscreens.</p>



<p>In the new study, environmental chemist Djordje Vuckovic of Stanford University and colleagues found that glass anemones (<em>Exaiptasia pallida</em>) exposed to oxybenzone and UV light add sugars to the chemical. While such sugary add-ons would typically help organisms detoxify chemicals and clear them from the body, the oxybenzone-sugar compound instead becomes a toxin that’s activated by light.</p>



<p>Anemones exposed to either simulated sunlight or oxybenzone alone survived the length of the experiment, or 21 days, the team showed. But all anemones exposed to fake sunlight while submersed in water containing the chemical died within 17 days.</p>

<p>The anemones’ algal friends absorbed much of the oxybenzone and the toxin that the animals were exposed to in the lab. Anemones lacking algae died days sooner than anemones with algae.</p>



<p>In similar experiments, algae living inside mushroom coral (<em>Discosoma </em>sp<em>.</em>) also soaked up the toxin, a sign that algal relationships are a safeguard against its harmful effects. The coral’s algae seem to be particularly protective: Over eight days, no mushroom corals died after being exposed to oxybenzone and simulated sunlight.</p>



<p>It’s still unclear what amount of oxybenzone might be toxic to coral reefs in the wild. Another lingering question, Downs says, is whether other sunscreen components that are similar in structure to oxybenzone might have the same effects. Pinning that down could help researchers make better, reef-safe sunscreens. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parkinsons-disease-brain-cell-death-neuron-dopamine">A very specific kind of brain cell dies off in people with Parkinson’s</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deep in the human brain, a very specific kind of cell dies during Parkinson’s disease.</p>



<p>For the first time, researchers have sorted large numbers of human brain cells in the substantia nigra into 10 distinct types. Just one is especially vulnerable in Parkinson’s disease, the team reports May 5 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>. The result could lead to a clearer view of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01061-1">how Parkinson’s takes hold</a>, and perhaps even ways to stop it.</p>



<p>The new research “goes right to the core of the matter,” says neuroscientist Raj Awatramani of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Pinpointing the brain cells that seem to be especially susceptible to the devastating disease is “the strength of this paper,” says Awatramani, who was not involved in the study.</p>





<p>Parkinson’s disease steals people’s ability to move smoothly, leaving balance problems, tremors and rigidity. In the United States, nearly 1 million people are estimated to have Parkinson’s. &nbsp;Scientists have known for decades that these symptoms come with the death of nerve cells in the substantia nigra. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-chemical-lost-parkinsons-may-contribute-its-own-demise">Neurons there</a> churn out dopamine, a chemical signal involved in movement, among other jobs (<em>SN: 9/7/17</em>).</p>



<p>But those dopamine-making neurons are not all equally vulnerable in Parkinson’s, it turns out.</p>



<p>“This seemed like an opportunity to … really clarify which kinds of cells are actually dying in Parkinson’s disease,” says Evan Macosko, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.</p>





<p>The tricky part was that dopamine-making neurons in the substantia nigra are rare. In samples of postmortem brains, “we couldn’t survey enough of [the cells] to really get an answer,” Macosko says. But Abdulraouf Abdulraouf, a researcher in Macosko’s laboratory, led experiments that sorted these cells, figuring out a way to selectively pull the cells’ nuclei out from the rest of the cells present in the substantia nigra. That enrichment ultimately led to an abundance of nuclei to analyze.</p>



<p>By studying over 15,000 nuclei from the brains of eight formerly healthy people, the researchers further sorted dopamine-making cells in the substantia nigra into 10 distinct groups. Each of these cell groups was defined by a specific brain location and certain combinations of genes that were active.</p>



<p>When the researchers looked at substantia nigra neurons in the brains of people who died with either Parkinson’s disease or the related Lewy body dementia, the team noticed something curious: One of these 10 cell types was drastically diminished.<br><br>These missing neurons were identified by their location in the lower part of the substantia nigra and an active <em>AGTR1</em> gene, lab member Tushar Kamath and colleagues found. That gene was thought to serve simply as a good way to identify these cells, Macosko says; researchers don’t know whether the gene has a role in these dopamine-making cells’ fate in people.<br><br>The new finding points to ways to perhaps counter the debilitating diseases. Scientists have been keen to replace the missing dopamine-making neurons in the brains of people with Parkinson’s. The new study shows what those cells would need to look like, Awatramani says. “If a particular subtype is more vulnerable in Parkinson’s disease, maybe that’s the one we should be trying to replace,” he says.<br><br>In fact, Macosko says that stem cell scientists have already been in contact, eager to make these specific cells. “We hope this is a guidepost,” Macosko says.</p>



<p>The new study involved only a small number of human brains. Going forward, Macosko and his colleagues hope to study more brains, and more parts of those brains. “We were able to get some pretty interesting insights with a relatively small number of people,” he says. “When we get to larger numbers of people with other kinds of diseases, I think we’re going to learn a lot.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">How much does eating meat affect nations’ greenhouse gas emissions?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The food we eat is responsible for an astounding one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities, according to two comprehensive studies published in 2021.</p>



<p>“When people talk about food systems, they always think about the cow in the field,” says statistician Francesco Tubiello, lead author of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac018e">one of the reports</a>, appearing in last June’s <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>. True, cows are a major source of methane, which, like other greenhouse gases, traps heat in the atmosphere. But methane, carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases are released from several other sources along the food production chain.</p>



<p>Before 2021, scientists like Tubiello, of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, were well aware that agriculture and related land use changes made up roughly 20 percent of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions. Such land use changes include cutting down forests to make way for cattle grazing and pumping groundwater to flood fields for the sake of agriculture.</p>





<p>But new modeling techniques used by Tubiello and colleagues, plus a study from a group at the European Commission Tubiello worked with, brought to light another big driver of emissions: the food supply chain. All the steps that take food from the farm to our plates to the landfill — transportation, processing, cooking and food waste — bring food-related emissions up from 20 percent to 33 percent.</p>



<p>To slow climate change, the foods we eat deserve major attention, just like fossil fuel burning, says Amos Tai, an environmental scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The fuller picture of food-related emissions demonstrates that the world needs to make drastic changes to the food system if we are to reach international goals for reducing global warming.</p>



<h4>Change from developing countries</h4>



<p>Scientists have gained a clearer understanding of global human-related emissions in recent years through databases like EDGAR, or <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research</a>, developed by the European Union. The database covers every country’s human-emitting activities, from energy production to landfill waste, from 1970 to the present. EDGAR uses a unified methodology to calculate emissions for all economic sectors, says Monica Crippa, a scientific officer at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre.</p>



<p>Crippa and colleagues, with help from Tubiello, built a companion database of food system–related emissions called EDGAR-FOOD. Using that database, the researchers arrived at the same one-third estimate as Tubiello’s group.</p>



<p>Crippa’s team’s calculations, reported in <em>Nature Food</em> in March 2021, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00225-9">split food system emissions into four broad categories</a>: land (including both agriculture and related land use changes), energy (used for producing, processing, packaging and transporting goods), industry (including the production of chemicals used in farming and materials used to package food) and waste (from unused food).</p>



<p>The land sector is the biggest culprit in food system emissions, Crippa says, accounting for about 70 percent of the global total. But the picture looks different across different nations. The United States and other developed countries rely on highly centralized megafarms for much of their food production; so the energy, industry and waste categories make up more than half of these countries’ food system emissions.</p>



<p>In developing countries, agriculture and changing land use are far greater contributors. Emissions in historically less developed countries have also been rising in the last 30 years, as these countries have cut down wild areas to make way for industrial farming and started eating more meat, another major contributor to emissions with impacts across all four categories.</p>



<p>As a result, agriculture and related landscape shifts have driven major increases in food system emissions among developing countries in recent decades, while emissions in developed countries have not grown.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>As industrialized farming grows, emissions rise</h3>



<p>Developing countries’ food-related greenhouse gas emissions have been rising as these countries have shifted to eating more meat and producing food at large, industrialized farms. This shift is driving an overall global increase in food-related emissions. In developed countries, emissions have remained relatively stable. </p>

<p>For instance, China’s food emissions shot up by almost 50 percent from 1990 to 2018, largely due to a rise in meat-eating, according to the EDGAR-FOOD database. In 1980, the average Chinese person ate about 30 grams of meat a day, Tai says. In 2010, the average person in China ate almost five times as much, or just under 150 grams of meat a day.</p>



<h4>Top-emitting economies</h4>



<p>In recent years, Crippa says, six economies, the top emitters, have been responsible for more than half of total global food emissions. These economies, in order, are China, Brazil, the United States, India, Indonesia and the European Union. The immense populations of China and India help drive their high numbers. Brazil and Indonesia make the list because large swaths of their rainforests have been cut down to make room for farming. When those trees come down, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">vast amounts of carbon flow into the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>The United States and the European Union are on the list because of heavy meat consumption. In the United States, meat and other animal products contribute the vast majority of food-related emissions, says Richard Waite, a researcher at the World Resources Institute’s food program in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Waste is also a huge issue in the United States: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-11/from-farm-to-kitchen-the-environmental-impacts-of-u.s.-food-waste_508-tagged.pdf">More than one-third of food produced never actually gets eaten</a>, according to a 2021 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When food goes uneaten, the resources used to produce, transport and package it are wasted. Plus, the uneaten food goes into landfills, which produce methane, carbon dioxide and other gases as the food decomposes.</p>

<h3>Six big bites of the pie</h3>



<p>The world’s food system produces about 17 metric gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions each year, measured in tons of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;equivalents — a standardized unit that allows for comparisons between different gases. Emissions from China, Brazil, the United States, India, Indonesia and the European Union together account for 52 percent of this total. </p>

<h4>Meat consumption drives emissions</h4>



<p>Climate advocates who want to reduce food emissions often focus on meat consumption, as animal products lead to far greater emissions than plants. Animal production uses more land than plant production, and “meat production is heavily inefficient,” Tai says.</p>



<p>“If we eat 100 calories of grain, like maize or soybeans, we get that 100 calories,” he explains. All the energy from the food is delivered directly to the person who eats it. But if the 100 calories’ worth of grain is instead fed to a cow or a pig, when the animal is killed and processed for food, just one-tenth of the energy from that 100 calories of grain goes to the person eating the animal.</p>



<p>Methane production from “the cow in the field” is another factor in meat consumption: Cows release this gas via their manure, burps and flatulence. Methane traps more heat per ton emitted than carbon dioxide, Tubiello says. So emissions from cattle farms <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-creative-cut-methane-cows">can have an outsize impact</a> (<em>SN: 11/28/15, p. 22</em>). These <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/methane-emissions-are-driving-climate-change-heres-how-reduce-them">livestock emissions account for about one-third of global methane emissions</a>, according to a 2021 U.N. report.</p>



<h4>Shifting from meats to plants</h4>



<p>U.S. residents should consider how they can shift to what Brent Kim calls “plant-forward” diets. “Plant-forward doesn’t mean vegan. It means reducing animal product intake, and increasing the share of plant foods that are on the plate,” says Kim, program officer at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.</p>



<p>Kim and colleagues estimated food emissions by diet and food group for 140 countries and territories, using a similar modeling framework to EDGAR-FOOD. However, the framework includes only the food production emissions (i.e. agriculture and land use), not processing, transportation and other pieces of the food system incorporated in EDGAR-FOOD.</p>



<p>Producing the average U.S. resident’s diet <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378018306101?via=ihub">generates more than 2,000 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions per year</a>, the researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Global Environmental Change</em>. The group measured emissions in terms of “CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents,” a standardized unit allowing for direct comparisons between CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases like methane.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Food production&#8217;s toll rises with deforestation and meat-heavy diet</h3>



<p>The food produced for an average person’s diet in a developed country results in more greenhouse gas emissions than the food produced for the average diet in a developing country. These food production emissions represent the largest share of food-­related emissions, but do not include processing, transportation, retail or waste. Deforestation for food production has led to high emissions in Australia, Brazil, Argentina and several other South American countries. </p>

	</iframe></div>



<p>Going meatless one day a week brings down that figure to about 1,600 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per year, per person. Going vegan — a diet without any meat, dairy or other animal products — cuts it by 87 percent to under 300. Going even two-thirds vegan offers a sizable drop to 740 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents.</p>



<p>Kim’s modeling also offers a “low food chain” option, which brings emissions down to about 300 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per year, per person. Eating low on the food chain combines a mostly plant-based diet with animal products that come from more climate-friendly sources that do not disturb ecological systems. Examples include insects, smaller fish like sardines, and oysters and other mollusks.</p>



<p>Tai agrees that not everybody needs to become a vegetarian or vegan to save the planet, as meat can have important cultural and nutritional value. If you want to “start from the biggest polluter,” he says, focus on cutting beef consumption.</p>



<p>But enough people need to make these changes to “send a signal back to the market” that consumers want more plant-based options, Tubiello says. Policy makers at the federal, state and local levels can also encourage climate-friendly farming practices, reduce food waste in government operations and take other actions to cut down the resources used in food production, Waite says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Food choice changes climate footprint</h3>



<p>Eating fewer animal products leads to a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions tied to an individual U.S. resident’s diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Diets are defined as follows:&nbsp;<strong>typica</strong>l&nbsp;is the average U.S. diet;&nbsp;<strong>one meatless day</strong>&nbsp;refers to eating no meat one day per week;&nbsp;<strong>low red meat</strong>&nbsp;refers to having no more than 450 grams of cooked red meat per week;&nbsp;<strong>no dairy</strong>&nbsp;refers to having no milk or other dairy products;&nbsp;<strong>lacto/ovo vegetarian</strong>&nbsp;refers to eating no meat but eating dairy and eggs;&nbsp;<strong>pescatarian</strong>&nbsp;refers to eating fish, but no other meat;&nbsp;<strong>no red meat</strong>&nbsp;refers to eating no beef, pork, sheep or goat;&nbsp;<strong>2/3 vegan</strong>&nbsp;refers to eating vegan two out of three meals per day;&nbsp;<strong>low food chain</strong>&nbsp;means eating plant-based food and consuming insects and mollusks that don’t disturb ecological landscapes; and&nbsp;<strong>vegan</strong>&nbsp;refers to eating no animal products.</p>

<p>For example, the World Resources Institute, where Waite works, is part of an initiative called the <a href="https://coolfood.org/pledge/">Cool Food Pledge</a>, in which companies, universities and city governments have signed on to reduce the climate impacts of the food they serve. The institutions agree to track the food they purchase every year to ensure they are progressing toward their goals, Waite says.</p>



<p>Developed countries like the United States — which have been heavy meat consumers for decades — can have a big impact by changing food choices. Indeed, a paper published in <em>Nature Food</em> in January shows that if the populations of 54 high-income nations switched to a plant-focused diet, annual emissions from these countries’ agricultural production could <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00431-5">drop by more than 60 percent</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-smell-odor-artifacts-texts-egypt-archaeology">Ancient ‘smellscapes’ are wafting out of artifacts and old texts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ramses VI faced a smelly challenge when he became Egypt’s king in 1145 B.C. The new pharaoh’s first job was to rid the land of the stench of fish and birds, denizens of the Nile Delta’s fetid swamps.</p>



<p>That, at any rate, was the instruction in a hymn written to Ramses VI upon his ascension to the throne. Some smells, it seems, were considered far worse than others in the land of the pharaohs.</p>



<p>Surviving written accounts indicate that, perhaps unsurprisingly, residents of ancient Egyptian cities encountered a wide array of nice and nasty odors. Depending on the neighborhood, citizens inhaled smells of sweat, disease, cooking meat, incense, trees and flowers. Egypt’s hot weather heightened demand for perfumed oils and ointments that cloaked bodies in pleasant smells.</p>





<p>“The written sources demonstrate that ancient Egyptians lived in a rich olfactory world,” says Egyptologist Dora Goldsmith of Freie Universität Berlin. A full grasp of ancient Egyptian culture requires a comprehensive examination of how pharaohs and their subjects made sense of their lives through smell, she contends. No such study has been conducted.</p>



<p>Archaeologists have traditionally studied visible objects. Investigations have reconstructed what ancient buildings looked like based on excavated remains and determined how people lived by analyzing their tools, personal ornaments and other tangible finds.</p>



<p>Rare projects have re-created what people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stonehenge-acoustics-sounds-voices-music">may have heard thousands of years ago</a> at sites such as Stonehenge (<em>SN: 8/31/20</em>). Piecing together, much less re-creating, the olfactory landscapes, or smellscapes, of long-ago places has attracted even less scholarly curiosity. Ancient cities in Egypt and elsewhere have been presented as “colorful and monumental, but odorless and sterile,” Goldsmith says.</p>



<p>Changes are in the air, though. Some archaeologists are sniffing out odor molecules from artifacts found at dig sites and held in museums. Others are poring over ancient texts for references to perfume recipes, and have even cooked up a scent much like one presumably favored by Cleopatra. In studying and reviving scents of the past, these researchers aim to understand how ancient people experienced, and interpreted, their worlds through smell.</p>



<h4>Molecular odors</h4>



<p>A growing array of biomolecular techniques is enabling the identification of molecules from ancient aromatic substances preserved in cooking pots and other containers, in debris from city garbage pits, in tartar caked on human teeth and even in mummified remains.</p>



<p>Take the humble incense burner, for instance. Finding an ancient incense burner indicates only that a substance of some kind was burned. Unraveling the molecular makeup of residue clinging to such a find “can determine what exactly was burned and reconstruct whether it was the scent of frankincense, myrrh, scented woods or blends of different aromatics,” says archaeologist Barbara Huber.</p>



<p>That sort of detective work is exactly what Huber, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and her colleagues did in research on the walled oasis settlement of Tayma in what’s now Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>Researchers generally assume that Tayma was a pit stop on <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1107/">an ancient network of trade routes, known as the Incense Route</a>, that carried frankincense and myrrh from southern Arabia to Mediterranean destinations around 2,300 to 1,900 years ago. Frankincense and myrrh are both spicy-smelling resins extracted from shrubs and trees that grow on the Arabian Peninsula and in northeastern Africa and India. But Tayma was more than just a refueling oasis for trade caravans.</p>



<p>The desert outpost’s residents purchased aromatic plants for their own uses during much of the settlement’s history, a team led by Huber found. Chemical and molecular analyses of charred resins identified frankincense in cube-shaped incense burners previously unearthed in Tayma’s residential quarter, myrrh in cone-shaped incense burners that had been placed in graves outside the town wall, and an aromatic substance from Mediterranean mastic trees in small goblets used as incense burners in a large public building.</p>



<p>Fragrances of various kinds that must have had special meanings <a href="https://www.icaane2018.vorderas-archaeologie.uni-muenchen.de/programme/main-sessions/abstract-book.pdf">permeated a range of daily activities at ancient Tayma</a>, Huber’s group reported in 2018 in Munich at the 11th International Conference on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East.</p>



<p>In a more recent study, published March 28 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>, Huber and her colleagues outlined ways to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01325-7">detect chemical and genetic traces</a> of ancient scents.</p>

<p>Other researchers have gone searching for molecular scent clues in previously excavated pottery. Analytical chemist Jacopo La Nasa of the University of Pisa in Italy and his colleagues used a portable version of a mass spectrometer to study 46 vessels, jars, cups and lumps of organic material.</p>



<p>These artifacts were found more than a century ago in the underground tomb of Kha and his wife Merit, prominent nonroyals who lived during Egypt’s 18th dynasty from about 1450 B.C. to 1400 B.C. The spectrometer can detect the signature chemical makeup of invisible gases emitted during the decay of different fragrant plants and other substances that had been placed inside vessels.</p>



<p>Analyses of residue from inside seven open vessels and of one lump of unidentified organic material <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440322000358">detected oil or fat, beeswax or both</a>, the scientists report in the May <em>Journal of Archaeological Science</em>. One open vessel yielded possible chemical markers of dried fish and of a possible aromatic resin that could not be specified. The remaining containers were sealed and had to stay that way due to museum policy. Measurements taken in the necks of those vessels also picked up signs of oils or fats and beeswax in some cases. Evidence of a barley flour appeared in one vessel’s neck.</p>



<p>Museum-based studies such as La Nasa’s have great potential to unlock ancient scents. But that’s true only if researchers can open sealed vessels and, with a bit of luck, find enough surviving chemical components of whatever was inside to identify the substance, Goldsmith says.</p>



<p>Luck did not favor La Nasa’s group, she says. “Their analyses did not detect any [specific] scents.”</p>



<p>Oils, fats and beeswax in the seven open vessels could only have constituted neutral-smelling base ingredients for ancient Egyptian perfumes and ointments, Goldsmith says. Starting with mixtures of those substances, Egyptian perfume makers added a host of fragrant ingredients that included myrrh, resin and bark from styrax and pine trees, juniper berries, frankincense and nut grass. The heating of these concoctions produced strongly scented ointments.</p>



<h4>Re-creating Cleopatra’s perfume</h4>



<p>A tradition of fragrant remedies and perfumes began as the first Egyptian royal dynasties assumed power around 5,100 years ago, Goldsmith’s research suggests. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic and cursive documents describe recipes for several perfumes. But precise ingredients and preparation methods remain unknown.</p>



<p>That didn’t stop Goldsmith and historian of Greco-Roman philosophy and science Sean Coughlin of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague from trying to re-create a celebrated Egyptian fragrance known as the Mendesian perfume. Cleopatra, a perfume devotee during her reign as queen from 51 B.C. to 30 B.C., may have doused herself with this scented potion. The perfume took its name from the city where it was made, Mendes.</p>



<p>Excavations conducted since 2009 at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeologists-tie-ancient-bones-egypt-warrior-revolt-rosetta-stone-chronicle">Thmouis, a city founded as an extension of Mendes</a>, have uncovered the roughly 2,300-year-old remains of what was probably a fragrance factory, including kilns and clay perfume containers (<em>SN: 11/27/19</em>). Archaeologist Robert Littman of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and anthropological archaeologist Jay Silverstein of the University of Tyumen in Russia, who direct the Thmouis dig, asked Goldsmith and Coughlin to try to crack the Mendesian perfume code by consulting ancient writings.</p>



<p>After experimenting with ingredients that included desert date oil, myrrh, cinnamon and pine resin, Goldsmith and Coughlin produced a scent that they suspect approximates what Cleopatra probably wore. It’s a strong but pleasant, long-lasting blend of spiciness and sweetness, they say.</p>

<p>Goldsmith has re-created several more ancient Egyptian perfumes from written recipes for fragrances that were used in everyday life, for temple rituals and in the mummification process.</p>



<h4>Ancient smellscapes</h4>



<p>Odor molecules unearthed in archaeological digs and reconstituted perfumes from the past, however, offer only a partial view of the scents of thousands of years ago. To get a more complete picture of an ancient city’s or town’s range of smells — its smellscape — some archaeologists are combing ancient written texts for references to smell.</p>



<p>That’s what Goldsmith did to come up with what she thinks is a smellscape typical of ancient Egyptian cities. Here’s what a “smellwalk” through one of these cities would entail, she says.</p>



<p>In the royal palace, for instance, the perfumed smell of rulers and their family members would have overpowered that of court officials and servants. That would perhaps have denoted <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Handbook-of-the-Senses-in-the-Ancient-Near-East/Neumann-Thomason/p/book/9780367235284">special ties to the gods among those in charge</a>, Goldsmith wrote in a chapter of <em>The Routledge Handbook of the Senses in the Ancient Near East</em>, published in September of 2021.</p>

<p>In temples, priests anointed images of gods with what was called the 10 sacred oils. Though their ingredients are mostly unknown, each substance apparently had its own pleasing scent and ritual function. Temples mixed smells of perfumes, flowers and incense with roasted meat. Written sources describe the smell of fatty meat being grilled as especially pleasing and a sign of peace as well as authority over enemies.</p>



<p>In other parts of an ancient Egyptian city, Goldsmith says, scribal students lived in a special building where they learned Egyptian script. Achieving such knowledge required total devotion and the avoidance of perfume or other pleasant scents. One ancient source described aspiring scribes as “stinking bulls.” That name speaks, and reeks, for itself.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in workshops, sandal-makers mixing tan to soften hides and smiths making metal weapons at the mouths of furnaces probably developed their own distinctive, foul smells, Goldsmith says.</p>



<p>Stinky odors get far fewer mentions than sweet aromas in many of the written accounts from ancient Egypt that Goldsmith reviewed. Goats and other domestic animals, butchered carcasses, open latrines and garbage in the streets, for example, get no mention in these surviving texts.</p>



<p>An awareness that such texts may represent only an elite perspective — and thus not reveal the entire smellscape of the time or how it was perceived by everyday folks — is crucial when compiling the scents of ancient history, Goldsmith says.</p>



<h4>Cultured noses</h4>



<p>Once researchers come up with a reasonable reconstruction of an ancient city’s smellscape, the challenge shifts to figuring out how the ancients interpreted those smells.</p>



<p>Scent is a powerful part of the human experience. Today, scientists know that smells, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-noses-know-more-1-trillion-odors">which humans might discriminate surprisingly well</a>, can instantly trigger memories of past experiences (<em>SN: 3/20/14</em>). And social and ritual meanings also get attached to specific odors — there’s nothing like the smell of freshly mown grass and grilled hot dogs to evoke memories of summer days at the ballpark. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People in modern settings probably perceive the same smells as nice or nasty as folks in ancient Egypt or other past societies did, says psychologist Asifa Majid of the University of Oxford. In line with that possibility, members of nine non-Western cultures, including hunter-gatherers in Thailand and farming villagers in highland Ecuador, closely agreed with Western city dwellers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.02.062">when ranking the pleasantness of 10 odors</a>, Majid and her colleagues report April 4 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Smells of vanilla, citrus and floral sweetness — dispensed by pen-sized devices — got high marks. Odors of rancid oiliness and a fermented scent like that of ripe cheese or human sweat evoked frequent “yech” responses.</p>



<p>A collective “yech” in response to the Nile Delta’s moist, stinky emissions may have inspired the hymn that instructed Ramses VI to rid the land of its swampy fish and fowl smell. But Goldsmith argues that the hymn’s meaning is deeper and hinges on what ancient Egyptians saw as a conflict between sweet and evil smells.</p>



<p>In a 2019 review of texts written during the reigns of various ancient Egyptian kings, Goldsmith was struck by frequent references to this odiferous opposition. She concluded that ancient Egyptians’ largely unexplored views about what exemplified good and bad smells could provide insights into their world view. Researchers have long noted that concepts known as <em>isfet</em> and <em>ma’at</em> helped ancient Egyptians determine what was good or bad in the world. <em>Isfet</em> referred to a natural state of chaos and evil. <em>Ma’at</em> denoted a world of order and justice.</p>



<p>Signature odors <a href="https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/9780884143635_OA.pdf">were associated with <em>isfet</em> and <em>ma’at</em></a>, Goldsmith proposed in a chapter in <em>Sounding Sensory Profiles in the Ancient Near East</em>. In Nile societies, the smelly fish and birds best represented <em>isfet’s</em> nasal assault. Fish, in particular, signified not only stench but also the danger of unfamiliar places outside the pharaoh’s command, she concludes. Meanwhile, the ancient documents equated scented ointments and perfumes with the <em>ma’at</em> of civilized, pharaoh-ruled cities, she says.</p>



<p>Thus, an Egyptian pharaoh’s first duty was to erase the social and physical stink of <em>isfet</em> and institute the sweet smell of <em>ma’at</em>, Goldsmith contends<em>. </em>In his welcoming hymn, Ramses VI got a friendly reminder to make Egypt politically strong and olfactorily fresh.</p>



<p>Explicit beliefs connecting <em>isfet</em> with evil smells and <em>ma’at</em> with sweet smells throughout ancient Egyptian history haven’t yet been established but deserve closer scrutiny, says UCLA Egyptologist Robyn Price.</p>



<p>Price thinks that, rather than being fixed, values that were applied to scents fluctuated over time. For instance, some ancient texts describe the “marsh,” where fish and fowl flourished, as a place of divine creation, she says. And documents from southern Egypt often spoke negatively about northern Egyptians, perhaps influencing claims that northern marshes stunk of <em>isfet</em> during periods when the two regions were under separate rule.</p>



<p>So, even if the ancients tagged the same odors as pleasurable or offensive as people do today, culture and context probably profoundly shaped responses to those smells.</p>



<p>Working-class Romans living in Pompeii around 2,000 years ago — before Mount Vesuvius’ catastrophic eruption in A.D. 79 — provide one example. Archaeological evidence and written sources indicate that patrons of small taverns throughout the city were bombarded with strong smells, says archaeologist Erica Rowan of Royal Holloway, University of London. Diners standing or sitting in small rooms and at outdoor counters whiffed smoky, greasy food being cooked, body odors of other customers who had been toiling all day and pungent aromas wafting out of nearby latrines.</p>



<p>The smells and noises that filled Pompeii’s taverns provided a familiar and comforting experience for everyday Romans, who made these establishments successful, Rowan suspects. Excavations have uncovered 158 of these informal eating and drinking spots throughout Pompeii.</p>

<p>Roman <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Smell-and-the-Ancient-Senses/Bradley/p/book/9781844656424">cities generally smelled</a> of human waste, decaying animal carcasses, garbage, smoke, incense, cooked meat and boiled cabbage, Classical historian Neville Morley of the University of Exeter in England wrote in 2014 in a chapter of <em>Smell and the Ancient Senses</em>. That potent mix “must have been the smell of home to its inhabitants and perhaps even the smell of civilization,” he concluded.</p>



<p>Ramses VI undoubtedly regarded the perfumed world of his palace as the epitome of civilized life. But at the end of a long day, Egyptian sandal-makers and smiths, like Pompeii’s working stiffs, may well have smelled home as the air of city streets filled their nostrils.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How do you know when someone else is paying attention to you? If they’re staring at you intensely, that’s a pretty obvious giveaway. But there are also far subtler signals — such as the size of their pupils.</p>



<p>As Clara Colombatto and Brian Scholl at Yale University note in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-77822-001">new paper</a> in the J<em>ournal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>, our pupils automatically and uncontrollably dilate when we’re emotionally aroused, working something out, or just attending to something. Pupil size has been used as an objective indicator of all these things in a wealth of recent studies.</p>



<p>But if another person is directing their attention towards you, you need to know about it. It might be attention that you should reciprocate, to build a relationship, or it might signal a potential threat. So, Colombatto and Scholl wondered, “If the apprehension of pupil size is so helpful to scientists, might it be similarly helpful to us in everyday life?”</p>



<span id="more-46133"></span>



<p>To investigate, they studied groups of student participants. For these screen-based studies, they manipulated the presentation of a series of images so that they only gradually became perceptible. As soon as a participant saw any part of the image emerge into their conscious awareness, they hit a key.</p>



<p>In each of the two main studies, the participants were repeatedly exposed to versions of face and upper torso images of two men and two women. The researchers digitally manipulated the pupils so that they were either small or large; in the first study, they also digitally cut, rotated and pasted pairs of large or small pupils to resemble shirt buttons. In the second study, instead of &#8220;buttons&#8221;, a single large or small pupil was pasted near the mouth to resemble a facial mole. Colombatto and Scholl varied the size of the pupils and the &#8220;buttons&#8221; or &#8220;moles&#8221; independently, and looked for any differences in the time it took for the images to be consciously perceived.</p>

Buttons and moles actually consisted of pupils digitally imposed on the shirt or face. From <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-77822-001">Colombatto and Scholl (2022)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The results showed that the participants became more rapidly consciously aware of facial close-ups with large vs small pupils — but this was not the case for large vs small &#8220;buttons&#8221; or large vs small &#8220;moles&#8221; (even though the large facial moles really stood out visually against the individuals’ skin). It seems, then, that our visual system is indeed attuned to large pupils, which carry a social meaning — but not to otherwise identical dots.</p>



<p>A further experiment ruled out a potential alternative explanation for the results: that a face with dilated pupils might be perceived as more attractive, and this could lead it to enter conscious awareness more rapidly. Colombatto and Scholl found, in fact, that big-pupil versions of the faces were considered less attractive than the small-pupil versions.</p>



<p>“Despite its social significance, pupil dilation is an exceptionally visually subtle signal,” the pair also notes. During debriefings after the experiments, only two of their total of 60 participants said they’d noticed any eye differences in the images. One referred to a difference in eye colour. The other said: &#8220;Some people looked more intense.&#8221; “This degree of subtlety makes the key results of the study all the more striking,” they argue — and it’s hard to disagree.</p>



<p>In revealing that we unconsciously pay more attention to someone who seems to be paying attention to us, the work also helps to illuminate the processes by which we come to share mutual attention. “In short, the current results suggest that the perceived attentional state of other can in turn cause us to attend to them — a novel form of ‘attentional contagion’,” the researchers conclude.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-hamsters-susceptible-transmission-humans">Some hamsters are extremely susceptible to COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>Golden Syrian hamsters <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.19.488826v1">are highly susceptible to the coronavirus</a> that causes COVID-19, a new study shows.</p>



<p>While the species is popular among pet owners, the results, posted April 20 at bioRxiv, are not cause for panic, says Anne Balkema-Buschmann, a veterinarian at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Riems, Germany. “The message of this paper is not that hamsters are ticking time bombs that can&#8217;t be kept in households any longer.” &nbsp;But pinpointing just how sensitive the animals are to SARS-CoV-2 can help researchers fine-tune experiments that use hamsters to test potential treatments for COVID-19.</p>



<p>The rodents made headlines in January when a cluster of COVID-19 cases in people emerged around pet shops in Hong Kong. In accordance with its “zero-COVID” strategy, the government <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/3163775/coronavirus-hong-kong-leader-worried-about-community-outbreak">culled over 2,000 animals</a>. A viral genetic analysis ultimately revealed that infected hamsters <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00326-9/fulltext">had transmitted the delta variant of the virus to humans twice</a>, leading to at least one further human-to-human transmission. Aside from an instance of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe5901">mink-to-human transmission in Denmark</a> and a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.22.481551v1.full">possible case of white-tailed deer-to-human transmission</a> in Canada, this is the only documented example of the virus going from animals to humans.</p>

<p>Hamsters <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2342-5">can transmit the virus</a> to their uninfected brethren and display similar pneumonia symptoms to humans. So since the early days of the pandemic, the rodents, including Golden Syrians (<em>Mesocricetus auratus</em>), emerged as a useful animal model for COVID-19 drug and vaccine research.</p>



<p>To better design their own COVID-19 vaccine and drug studies,  Balkema-Buschmann’s team tried to determine how much SARS-CoV-2 virus actually makes the animals sick and shed the virus. The researchers found that the minimum infectious dose for hamsters is 1/5000th of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33251966/">some previous estimates</a> and 1/100,000th the minimum infectious dose for humans.</p>



<p>With this minimum dose, the virus infected the animals’ lungs and replicated in the nose and throat. When that minimum dose was increased by a factor of 100, rapid tests of oral swabs from the animals turned up positive results, and the animals got pneumonia and lost weight. There was also a few day delay before the animals started shedding virus and exhibiting disease symptoms, which might cause hamster cases to go unnoticed. Other hamster species that can pick up the virus may have similar risk, and even at low doses, the animals may shed enough virus to infect humans.</p>

<p>For researchers, the results provide a better timeline of disease progression in hamsters and may mean lowering hamster virus dosage levels in drug and vaccine studies to better mirror what happens in humans. For pet owners, the takeaway is to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/covid-19/pets.html">use proper hygiene around hamsters</a> if a human in the household tests positive for the virus and to consult a veterinarian. Swabbing your pet hamster’s mouth could also tell you if it might be infected.</p>



<p>“We don&#8217;t think from these results that hamsters play a role in the dynamics of pandemic. It’s just that the virus might ping-pong within the household if an infected person has close contact with a hamster,” says Balkema-Buschmann.</p>



<p>The greater danger, says Leo Poon, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong who studied the pet shop cluster, is hamsters in farmed or pet trade settings. “With such a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, an introduction of an infectious hamster to a hamster farm or a batch of hamsters might cause an outbreak in the population,” says Poon. “Even worse, it might be silently spreading.”</p>



<p>The new hamster study also examined two genetic versions of the virus from hamsters that received high and low doses, respectively. Neither contained significant mutations. Whenever a virus passes between species there’s a concern that it might mutate and become more infectious or dangerous (as we’ve seen in humans), but Poon notes that one would need to see multiple rounds of infection to say anything about the mutation risk in these rodents.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/io-jupiter-moon-lava-frost-mystery-lumps-dunes">Lava and frost may form the mysterious lumps on Jupiter’s moon Io</a></h4>

              
                <p>On Jupiter’s moon Io, lava creeping beneath frost may give rise to fields of towering dunes.</p>



<p>That finding, described April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>, suggests that dunes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29682-x">may be more common on other worlds than previously thought</a>, though the lumps may form in odd ways. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“In some sense, these [other worlds] are looking more familiar,” says George McDonald, a planetary scientist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. “But the more you think about it, they feel more and more exotic.”</p>





<p>Io is a world crowded with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/three-volcanic-eruptions-rock-jupiters-moon-io">erupting volcanoes</a>, created when the gravitational forces of Jupiter and some of its other moons pull on Io and generate heat (<em>SN: 8/6/14</em>). Around 20 years ago, scientists reported another type of feature on Io’s dynamic surface — hummocky ridges. The features resemble dunes, but that couldn’t be the case, scientists reasoned, because Io’s atmosphere is too thin for winds to whip up a dunescape.</p>



<p>But in recent years, dunelike features have been discovered on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultraviolet-aurora-comet-67p-rosetta-space">comet 67P</a> (<em>SN: 9/21/20</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">Pluto</a> (<em>SN: 8/24/21</em>), planetary bodies that also lack thick atmospheres. Inspired by those alien dunescapes, McDonald and his colleagues revisited the matter of Io’s mysterious lumps. All they needed was some type of airborne force to sculpt the moon’s dunes.</p>



<p>On Earth, powerful explosions of steam occur when flows of molten rock encounter bodies of water. While water isn’t found on Io, sulfur dioxide frost is pervasive. So the scientists hypothesize that when lava slowly flows into and just under a frost layer, jets of sulfur dioxide gas could burst from the frost. Those jets could send grains of rock and other material flying and forming dunes.</p>



<p>The researchers calculate that an advancing lava flow, buried under at least 10 centimeters of frost, could sublimate some of the frost into pockets of hot vapor. When enough vapor accumulates and the pressure becomes high enough to match or overcome the weight of the overlying frost, the vapor could burst out at velocities over 70 kilometers per hour. These bursts could propel grains with diameters from 20 micrometers to 1 centimeter in size, the team estimates. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Analyzing images of Io’s surface, collected by NASA’s now-defunct Galileo probe, revealed highly reflective streaks of material radiating outward over dunes in front of lava flows — possibly material newly deposited at the time by vapor jets.</p>

<p>What’s more, using the images to measure the hummocky features showed that their dimensions align with those of dunes on other planetary bodies. Some of the Ionian dunes are over 30 meters high, the team estimates.</p>



<p>“I think a lot of [scientists] looked at those and thought, hey, these really could be dunes,” says Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who was not involved in the study. “But what&#8217;s exciting about it is that they’ve come up with a good physical mechanism to explain how it’s possible.”</p>



<p>Io is typically thought of as a world of volcanoes. The possibility of dunes suggests that there might be more going on there than scientists thought, McDonald says. “It certainly adds a layer of complexity.”</p>

                <p>Scientists are discovering a surprising bright side for some people with asthma: They are less susceptible to COVID-19.</p>



<p>The very same immune system proteins that trigger excess mucus production and closing of airways in people with <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2119680119">allergic asthma may erect a shield</a> around vulnerable airway cells, researchers report in the April 19 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding helps explain why people with allergic asthma seem to be less susceptible to COVID-19 than those with related lung ailments, and could eventually lead to new treatments for the coronavirus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by airway inflammation. The result is coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/most_recent_national_asthma_data.htm">8 percent of people in the United States have asthma</a>, with about <a href="https://www.aafa.org/allergic-asthma/">60 percent of them having allergic asthma</a>. Allergic asthma symptoms are triggered by allergens such as pollen or pet dander. Other types of asthma can be set off by exercise, weather or breathing in irritants such as strong perfumes, cleaning fumes or air pollution.</p>



<p>Usually, asthma is bad news when it comes to colds and flu. At the start of the pandemic, most experts predicted that coronavirus infections and asthma would be a dangerous mix, says Luke Bonser, a cell biologist at the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved in the study. And that is true for people whose asthma is not triggered by allergies and those with related lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Those conditions put people at high risk for severe COVID-19.</p>



<p>But as the pandemic progressed, researchers noticed that people with allergic asthma weren’t developing severe COVID-19 as often as expected. Here’s a look at why that may be.</p>



<h3>Protein protection</h3>



<p>What sets allergic asthma apart from other types of asthma and COPD is a protein called interleukin-13, or IL-13.</p>



<p>Usually, IL-13 helps the body fight off parasites such as worms. Certain T cells pump out the protein, and the body responds by churning out sticky mucus and constricting airways. This traps the worms, holding them in place until other immune system cells can come in for the kill.</p>



<p>“In the case of [allergic] asthma, the body is making a mistake. It’s mistaking a harmless substance, like pollen, for a worm,” says Burton Dickey, a pulmonologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston who was not involved in the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But it wasn’t clear how IL-13 was protecting people with allergic asthma from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To find out, pathophysiologist Camille Ehre of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill and colleagues grew cells from the lining of the airways from six lung donors. Some of the cells were treated with IL-13 to mimic allergic asthma. Then the researchers infected some of the cells with SARS-CoV-2.</p>



<h3>Lawn trouble</h3>



<p>Next on the list of to-dos was to compare how cells that haven’t been treated with IL-13 behave when healthy and when infected with the coronavirus.</p>



<p>Uninfected cells grew in lawns resembling lush grasslands, where the tufts of waving fronds are actually hairlike protrusions called cilia, which grow from the tops of airway-lining cells, the team confirmed. Cilia’s motions help move mucus, and anything stuck in the mucus, out of the lungs.</p>

<p>Cells infected with the coronavirus looked much different. The lush lawn was now slathered in mucus, and bald spots appeared as infected cells died. The doomed cells get squeezed out of the lawn of cilia and inflate like a balloon. The inflation happens partly because chambers called vacuoles inside the infected cells get clogged with viruses. “It’s just filled with viruses, and then it gets kicked out of the club and it blows up and releases all these viruses,” Dickey says.</p>

<p>But not all the cells in the infected lawn were affected equally. Looking at the cells from the side, researchers could see that cells sporting cilia were infected with the coronavirus. But mucus-producing cells called goblet cells, which don’t have cilia, were rarely infected. That may be because a protein called ACE2 decorates the surface of ciliated cells far more often than it does goblet cells. ACE2 is the protein that the coronavirus uses as a door into cells.</p>

<h3>A sticky solution</h3>



<p>When researchers doused the cells with IL-13 before adding the coronavirus, the results were strikingly different.</p>



<p>The lawn of waving cilia atop the treated cells was mostly intact, with far fewer balloons of dying cells rising above the surface. But the fronds didn’t wave as vigorously as in untreated cells. That’s because IL-13 reduces cilia beating, the researchers found. &nbsp;Less active cilia could mean that virus-laden mucus sticks around longer. “That can be a double-edged sword inside the lungs because you want to clear the mucus, but you don’t want to spread it around,” Ehre says.</p>

<p>Counting cells under the microscope, the researchers saw that far fewer of the infected cells treated with IL-3 got the heave-ho. Whereas the untreated cells had ejected about 700 of their own by about four days after infection, only about 100 treated cells had gotten kicked out. The images showed that IL-13 really was protecting cells from infection. But how was still an unanswered question.</p>



<p>One thing that IL-13 does is stimulate airway-lining cells to churn out a type of sticky mucus that can trap viruses before they can infect cells. The team found that untreated cells released a burst of the mucus shortly after being infected with the coronavirus, depleting stores of the sticky stuff. But cells treated with IL-13 were still well-stocked with mucus.</p>

<p>All that extra mucus from the treated cells could ensnare viruses and expel them from the lungs before much damage is done. But people with nonallergic asthma and COPD make plenty of mucus too, and they aren’t protected from the virus. So Ehre and colleagues stripped away the mucus to see how the airway cells fared without this phlegmy trap.</p>



<p>Even without the mucus, IL-13 was still protective.</p>



<h3>Barricading the doors</h3>



<p>Examining patterns of gene activity, the team found that IL-13 was also causing cells to make less ACE2, the protein that SARS-CoV-2 commandeers as a gateway into cells. “It makes it much harder for the virus to find its door to enter the cells,” Ehre says.</p>



<p>That result agrees with previous findings from Bonser and colleagues. “Being able to replicate the same data in several different studies, that’s great,” he says. And the new study looks more closely into IL-13’s protective mechanism than previous research did.</p>



<p>Cells treated with IL-13 also turn down the activity of genes involved in making protein-producing factories called ribosomes, the researchers discovered. That may limit viral replication in cells. But some genes’ activity was also turned way up. That includes several genes involved in making keratan sulfate, a long, sugar-studded protein that is found in cartilage and the eyes’ corneas. “It’s there in the body to make a shield,” Ehre says.</p>



<p>That seems to be what it is doing for airway cells too. A thick layer of keratan sulfate developed on top of cells treated with IL-13, armoring them against a coronavirus infection.</p>

<p>Which of these protective mechanisms is most important, or if it’s a combination of all of them, is one of the many things left to explore, Ehre says. “This paper is not the final paper that figures everything out. There is way more work to do.”</p>



<p>Knowing even more details about how IL-13 works to protect against the coronavirus could lead to new treatments, Bonser says. But IL-13 itself probably will not be used as a drug because of the inflammation, excess mucus, cough and shortness of breath it triggers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the extra protection doesn’t mean that people with allergic asthma don’t have to be concerned about getting COVID-19, Dickey says. “People with asthma have had very bad outcomes. This is not a virus you want to take chances with,” he says. But it’s OK to bask on the bright side a little. “It’s not fun to have asthma, so you have to be grateful for every rare occasion where it does something useful.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">Ancient zircons may record the dawn of plate tectonics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s crust may have gone on the move roughly 3.8 billion years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A change in the chemistry of ancient zircon crystals from different bygone eras <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021AV000520">may be the earliest hint of subduction</a>, the sliding of one tectonic plate under another, researchers report in the April <em>AGU Advances.</em> This shift may mark the first steps of processes that would evolve into modern <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">plate tectonics on Earth</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Before then, early Earth may have donned a relatively immobile “protocrust,” such as observed on Venus today, the team says.</p>



<p>“Earth is actually quite distinct to other planets, in that it has plate tectonics,” says study coauthor Nadja Drabon, a geochemist at Harvard University. “We’re trying to figure out, when did it become so special?”</p>





<p>Geologists have long debated what <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/remnants-earths-original-crust-preserve-time-plate-tectonics">Earth’s crust looked like during the Hadean Eon</a>, more than 4 billion years ago (<em>SN: 3/16/17</em>). One reason the debate has remained unresolved is that opportunities to investigate that distant past are scarce, as few rocks have survived the eons of tectonic activity.</p>



<p>But zircons — extremely resilient, bright gemstones — are renowned for their ability <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3-billion-year-old-crystals-hint-lost-continents-fate">to last for billions of years</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/17</em>). Geologists know this because they can reliably estimate zircon ages by measuring how much uranium and lead is in the crystal. Growing zircons readily capture uranium but tend to exclude lead, so any lead found in zircon is assumed to have decayed from uranium. Geologists know that decay rate, which is based on uranium’s half-life, so they can estimate the zircons’ age.</p>



<p>What’s more, zircons provide clues about the environments in which they formed, as their growing lattices of zirconium, silica and oxygen capture tiny amounts of other elements from their surroundings.</p>



<p>Most of the world’s Hadean zircons have been found in a just a dozen sites, and most of those are from a site in Australia. But since 2018, Drabon and her colleagues have reported on a new source: the Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains in South Africa. Dozens of zircons collected from that region crystallized between 4.15 to 4 billion years ago, while thousands of others are at least 3.3 billion years old. The findings have provided the researchers with a new, roughly 800-million-year window into the past, straddling the end of the Hadean and the beginning of the Archean Eon.</p>



<p>For the new study, the researchers peered through that window by checking the zircons for trace elements—uranium, scandium, ytterbium, niobium and cerium—and also for different forms of oxygen and hafnium.</p>



<p>Prior to 3.8 billion years ago, most of the zircons contained quantities of different forms of hafnium through time that supported the existence of an old, stable protocrust. What’s more, these older zircons contained trace elements at levels that were similar to those found in zircons from Hawaii’s volcanic hotspot. There, new rock is created as a plume of molten material rises from Earth’s mantle and crystallizes — a process that could have operated in the absence of moving plates.</p>



<p>But in the zircons that formed after 3.8 billion years ago, the researchers found no more evidence of a protocrust, and many of the zircons contained trace element signatures resembling those found today at subduction zones.</p>



<p>That’s a fundamental shift, says Jennifer Kasbohm, a geochronologist at Yale University who was not involved in the study. “We really consider subduction to be essential for plate tectonics.”</p>



<p>Previous analyses of zircons from other places, such as Australia and India, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14857-1">have reported similar compositions</a>, the researchers note, suggesting that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stop-and-go-plate-tectonics">an early form of plate tectonics</a> may have become widespread by around 3.8 billion years ago (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Moving forward, Drabon plans to investigate if other minerals were trapped inside the zircons during their formation. If so, those hitchhiking bits might open even more windows into Earth’s early tectonic history.</p>

<h4>Reflecting on our past</h4>



<p><em>During </em>Science News<em>’ early history, in the 1920s through ’60s, we shared and endorsed ideas that were unscientific, racist, sexist and morally wrong. In “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/past-science-news-coverage-racism-sexism">The darkness in our past</a>” (</em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 26<em>), the </em><strong>Science News <em>reckoning team</em> </strong><em>and <strong>senior staff</strong> apologized for these past prejudices and vowed to hold ourselves accountable moving forward.</em></p>



<p>Many readers commended <em>Science News</em> for doing this work. “I can’t thank you enough for [this] excellent and insightful article,” reader <strong>Kirsten Muir</strong> wrote. “It is sobering to read, but enormously appreciated in light of your different attitude today and ongoing scientific rigor. It is important for you to have been open and transparent about your past, and I greatly respect and admire you for it.”</p>





<p>The article made reader <strong>Roberta Riggs</strong>, who grew up in the 1950s and ’60s, reflect on the social and cultural transformations she has experienced during her lifetime. “I really appreciate the fact that you showed honest grief for stepping over the line,” <strong>Riggs </strong>wrote. “Change is a hard thing to do. But I have changed, hopefully for the better. I have changed my opinion on a great many things, and a lot of that, I believe, is because of the articles I have read in your magazine.… Since we cannot go backward, we must do what we can now, for today and every day that we have as we live out our lives.”</p>

<h3>Happy 100th birthday to us!</h3>



<p>Across a century of journalism, <em>Science News</em> has shined a light on all corners of science, from the Scopes trial to the atomic bomb, <strong>Maria Temming</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-journalism-history-century-birthday">100 years of <em>Science News</em></a>” (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 16</em>). Readers joined the centennial celebration on social media. Twitter user <strong>@ZhangZine </strong>wrote: “Congratulations! I hope that <em>Science News</em> will provide us with more timely news about science and contribute to humans’ science development.”</p>

<h4>Crater questions</h4>



<p><em>A space rock probably about 4 to 5.4 kilometers wide crashed into Earth about 280 million years ago, and material blasted from that impact may have created a bevy of secondary craters, <strong>Sid Perkins</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crater-ancient-asteroid-meteorite-impact-earth">Impact caused a cascade of craters</a>” (</em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Anne Wolfe </strong>wondered how the ancient space rock’s size compares with others in space, and whether it traveled alone.</p>



<p>Much bigger asteroids exist in the asteroid belt. But of the more than 28,000 known asteroids near Earth, only about 900 are at least 1 kilometer wide, says planetary scientist <strong>Thomas Kenkmann</strong> of the University of Freiburg in Germany. On average, a space rock several kilometers in diameter hits Earth about once every several million years, making it a rare event, he says. Although some asteroids have satellites or companions, it’s unclear whether the rock that struck Earth about 280&nbsp;million years ago was traveling solo.</p>



<p><strong>Wolfe</strong> also wondered in what other ways the primary impact affected the environment.</p>



<p>The blast wave generated by the impact would have devastated areas within a few hundred kilometers of the crash, <strong>Kenkmann</strong> says. In addition, heat from the impact most likely burned everything within that same radius.</p>



<h4>Parched plants</h4>



<p><em>South Africa’s fynbos plants use their long, thin roots to commandeer soil nutrients and keep adjacent forest from encroaching on fynbos territory, <strong>Jake Buehler </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-fynbos-plants-roots-long-thin-nutrients">African shrubs weaponize skinny roots</a>” (</em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 10<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Wendy</strong> asked whether fynbos roots also take up water from soil faster than the nearby forest plants.</p>



<p>Thin roots are generally more efficient than thicker roots, such as those of forest trees, at absorbing water from soil within a small window of time, says ecologist <strong>Mingzhen Lu</strong> of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. But thick roots live longer. In forests’ more stable soil environment, where moisture fluctuates less dramatically compared with fynbos soils, thick roots would be able to provide forest species a steady flow of water, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changing-climate-means-changes-on-plate">A changing climate means changes on the plate</a></h4>

              
                <p>Food has always been complicated, not the least because we can’t live without it. Throughout human history, the hunt for food has fueled migration, war and exploration. Changing tastes in food can change history. Europeans came upon the Americas while trying to break the Ottoman Empire’s monopoly on the spice trade. And Europeans’ yen for sugar in the 17th century sparked the development of Caribbean sugar plantations and the transatlantic trade of enslaved people.</p>



<p>In this issue, we consider the future of food through the lens of climate change. Currently, one-third of human-caused global greenhouse gas emissions are related to food. And there’s growing focus on how to shrink food’s climate footprint.</p>



<p>Agriculture is one big opportunity. In India, experiments in climate-smart agriculture include planting trees that boost soil nutrients and keep carbon out of the atmosphere. Freelance writer Sibi Arasu talked with Pravinbhai Parmar, a farmer in the state of Gujarat who switched from using diesel fuel to electricity from solar panels to pump irrigation water. He no longer has to pay for diesel and has income from selling excess electricity. Around the world, people are identifying foods that can thrive despite increasingly volatile weather, such as millet and Bambara groundnuts, our intern Anna Gibbs reports.</p>





<p>But as you might imagine, the calculus on food and climate gets complicated quickly. Six economies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-emissions-data-diet-carbon-greenhouse-gas-climate-agriculture">contribute more than half of Earth’s food-related greenhouse gases</a>, according to reporting by freelancer Betsy Ladyzhets. But the sources of those emissions vary widely. China and India are high emitters largely due to their big populations, while bulldozing forests to clear land for farming is a big driver in Brazil and Indonesia. And in Europe and the United States, it’s our penchant for meat-heavy meals and reliance on industrial-scale farming, which is dependent on fossil fuels and chemicals.</p>



<p>Not all efforts to make for a greener food system require changing the habits of entire countries, continents or global industries. Individuals like me who appreciate a good burger every now and then will be heartened to learn that dining meat-free one day a week takes a bite out of greenhouse gas production. Other changes, such as eating vegan for two out of three meals a day, can have an even bigger impact. So I could have my occasional burger and help the planet, too.</p>



<p>I grew up in the Midwest. Each fall, my family stocked the freezer with a side of beef and a side of pork to get us through the winter. But we also grew vegetables and put them by. Over the years, I have found myself enjoying vegetables more and craving meat less, and I’m sure I’m not alone. Given that food is so entwined with culture, family and identity, researchers are keenly interested in how cultural and personal food preferences can change, as social sciences writer Sujata Gupta reports. Sometimes it’s as simple as being more inclusive: For many, “flexitarian” sounds much less restrictive than “vegetarian.”</p>

Nostalgic love can only survive in a long-distance relationship. A cinematic image of nostalgia is a double exposure, or a superimposition of two images—of home and abroad, of past and present, of dream and everyday life. The moment we try to force it into a single image, it breaks the frame or burns the surface.”<br /><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">–Svetlana Boym, <a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/the-uses-of-the-past/articles/nostalgia-and-its-discontents" target="_blank"><i>Nostalgia and Its Discontents</i></a></span></p></blockquote><br /><p></p><p>Nostalgia means different things to different groups of scholars. To historians, nostalgia is bad, “...essentially history without guilt ... an abdication of personal responsibility, a guilt-free homecoming, an ethical and aesthetic failure” (<a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/the-uses-of-the-past/articles/nostalgia-and-its-discontents" target="_blank">Boym, 2007</a>). To social psychologists, nostalgia is good, “a meaning-providing resource [that] may serve an existential function” by helping us avoid thoughts of death (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103106001661" target="_blank">Routledge et al., 2008</a>). <br /></p><p>To cognitive neuroscience types, nostalgia is encapsulated in an fMRI experiment that compares brain responses to pictures of “nostalgic” objects (from childhood) vs. contemporary objects (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91322-z" target="_blank">Yang et al., 2021</a>).<span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span><br /><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDhKD3WJY5DiGJHhL_oYxUAX5hJFtWRXKuNu5UEHfgQ2LTH8KF3gD-Db8kK58fbBmL9_Lr2Tq1veP0vl0bdL4SHwlO8uARxFeTl2qWZE9oEJRnC7JV0n4i1_IiWK7cFzJjjLvvRrOs_gV3rsPymo1FqiYVtKGjTEMn_racJEWraLqFw1-f9w/s864/nostalgic%20chewing%20gum.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="346" data-original-width="864" height="160" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDhKD3WJY5DiGJHhL_oYxUAX5hJFtWRXKuNu5UEHfgQ2LTH8KF3gD-Db8kK58fbBmL9_Lr2Tq1veP0vl0bdL4SHwlO8uARxFeTl2qWZE9oEJRnC7JV0n4i1_IiWK7cFzJjjLvvRrOs_gV3rsPymo1FqiYVtKGjTEMn_racJEWraLqFw1-f9w/w400-h160/nostalgic%20chewing%20gum.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><p></p><p>In this post, my authority on cultural nostalgia is Svetlana Boym, who was the <a href="https://faculty.slavic.fas.harvard.edu/svetlana-boym/home" target="_blank">Curt Hugo Reisinger Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literatures</a> at Harvard, a Russian <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">émigré,</span></span> and an <a href="https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~boym/main.htm" target="_blank">extraordinary</a> thinker, writer, cultural theorist, and photographer. Her 2007 essay was adapted from her influential book, <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/svetlana-boym/the-future-of-nostalgia/9780465007080/" target="_blank"><i>The Future of Nostalgia</i></a> (2001). She viewed nostalgia as a manifestation of collective memory and longing, with two contrasting types. Reflective nostalgia is exemplified by the displacement of immigrants, who may long for a home that no longer exists (or perhaps never existed). Restorative nostalgia, on the other hand, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally" target="_blank">dangerous impulse</a> to return to a “pure” (or nationalistic) state of a distant past. Is it fair for psychologists to consider nostalgia as a private reminiscence devoid of a larger context?</p><p><br /></p><p><b>A Blast from the Past</b><br /></p><p>The reconciliation between these different views of nostalgia used to be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7965609/" target="_blank">terror management theory</a> (TMT). In this theory, reminders of death (mortality salience) increase in-group favoritism and defense of one's own world view as a way to assuage existential fear. Thus, restorative nostalgia might be seen in the light (or darkness) of TMT. Indeed, instructing participants to write about a nostalgic event lessened mortality salience (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103106001661" target="_blank">Routledge et al., 2008</a>). However, TMT has <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/8/1/35271/168050/Many-Labs-4-Failure-to-Replicate-Mortality" target="_blank">failed to replicate</a> in several large studies, so there goes that idea (i.e., the link between social psychology experiments and restorative nostalgia, not the concept of restorative nostalgia itself).<br /></p><br /><p><b>Escape from the Pandemic</b></p><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/01/20/pandemic-memory-covid-2020-2021-2022/" target="_blank">COVID memory vortex</a> altered our perception of time and space and warped the horizon of past and future. A restricted sense of the present (and the lack of new cultural output) caused <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2021/lol-amid-uncertain-times-consumers-take-comfort-in-nostalgic-comedy-shows/" target="_blank">TV nostalgia</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/music/2021/12/28/nostalgia-why-we-love-old-music/" target="_blank">musical nostalgia</a>:<br /></p><blockquote>Nostalgia became a default listening mode — and for me, the cumulative oldness felt distressingly new. The old problem with nostalgia was that it made it harder to imagine the future. The new problem with nostalgia was that it made it harder to experience the present.</blockquote><p>But wasn't this also a way to avoid ubiquitous thoughts of death and constant media coverage (and lived experience) of overwhelmed essential workers, illness, hospitalization, and relatives dying alone? Was there anything special about nostalgia, or would any absorbing distraction suffice?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">How I decided on a second COVID-19 booster shot</a></h4>

              
                <p>Booster shots against COVID-19 are once again on my mind. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that older people and immunocompromised people are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-second-booster-dose-two-covid-19-vaccines-older-and">eligible for a second booster shot</a> provided it has been at least four months since their last shot. After I got over the shock of the FDA calling me “older” — meaning anyone 50 and up — I’ve been pondering whether to get a second booster (otherwise known as a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine, or third dose of any vaccine if you initially got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine), and if so, when.</p>



<p>Peter, a 60-year-old acquaintance who asked me not to use his last name to protect his privacy, told me he’s going to get a second booster, but not now. He’s holding out for fall and hoping for a variant-specific version of the vaccine. Right now, he and his wife “are vaxxed out,” he says. And he worries that getting boosted too often could hurt his immune system’s ability to respond to new variants. “I just think it’s the law of diminishing returns,” he says.</p>



<p>Lots of scientists and policy makers are thinking about these issues, too. For instance, last week an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/live-mtg-2022-4-20.html">met to discuss boosters</a>. And a bevy of studies about how well boosters work and how they affect the immune system have come out in recent weeks, some of them peer-reviewed, some still preliminary.</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In making my own decision, I wanted to know several things. First, does a second booster really provide additional protection from the coronavirus beyond what I got from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-choose">my first booster</a> (<em>SN: 11/8/21</em>)? Second, are there downsides to getting boosted again? And finally, if I’m going to do it, when should that be and which vaccine will I get?</p>



<p>To get a handle on the first question, I need to know how much protection the first booster actually gave me. I’m not immunocompromised, so there’s no reason for me to get an antibody test to see if I have enough of those defenders to fend off the coronavirus. I just have to assume that my immune system is behaving normally and that what’s true for others in my age group also goes for me.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How long does COVID-19 booster immunity last?</h4>



<p>Although the exact numbers vary, several studies have found that a third dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gave higher levels of protection against the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">omicron variant</a> than two doses did (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>). But that protection wanes after a few months.</p>



<p>Data from Israel, where some people have been getting fourth doses for months, suggest that a second booster does indeed bolster protection, but again only temporarily. In health care workers who got a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202542">fourth dose, antibody levels shot up</a> above levels achieved after the third jab, researchers reported April 7 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Vaccine effectiveness against infection was 30 percent with the Pfizer shot and 11 percent with Moderna. Both were better at preventing symptomatic disease, with Pfizer weighing in at 43 percent and Moderna at 31 percent. But those who did get infected produced high levels of the virus, suggesting they were contagious to others.</p>



<p>In a separate study published in the same journal, researchers looking at people 60 and older found that a fourth dose gave protection against both infection and severe disease, but the<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201570"> protection against infection began to decline after about five weeks</a>.</p>



<p>There’s more data on protection against severe illness from a study of more than 11,000 people admitted for COVID-19 to a hospital or emergency department in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health care system. At nine months after the second shot, two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00101-1/fulltext">31 percent effective</a> at keeping people out of the emergency room with omicron, researchers reported April 22 in <em>Lancet Respiratory Medicine</em>. The shots were 41 percent effective at preventing more severe illness resulting in hospitalizations from the omicron variant.</p>



<p>The third dose (first booster) bumped the effectiveness way up to 85 percent against hospitalization and 77 percent against ER visits, the team found. But the effect was temporary. By three months after the booster, effectiveness had declined to 55 percent against hospitalization and 53 percent against emergency room visits. The same jump in protection and quick waning from the first booster has also been noted in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1046488/S1482_Warwick_Omicron_5_1_2022.pdf">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.13.22272308v1.full.pdf">Qatar</a>.</p>



<p>It’s been about six months since my first booster shot, so any extra protection I got from it is probably gone by now. But will a fourth dose restore protection?</p>



<p>The CDC calculates that for every million people 50 and older who get a fourth dose of vaccine, 830 hospitalizations, 183 intensive care unit admissions and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-04-20/05-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">85 deaths could be prevented</a>. Those are impressive numbers, but many people think efforts should be focused more on getting still-unvaccinated people immunized instead of worrying about additional shots for the already vaxxed. CDC’s numbers support that. Because unvaccinated people are so vulnerable to the coronavirus, you would need to vaccinate just 135 people aged 50 and older with two shots to prevent one hospitalization. But already vaccinated people still have quite a bit of immunity, so you’d need to vaccinate 1,205 older people with a fourth dose to prevent one hospitalization.</p>





<h4>How does my health factor in?</h4>



<p>Of course, that’s data concerning populations. I and millions of others are trying to make individual calculations. “People need to make decisions based on their health condition as well as their exposure levels,” says Prakash Nagarkatti, an immunologist at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia. For instance, people whose jobs or other activities put them in contact with lots of people have higher exposure risks than someone who works at home. People who are older or have underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or lung, kidney, liver and heart diseases are all at higher risk. Those people might benefit from a shot now. “But if you’re 50 to 60 and very healthy, I don’t know if you need it right away,” Nagarkatti says. “You could maybe wait a few months.”</p>



<p>I’ve got some health risks that may make me more likely to get severely ill, and I have a couple of big events coming up this summer where I could get exposed to the virus. So getting boosted now to get a little bump in immunity that should last for a few months seems like a good idea. I’m also basing that decision about when to get a booster on what’s happening with the virus.</p>



<p>Case counts in my county are on the upswing. Nationally, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#variant-proportions">BA.2.12.1, a potentially even wilier subvariant </a>of the already slippery BA.2 omicron variant, is on the rise, making up almost 29 percent of cases in the week ending April 23. South Africa is experiencing a rise in cases caused by the <a href="https://twitter.com/TWenseleers/status/1518673358845620225">omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5</a>. It could be the start of a fifth wave of infection in that country, something researchers thought wouldn’t happen because so many people there were previously infected and vaccinated, Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said April 26 in a news briefing. “It has the flavor of, ‘Here we go, again,’” he said. “So much for the idea of herd immunity.”</p>



<h4>Are there any downsides to a second booster?</h4>



<p>But would I be harming my immune system if I get a booster shot now? Previous experience with vaccines against other viruses suggests repeated boosting isn’t always a good thing, Galit Alter, codirector of the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research said in the news briefing. For instance, in one HIV vaccine trial, people were boosted six times with the same protein. Each time their antibody levels went up, but the researchers found that the immune system was making nonfunctional, unhelpful antibodies that blocked the action of good ones. So far, that hasn’t happened with the COVID-19 vaccines, but it could be important to space out doses to prevent such a scenario.</p>



<p>Another worry for immunologists is <a href="https://www.jimmunol.org/content/202/2/335">original antigenic sin</a>. That has nothing to do with apples, serpents and gardens. Instead it happens when the immune system sees a virus or portion of the virus for the first time and trains memory cells to make antibodies against the virus. The next time the person encounters the virus or another version of it, instead of adding to the antibody arsenal, it continues to make only those original antibodies.</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>With the coronavirus, though, “what’s happened is the opposite of antigenic sin,” says Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Rockefeller University in New York City. He and colleagues examined what happens to the immune response after a third dose of vaccine, focusing especially on very long-lived immune cells called memory B cells. Those <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04778-y">memory cells still made new antibodies</a> when they got a third look at the vaccine, Nussenzweig and colleagues reported April 21 in <em>Nature.</em> That wouldn’t happen if antigenic sin were a problem. And it’s great news since an ever-growing repertoire of antibodies may help defend against future variants.</p>



<p>A separate <em>Nature Immunology</em> study found that other immune cells called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01184-4">T cells also learn new tricks</a> after a booster dose or a breakthrough infection. Those and other studies seem to indicate that getting a booster isn’t bad for my immune system and could help me against future variants.</p>



<h4>Is it okay to mix and match COVID-19 booster shots?</h4>



<p>Now the question is, which booster to get? Mixing vaccines doesn’t seem to push the immune system toward making the unhelpful antibodies, Alter said. It “tantalizes the immune system with different flavors of vaccines, and seems to reawaken it,” she said. “Even mixing and matching mRNAs may be highly advantageous to the immune system.” She and colleagues found that the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abm2311">Moderna vaccine may make more IgA antibodies</a>, the type that help protect mucous membranes in the nose, mouth and other slick surfaces in the body from infection, than the Pfizer vaccine does. Pfizer’s makes more of the IgM and IgG antibodies that circulate in the blood, data published March 29 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em> show.</p>



<p>Since I got the Pfizer vaccine for my first three doses, it seems wise to shake things up with Moderna this time. I’ve already booked my shot.</p>



<p>As for Peter, after I laid out the evidence, he said he was convinced that he should probably get a shot now, as his doctor recommends. But he admitted he might just wait to see if Moderna comes out with an updated version of its vaccine.</p>



<p>What’s really needed, all the experts tell me, is to better understand how the immune system operates so researchers can build better vaccines with longer-lasting protection so we won’t be facing needles multiple times per year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-brightly-colored-feathers-heads-fossil-skull-soft-tissue">Pterosaurs may have had brightly colored feathers on their heads</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pterosaurs not only had feathers, but also were flamboyantly colorful, scientists say.</p>



<p>That could mean that feathers — and vibrant displays of mate-seeking plumage — may have originated as far back as the common ancestor of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, during the early Triassic Period around 250 million years ago.</p>



<p>Analyses of the partial skull of a 113-million-year-old pterosaur fossil revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04622-3">the flying reptile had two types of feathers</a>, paleontologist Aude Cincotta of University College Cork in Ireland and colleagues report April 20 in <em>Nature</em>. On its head, the creature, thought to be <em>Tupandactylus</em> <em>imperator</em>, had whiskerlike, single filaments and more complicated branching structures akin to those of modern bird feathers.</p>





<p>Because the fossil’s soft tissues were also well-preserved, the team identified a variety of different shapes of pigment-bearing melanosomes in both feathers and skin. Those shapes ranged from “very elongate cigar shapes to flattened platelike disks,” says Maria McNamara, a paleobiologist also at University College Cork.</p>



<p>Different melanosome shapes have been linked to different colors. Short, stubby spheroidal melanosomes are usually associated with yellow to reddish-brown colors, while the longer shapes are linked to darker colors, McNamara says.</p>



<p>The range of melanosome geometries found in this <em>Tupandactylus</em> specimen suggests that the creature may have been quite colorful, the team says. And that riot of color, in turn, hints that the feathers weren’t there just to keep the creatures warm, but may have been used for visual signaling, such as displays to attract a mate.</p>

Scale bars all represent 2 micrometers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3113247">A. Cincotta <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Scientists have wrangled over whether pterosaurs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Earth’s first true vertebrate flyers</a>, had true feathers, or whether their bodies were covered in something more primitive and hairlike, dubbed “pycnofibers” (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>). If the flying reptiles did have feathers, they weren’t needed for flying; pterosaurs had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-bat-wings-clumsy-evolution-flying-gliding">fibrous membranes stretched between</a> their long, tapering wings, much like modern bats (<em>SN: 10/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>In 2018, a team of researchers including McNamara reported that some of the fuzz covering two fossilized pterosaur specimens wasn’t just simple pycnofibers but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-reptile-pterosaur-fossils-fur-primitive-feathers">showed distinct, complex, branching patterns</a> similar to those seen in modern feathers (<em>SN: 12/21/18</em>). But some researchers have disputed this, saying that the branching observed in the fossils was an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01308-9">artifact of preservation</a>, the appearance of branching created by overlapping fibers.</p>



<p>The new pterosaur specimen has “turned all that on its head,” McNamara says. In this fossil, “it’s very clear. We see feathers that are separated, isolated — you can’t say it’s an overlap of structures.” The fossilized feathers show successive branches of consistent length, extending all the way along a feather’s shaft.</p>



<p>And though the previous pterosaur fossils described in 2018 did have some preserved melanosomes, those were “middle-of-the-road shapes, little short ovoids,” McNamara says. In <em>Tupandactylus</em>, “for the first time we see melanosomes of different geometries” in the feathers. That all adds up to bright, colorful plumage.</p>



<p>“To me, these fossils close the case. Pterosaurs really had feathers,” says Stephen Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study. “Not only were many famous dinosaurs actually big fluffballs,” he says, but so were many pterosaurs.</p>





<p>Many dinosaurs, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/feathered-dinosaurs-may-have-been-rule-not-exception">particularly theropod dinosaurs</a>, also had colorful feathers (<em>SN: 7/24/14</em>). What this study shows is that feathers aren’t merely a bird thing, or even just a dinosaur thing, but that feathers evolved even deeper in time, Brusatte adds. And, as pterosaurs had wing membranes for flying, their feathers must have served other purposes, such as for insulation and communication.</p>



<p>It’s possible that dinosaurs and pterosaurs evolved this colorful plumage independently, McNamara says. But the shared structural complexity of the pigments in both groups of reptiles makes it “much more likely that it was derived from a common ancestor in the early Triassic.”</p>



<p>“That’s a big new implication,” says Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England.</p>



<p>Benton, a coauthor on the 2018 paper, wrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01036-z">a separate commentary on the new study</a> in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. If feathers arose in a common ancestor, Benton says, that would push back the origin of feathers by about 100 million years, to roughly 250 million years ago.</p>



<p>And that might have other interesting implications, Benton writes. The early Triassic was a rough time for life on Earth; it was the aftermath of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">the mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian that killed off more than 90 percent of the planet’s species (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>). If feathers did evolve during that time, the insulating fuzz, as well as warm-bloodedness, may have been part of an early arms race between reptilian mammal ancestors called synapsids and the pterosaur-dinosaur ancestor.</p>

                <p class="has-text-align-left"><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Whether or not Donald Trump’s presidency actively increased prejudice or simply emboldened those who already held bigoted views was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/08/14/trump-and-racism-what-do-the-data-say/">frequently</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/trump-effect-an-experimental-investigation-of-the-emboldening-effect-of-racially-inflammatory-elite-communication/0335108B8E4AF36CBFFA1E45816C6143">debated</a> during his term. A new study looks more closely at prejudicial attitudes during the presidency, exploring the views of over 10,000 American citizens.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01287-2">The study</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour, </em>finds a complex picture. While prejudicial attitudes decreased among Trump’s opponents, his supporters showed an increase in prejudice — and this seems to be because they believed these views had become more socially acceptable.</p>



<span id="more-46116"></span>



<p>First, the researchers conducted a set of studies looking at attitudes towards Muslims. In 2014/2015, before Trump came into power, participants completed a scale measuring their levels of Islamophobia. Some also rated how ashamed, angry, guilty, and compassionate they felt towards a Muslim man who had been arrested by US forces and held in Guantanamo Bay prison. Then, two years later once Trump was in office, the participants repeated these measures and&nbsp; answered further questions about their political attitudes generally and support for Trump.</p>



<p>Participants did not, as a whole, increase or decrease in prejudice between the first and second survey. However, when the team looked at Trump supporters and opponents separately, this changed: supporters of Trump showed a significant increase in Islamophobia, while those opposed to Trump showed significant <em>decreases</em> in negativity towards Muslims. These findings were also replicated when participants read the story about the Muslim man imprisoned in a US military prison: Trump supporters reported significantly less concern for the man by the second survey.</p>



<p>Trump support was crucial here: this, rather than conservatism generally or membership of the Republican party, was the most important predictor of changes in prejudice. In fact, conservatives who opposed Trump did not display increases in prejudice.</p>



<p>The next set of studies looked at prejudice against African Americans, again surveying participants before and after Trump’s rise to power. The same patterns held: Trump support predicted increases in prejudice towards Black people, both in implicit and blatant forms. Trump supporters were more likely to agree with racist statements such as “Blacks are not as smart as Whites” by the second survey, for instance. And, again, this held when controlling for political conservatism more generally.</p>



<p>Data from a longitudinal study of American citizens conducted in 2016 and 2011 looked at prejudice against other minorities too. This data again showed that prejudice amongst Trump opponents decreased over this period, while supporters showed an increase in prejudice against some of these groups (for others, they didn’t show a significant increase but still didn’t show the <em>decrease</em> in bigotry seen in society on a broader scale).</p>



<p>What could account for these changes in prejudice? Shifts in social norms that occurred with the rise of Trump seem to be crucial. In a final set of studies looking at perception of other people’s attitudes, participants believed that Americans generally had become more critical of Muslims — something both Trump supporters and non-Trump supporters agreed on. And Trump supporters also reported that those they respected and admired in their own social group had become more critical of Muslims, too. In further experimental studies, the team found that leading people to believe that Trump supporters approved of his anti-immigrant rhetoric led Trump-supporting participants to express a greater degree of prejudice themselves.</p>



<p>While the earlier studies are merely correlational, these later studies provide evidence of some form of causation: that Trump supporters felt it was more acceptable to express prejudice after his election, and that this acceptance facilitated their own further expression. Creating social environments where such speech or action is not acceptable is, on a societal level, easier said than done — future research could look at ways to push back on hateful rhetoric even when it is being promoted by those in the public sphere.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-breed-individual-behavior-predictor-genetics">Dog breed is a surprisingly poor predictor of individual behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Turns out we may be unfairly stereotyping dogs.</p>



<p>Modern breeds are shaped around aesthetics: Chihuahuas’ batlike ears, poodles’ curly fur, dachshunds’ hot dog shape. But breeds are frequently associated with certain behaviors, too. For instance, the American Kennel Club describes border collies as “affectionate, smart, energetic” and beagles as “friendly, curious, merry.”</p>



<p>Now, genetic information from more than 2,000 dogs, paired with self-reported surveys from dog owners, indicates that a dog’s breed is a poor predictor of its behavior. On average, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0639">breed explains only 9 percent of the behavioral differences</a> between individual dogs, researchers report April 28 in <em>Science.</em></p>





<p>“Everybody was assuming that breed was predictive of behavior in dogs,” geneticist Elinor Karlsson of the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester said in an April 26 news briefing. But “that had never really been asked particularly well.”</p>



<p>Geneticists had asked the question before in different ways. One study in 2019 looked at whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-breed-behavior-genetics">genetics might explain collective variation between breeds</a> and found that genes could explain some of the differences between, say, poodles and chihuahuas (<em>SN: 10/1/19</em>). But Karlsson and her colleagues wanted to learn how much breed can predict variation in individual dogs’ behavior.</p>



<p>To study variation at the individual level, the team needed genetic and behavior data from a lot of dogs. So they developed <a href="https://darwinsark.org/">Darwin’s Ark</a>, an open-source database where more than 18,000 pet owners responded to surveys about their dog’s traits and behavior. The survey asked over 100 questions about observable behaviors, which the researchers grouped into eight “behavioral factors,” including human sociability (how comfortable a dog is around humans) and biddability (how responsive it is to commands).</p>



<p>The researchers also collected genetic data from 2,155 purebred and mixed-breed dogs, including 1,715 dogs from Darwin’s Ark whose owners sent in dog saliva swabs. The inclusion of mixed-breed dogs, or mutts, shed light on how ancestry affects behavior while removing the purebred stereotypes that could affect the way the dog is treated — and thus behaves.</p>



<p>Studying mutts also makes it easier to decouple traits from one another, says Kathleen Morrill, a geneticist in Karlsson’s lab. “And that means on an individual basis, you&#8217;re going to have a better shot at mapping a gene that is actually tied to the question you&#8217;re asking.”</p>



<p>Then the team combined the genetic and survey data for the individual dogs to identify genes associated with particular traits. The new study revealed that the most heritable behavioral factor for dogs is human sociability, and that motor patterns — such as howling and retrieving — are generally more heritable than other behaviors.</p>



<p>That makes sense, Kathryn Lord, an evolutionary canine biologist in Karlsson’s lab, said during the briefing. Before modern breeding started within the last couple hundred years or so, dogs were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/dog-dna-study-maps-breeds-across-world">selected for the functional roles</a> they could provide, such as hunting or herding (<em>SN: 4/26/17</em>). Today, these selections still show up in breed groups. For instance, herding dogs on average tend to be more biddable and interested in toys. It also follows that, within breed groups, individual breeds are more likely to display certain motor patterns: Retrievers, unsurprisingly, are more likely to retrieve.</p>



<p>Still, even though breed was associated with certain behaviors, it was not a reliable predictor of individual behavior. While retrievers are less likely to howl, some owners reported that their retrievers howled often; greyhounds rarely bury toys,&nbsp;except some do.</p>



<p>The research solidifies what people have observed: Dog breeds differ on average in behavior, but there&#8217;s a lot of variation within breeds, says Adam Boyko, a canine geneticist at Cornell University who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, size had even less of an effect — as in, virtually none — on an individual’s behavior, despite the yappiness commonly associated with small dogs. Boyko points out that small dogs may often behave worse than large dogs, but rather than that being built into their genetics, “I think it&#8217;s that we typically tolerate poor behavior more in small dogs than we do in big dogs.”</p>



<p>As a dog trainer, Curtis Kelley of Pet Parent Allies in Philadelphia says that he meets a dog where it’s at. “Dogs are as individual as people are,” he says. Breed gives a loose guideline for what kind of behaviors to expect,&nbsp;“but it’s certainly not a hard-and-fast rule.”</p>



<p>If a person is looking to buy a dog, he says, they shouldn’t put too much stock in the dog’s breed. Even within a litter, dogs can show very different personalities. “A puppy will show you who they are at eight weeks old,” Kelley says. “It&#8217;s just our job to believe them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mom-voice-kid-brain-teen-neuroscience">Mom’s voice holds a special place in kids’ brains. That changes for teens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Young kids’ brains are especially tuned to their mothers’ voices. Teenagers’ brains, in their typical rebellious glory, are most decidedly not.</p>



<p>That conclusion, described April 28 in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em>, may seem laughably obvious to parents of teenagers, including neuroscientist Daniel Abrams of Stanford University School of Medicine. “I have two teenaged boys myself, and it’s a kind of funny result,” he says.</p>



<p>But the finding may reflect something much deeper than a punch line. As kids grow up and expand their social connections beyond their family, their brains need to be attuned to that growing world. “Just as an infant is tuned into a mom, adolescents have this whole other class of sounds and voices that they need to tune into,” Abrams says.</p>





<p>He and his colleagues scanned the brains of 7- to 16-year-olds as they heard the voices of either their mothers or unfamiliar women. To simplify the experiment down to just the sound of a voice, the words were gibberish: teebudieshawlt, keebudieshawlt and peebudieshawlt. As the children and teenagers listened, certain parts of their brains became active.</p>



<p>Previous experiments by Abrams and his colleagues have shown that certain regions of the brains of kids ages 7 to 12 — particularly those parts involved in detecting rewards and paying attention — respond more strongly to mom’s voice than to a voice of an unknown woman. “In adolescence, we show the exact opposite of that,” Abrams says.</p>



<p>In these same brain regions in teens, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2018-21.2022">unfamiliar voices elicited greater responses</a> than the voices of their own dear mothers. The shift from mother to other seems to happen between ages 13 and 14.</p>



<p>It’s not that these adolescent brain areas stop responding to mom, Abrams says. Rather, the unfamiliar voices become more rewarding and worthy of attention.</p>



<p>And that’s exactly how it should be, Abrams says. Exploring new people and situations is a hallmark of adolescence. “What we’re seeing here is just purely a reflection of this phenomenon.”</p>



<p>Voices can carry powerful signals. When stressed-out girls heard their moms’ voices on the phone, the girls’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moms-talk-daughters-hormones-listen">stress hormones dropped</a>, biological anthropologist Leslie Seltzer of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and colleagues found in 2011 (<em>SN: 8/12/11</em>). The same was not true for texts from their mothers.</p>



<p>The current results support the idea that the brain changes to reflect new needs that come with time and experience, Seltzer says. “As we mature, our survival depends less and less on maternal support and more on our group affiliations with peers.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear how universal this neural shift is. The finding might change across various mother-child relationships, including those that have different parenting styles, or even a history of neglect or abuse, Seltzer says.</p>



<p>So while teenagers and parents may sometimes feel frustrated by missed messages, take heart, Abrams says. “This is the way the brain is wired, and there’s a good reason for it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jogger-running-speed-pace-energy">Joggers naturally pace themselves to conserve energy even on short runs</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many recreational runners, taking a jog is a fun way to stay fit and burn calories. But it turns out an individual has a tendency to settle into the same, comfortable pace on short and long runs — and that pace is the one that minimizes their body’s energy use over a given distance.</p>



<p>“I was really surprised,” says Jessica Selinger, a biomechanist at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “Intuitively, I would have thought people run faster at shorter distances and slow their pace at longer distances.”</p>



<p>Selinger and colleagues <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00563-2">combined data from more than 4,600 runners</a>, who went on 37,201 runs while wearing a fitness device called the Lumo Run, with lab-based physiology data. The analysis, described April 28 in <em>Current Biology</em>, also shows that it takes more energy for someone to run a given distance if they run faster or slower than their optimum speed.</p>





<p>“There is a speed that for you is going to feel the best,” Selinger says. “That speed is the one where you&#8217;re actually burning fewer calories.”</p>



<p>The runners ranged in age from 16 to 83, and had body mass indices spanning from 14.3 to 45.4. But no matter participants’ age, weight or sex — or whether they ran only a narrow range of distances or runs of varying lengths — the same pattern showed up in the data repeatedly.</p>



<p>Researchers have thought that running was performance-driven, says Melissa Thompson, a biomechanist at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., who was not involved in the new study. This new research, she says, is “talking about preference, not performance.”</p>



<p>Most related research, Selinger says, has been done in university laboratories, with study subjects who are generally younger and healthier than the general population. By using wearable devices, the researchers could track many more runs, across more real-life conditions than is possible in a lab. That allowed the scientists to look at a “much broader cross section of humanity,” she says. Treadmill tests measuring energy use at different paces with people representative of those included in the fitness tracker data were used to determine optimum energy-efficient speeds.</p>



<p>Because the study includes a wide range of conditions and doesn’t control for things like fasting before running, it’s messier than data gathered in labs. Still, the sheer volume of real-world runs recorded by the wearable devices supports a convincing general rule about how humans run, says Rodger Kram, a physiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder not involved with the study. “I think the rule’s right.”</p>



<p>The results don’t apply to very long runs when fatigue starts to set in, or to race performance by elite athletes or others consciously training for speed. And a runner’s optimum pace can change over time, with training or age for instance.</p>



<p>There are quick tricks for those who want to speed up and go for a little more calorie burn to temporarily trump their body’s natural inclinations: Listen to upbeat music or jog alongside someone with a faster pace, Selinger says. “But it seems like your preference is actually to sink back into that optimum.”</p>



<p>The results match observations of optimum pacing from animals like horses and wildebeests, and also correspond to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-adjust-walking-style-energy-efficiency">the way humans tend to walk</a> at a speed that minimizes their individual energy use (<em>SN: 9/10/15</em>).</p>



<p>It does make sense that humans would be adapted to run at an optimum speed for minimizing energy use, says coauthor Scott Delp, a biomechanist at Stanford University. Imagine being an early human ancestor going out to hunt difficult prey. “It might be days before I get my next food,” he says. “So I want to spend the least energy en route to getting that food.”</p>

<p><strong>Cyclic AMP and psoriasis —</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/biological-sciences-4"><em>Science News</em></a>, April 29, 1972</p>



<p>[A team of dermatologists] discovered that cyclic AMP levels in psoriasis lesions are significantly lower than in healthy skin.… [The team] is now trying to find out if the cyclic AMP deficiency causes psoriasis and to develop a medication to increase cyclic AMP levels in psoriasis lesions.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Psoriasis, which affects 2 to 3 percent of the global population, is an inflammatory skin disease marked by red, scaly patches that itch or burn. Low levels of cyclic AMP — a chemical messenger key to cellular communication — haven’t been found to cause the disease. Psoriasis stems from an overactive immune response. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27883001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyclic AMP is just one player</a> alongside other chemical messengers and immune cells, and certain gene variants can make a person more susceptible. The choice among a range of treatment options today depends in part on the severity of the disease and the areas of the body affected. One drug, called apremilast, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014, increases levels of cyclic AMP, among other actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/27/extraverts-are-considered-to-be-poorer-listeners/">Extraverts are considered to be poorer listeners</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Extraverts are hugely sociable — they really care about their relationships, and possess outstanding social skills. Well, that’s how extraverts are generally portrayed. But, according to new work, that’s not exactly how other people see them. In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211072815?journalCode=pspc">series of studies</a> reported in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, Francis J. Flynn at Stanford University, US and colleagues consistently found that more extraverted people are considered to be <em>poorer</em> listeners. Their research also reveals a likely reason why.</p>



<span id="more-46094"></span>



<p>There is no academic consensus on what constitutes &#8220;good&#8221; listening. But, in line with some other researchers, the team conceptualises it as involving emotion-related processes (showing empathy, for example, and emotional engagement with what the other person is saying), cognitive processes (paying attention to and comprehending what they’re saying) and also behavioural processes (such as nodding and asking questions). In everyday life, it’s not necessarily easy to ascertain whether the person we’re talking to is really listening, however. They might be making plenty of eye contact, for example (which would suggest engagement), but it’s always possible that they’re just pretending to be listening well, in a bid to make a good impression. In this research, the team focused on only the participants’ <em>perceptions</em> of others’ listening skills.</p>



<p>In a preliminary study, 147 first-year business students, who met weekly in groups of six to work on leadership skills, rated the listening skills of everyone else in their group (rating how much that person seemed to listen while they spoke, and later remembered what they’d said, for example). The participants then completed a scale that assessed their own extraversion. The team found that those with higher self-reported extraversion got poorer marks for listening.</p>



<p>However, in this study, people’s perceptions could have been influenced by the actual social relationships they had with other members of their group. So in almost all of the subsequent studies, fresh groups of participants rated the listening skills of fictional people who were described as falling at various points on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Results from these studies supported the preliminary finding. Time and again, extraverted people were rated as being poorer listeners in social situations. As the team writes: “That is, despite the tendency for people to see extroverts as highly sociable, they tend to see this sociability as highly one-sided.”</p>



<p>An online study of 337 US-based adults suggested why this might be. Fictional people who were portrayed as highly extraverted were also perceived to be better at controlling and modifying how they come across to others. “To observers, this signal of malleable self-presentation suggests that extraverts are more interested in ‘looking the part’ than attending to what others have to say,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Are extraverts <em>actually</em> poorer listeners? Only further research will tell. But the team cautions that such work will be tricky to do, because of the difficulties in objectively evaluating listening. In any case, they add, the lack of objective information on a conversational partner’s listening means that we rely heavily on our pre-existing assumptions as well as limited behavioural cues. “Thus, although it might be an interesting exercise to test the validity of the lay belief that extraverts are worse listeners, it might not matter much. Instead, people may continue to rely on their lay beliefs to judge whether the other person is listening or merely pretending to listen.”</p>



<p>It would be really interesting, though, to see work on the real-world implications of this particular belief. “For example, listening has been identified as the ‘holy grail’ in sales roles,” the team notes — so perhaps it would be wise for highly extraverted sales people to try to modify their behaviour with clients. One important note is that of course that these findings are on US adults — they may not hold in other countries in which extraversion is either less or more socially desirable.</p>



<p>Still, for these assorted US participants, evidence for the belief that extraverts are worse listeners was found across the experiments. A vast amount of research has been done on extraversion itself. “Our findings contribute to the study of extraversion by examining <em>how people think about extraversion,</em>” the researchers write (their italics). And for understanding conversations and relationships, which of course are two-way, that’s clearly important, too.</p>
