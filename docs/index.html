              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-dog-infection-animal-spillover">The first known monkeypox infection in a pet dog hints at spillover risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first recorded case of person passing monkeypox to a dog could be harbinger of other animals catching the sometimes disfiguring and deadly virus. If that happens, monkeypox could establish animal reservoirs outside of Africa for the first time.</p>



<p>Two men in France appear to have <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01487-8/fulltext#%20">spread monkeypox to their Italian greyhound</a>, researchers report August 10 in the <em>Lancet</em>. The men reported letting the dog sleep in bed with them.</p>



<p>Monkeypox can spread through skin-to-skin contact, such as the intimate contact that happens during sex. Even more casual contact such as <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1191_article">dancing in close confines</a> can spread the virus, an Aug. 15 study in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> suggests. So can contact with objects an infected person has used, including bedding and clothing. Infectious monkeypox viruses <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1047_article">linger more often on such soft, porous materials</a> than on hard surfaces, researchers report August 11 in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>. Some 60 percent of soft goods and 5 percent of hard surfaces tested still carried viable virus for at least 15 days, the team found. &nbsp;</p>





<p>In the case of the dog, the animal developed pustules about 12 days after its owners reported symptoms. Viral DNA from one of the men matched that from the dog, suggesting that the human had given monkeypox to an animal.</p>



<p>Usually monkeypox goes the other way, from animals — especially rodents in some parts of Africa — to people in “spillover,” or zoonotic, infections. “This is a classic case of reverse zoonoses,” or spillback, in which a viral disease hops from humans back into animals, says Grant McFadden, a pox virologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>Such spillback events are fairly common with other viruses; people are known to have given COVID-19 to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-dog-pet-hong-kong-infection">dogs</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-animals-pets-coronavirus-covid19">cats</a> and zoo animals, for instance (<em>SN: 3/5/20; SN: 3/31/20</em>). Some pox viruses, including cowpox, can infect a wide range of species, while others like smallpox and a rabbit pox virus called myxoma virus can infect only one or a few species.</p>



<p>How widely monkeypox can spread among nonrodent animal species isn’t known. Researchers have documented that the virus can infect 51 species, including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/veterinarian/monkeypox-in-animals.html#table">apes and monkeys</a>, and other animals including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7823380/">anteaters, porcupines and opossums</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, monkeypox is endemic in some parts of Africa. But some scientists worry that the global outbreak, which has <a href="https://extranet.who.int/publicemergency">infected more than 36,000 people</a> so far, creates more chances for the virus to jump from humans to animals. If that happens, the virus could become established in animal populations around the world, setting up new reservoirs that could cause repeated infections in humans and animals.</p>



<p>Preliminary research suggests that monkeypox may be able to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.13.503846v1?ct=">infect two to four times more species</a> than previously thought, researchers from the University of Liverpool in England report August 15 in a preprint on bioRxiv.org. The team used machine learning trained to consider the genetic makeup of the virus, the number of species of animals in a genus known to be infected by pox viruses, diet composition of potential hosts, where the animals live and other factors that could contribute to a species becoming a new host for monkeypox, says virologist Marcus Blagrove.</p>



<p>About 80 percent of the potential new hosts for monkeypox are rodents or primates, the researchers predict. But domestic animals like dogs and cats were also predicted to be susceptible to infection. The researchers didn’t know about the case of the dog in France when they made the prediction, Blagrove says, so the report of the canine infection “was a quite nice validation that the method works.”</p>



<p>Red foxes and brown rats are two potential monkeypox hosts that the researchers say are particularly worrisome. Foxes (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) scavenge from garbage, which could bring them in contact with monkeypox-contaminated items. Brown rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) are already known hosts for cowpox. They are common in sewers in Europe and could get infected through feces containing monkeypox. Though the study emphasized the risk in Europe, where more than half the monkeypox cases in people in the current outbreak have been reported, the findings could be applicable more widely. Brown rats are found on <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Rattus_norvegicus/">every continent except Antarctica</a>. Red <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Vulpes_vulpes/">foxes roam much of the Northern Hemisphere</a>, including North and Central America, Europe, Northern Africa and parts of Asia.</p>

<p>The study also names three European rodents that could become reservoir species. The herb field mouse (<em>Apodemus uralensis</em>), yellow-necked field mouse (<em>Apodemus flavicollis</em>) and Alpine marmot (<em>Marmota marmota</em>) all have pockets of big populations that could be ideal for passing the virus around.</p>



<p>“These are examples of wild animals that might be a reservoir. We can’t say for certain, but they might be susceptible,” Blagrove says. Those species along with foxes and brown rats should be regularly surveyed for monkeypox to prevent new reservoirs from being established, he says.</p>



<p>But just because an animal can get infected with monkeypox doesn’t mean they can pass it on. “There is a difference between accidental hosts and a reservoir,” says Giliane de Souza Trindade, a pox virologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Accidental hosts are often dead ends for the virus. A true reservoir species must be able to pass the virus from animal to animal, and then sometimes to humans they encounter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If dogs can easily get monkeypox, they may be able to pass it to humans, other dogs or other animals through feces or saliva, Trindade says. Domestic animals that live with people who get monkeypox should be isolated from sick people and from other animals outside the home, she says.</p>



<p>Trindade and her colleagues are preparing to study pets of people who have monkeypox to see whether the virus passes easily to cats and dogs, she says. But she is more worried about live animal markets. “Animals are in cages very close together and people are passing by all the time.” Such settings are ripe for transmitting viruses between species. The COVID-19 pandemic probably got its <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715">start at a live animal market</a> in Wuhan, China, researchers reported July 26 in <em>Science</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>McFadden stresses that the dog’s case is still an isolated report. “We don’t know is this a rare thing or have we just not paid attention to it?” For now, he says, efforts should be focused on containing the outbreak among humans. While people with monkeypox should take care not to pass the virus to their pets, this case shouldn’t cause undue worry, he says. “We’re not at the panic button stage just yet.”</p>



<p>Scientists are also still learning how monkeypox spreads among people. Some people may <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-2183">have monkeypox, but not develop symptoms</a>, researchers report August 16 in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. It’s not known whether asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others, but if they can, vaccinating close contacts of symptomatic people may not be enough to contain the outbreak, the researchers warn.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-charm-quark-up-down-particle-physics">Protons contain intrinsic charm quarks, a new study suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons may be intrinsically charming.</p>



<p>The subatomic particles are a mash-up of three lighter particles called quarks: two of the type known as up quarks and one down quark. But physicists have speculated for decades that protons may also host more massive quarks, called “intrinsic” charm quarks. A new analysis <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04998-2">supports that idea</a>, physicists report in the Aug. 18 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Charm quarks are much heavier than up or down quarks. So heavy that, mind-bendingly, “you can have a component of the proton which is heavier than the proton itself,” says theoretical physicist Juan Rojo of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>





<p>Rojo and colleagues combined a variety of experimental results and theoretical calculations in hopes of unveiling the proton’s hypothetical charm. Measuring this feature is key to fully understanding one of the most important particles in the universe, Rojo says.</p>



<p>Physicists know that the more deeply you probe a proton, the more complicated it appears. When observed at very high energies, as in collisions at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva, protons contain a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">motley crew</a> of transient quarks and their antimatter counterparts, antiquarks (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>). Such “extrinsic” quarks are created when gluons, particles that help “glue” the quarks together inside protons, split into quark-antiquark pairs.</p>



<p>Extrinsic quarks aren’t fundamental to the identity of the proton. They’re simply a result of how gluons behave at high energies. But charm quarks might exist inside protons even at low energies, in a more persistent, deep-seated form.</p>



<p>In quantum physics, particles don’t take on a definite state until they’re measured — they are instead described by probabilities. If protons contain intrinsic charm, there’d be a small probability to find within a proton not only two up quarks and a down quark, but also a charm quark and antiquark. Since protons aren’t well-defined collections of individual particles, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-mass-quarks-calculation">proton’s mass</a> isn’t a simple sum of its parts (<em>SN: 11/26/18</em>). The small probability means that the full mass of the charm quark and antiquark isn’t added to the proton’s heft, explaining how the proton may contain particles heavier than itself.</p>



<p>Using thousands of measurements from experiments at the LHC and other particle accelerators, combined with theoretical calculations, the team found evidence for intrinsic charm in the proton at a statistical level called 3 sigma. The intrinsic charm quarks carry about 0.6 percent of a proton’s momentum, the researchers report.</p>



<p>But 5 sigma is typically required for a conclusive result. “The data and analysis are not yet sufficient &#8230; to get from ‘evidence for’ to ‘discovery of’ intrinsic charm,” says Ramona Vogt, a theoretical physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who wrote a perspective piece on the study for <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more, defining what is meant by “intrinsic charm” isn’t straightforward, muddling the comparison of the new finding with earlier results from different groups. “Previous studies have found different limits on intrinsic charm partly because they have used different definitions and schemes,” says theoretical physicist Wally Melnitchouk of Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Va.</p>



<p>Notably, the new analysis incorporates results from the LHCb collaboration, which <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.082001">reported measurements potentially consistent</a> with intrinsic charm in the proton in the Feb. 25 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Including that data in the analysis is “what’s really new,” says theoretical physicist C.-P. Yuan of Michigan State University in East Lansing. But Yuan has reservations about the type of calculation used to interpret the data. “It’s not done at what we today call the state-of-art analysis.”</p>



<p>Scientists need to pin down the proton’s intrinsic charm content to better understand results at the LHC and other facilities that smash protons together and observe what comes out. Researchers have to be able to gauge the ins and outs of the objects they’re colliding.</p>



<p>Data from future accelerators such as the planned Electron-Ion Collider could help, says theoretical physicist Tim Hobbs of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. For now, the proton remains mysterious. “The problem is still with us; it remains very challenging.”</p>

                <p> PLOS Note: we use this blog, on occasion, to highlight authors and their research. Today, we are shining a spotlight on this <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272730">work </a>that was published last week on PLOS ONE. The topic is dear to our heart. The author of the blog and the paper is Marc-Andre Simard. He is a Ph.D. student in information science at the University of Montr&eacute;al who works on open science and science policy.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of faster and more efficient dissemination of scholarly literature. Early in the pandemic, several publishers, such as Springer-Nature, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Elsevier, announced the opening of their COVID-19-related papers. However, it remains unclear if these papers will remain free to access for researchers and the public. For instance, Elsevier <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/coronavirus-information-center">mentioned</a> that their Novel Coronavirus Information Center will be available &ldquo;as long as necessary,&rdquo; hinting that these resources might be locked behind a paywall one day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The movement toward open access</strong></p>



<p>The scientific community has long advocated for free and unrestricted access to scholarly literature. This movement toward <em>open access</em> was formalized through 2002&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read/">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a>. The idea behind the open access (OA) movement is that science is a public good that should be made available to everyone in order to remove some of the technological and financial barriers to science and accelerate research and education across the planet. Over the past 20 years, several major initiatives have been developed worldwide to support open access dissemination. These include <a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">UNESCO&rsquo;s Recommendation on Open Science</a> and <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/">Plan S</a>, a European initiative that aims to make research articles supported by public funds freely available online, without embargo, and with transparent pricing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Just how big is open access?</strong></p>



<p>Using the <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search">Web of Science</a>, a database that indexes publication and citation data from about 13,000 journals annually, and <a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a>, an open database tracking open access content from over 50,000 scientific publishers and repositories, we have collected a dataset of 8,137,675 documents that were published between 2015 and 2019. We found that over 40% of all scientific publications indexed in the Web of Science during that period were available in OA at the time of our data collection, with shares ranging from 21% in humanities to 50% in medical and health sciences (Figure&nbsp;1).</p>

<p><strong>Does open access really matter for lower income countries?</strong></p>



<p>Scientific publishing is a lucrative business. Since the early 2000s, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">more than half of scientific papers have been published by the so-called &ldquo;oligopoly of publishers&rdquo;</a> that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24032052-900-time-to-break-academic-publishings-stranglehold-on-research/#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20academic%20publishing,up%20and%20judge%20its%20merits.">have been making record profits</a>. Participating in science is also expensive: in order to have access to the latest scientific discoveries, it is often necessary to pay journal subscription fees that are so high that even <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/">some of the wealthiest universities in the world have decided to unsubscribe from them</a>. Low-income and developing countries are particularly vulnerable to these pricing dynamics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2021-2022">World Bank&rsquo;s country classification by income</a> and author affiliation data from the Web of Science, we have looked into the relationship between income level and 1) open access publishing and 2) references made to open access literature. Figures&nbsp;2 and 3 illustrate OA publications and references of countries compared to the world average. Our data show that low-income and lower-middle-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, tend to publish and use open access literature more than the rest of the world. However, upper-middle-income countries use open access literature less than the rest of the world, while open access practices vary greatly in high-income countries.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="924" height="542" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20581" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3.png 924w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3-300x176.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/Picture-3-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px"></figure>



<p>Figure&nbsp;3. Normalized map of the number of references made to open access per country. Green indicates that a country is over the world average, and brown indicates that a country is under the world average.</p>



<p>Those findings show that countries in sub-Saharan Africa publish and cite open access literature at a higher rate than the rest of the world. At the same time, we found that the Middle East and Asia are the areas where both their proportion of OA publications and of OA use is lower. This could be explained by the fact that most publishers provide publication fee waivers for low-income countries but not or only partially for middle-income countries. Ultimately, our study highlights national differences in open access uptake and leads us to believe that more open access initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support the broader adoption of open scholarship.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063086906">A Portrait of the Scientist as a Young Woman</a><br><em>Lindy Elkins-Tanton</em><br><em>William Morrow, $29.99</em></p>
</div>



<p>Becoming an astronomer might seem straightforward. An awe of the night sky sparks a child to someday study astronomy in school, eventually leading to a graduate degree and a job in the field. But as two new books make clear, few women find the road so simple.</p>



<p>In <em>A Portrait of the Scientist as a Young Woman</em>, Lindy Elkins-Tanton, a geologist turned planetary scientist, recounts her struggles with depression and anxiety as a child and with the sexism she faced early in her career. In one example, she and colleagues (all men but one) were collecting rock samples in Siberia, searching for evidence of a connection between volcanic eruptions and past extinction events. Taking her time to set her chisel at just the right spot to break the rock, Elkins-Tanton could “practically smell the silent impatience from the men nearby,” she writes. “Yes, they could have done it faster, and with fewer blows. But why should that be the important metric? Why is it not more important to let each person do the tasks they want and need to do, at their own pace?”</p>





<p>Her male colleagues’ implicit and explicit bias against women in science, she writes, fanned her own self-doubt. To demand the same respect as male scientists, she learned she had to insist, gently, to carry her own baggage and take her own samples, her way and on her time. The lessons she learned in Siberia and in the lab, she writes, helped her develop a compassionate and just leadership style as the director of Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and as the head of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-launch-delay-for-psyche-asteroid-mission">NASA’s upcoming Psyche mission</a>. That mission will send a spacecraft to probe a metal-rich asteroid to better understand Earth’s iron-rich core.</p>



<p>Every scientist’s experience is unique, but elements of Elkins-Tanton’s story, particularly the sexism in science, find voice throughout <em>The Sky Is for Everyone: Women Astronomers in Their Own Words</em>. Edited by astronomer Virginia Trimble and author David Weintraub, this anthology of 37 short autobiographies covers more than six decades of astronomy and shows the varied paths of female astronomers and the roadblocks that can slow or sideline their success.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691207100">The Sky Is for Everyone</a><br><em>Virginia Trimble and David A. Weintraub (eds.)</em><br>Princeton Univ., $29.95</p>
</div>



<p>Astrophysicist France Córdova, for instance, opens her story with an evocative description of the time she spent in the summer of 1968 in a pueblo near Oaxaca City, Mexico, working on a cultural anthropology project. She had planned to study anthropology in graduate school, but after watching a TV show on dead stars, she realized she “had a deeper wanderlust inside,” she writes, “to connect with something wider, deeper than I could imagine — the stars and the Universe that held them.”</p>



<p>As a child, Córdova hadn’t known anyone who believed women could be scientists. Her parents thought finding a husband should be her college goal. Instead, she chose to pursue a graduate degree in astrophysics. She launched a career in X-ray astronomy and then pivoted again to policy and leadership, assuming the role of NASA’s chief scientist and later head of the National Science Foundation — positions where, she writes, she could advocate more effectively for women in science.</p>



<p>Dara Norman, in contrast, never questioned that she’d become an astronomer; by age 10 she was certain. She earned a Ph.D. in 1999 after studying bias in the measurements of distant galaxies that can distort our understanding of the universe. To her, the similarities between biases in scientific data and biases in the culture of science were blatant. “I am amazed that as scientists we understand the idea of bias in our data and methods…. We work tirelessly to identify such biases … and eliminate that bias,” she writes. “However, when confronted with bias in our profession … many of us continue to deny the existence of the issue.”</p>





<p>Norman realized the traditional path of an astronomer wasn’t for her. The joy of doing research was overshadowed by the negative experiences she endured “as a Black American woman just trying to <em>be</em> a scientist.” Like Córdova, she now works to improve the culture of science, at the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Lab in Tucson.</p>



<p>That culture is changing, slowly. Before 1990, fewer than 40 women held full-time positions in astronomy or astrophysics at North American universities. Now, the number is high enough that it’s not as easy to track how many women successfully pursue a career in the field, Trimble and Weintraub note. Although those numbers point to progress, both books remind readers that blatant and subtle acts of sexism are still present and that careers in science can still be precarious for women. And yet women persist, perhaps, as Elkins-Tanton writes, driven by the “realization that we are only a tiny part of a vast unexplored universe.” If true, it’s a pillar of resilience to aspire to.</p>

                <p>In a new study from <em>PLOS Climate</em> authors Laura Niggli at University of Zurich, Switzerland and colleagues have found that the cascading effects of extreme weather &ndash; such as recent heat waves which combine heat and drought &ndash; and the interconnectedness of critical services and sectors has the potential to destabilize socioeconomic systems. Learn on to learn more about the researchers&rsquo; findings below or visit <em>PLOS Climate</em> to access the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Over the past several decades, the frequency and magnitude of concurrent climate extremes, such as heat and drought events, have increased. These events can affect many different assets, sectors and systems of the human environment, including human security, health, and well-being, although many risk assessments and resilience plans only consider individual events.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>To better understand how extreme weather might affect interlinked socioeconomic systems, the authors of the present study conducted a qualitative network-type analysis, first reviewing studies of eight historical concurrent heat and drought extreme events in Europe, Africa and Australia. Next, they compiled examples of interlinked impacts on several critical services and sectors, including human health, transport, agriculture and food production, and energy. For example, drought events reduced river navigation options, limiting the transport of critical goods. Rail transport was simultaneously stymied when prolonged heat buckled the tracks. Using these analyses, researchers created visualizations of the interconnected effects of concurrent heat and drought events on those services and sectors.</p>

<p>The researchers found the most important cascading processes and interlinkages centered around the health, energy and agriculture and food production sectors. In some instances, response measures for one sector had negative effects on other sectors. Future research should focus on response measures in interconnected systems to improve the resilience to compound heat and drought events.</p>



<p>According to the authors, &ldquo;We identified an interconnected web of sectors that interact and cause additional losses and damages in several other sectors. This multilevel interconnectedness makes the risks of compound extreme events so complex and critical. More efforts should be concentrated on the analysis of such cascading risks and on strategies to interrupt such chains of impacts, rather than compartmentalizing risk assessment into single extreme events, impacts and sectors&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Author Laura Niggli adds: &ldquo;This study presents unprecedented quantitative information and qualitative understanding on the impacts of combined heat and drought events in major world regions over the past 20 years. It contributes new insights into how these impacts cascade through critical systems (health, energy, food production, etc.) and emphasizes the importance to appropriately consider such impact cascades in adaptation efforts.&rdquo;</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/pexels-pixabay-220213-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>A participatory method</strong></p>
<p>Ripple Effects Mapping, or REM, is a participatory and qualitative form of impact evaluation. When we learned of this method, we thought that it would be invaluable in helping understand some of the complex public health interventions we were evaluating – particularly the elements that were deemed hard-to-measure. However, to make it more suited to our needs, we adapted it further. It is this adapted method that we talk more about here.</p>
<p>One fundamental aspect of REM is that it is participatory. This means that the people who are involved in the design or delivery of an intervention, and those who are affected by it, are invited to participate in data collection workshops. These workshops are qualitative in nature, and so we aim to build up a collective picture of what happened during the life-course of an intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Running a REM workshop</strong></p>
<p>Workshops are usually split into five main sections. The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>first </em></span><em>section</em> gives everyone time to speak with each other; to discuss how they have been involved in the intervention, what they are proud of, and what impacts have been important to them. This is predominantly a warm-up activity.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>second and third</em></span> <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>sections</em></span> are perhaps the most important. Small groups of 4-6 people are formed, and groups are asked to start writing down and discussing what they were involved in and what the impacts have been. They capture this on flip chart paper which has a timeline in its centre (e.g. Figure 1). A facilitator can guide participants through the activity by asking probing questions. They also make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute to the activities.</p>
<p>One of the adaptations we made was that REM is viewed as both a retrospective and prospective method. In the workshops, participants can map their activities and impacts over the previous 3-6 months, and they can also anticipate what they envisage will happen over the next 3-6 months. Follow up workshops can then be carried out 3-6 months later where they revisit the previous REM outputs and ask, &#8220;Did what we think was going to happen, happen?&#8221; We also recommend that the first REM workshop is delivered in the first 3-6 months of their work.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>fourth section</em></span> is a reflective one. Now that activities and impacts are visualised, the facilitator can ask participants to reflect on what they deem to be the most significant and why. But often, a more interesting conversation happens around the least significant impacts. Where did they invest time and energy which didn’t lead to anything meaningful? Why did this happen? What could be done in the future to minimise this happening again? Were other factors at play which prevented their work being impactful? Some of this can also be added to the map, or it could be audio-recorded and analysed later.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>last section</em></span> of the workshop is also reflective. REM is not only an evaluative tool but also one which can drive continuous intervention improvement. So here, the facilitator can get the group to discuss what they will do next because of attending the REM workshop. It might be that some participants didn’t previously know of each other, and merely being in the workshop created the opportunity for new collaborations.</p>
<p>Workshops usually require a couple of hours. If you have less time, then elements of the workshop can be shortened. The follow up workshops can be shorter too as participants become more familiar with the method. We’ve tested the adapted method in online and in-person formats. Both can work, and each has pros and cons, but the in-person format probably allows for greater levels of participation and discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01570-4">paper</a> and our <a href="https://arc-w.nihr.ac.uk/training-and-capacity-building/arc-west-courses/introduction-to-ripple-effects-mapping/">supplementary online training</a>, we provide further details on how to apply the method, the circumstances in which it may be useful, and perhaps most importantly, we encourage others to adapt the method to meet their own needs. Hopefully, this method, and future iterations of it, offer one means of capturing the realities of efforts to improve public health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/football-spiral-wobble-frequency-physics">Spiraling footballs wobble at one of two specific frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>In American football, some passes are caught and some are dropped — but all wobble as they fly.</p>



<p>Spiraling pigskins tend to <a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/openengineering/article/doi/10.1115/1.4054692/1141841/Modeling-the-Dynamics-of-an-American-Football-and">visibly wobble at either a slow or fast frequency</a>, depending on how the ball is thrown, researchers report online June 23 in the <em>ASME Open Journal of Engineering</em>. That wobble, and to a lesser extent Earth’s rotation and the ball’s spin, cause passes to stray sideways — so don’t completely blame the quarterback this upcoming season.</p>





<p>“The fact that [a football] wobbles and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t go straight — those are the two big effects that you see in a pass,” says mechanical engineer John Dzielski of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.</p>



<p>Using physics equations from ballistics studies and data from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02859892">wind tunnel experiments with footballs</a>, Dzielski and software engineer Mark Blackburn, also of the Stevens Institute, ran computer simulations of a spiraling football pass.</p>



<p>They found that a pigskin flying at around 27 meters per second with around 600 rotations per minute would visibly wobble either one or five times per second. Wobbling occurs as the ball’s spinning momentum interacts with a twisting force that acts to turn the football’s nose away from the direction of flight. The faster wobble dominates when extra energy is applied during throws by twisting of the wrist or lateral motion of the arm.</p>



<p>That wobbling generates lift that pushes the ball sideways, potentially changing the landing point by several meters, the team reports. Earth’s rotation also could cause a pass to drift several centimeters. And the Magnus effect — whereby a spinning projectile becomes sandwiched by low- and high-pressure zones of air, bending its trajectory — had double that impact.</p>



<p>Dzielski and Blackburn are now interested in refining their simulations by developing an instrument to gather data from footballs in flight.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impacts-created-mars-planetary-sand">Asteroid impacts might have created some of Mars’ sand</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sand on Earth is continuously being created by the slow erosion of rocks. But on Mars, violent asteroid impacts may play an important role in making new sand.</p>



<p>As much as a quarter of Martian sand is composed of spherical bits of glass forged in the intense heat of impacts, a new study shows. Since windblown sand sculpts the Martian landscape, this discovery reveals how <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2022/pdf/6526.pdf">asteroid impacts contribute to shaping Mars</a>, even long after the collisions occur, Purdue University planetary scientist Briony Horgan and colleagues suggest. The team will present their results August 18 at the 85th Annual Meeting of the Meteoritical Society in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>





<p>Using data collected by spacecraft orbiting Mars, Horgan and collaborators looked at different wavelengths of visible and infrared light reflected from the planet’s surface to determine the minerals present in Martian sand. The team found signatures of glass all over the planet, particularly at higher latitudes.</p>



<p>One explanation for all that glass is volcanic eruptions, which are known to produce glass when magma mixes with water. But the most glass-rich swath of Mars — the planet’s northern plains — is conspicuously bereft of volcanoes, the researchers note. That rules out volcanic eruptions as the culprit in that location and instead suggests that far more cataclysmic events — asteroid impacts — might be involved.</p>



<p>That’s a plausible argument, says Steven Goderis, a geochemist at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium who was not involved in the research. “Often Mars is seen as a volcanic planet. But there’s also a very strong impact component, and this is often overlooked.”</p>



<p>When an asteroid moving at several kilometers per second slams into a rocky planet like Mars, the energy of the event melts nearby rocks and launches them skywards. That molten shrapnel fragments and produces sand grain–sized pieces that are roughly spherical. Those bits of glass — called impact spherules — eventually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteor-explosion-over-antarctica-impact-rock">rain back onto the planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>).</p>

<p>Over the last 3 billion years, asteroid impacts could have plausibly blanketed the surface of Mars in a layer of impact spherules roughly half a meter thick, Horgan and her colleagues calculate. All that material added to the sand on Mars that formed through normal erosion. “Impacts helped supply sand to the surface continuously over time,” Horgan says.</p>



<p>Scientists might have the opportunity to analyze Martian impact spherules in the future. NASA’s Perseverance rover is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">currently storing samples of Martian sand and rocks</a> for eventual return to Earth (<em>SN: 9/10/21</em>). That’s exciting, Horgan says. “The record of all this is in the sand.”</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us a little bit about what you do at PLOS.</strong></p>

          <p>As part of the Open Research team, I&rsquo;m working to advance the adoption of open science in the research communities that PLOS serves. This work is core to our mission, because we see Open Science adoption as essential to increasing accessibility, trust and collaboration around research that can solve pressing problems. Beyond just publishing the finished product of scientific research on an open access basis, we want to see researchers sharing outputs from <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">across the entire research cycle</a> as openly as possible.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>In some fields sharing early and often is second nature, but in others this takes real reorientation. So my job is to understand the needs that particular research communities have around open science, the challenges they face as well as the assets they bring to the table. From there, my colleagues and I develop solutions that can move the needle on the uptake of open science by PLOS authors&mdash;this could be a policy, a technology, or something else&mdash;and then test their effectiveness to see if these solutions might be relevant elsewhere.</p>



<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiatives have you been involved with that have been driven by curiosity?</strong></p>



<p>One project that I&rsquo;m involved with at the moment is a study of how and why researchers share detailed methods information. There&rsquo;s been very little written about this, relative to other open science practices like data sharing. So, both at PLOS and as we&rsquo;ve discussed this study with other stakeholders, there&rsquo;s a genuine sense of curiosity about an understudied phenomenon; we know that we need to understand the current state of play before we can improve on it.</p>



<p>To develop a research instrument for this study, I conducted exploratory interviews with researchers from a diverse set of backgrounds. I engaged with scholarship from outside the narrow domain of publishing, drawing inspiration from a study of what film studies researcher Salom&eacute; Aguilera Skvirsky calls &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-process-genre">the process genre</a>.&rdquo; I also worked with colleagues from other teams at PLOS to sharpen the question logic and sampling strategy for the survey I created: like most scientists, I collaborated rather than trying to become an expert in everything.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m still in the midst of analyzing our results, but whatever we find we intend to share openly. That&rsquo;s one of the things that makes me proud to work at PLOS: even as we use<a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/"> the research we conduct</a> to inform our internal decision-making, we also communicate that knowledge back to the research community in order to keep driving discovery forward.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this approach is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>Having curiosity guide our work at PLOS is important for at least two reasons. The first is being empirical. Even as evidence piles up about the scientific and societal benefits of openness, the persistence of more closed ways of doing research suggests that advocates need to do more than simply talk louder. For instance, I admire the work that science studies researcher Nicole Nelson has done to show that limited uptake of reproducibility reforms may be about<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03617-w"> more than misaligned incentives</a>. Curiosity means not getting too attached to any one explanation.</p>



<p>The second reason for foregrounding curiosity is being critical. A recent edited collection on the study of curiosity<a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/read/curiosity-studies/section/a782de56-c52a-49d6-941d-ecb0c4f0f015#intro"> opened with questions</a> that have stayed with me: &ldquo;Who can be curious, within what contexts, why, and how? For whom is curiosity valorized?&rdquo; These questions chime with a heightened focus, at PLOS and elsewhere, on equity and inclusion in open science. Against the backdrop of historical disparities that concentrated opportunities for scientific inquiry in the global North, we must ensure that our current efforts open up what counts as legitimate knowledge and avoid stratifying researchers into creators and reusers.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>My own research background is in cultural anthropology, a field whose method is rooted in appreciative curiosity about how people&mdash;<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674063488">including scientists!</a>&mdash;go about their everyday lives. This personal and professional curiosity still kicks in every time I&rsquo;m talking to a researcher and hear a term used in a way that I don&rsquo;t (yet) understand.</p>



<p>During my PhD, I thought that I would channel this curiosity into a career as a professor. But, in the work I&rsquo;m doing now around open science, I&rsquo;ve found another, no less rewarding way to learn about new communities and to help them realize their aims. It&rsquo;s meaningful for me to be able to tell early-career researchers that you can live out your values off of the tenure track.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p>I hope they&rsquo;ll think of me as a boundary crosser, someone who asked big-picture questions that cast problems in a usefully different light. I hope they&rsquo;ll say that I was willing to experiment, to try things that might end up failing and to be transparent about it when they did. I hope they&rsquo;ll see that I left scholarly communication a little weirder, kinder, and more open than I found it.<br></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-color-rhythm-dimming">Over time, Betelgeuse changed color. Now it’s also lost its rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>The star Betelgeuse has always been a diva.</p>



<p>Astronomers from antiquity through the present day have watched the red supergiant pulsing at the shoulder of the constellation Orion, and the star has continually put on a show, two new studies suggest. Betelgeuse may still be recovering from a deep dimming episode a few years ago, one team reports. And the star appears to have put on its reddish stage makeup just 2,000 years ago, before which it wore yellow, another team says.</p>





<p>Together, these studies could tell researchers about how stars spew their guts into space and hint at how long it will be before Betelgeuse explodes in a supernova.</p>



<p>“This star always fools you,” says astronomer Edward Guinan of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, who has studied Betelgeuse for decades and was not involved in the new works. “You think you have it, and all of a sudden, it changes.”</p>



<h4>The “Great Dimming”</h4>



<p>In late 2019, Betelgeuse captured astronomers’ attention when it suddenly grew dark for several months — an event astronomers now call the Great Dimming. Months of subsequent observations led researchers to an explanation: The star had coughed out a big bubble of plasma. That material cooled, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened">condensed into dust and blocked the star’s face</a> from the perspective of Earth months later (<em>SN: 11/29/20</em>). The surface of the star also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">cooled down, contributing to the dimming</a> (<em>SN: 6/16/21</em>).</p>



<p>But what happened next was equally surprising, astrophysicist Andrea Dupree and colleagues report in a paper submitted August 2 to arXiv.org. The star’s regular pulsating brightness, it seems, went <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01676">completely out of whack</a>.</p>



<p>In its non–Great Dimming life, Betelgeuse’s brightness was on a quasi-periodic dimmer switch. As the star breathed in and out — ballooning out before shrinking back down — its brightness went up and down. “For 200 years, it had a nice, 400-day oscillation in brightness,” says Dupree, of the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “But that’s gone now.”</p>



<p>That regular drumbeat has since grown erratic. Instead of a regular thrum, the oscillations are “like an unbalanced washing machine, going ‘wonka wonka wonka,’” Dupree says.</p>



<p>The wonkiness is a sign of the star struggling to recover from the loss of material in 2019, Dupree says. She calculates that Betelgeuse ejected several times the mass of the moon from its surface, leaving a large cool spot behind. The star’s surface plasma is sloshing around as it returns to equilibrium.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Lost rhythm</h4>



<p>Betelgeuse’s brightness, or stellar magnitude, used to change with a steady, 400-day rhythm (dashed line). But shortly after the Great Dimming in early 2019, the brightness changes became erratic. The different plot symbols and colors denote stellar magnitude measurements from different observatories.</p>

<p>If this picture is correct, it means red supergiants like Betelgeuse can spray material into interstellar space in discrete bursts, rather than a continuous stream. That’s important to know because many of the elements that make up planets and people were formed in stars undergoing what Betelgeuse is going through right now. Studying Betelgeuse’s growing pains and death throes can tell us about our own origins.</p>



<p>But while this picture of Betelgeuse holds together, it is still speculative, Guinan cautions.</p>



<p>One confounding factor is a new set of observations of Betelgeuse during the four-month period when it’s usually out of view. From May through August every year, Betelgeuse is too close to the sun from Earth’s perspective to be seen at night. Usually that leaves a hole in the datasets of astronomers who track its periodic behavior.</p>



<p>But amateur observer Otmar Nickel of Mainz, Germany, developed a technique to measure Betelgeuse’s brightness using <a href="https://app.aavso.org/jaavso/article/3798/">multiple images taken during the day</a>. Dupree’s paper is the first to include those daytime data.</p>



<p>“That’s cool,” Guinan says. “You can follow the star all year round.”</p>



<p>Those extra observations might reveal recurring changes that have always been there, rather than picking up on something truly new. “Those little variations you’re seeing…could easily be present right before the Great Dimming,” Guinan says.</p>



<p>Dupree’s team predicts that the dust Betelgeuse lost could become visible to some telescopes on Earth in 2023. “That would be proof” that the brightness changes were due to a single outburst, Guinan says.</p>



<h4>Seeing yellow</h4>



<p>The Great Dimming isn’t the first time humans have recorded a major change in Betelgeuse’s personality. Two millennia ago, the star <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac1969/6651563">was a completely different color</a>, astrophysicist Ralph Neuhäuser and colleagues report in a paper in press in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>



<p>The team analyzed ancient descriptions of more than 200 stars whose colors should have been visible to the naked eye in the past few thousand years. Most stars observed over human history had the same color recorded in the past as they display today, the team found. But not Betelgeuse.</p>



<p>The ancient Roman astronomer Gaius Julius Hyginus, who lived from about 64 B.C. to A.D. 17, and is thought to have written the Latin work <em>De Astronomia</em>, described the star in the right shoulder of Orion has having a similar color to Saturn ­— which is yellow. Astrologer and archivist Sima Qian, working during the Chinese Han dynasty around 100 B.C., independently described the star as yellow. Observers from other ancient cultures conspicuously left Betelgeuse out of their lists of red stars.</p>



<p>“I thought, ‘Oh, how can this be?’” says Neuhäuser, of AIU Jena in Germany. “I was not expecting such a result … to find a star to change color in historical time.”</p>



<p>A star’s color is a sign of its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">evolutionary stage</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). When stars burn through the hydrogen fuel in their cores, they puff up and expel gases into space. That expansion makes their surface temperatures drop, and they change color from blue to red in fairly short order — about 10,000 years for a giant star like Betelgeuse, which is around 14 times as massive as the sun.</p>

</div><figcaption>Measuring a star’s age isn’t as easy as you’d think. Here’s how scientists get their ballpark estimates.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That relatively recent color change suggests Betelgeuse has just reached the end of its hydrogen-burning life and became the red supergiant we know it as today while human observers were watching.</p>



<p>“It’s fully consistent with astrophysical knowledge,” Neuhäuser says. “It could have been expected, but no one really checked.”</p>



<p>That result means anyone waiting for Betelgeuse to go supernova will have a very long wait. If the star just became a supergiant in the last few millennia, it has more than 1 million years to go before the boom.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-www-event-particle-physics-large-hadron-collider">Physicists spotted rare W boson trios at the Large Hadron Collider</a></h4>

              
                <p>The letters “www” are typically followed by a “dot” — but not in this experiment.</p>



<p>Around 270 WWW events, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.061803">trios of particles called W bosons</a>, appeared in an experiment at the world&#8217;s largest particle collider, researchers report in the Aug. 5 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. By measuring how often W boson triplets appear in such experiments, physicists can check their foundational theory of particle physics — the standard model — for any cracks.</p>



<p>To produce the rare boson triplets, scientists smashed protons together at the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva. W bosons are particles that transmit the weak force, which is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay. The particles are mysterious: In April, researchers with the now-concluded CDF experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., reported that the W boson was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">more massive than predicted</a>, hinting that something may be amiss with the standard model (<em>SN: 4/7/22</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, the probability of a WWW appearance was slightly higher than predicted by the standard model, the team found, though not enough for scientists to declare the theory flawed. “We need to accumulate more data to see how this evolves,” says ATLAS spokesperson and physicist Andreas Hoecker of CERN, the particle physics lab that is the home of the LHC.</p>



<p>Those proton collisions, which reached an energy of 13 trillion electron volts, occurred before the LHC shut down for upgrades in 2018. In July, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/large-hadron-collider-restart-upgrades">LHC restarted</a> at a higher energy of 13.6 trillion electron volts (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). New data could help nail down whether these threes of a kind really do misbehave.</p>



<p>The WWW discovery is fitting — in 1989, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-rebound-infection-paxlovid-biden-fauci">COVID-19 infections can rebound for some people. It’s unclear why</a></h4>

              
                <p>For some people, including President Joe Biden and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, the relief of vanishing COVID-19 symptoms and a negative test is fleeting. Biden, Fauci and many others have seen their tests turn positive again or have unwelcome symptoms return after taking a five-day course of the antiviral Paxlovid. Other people, including my husband, have had their infections rebound even without taking the drug.</p>



<p>Multiple studies have described cases of “Paxlovid rebound” after treatment. In one, seven Paxlovid-treated patients <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac512/6614635">had the virus rebound</a> to high levels after treatment ended, and symptoms returned for six of them, virologist Jonathan Li and colleagues reported in June in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>. Samples from three patients even carried infectious virus, a clue that some people who rebound might infect others. Another study that has yet to be peer-reviewed by other researchers found that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.22276724v1">fewer than 6 percent of people in the study who&#8217;d been prescribed Paxlovid</a> had rebound infections in the month after finishing treatment.</p>





<p>It’s unclear why Paxlovid rebound happens, says Li, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Studies show that people given the drug still develop a strong immune response to the virus after five days of treatment. “I think what’s happening in that situation is that you’ve got virus replication that’s been inhibited. All of a sudden, the drug has disappeared and the virus has a momentary opportunity to replicate. And it replicates to high levels,” Li says. But by then, the immune system has learned to fend off the coronavirus. If the recently trained immune cells encounter newly made viruses and set off alarm bells, symptoms may briefly come back.</p>



<p>Some people might not want to take the drug because they’re worried about rebound, Li says. But Paxlovid itself probably isn’t the cause. The drug’s not failing. It is still highly effective in preventing severe disease. “I would not hesitate to give my patients Paxlovid,” Li says. “I do tell them to be on the lookout for rebounding symptoms. But it doesn’t dissuade me in terms of prescribing it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fauci took another course of Paxlovid in the wake of his rebound. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that there’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-updates-paxlovid-health-care-providers">no evidence that 10 days of treatment is any more effective than five days</a>, or that patients need a repeat. But, researchers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/biden-rebound-covid-infection-paxlovid/">testing whether taking the drug for a longer period of time</a> might prevent rebound.</p>



<p>Rebounding COVID-19 isn’t limited to patients who take Paxlovid. Li recalls that even in the early days of the pandemic, some patients would come to him in the hospital saying that they’d started to feel better but got worse again. It’s hard to know how to interpret such anecdotal reports, he says. Researchers are still learning what an untreated viral infection can look like in the body. While the virus’s (hopefully) brief invasion may appear straightforward on average — with virus levels in the body increasing to a peak before slowly declining as the person recovers — not everyone follows that pattern.</p>

<p>My husband got COVID-19 two months ago. His symptoms lasted about a week, and he was delighted to see the line on his antigen test getting fainter. Even so, despite feeling perfectly healthy, the line was suddenly back at full strength almost immediately after he added his sample to a new test days later. He was frustrated and, as a social person, lamented having to stay isolated.</p>



<p>Studies show he’s not alone. When Li and colleagues studied the course of disease in COVID-19 clinical trial participants who received a placebo treatment, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.22278278v1.full.pdf">1 in 8 people experienced a rebound</a>, with symptoms coming back for 1 in 4 people. That rebound, however, typically lasted about a day, and few had both high viral loads and returning symptoms, the team reports in a preliminary study posted August 2 at medRxiv.org that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists.</p>



<p>In this case, there’s no disappearing drug. Any returning symptoms without a positive test might be from something else such as allergies or a different respiratory virus, Li says. It’s also possible that the virus is replicating in different parts of the body at different times. Some tests might end up negative when the body eliminates virus from the throat, for example, but it’s still replicating at low levels in the nose.</p>



<p>That latter scenario may have happened with my husband. In a confusing twist, he tested negative on two saliva PCR tests while continuing to test positive on nasal antigen tests. A PCR test is far more sensitive, so we expected the opposite to happen. Since experts say to<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases"> consider a positive antigen test as a sign you’re still contagious</a>, he stayed isolated until he finally tested negative on an antigen test two weeks after his first symptoms appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, he’s fully recovered now, and not at all eager for a repeat experience. That means we’re both still masking in public spaces and taking other precautions. We know we’re not done with this pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>The icy world of organ freezing </strong>– <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/icy-world-organ-freezing"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 19, 1972</p>



<p>If whole organs could be frozen and stored … surgeons would be able to perform far more transplants…. For all their efforts, though, cryobiologists (biologists who study the effects of cold on life) have not been very successful with organ freezing…. Nobody to date has cooled whole mammalian hearts any lower [than −20° Celsius] or longer [than six hours] and revived them.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists still struggle to keep donor hearts on ice for longer than six hours, but it is now possible to store a different organ — the liver — at below-freezing temperatures for more than a day. The challenge has been figuring out how to stop ice from crystallizing and damaging cells. In 2019, scientists reported successfully warming up several human livers after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercooling-chemicals-tripled-shelf-life-donor-organs">supercooling them for 27 hours</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/19 &amp; 10/26/19, p. 10</em>). This and other preservation methods such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11267128/">freezing at high pressures</a> or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aah4586">thawing using nanoparticles</a> aren’t yet ready for the operating room, but they have the potential to keep thousands of lifesaving organs from going to waste each year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/renaissance-beauty-chemistry-plants-ingredients">These researchers are unlocking Renaissance beauty secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Art historian Erin Griffey is a bit of a beauty maven. “I’m one of those people who reads the backs of beauty products,” she says. That’s why, while working on a book about beauty culture in Renaissance Europe, Griffey experienced déjà vu.</p>



<p>She noticed that many ingredients in beauty recipes from the 16th to 18th centuries — compiled from books, cosmetic recipe collections, medical texts, health regimen manuscripts, herbals and pharmacopeias — also appear on modern beauty packaging. For instance, rosewater is used in modern skin-hydrating mists and sulfur is found in some over-the-counter acne creams.</p>





<p>Such similarities are clues to what Renaissance-era people used the products for and how the products worked. But they are not the whole story. That’s because the ancient recipes often also list bizarre or even dangerous ingredients, from bile acids and calves’ hooves to lead and the poisonous bryony plant. To get a better understanding, Griffey wanted to re-create the recipes. So she turned to her colleagues at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Thus the <a href="https://www.beautifulchemistryproject.com/">Beautiful Chemistry Project</a> was born.</p>



<p>The team started with what Griffey calls “sticky recipes” because they’re found in many sources throughout the Renaissance period: rosemary flowers in white wine, myrrh powder with egg white, and the velvety covering of newly grown deer antlers <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/808.html"></a>with bean flour.</p>



<p>The recipes tend to be vague and varied. So chemist Michel Nieuwoudt and her team experiment with the measurements and procedures while Griffey searches various sources for more clues to ingredient types and ratios.</p>



<p>“We knew we could not re-create it exactly as is,” Griffey says of the recipe for rosemary flowers in white wine. “We do not have access to the rosemary plants that grew 500 years ago or the wines and whatever their chemical makeup was.” But this legwork “enabled us to get closer to an approximation<a></a>.”</p>



<p>Nieuwoudt and her team boiled rosemary flowers in round-bottom flasks each filled with a different solution: sweet white wine, dry white wine, ethanol in water or aqua vitae. Once the researchers filtered out the flowers and analyzed the resulting mixtures using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, they found chemical compounds that are common in today’s skin care products, including soothing camphor, eucalyptol and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-scents-flowers">the fragrant alcohol linalool</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/02</em>).</p>



<p>The Renaissance-era recipe stated the potion would “make the face fair.” Nieuwoudt’s findings suggest how: by toning and moisturizing skin.</p>

<p>The team has also made progress on unlocking the secrets of myrrh powder and egg whites. Experiments suggest that myrrh draws out proteins from egg whites and the egg whites extract resins, sugars and volatiles from the myrrh. That results in a serumlike product that has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties and probably stimulates collagen growth, Nieuwoudt says. “It seems there’s a synergy between all of these different ingredients, and this is why it works.”</p>



<p>As for what deer velvet and bean flour may have been used for, the researchers are still teasing out results. And they have yet to tackle recipes with dangerous ingredients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, the researchers hope to perfect their re-creations and bring the products to drug store shelves — minus, of course, any unsafe ingredients. “I think people will want to go back to something that is natural, and it’s also appealing for people to think they’re using Renaissance products,” Nieuwoudt says. Until then, the beauty for the researchers lies in “digging [the recipes] out and understanding them.”</p>

          <p><strong>George: </strong>As the Deputy Editor in Chief, I work closely with Emily, overseeing the development and implementation of the journal&rsquo;s editorial vision, our editorial strategy, and the journal&rsquo;s editorial activities to engage with our communities. I also work with other teams supporting PLOS ONE to ensure efficiency and quality of manuscript handling by the Editorial Board and the quality of the published output</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiative/s have you been involved with to ensure fairness in science (policies etc.)?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>I would say <em>PLOS ONE</em>, as a journal, was developed in order to embody fairer practices in research publication. It was the first journal to publish all rigorous science research and make it openly available to the public. By eliminating criteria for novelty or impact, <em>PLOS ONE</em> changed how we assess high-quality research and created opportunities for researchers to publish and get credit for their work. Each of us who work for the journal play a role in continuing that legacy, striving toward fairer practices across each stage of the publishing process at <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>As a recent example, we&rsquo;re currently working on simplifying our appeals process. The appeals process exists to ensure that authors have the ability to challenge decisions that they perceive to be unfair or incorrect. The changes that we will be introducing to the appeals process will help ensure that it is straightforward for authors and that it provides support to PLOS ONE Academic Editors in handling potentially tricky manuscripts.</p>



<p><strong>George: </strong>I think one of the most important initiatives I&rsquo;ve been able to work on is the development of a PLOS-wide policy, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">Inclusivity in Global Research</a>, which launched in September last year. The new policy aims to address concerns related to a practice called &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;. Parachute research occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their research, and leave, often with little understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants. As part of the policy, authors conducting research in other countries or communities are asked to complete a questionnaire that outlines ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policy itself was developed collaboratively, with members of the research community across different countries. Our aim was to improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>I think it&rsquo;s important that scientific progress is a dialogue &ndash; where authors, reviewers, editors, and the community discuss ideas and build consensus. Fairness helps instill trust in science. If the community perceives a policy (or a person or a journal) to be unfair, they won&rsquo;t engage with it, meaning that the important process of agreeing, arguing and eventually coming to a shared understanding that allows decisions and further discovery to move forward won&rsquo;t happen. So I think it&rsquo;s really important that PLOS ONE pursues policies that are grounded in principles of inclusivity, anti-bias and fairness to enable everyone to engage with the process of scientific communication and discovery.</p>



<p><strong>George:</strong><strong> </strong>I agree and I think<strong> </strong>our new policy is a good example of this. Research is better when it involves members of the local community; these individuals can add knowledge and expertise that others cannot. It&rsquo;s important that their perspectives are heard and given due weight in the scholarly discourse. I hope the policy raises awareness of these concerns and encourages better and more meaningful international collaboration in research, especially with those in low- and middle-income countries. This can bring long-term benefits as knowledge is shared between research teams, building local, individual and institutional research capacity.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>I care very deeply that PLOS ONE continues its mission to support the advancement of research by focusing on rigor rather than perceived impact, and I strongly support efforts to increase fairness, transparency and trust in the review and publication process. Asking reviewers and academic editors to focus on objective measures such as the inclusion of proper controls and whether the conclusions are supported by the data reported eliminates a source of bias in the publication process. I really enjoy being part of a journal and community that has taken active steps to move away from the tyranny of a very small minority determining what&rsquo;s &ldquo;hot&rdquo; or important or worthy in scholarly communication. I want research to be reviewed and published rapidly, and openly accessible to all, so that we as a society can benefit from these advances in knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>George:</strong><strong> </strong>It&rsquo;s been a fantastic experience to work on the Inclusivity in Global Research policy as its implementation has the potential to change the way in which research is conducted, something that can be difficult to achieve with editorial policy. I strive for equity in research and its dissemination and hope that this policy has moved the needle in ensuring fairer research collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>In a way, I hope I&rsquo;m remembered by what people <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> see published in PLOS ONE &ndash; for example, studies that didn&rsquo;t have appropriate ethical approval, or research funded by tobacco companies. I hope that the community will think that PLOS ONE had fair policies applied in a consistent manner that supported its mission. But I also hope that my contribution towards this is not highly visible. The policies and workflows that we have on PLOS ONE have been co-developed with our communities and are designed to address specific needs that have been raised by different groups. The journal does not operate in a top-down manner such that I will place any particular stamp on it&ndash;rather, I want my time as Editor in Chief to be marked by increased collaboration and communication with all groups who access the journal, and the recognition that PLOS ONE exists solely to serve the needs of the community.</p>



<p><strong>George: </strong>I think everyone should have equal opportunity to access and contribute to the publication of academic research. I hope that my contributions to <em>PLOS ONE</em> will ensure that everyone can publish well-conducted research, regardless of where they are from, the topic studied, or the perceived novelty of their work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-primates-voice-control-cords-larynx-membrane">Why humans have more voice control than any other primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>A crying baby, a screaming adult, a teenager whose voice cracks — people could have sounded this shrill all the time, a new study suggests, if not for a crucial step in human evolution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s what we’re missing that makes the difference. Humans have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineered-vocal-cords-show-promise-animal-tests">vocal cords</a>, muscles in our larynx, or voice box, that vibrate to produce sound (<em>SN: 11/18/15</em>). But unlike all other studied primates, humans don’t have small bits of tissue above the vocal cords called vocal membranes. That uniquely human trait helps people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1574">control their voices well enough</a> to produce the sounds that are the building blocks of spoken language, researchers report in the Aug. 12 <em>Science.</em></p>





<p>Vocal membranes act like a reed in a clarinet, making it easier for some animals to shout loud and shrill. Think of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/howler-monkeys-sacrifice-sperm-deeper-roars">piercing calls of howler monkeys</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/15</em>). When researchers used MRI and CT scans to look for vocal membranes in 43 different primate species, the scientists were surprised by what they saw: All primates except humans had the tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That loss of vocal membranes would have been a “very major, very revolutionary event in human evolution,” says Takeshi Nishimura, a paleontologist at Kyoto University in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

Dunn</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Primates mostly make sound in the same basic way: They push air out from their lungs while vibrating muscles in the larynx to create sound waves. To understand the role that vocal membranes play, Nishimura’s team studied videos of primate voice boxes in action in chimpanzees, rhesus macaques and squirrel monkeys. The researchers also took larynges from macaques and chimpanzees that had died of natural causes and — in what’s common practice for the field — mounted the parts on tubes, pushing air through the larynges to see how the vocal cords and membranes would react.</p>



<p>In both experiments, the larynges made sounds that would often fluctuate wildly in pitch. Nishimura’s team found that happens only when an animal has both vocal membranes and vocal cords.</p>





<p>In humans, that sort of screeching can happen when we put extreme amounts of pressure on our voice, like when we scream — or when teens struggle with controlling their growing vocal cords and their voices crack.&nbsp;But those are rare cases. Since humans don’t have vocal membranes, we usually make more stable sounds than other primates, the team concludes. Our mouths and tongues, the idea goes, can then manipulate those stable tones into the complex sounds that language is based on.</p>



<p>“That’s a really elegant explanation,” says Sue Anne Zollinger, an animal physiologist at Manchester Metropolitan University in England who was not involved in the study. It’s almost counterintuitive, she says: “You lose complexity to be able to produce more complex sounds.”</p>



<p>The loss of vocal membranes isn’t the only thing that makes humans more eloquent than other primates. Beyond anatomical differences, humans have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/language-gene-foxp2-no-humans-evolution-boost">specific genes</a> that may have helped drive language evolution (<em>SN: 8/3/18</em>). And perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeys-have-vocal-tools-not-brains-talk-humans">human brains are structured differently</a> from other primates in ways that also give us more control over our speech (<em>SN: 12/19/16</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">The Arctic is warming even faster than scientists realized</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Arctic is heating up at a breakneck speed compared with the rest of Earth. And new analyses show that the region is warming even faster than scientists thought. Over the last four decades, the average Arctic temperature increased <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00498-3">nearly four times as fast as the global average</a>, researchers report August 11 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>And that’s just on average. Some parts of the Arctic Ocean, such as the Barents Sea between Russia and Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, are warming as much as seven times as fast, meteorologist Mika Rantanen of the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki and colleagues found. Previous studies have tended to say that the Arctic’s average temperature is increasing two to three times as fast as elsewhere, as humans continue causing the climate to change.</p>





<p>To calculate the true pace of the accelerated warming, a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context">Arctic amplification</a>, the researchers analyzed observational data from 1979 to 2021 (<em>SN: 7/1/20</em>). Globally, the average temperature increase over that time was about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. But the Arctic was warming by about 0.75 degrees C per decade.</p>

<h3>Heating up</h3>



<p>Over the last four decades, the global average temperature increased by about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, but in the Arctic, the mean increase per decade was about 0.75 degrees Celsius (left). Comparing the two trends, Arctic temperatures increased on average four times as fast as the global average, with some areas increasing as much as seven times as fast (right). The gray dotted line indicates the border of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Even the best climate models are not doing a great job of reproducing that warming, Rantanen and colleagues say. The inability of the models to realistically simulate past Arctic amplification calls into question how well the models can project future changes there.</p>



<p>It’s not clear where the problem lies. One issue may be that the models are struggling with correctly simulating the sensitivity of Arctic temperatures to the loss of sea ice. Vanishing snow and ice, particularly sea ice, are one big reason why Arctic warming is on hyperspeed. The bright white snow and ice create a reflective shield that bounces incoming radiation from the sun back into space. But open ocean waters or bare rocks absorb that heat, raising the temperature.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As Tanina Agosto went through her normal morning routine in July 2007, she realized something was wrong. The 29-year-old couldn’t control her left side, even her face. “Literally the top of my head to the bottom of my foot on the left side of my body could not feel anything.”</p>



<p>The next day, Agosto spoke with a doctor at the New York City hospital where she works as a medical secretary. He told her that she probably had a pinched nerve and to see a chiropractor.</p>





<p>But chiropractic care didn’t help. Months later, Agosto needed a cane to get around, and moving her left leg and arm required lots of concentration. She couldn’t work. Numbness and tingling made cooking and cleaning difficult. It felt a bit like looping a rubber band tightly around a finger until it loses sensation, Agosto says. Once the rubber band comes off, the finger tingles for a bit. But for her, the tingling wouldn’t stop.</p>



<p>Finally, she recalls, one chiropractor told her, “I’m not too big of a person to say there’s something very wrong with you, and I don’t know what it is. You need to see a neurologist.” In November 2008, tests confirmed that Agosto had multiple sclerosis. Her immune system was attacking her brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>Agosto knew nothing about MS except that a friend of her mother’s had it. “At the time, I was like, there’s no way I’ve got this old lady’s condition,” she says. “To be hit with that and know that there’s no cure — that was just devastating.”</p>



<p>Why people develop the autoimmune disorder has been a long-standing question. Studies have pointed to certain gene variations and environmental factors. For decades, a common virus called Epstein-Barr virus has also been high on the list of culprits.</p>



<p>Now recent studies paint a clearer picture that Epstein-Barr virus instigates MS when the central nervous system gets caught in the cross hairs of an immune response to the virus’s attack. This recognition opens new options for treatment, or even vaccines. Perhaps therapies that target Epstein-Barr itself — or remove the cells in the body where the virus camps out — could jettison the virus before damage is done.</p>

<p>Vaccines might one day “make multiple sclerosis become a historical disease like polio,” says Lawrence Steinman, a neurologist at Stanford University. “The trials will be arduous,” Steinman says. Still, “I think we might be able to put MS in the rearview mirror.”</p>



<p>For now, there’s a lot to learn, including how exactly the virus triggers MS, says Francesca Aloisi, a neuroscientist at the Italian National Institute of Health in Rome.</p>



<p>For many people with MS, even with current therapies, the disease can progress. Right now, Agosto’s symptoms are largely under control. Thanks to physical therapy, an anti-inflammatory diet and medication, she has about 90 percent function on the left side of her body. “Things like long-distance running are out of the question,” she says. Carrying grocery bags with her left arm is a challenge.</p>



<p>Studying the virus’s role in MS “will be an amazing game changer,” says Agosto, who is a patient advocate with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s New York City chapter. If Epstein-Barr virus is driving her disease, she wants to know: “How do we get this virus out of the driver’s seat?”</p>



<h4>A familiar virus</h4>



<p>Multiple sclerosis is an uncommon disease, affecting nearly 3 million people globally. Yet Epstein-Barr virus is almost everywhere.</p>



<p>The virus, discovered in 1964, infects an estimated 90 percent of people around the world. People infected as young children might have a mild cold or show no symptoms. Teenagers or young adults may experience a bout of debilitating fatigue called infectious mononucleosis, or mono, that can last weeks or months.</p>



<p>These symptoms eventually fade. But Epstein-Barr infections hang on. The virus belongs to the herpesvirus family — a group known for instigating lifelong infections. The herpesviruses behind cold sores, genital herpes and chicken pox also stick around for life, usually staying quiet for long stretches. For example, varicella-zoster virus, which causes chicken pox, goes latent inside nerve cells but can resurface to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shingles-virus-rash-chicken-pox-complications">cause the painful disease shingles</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>In the body, Epstein-Barr virus slips into the epithelial cells that line the surface of the throat, allowing the virus to spread to other people via saliva — hence mono’s nickname, “the kissing disease.” The virus also infects a type of immune cell called B cells, where it enters viral hibernation.</p>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus can cause problems long after the initial infection. People who had mono are more likely to develop cancers such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma than people who didn’t. And they are more likely to be diagnosed with MS. A teenage case of mono doesn’t mean long-term problems are inevitable. But avoiding mono-related fatigue doesn’t guarantee an escape from risk either. Agosto, for instance, doesn’t recall ever having mono.</p>

<h3>Lifelong infection</h3>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus infects the throat’s epithelial cells and the immune system’s B cells. Inside B cells, the virus can hibernate for long stretches of time — sometimes reemerging and doing new damage.</p>

<h4>Establishing the link</h4>



<p>In March 2000, epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published research exploring the link between Epstein-Barr virus and MS. With colleague Mette Munch of the University of Aarhus in Denmark, Ascherio analyzed data from eight studies suggesting that MS patients are more likely to have had an Epstein-Barr infection than those without MS. Studies over the next 20 years continued to hint that the virus plays a role, but “the problem is to go from a suggestion or suspicion to proof,” says Ascherio. Getting that proof is difficult, because nearly everyone has been infected with Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, yet very few have MS.</p>



<p>“If it’s true that EBV causes MS, then you would expect to find that those individuals who are not infected with EBV, they will not get MS,” Ascherio says. “It’s very simple.” He and colleagues needed to follow a large group of young adults who had never been infected.</p>



<p>The researchers found such a group in the U.S. military. Through the Department of Defense Serum Repository, the team had access to repeated blood samples from more than 10 million individuals, taken when active-duty members were screened for diseases such as HIV at the start of their service and then every two years. Using blood samples taken between 1993 and 2013, Ascherio and colleagues could identify people who had never been infected with Epstein-Barr virus, track new infections and learn when people who developed MS started showing symptoms.</p>



<p>Over that 20-year span, 801 people whose blood was tested were diagnosed with MS. Thirty-five of those people had no signs of Epstein-Barr virus infection in their first blood sample. But all but one became infected before their MS diagnosis. People <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222">infected with the virus were 32 times as likely to develop MS</a> as uninfected people. What’s more, the researchers found that blood concentrations of a nervous system protein that is a signal of nerve damage rose after Epstein-Barr virus infection, before an MS diagnosis. The results prompted Ascherio and his team to make a bold claim in <em>Science</em> in January: “These findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS.”</p>



<p>It is still possible that infection with Epstein-Barr virus is a time stamp for something else, perhaps not yet identified, that’s also relevant for MS, says Mark Allegretta, vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “The way we talk about it now is that it’s very strong evidence that it’s necessary for development of MS, but it’s insufficient on its own.”</p>



<p>Ascherio isn’t deterred. “After 20 years of talking about EBV and MS, it’s quite exciting that we’ve finally nailed it down,” he says. “There was a lot of skepticism until now and that is fading away.”</p>

<h4>A skeptic convinced</h4>



<p>The fact that Epstein-Barr virus is implicated in so many diseases had many researchers skeptical of its link to MS, says Tobias Lanz, a neurologist at Stanford University. “It’s involved in tumors, it’s involved in MS, it’s involved in lupus, it’s in chronic fatigue syndrome. Somehow, people link it to everything and that makes us reasonably suspicious.”</p>



<p>Lanz’s mentor, Stanford rheumatologist William Robinson, was one of those skeptics. Once Lanz, Robinson and their colleagues found hints of how Epstein-Barr virus could spark nerve damage, however, Robinson became a believer.</p>



<p>The team discovered that immune proteins called antibodies from some MS patients <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04432-7">attach to a key Epstein-Barr virus protein</a>, as well as to a protein from the central nervous system. This finding, described in the March 10 <em>Nature</em>, suggests that as the immune system learns how to recognize the virus, it may also learn to attack nerve cells.</p>



<p>The viral protein, called EBNA1, helps Epstein-Barr virus persist in the body for life, hidden away inside B cells. Its molecular twin in the central nervous system, a portion of a protein called GlialCAM, is so similar that antibodies for the virus recognize and bind tightly to it too, the team found in lab experiments.</p>



<p>“That really changed everything,” Robinson says, calling it “an in-your-face result that you can’t dismiss as not being real.” In addition to adding to the evidence that Epstein-Barr virus causes MS, the finding also provides a hint of a possible mechanism: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rethinking-which-cells-are-conductors-learning-and-memory">GlialCAM is found in glial cells</a>, which support nerve cells and form the insulating layer myelin that helps nerve cells send signals (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 18</em>). Myelin is the very thing that is destroyed in MS.</p>



<p>About a quarter of patients in the study had antibodies that recognize both EBNA1 and GlialCAM. The similarities between the two proteins, called molecular mimicry, means that EBNA1 may not be a good viral protein to include in vaccines to curb diseases related to Epstein-Barr virus, says Steinman, the Stanford neurologist, who was also involved with the research. If the virus indeed sparks an autoimmune reaction, vaccines that target this viral protein or other mimics could harm myelin and spur MS.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Molecular mimic &nbsp;</h3>



<p>As the body mounts an attack against Epstein-Barr virus, the immune system may learn to turn against nerve cells too. Some researchers hypothesize that virus-attacking antibodies might also attack nerve-protecting myelin and drive MS.</p>

<h4>Viral damage</h4>



<p>Several studies support the idea that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531840/#:~:text=Molecular%20mimicry%20occurs%20when%20peptides,one%20specific%20virus%20to%20MS.">molecular mimicry causes MS damag</a>e. But other hypotheses are on the table.</p>



<p>Those B cells, for instance, where Epstein-Barr viruses hide out, produce antibodies. One possibility is that B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus transform in ways that encourage the immune system to attack the body’s own tissues.</p>



<p>Aloisi, the neuroscientist in Rome, backs a different hypothesis: Perhaps the immune system’s attack on the virus itself is behind the damage.</p>



<p>“The biology of the virus is so similar to the biology of the disease,” Aloisi says. For some people, MS can go through phases of silence where the disease is stable, no better, no worse. The disease then reactivates, producing new brain lesions and worsening symptoms. Epstein-Barr virus can similarly come out of latency, perhaps causing a surge of problems before returning to hibernation inside host cells.</p>



<p>In 2007, Aloisi and colleagues discovered unexpected <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/204/12/2899/46593/Dysregulated-Epstein-Barr-virus-infection-in-the">clusters of B cells within the membranes that cover and protect the brain</a>. In all but one of 22 patients studied, some of those B cells were infected with Epstein-Barr virus.</p>



<p>The finding “was like a bomb in the field,” Aloisi says, “because nobody ever thought about this possibility.” Other researchers initially failed to replicate the results. But “little by little other work came out [in support],” she says. “It’s difficult to find these [clusters of B cells] in the brain because people with MS don’t have large, inflamed brains. It’s small spots here and there.”</p>



<p>It’s possible that the central nervous system becomes a stronghold for the virus, Aloisi says. Immune cells called T cells, which can either coordinate an attack or kill infected cells, rush in. Some virus-infected B cells die, but the immune system can’t eliminate the virus. Myelin gets caught in the cross fire. “This creates a situation that is extremely detrimental to the tissue,” she says.</p>





<h4>Treatment tactics</h4>



<p>Regardless of whether Epstein-Barr virus drives MS symptoms directly or causes the body’s immune response to go haywire, the big question is what to do about it.</p>



<p>One obvious path is to develop MS drugs that go after the virus, Aloisi says. Some drugs that block hepatitis B virus and HIV have shown <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002392117">potential against Epstein-Barr virus in lab-grown cells</a>, says Ascherio, the Harvard epidemiologist. But those results are very preliminary.</p>



<p>Another option is to go after the infected cells. A few MS therapies may do that already. The existing MS therapy natalizumab already prevents B and T cells from crossing into the central nervous system. Fingolimod may do that as well. Another drug called ocrelizumab, approved for patients with MS in 2017, is an antibody that attaches to a protein on B cells and triggers cell death. The drug helps patients, like Agosto, who have relapsing-remitting MS, but it’s less effective for people with a progressive form of the disease, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-are-seeking-new-strategies-fight-multiple-sclerosis">who have fewer treatment options</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/17, p. 20</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers thought the drug dampened faulty immune responses by depleting B cells, Lanz says. “But it could also well be that we’re hitting those particular pathogenic B cells that are infected with Epstein-Barr virus. So the B cell depletion might actually be an anti-EBV drug and nobody appreciated that.”</p>



<p>Aloisi agrees. “Now we need something that targets the EBV-infected cells, not all of the B cells,” she says. Indiscriminately killing B cells puts patients at risk for other infections. One way to get around that could come in the form of T cell therapies that go after only infected cells. Such therapies are already in clinical trials in MS patients.</p>



<p>Some researchers suspect that antiviral treatments would probably make the most sense when used early on, before the immune system eats away at the myelin around the nerve cells. Once the virus has kick-started an immune response to attack the nervous system, “the train may already be out of the station,” says neuroimmunologist Emily Harrington of Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center in Columbus.</p>



<h4>A vaccine</h4>



<p>Even better than stopping the infection once it starts would be to build defenses before the virus invades, or to stop it from reawakening. Enter vaccines.</p>



<p>The widespread impact of mono and Epstein-Barr virus’s links to cancer and autoimmune disease had already spurred vaccine research, so a few potential shots are already in the pipeline. But Epstein-Barr virus has a complex way of invading the body, says vaccinologist Javier Gordon Ogembo of City of Hope, a cancer care center in Duarte, Calif. The virus uses at least five viral proteins to invade both epithelial cells and B cells. A vaccine would need to drive an immune response that blocks the virus’s entry into both cell types to prevent infection. “This is the reason, I think, why there has not been a vaccine so far,” Ogembo says.</p>

<h3>Vaccine options</h3>



<p>Recent studies suggest that vaccines being developed to prevent diseases related to Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, such as mononucleosis or cancer, might also work for multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<p>Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline took one vaccine candidate to clinical trials in the early 2000s. It seemed to stop people from developing mono, but it didn’t meet the original goal of preventing infection overall. So the company abandoned the vaccine.</p>



<p>Moderna, the biotechnology company made famous for its effective COVID-19 vaccine, recently launched a clinical trial of an mRNA vaccine for Epstein-Barr virus. The shot teaches the body to recognize four of the five viral proteins that help the virus invade both cell types, says viral immunologist Katherine Luzuriaga of the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester, who is involved in the trial. For now, the team is testing whether the vaccine sparks a strong immune response and getting a sense for whether it might curb cases of mono.</p>



<p>In March, the U.S National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-clinical-trial-epstein-barr-virus-vaccine">launched a clinical trial to test a vaccine</a> that uses nanoparticles to teach the body to recognize the virus and get rid of it. Ogembo and colleagues at City of Hope are developing another vaccine that uses a modified virus as the immune system’s instructor.</p>



<p>Although clinical trials could reveal within the next few years whether the vaccines can control mono, it will be decades before researchers learn anything about the potential impact on cancer or MS, Luzuriaga and Ogembo say. The hope is to see an outcome like the vaccines for human papilloma­viruses, Luzuriaga says, which reduce the number of HPV infections and led to a dramatic reduction in cervical cancers.</p>



<p>Developing therapeutic vaccines for people who already have MS may also be possible, Ascherio says. The aim would be to stop the virus from emerging from its slumber inside B cells. It would be akin to the shingles vaccine, which prevents the painful reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in nerve cells.</p>



<p>That is Steinman’s aim as well, but he envisions a shot that would put a check on the undesirable immune response. Steinman and colleagues have tested such a vaccine to try and teach MS patients’ immune systems to ignore and not harm a protein called myelin basic protein, which helps add myelin to nerves. There were hints the vaccine might have been effective, but the team ultimately stopped the project.</p>



<p>“If it weren’t for other very powerful therapies becoming approved in that same time frame, we may have continued,” Steinman says. Now, he wants to make a vaccine that helps MS patients tolerate, rather than attack, the central nervous system protein GlialCAM.</p>



<p>Researchers at BioNTech, also famous for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, are working on something similar. In mice with a disease close to MS, the company showed that an mRNA vaccine <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3638?url_ver=Z39.88-2003">could keep the immune system from attacking myelin proteins</a>, the team reported in January 2021 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Time will tell how effective any of these shots might be. But with studies providing more and more evidence that Epstein-Barr virus is linked to many diseases, Ogembo says, “it’s time to make a vaccine and get rid of it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zoo-gorilla-new-vocalization-call-cough-sound-human-attention">Zoo gorillas use a weird new call that sounds like a sneezy cough</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sukari the gorilla can grunt. She can hum. She can grumble. Now, scientists report, the gorilla’s got a new way to express herself. Sukari can “snough.”</p>



<p>She and other zoo gorillas make the noise, a cross between a sneeze and a cough, when zookeepers with food are near. The unusual utterance, which has not been observed in the wild and never been described before in this species, can help the gorillas grab people’s attention, says primatologist Roberta Salmi of the University of Georgia in Athens. The snough adds to the small but growing pile of evidence that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271871">captive apes can produce novel vocal sounds</a>, Salmi and her colleagues report August 10 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>





<p>Salmi first encountered the snough years ago at Zoo Atlanta, when she and a zookeeper noticed the gorillas making a strange sound. “We actually laughed,” she recalls. Gorillas utter an assortment of calls, but the snough stood out. As the animals wheeze out the noise, they open their mouths wide, almost as if they’re preparing to yodel. “It’s very theatrical,” Salmi says. And it seemed to crop up only in a specific situation — when keepers showed up with food.</p>



<p>Salmi and her colleagues wondered if the animals snoughed at other times too. So they recorded eight western lowland gorillas at Zoo Atlanta in three different scenarios: when a bucket of fresh grapes, a keeper or a keeper holding the grapes sat outside the enclosure. Gorillas snoughed most when both the keeper and the food sat nearby, the team found. And they made other noises that can draw human attention, like clapping, chest-beating or banging on the enclosure. When the gorillas saw just grapes or just the keeper, they stayed mostly silent.</p>

</div><figcaption>In an enclosure at Zoo Atlanta, Sukari the gorilla makes a call that sounds something like a sneeze and a cough — a “snough.” Sukari and other zoo gorillas used the sound most often when zookeepers with food were near. </figcaption></figure>



<p>“That’s quite decent evidence of the animals’ intention to request something from the keeper,” says Zanna Clay, a primatologist at Durham University in England who was not involved with the work.</p>



<p>And the snoughing wasn’t limited to Zoo Atlanta gorillas. Surveys from 19 zoos across the United States and Canada revealed that other gorillas make the same snuffling sound. Those animals probably didn’t learn to snough from the Zoo Atlanta gorillas, because they’ve never been exposed to one another, Salmi says.</p>



<p>At this point, her team can only speculate how the snough originated, though she notes that a sneezy cough might work particularly well to snare a keeper’s notice. “Coughing and sneezing are signs of a cold, which are signals that caregivers pay specific attention to,” she says.</p>



<p>If the gorillas want something they can’t physically reach, they may be “trying to use communicative signals to manipulate humans” into helping, says Jared Taglialatela, an evolutionary biologist at Kennesaw State University in Georgia who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>To date, most research on great apes’ vocal repertoires has been limited to gorillas’ charismatic cousins. Chimpanzees in captivity can blow “raspberries” and orangutans can whistle, but gorillas’ calls aren’t as well-studied. “There’s a bit of a gap in our understanding,” Taglialatela says. If chimpanzees, orangutans and now gorillas can all create novel vocalizations, an ability present in humans but rare across the animal kingdom, it’s possible that the ancestor of these animals and humans did as well, he says.</p>



<p>Clay thinks that studying gorillas might offer new clues about what drives language development. A snough is not the same as speech, she points out, but it could be a sign that there’s more to gorillas than meets the ear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-sponge-snot-rocket-mucus-pore">Sea sponges launch slow-motion snot rockets to clean their pores</a></h4>

              
                <p>The next time you spot a sea sponge, say “gesundheit!” Some sponges regularly “sneeze” to clear debris<strong> </strong>from their porous bodies.</p>



<p>As filter feeders, sponges draw in water through inlet pores — called ostia — and strain it through an internal&nbsp;canal system for nutrients. But there are also inedible bits in the water, like sediment. To prevent the undesirable junk from clogging up their outer pores, a Caribbean tube sponge (<em>Aplysina archeri</em>)<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01118-6"> uses mucus to trap and sneeze out unwanted particles</a>, Niklas Kornder, a marine biologist at the University of Amsterdam, and colleagues report online August 10 in <em>Current Biology</em>. To the team’s surprise, it found that the sponge expels its snot from the same pores through which it absorbs water.</p>





<p>It’s “like someone with a runny nose,” says team member Sally Leys, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. “It&#8217;s constantly streaming, but it&#8217;s going counterflow to the in-current.”</p>



<p>Researchers knew that sponges used contractions dubbed “sneezing” to move water through their bodies in a one-way flow. Typically, water comes in through numerous ostia and leaves through the osculum, a hole near the sponges’ top.</p>



<p>But when the team captured time-lapse video of <em>A. archeri</em>, it saw tiny specks of mucus exiting from the ostia, moving against the flow of incoming water. Sneezelike contractions appeared to expel and move the specks along a “mucus highway” across the surface of the sponge to points where they collected in stringy, gooey clumps. Unlike an explosive human sneeze, the sponges slowly and continuously secreted debris-laden mucus from their ostia, with one contraction taking between 20 and 50 minutes, the study finds.</p>

</div><figcaption>The Caribbean tube sponge (<em>Aplysina archeri</em>) uses contractions — called &#8220;sneezes&#8221; — to help eject mucus from its pores, or ostia. As the time-lapse video zooms in closer, it’s possible to see tiny specks of debris floating out of these pores and traveling along a “mucus highway” where they collect into stringy clumps of goo floating above the surface of the sponge. In real time, this sponge takes between 20 and 50 minutes to complete a sneeze.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other sea critters feast on these ocean boogers, like brittle stars and small crustaceans. Scientists view sponges primarily as habitat builders, but the mucus buffet shows they also perform an important function as food providers, says Amanda Kahn, a marine biologist at Moss Landing Marine Labs in California who was not involved with this work.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s so much to be said for a study that really spends time and watches,” Kahn says. “They let the animals show for themselves what was happening.”</p>



<p>Most sponges appear to sneeze, so it’s likely not just <em>A. archeri</em> that uses the counterflow technique, Leys says.&nbsp;The team also noted a similar behavior in an Indo-Pacific sponge (<em>Chelonaplysilla</em> sp). But biologists need to dig deeper to figure out how widespread the mechanism is. It’s also unclear exactly what the mucus is or how it’s moving backward through pores.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balloons-earthquake-detection-venus-geology">How balloons could one day detect quakes on Venus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The balloon was floating over the Pacific Ocean when the first sound waves hit. For 11 seconds, a tiny device dangling beneath the large, transparent balloon recorded sudden, jerky fluctuations in air pressure: echoes of an earthquake more than 2,800 kilometers away.</p>



<p>That scientific instrument was one of four hovering high above the Malay Archipelago on December 14, 2021. That day the quartet became <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098844">the first network of devices to monitor an earthquake from the air</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>





<p>The finding could help scientists track earthquakes in remote areas on Earth, and also opens the door to one day sending specially equipped balloons to study the geology of other worlds, including our closest planetary neighbor.</p>



<p>“Venus is the sister planet of Earth, but it’s the evil twin sister,” says David Mimoun, a planetary scientist at the University of Toulouse in France. “We don’t know why the two planets are so different. That’s why we need measurements.”</p>



<p>The idea of using balloons to study far-off rumblings on Earth has its roots in the Cold War. In the 1940s, the U.S. military launched a top secret project to spy on Soviet nuclear weapons testing using microphones attached to balloons floating high in the atmosphere. When the ground shakes, it releases low-frequency sound waves that can travel long distances in the atmosphere. The military planned on using the microphones to pick up on the sound of the ground shaking from a nuclear explosion. But the project was eventually deemed too expensive and dropped — though not before one of the balloons crashed in New Mexico, launching the Roswell conspiracy.</p>



<p>For decades after, balloon science stayed mostly in the realm of meteorology. Then in the early 2000s, Mimoun and his colleagues started experimenting with using balloons for space exploration, specifically for studying extraterrestrial quakes.</p>



<p>Analyzing temblors is one of the main ways that scientists can learn about a planet’s interior. On worlds with thin atmospheres, such as Mars or Earth’s moon, this generally means sending a lander to the surface and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">measuring quakes directly on the ground</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/22</em>).</p>



<p>But doing that on Venus isn’t really an option. The dense atmosphere means that the planet’s surface has about the same pressure as Earth’s deep ocean, with temperatures averaging around 450° Celsius — hot enough to melt lead. “Basically, it’s hell,” Mimoun says.</p>



<p>Landers have made it to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/unveiling-venus-hot-and-stifling">surface of Venus</a> before (<em>SN: 6/19/76</em>). But these probes lasted only a few hours before succumbing to the extreme heat and pressure. The chances of measuring a quake in that short time frame are slim, says Siddharth Krishnamoorthy, a research technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. So while radar images of Venus have revealed a world dotted with volcanoes, scientists still don’t know for sure if Venus is geologically active, he says.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously experimented with the idea of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-could-detect-quakes-venus">detecting quakes on Venus using orbiters</a> (<em>SN: 9/02/05</em>). But quake-detecting balloons have better resolution, says Mimoun, meaning they could provide the key to revealing the planet’s interior life. But first Mimoun and his colleagues had to show that they could design devices small enough to be carried by balloons but sensitive enough to pick up earthquakes far below.</p>



<p>In 2021, the team attached micro-barometers to 16 balloons launched from the Seychelles Islands, off the coast of East Africa. In December, four balloons — having drifted thousands of kilometers apart — recorded similar, low-frequency sound waves. These changes in air pressure resembled ground readings of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake near the Indonesian island of Flores, indicating that the sound waves were produced by the earthquake. The researchers were able to use the changes in air pressure to pinpoint the epicenter of the quake and calculate its magnitude.</p>

<h3>Balloon science</h3>



<p>On December 14, 2021, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake originated in Indonesia’s Flores Sea. High in the atmosphere, four balloons with barometers detected changes in air pressure that resembled ground readings of the quake.

<p>“This is a huge step forward in demonstrating the utility of this technology,” says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Even without being able to pick up quakes, the balloons, if designed to survive in the Venusian atmosphere, might be able to detect changes in air pressure that reveal clues about the planet’s volcanic eruptions and mysterious highlands, Byrne says.</p>



<p>Venus is entering a renaissance of interest from space agencies. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">At least two NASA missions to visit the planet are planned</a> for the end of this decade (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). Mimoun is hoping that earthquake-detecting balloons will feature in the next major mission, emphasizing that their data could help researchers understand why Earth and Venus — alike in size and distance from the sun, relative to the other planets — have gone down such different paths.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We have no clue,” Mimoun says. “So we need to go back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beaver-relocation-climate-change-dam-stream">Relocated beavers helped mitigate some effects of climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the upper reaches of the Skykomish River in Washington state, a pioneering team of civil engineers is keeping things cool. Relocated beavers boosted water storage and lowered stream temperatures, indicating such schemes could be an effective tool to mitigate some of the effects of climate change.</p>



<p>In just one year after their arrival, the new recruits <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4168">brought average water temperatures down by about 2 degrees Celsius</a> and raised water tables as much as about 30 centimeters, researchers report in the July <em>Ecosphere.</em> While researchers have discussed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stream-survival-beaver-dam-simple-structures-wildfires-drought">beaver dams as a means to restore streams and bulk up groundwater</a>, the effects following a large, targeted relocation had been relatively unknown (<em>SN: 3/26/21</em>).</p>





<p>“That water storage is so critical during the drier periods, because that&#8217;s what can keep the ecosystem resilient to droughts and fires,” says Emily Fairfax, an ecohydrologist at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>The Skykomish River flows down the west side of Washington’s Cascade Mountains. Climate change is already transforming the region’s hydrology: The snowpack is shrinking, and snowfall is turning to rain, which drains quickly. Waters are also warming, which is bad news for salmon populations that struggle to survive in hot water.</p>



<p>Beavers are known <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/got-environmental-problem-beavers-could-be-solution">to tinker with hydrology too</a> (<em>SN: 7/27/18</em>). They build dams, ponds and wetlands, deepening streams for their burrows and lodges (complete with underwater entrances). The dams slow the water, storing it upstream for longer, and cool it as it flows through the ground underneath.</p>



<p>From 2014 to 2016, aquatic ecologist Benjamin Dittbrenner and colleagues relocated 69 beavers (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) from lowland areas of the state to 13 upstream sites in the Skykomish River basin, some with relic beaver ponds and others untouched. As beavers are family-oriented, the team moved whole clans to increase the chances that they would stay put.</p>



<p>The researchers also matched singletons up with potential mates, which seemed to work well: “They were not picky at all,” says Dittbrenner, of Northeastern University in Boston. Fresh logs and wood cuttings got the beavers started in their new neighborhoods.</p>



<p>At the five sites that saw long-term construction, beavers built 14 dams. Thanks to those dams, the volume of surface water — streams, ponds, wetlands — increased to about 20 times that of streams with no new beaver activity. Meanwhile below ground, wells at three sites showed that after dam construction the amount of groundwater grew to more than twice that was stored on the surface in ponds. Stream temperatures downstream of the dams fell by 2.3 degrees C on average, while streams not subject to the beavers’ tinkering warmed by 0.8 degrees C. These changes all came within the first year after relocation.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re achieving restoration objectives almost instantly, which is really cool,” Dittbrenner says.</p>



<p>Crucially, the dams lowered temperatures enough to almost completely take the streams out of the harmful range for salmon during a particularly hot summer. “These fish are also experiencing heat waves within the water system, and the beavers are protecting them from it,” Fairfax says. “That to me was huge.”</p>



<p>The study also found that small, shallow abandoned beaver ponds were actually warming streams, perhaps because the cooling system had broken down over time. Targeting these ponds as potential relocation sites could be the most effective way to bring temperatures down, the researchers say. &nbsp;When relocated populations establish and breed, young beavers leaving their homes could seek those abandoned spots out first, Dittbrenner says, as it uses less energy than starting from scratch. “If they find a relic pond, it&#8217;s game on.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
