<p><i>By</i> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>To punch holes in a scientific claim, it’s legitimate to critique the supporting evidence, or query the way the evidence has been interpreted. More questionable is to throw dirt on the character or capability of the researcher making the claim. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192025">New research</a> in <i>PLOS One </i>explores<i> </i>the effectiveness of ad hominem attacks against scientists and shows that some are more damaging than others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-33675"></span></p>
<p>Ralph Barnes of Montana State University and his team asked around 500 undergraduate students to review a number of scientific claims, each attributed to a named researcher, such as “Dr Martinez”. The claims were either obscure or invented, to avoid hot-button issues where the participants might already have strong immovable views (e.g. “According to Dr. Martinez at the University of Oklahoma, dibutylphthalate, a chemical used in Gold Bond foot powder, decreases the risk of some kinds of cancer”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All the claims came with additional information that was either neutral (it didn’t challenge the claim) or that critiqued the researcher (ad hominem attacks) or the science behind his or her claim (e.g. pointing out issues with the supporting study itself, like the lack of a control group).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The ad hominem attacks either referred to past misconduct, like fabrication of previous data, conflict of interest (e.g. financed by a drug company with interests in the finding), education (e.g. low standards at the university from which he got a degree), or reports of sloppiness from his or her peers. One final type of criticism pointed at both the researcher and the study, for example an investigation that suggested he or she had fabricated this particular dataset.</p>
<p>Participants rated how much faith they held in each scientific claim. Ad hominems involving education and sloppiness did not sway participants from the default level of support that they showed when the claim was presented without criticism. But a conflict of interest or past misconduct lowered faith in the claim just as much as hearing about faults in the research supporting the claim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What’s more, personal allegations of vested interest or past misconduct were just as damning as hearing that the researcher was implicated specifically in falsifying <i>the very</i> research that supported the claim they were making. It seems that participants could forgive suggestions that a researcher was not top-notch, but suspicions about their past motives and integrity were sufficient to pour cold water on their claims. This pattern was replicated in a sample of around 200 non-students with a wider age range (23-83, mean 49 years).</p>
<p>One criticism of the new findings is the abstract measure of participants’ faith in the claims (rather asking whether they would act on the claims, for instance). But previous use of the same paradigm has shown that this measure predicts more concrete intentions, like which of two prescription drugs a participant says they would personally use. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Although an ad hominem attack is considered a logical fallacy, the participants’ reactions in the new research are not strictly speaking illogical: if someone has cheated in the past, it may be reasonable for that to colour your view of their current work. Barnes and his team expected that this would especially be the case when the allegations of bad behaviour pertained specifically to the evidence underlying a researcher’s claims – but in fact the findings suggest that any allegations of past bad behavior, whether directly relevant or not, made a researcher’s claims appear equally suspect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The strong effect of the conflict of interest ad hominem is also worth noting. It’s reasonably easy for critics to allege or imply a conflict of interest, especially for those willing to entertain a conspiratorial perspective. This may explain why groups hostile to scientific developments, such as vaccination, put such weight on these issues – because it works.</p>

In 2009, a university announced a prominent researcher in the field of protein crystallography had likely fabricated nearly a dozen protein structures. Nine years later, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has upheld the results — and announced a relatively long sanction, by the agency’s standards. Today, the ORI placed a 10-year ban on … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/04/10/infamous-case-of-fraud-by-protein-crystallographer-ends-in-10-year-funding-ban/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Infamous case of fraud by protein crystallographer ends in 10-year funding ban</span></a>

<p>Basic neuroscience teaches us how individual brain cells communicate with each other, like neighbours chatting over the garden fence. This is a vital part of brain function. Increasingly however neuroscientists are zooming out and studying the information processing that happens within and between neural networks across the entire brain, more akin to the complex flow of digital information constantly pulsing around the globe.</p>
<p>This has led them to realise the importance of what they call “brain entropy” – intense complexity and irregular variability in brain activity from one moment to the next, also marked by greater long-distance correlations in neural activity. Greater entropy, up to a point, is indicative of more information processing capacity, as opposed to low entropy – characterised by orderliness and repetition – which is seen when we are in a deep sleep or coma.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21008-6">study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> is the first to examine whether and how ingesting a psychostimulant – in this case caffeine – affects brain entropy. The results show caffeine causes a widespread increase in cerebral entropy. This dose of neural anarchy is probably welcome, especially considered in light of another new <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191582">paper</a>, in <em>PLOS One</em>, which finds greater brain entropy correlates with higher verbal IQ and reasoning ability.</p>
<p><span id="more-33665"></span></p>
<p>For the caffeine study, Da Chang at Hangzhou Normal University in China and other researchers scanned the brains of 60 participants – 30 men and women – at baseline, and also after they ingested a 200mg caffeine pill (roughly approximate to two cups of coffee). It was a “resting-state” scan meaning that the participants simply lay in the scanner doing nothing. For both scans, Chang’s team analysed changing neural activity levels from one moment to the next, and looked for correlations in activity across and within brain regions to calculate brain entropy. They also measured changes in cerebral blood flow across the brain.</p>
<p>The scans showed that caffeine increased brain entropy across nearly the entire cerebral cortex, but especially in “lateral prefrontal cortex, the DMN [default mode network, involving in day-dreaming and self-reflection], visual cortex, and motor network”, which the researchers linked to caffeine’s known beneficial effects on “attention, vigilance, and action/motion function.” There was little correlation locally between increased entropy and cerebral blood flow (which was reduced by caffeine), suggesting the effects of the caffeine were via influences on neuronal function, rather than due to vascular changes.</p>
<p>“Increased resting brain entropy indicates increased resting brain activity irregularity or complexity, suggesting an increase of information processing capacity in the resting brain,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a separate group led by Glenn Saxe at New York University’s School of Medicine used the same methods as Chang’s team to measure brain entropy in 900 healthy participants, who also completed measures of their verbal intelligence and reasoning ability outside of the scanner. The New York researchers defined brain entropy as “a measure of the brain’s overall flexibility or readiness to encounter unpredictable stimuli” and they found that it correlated with intelligence.</p>
<p>Specifically, superior vocabulary performance was associated with greater resting-state entropy in the left inferior frontal lobe, while superior reasoning ability was associated with greater entropy in that same region, but also in bilateral prefrontal areas.</p>
<p>Saxe and his colleagues said that “entropy in this context provides an indicator of the brain’s general readiness to process unpredictable stimuli from the environment” – a brain with greater entropy may in effect be better able to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787">model and predict the outcomes of a complex, chaotic world</a>. The researchers added, though, that they had not measured “the active use of brain states during a particular task”. Indeed, follow up research is now needed to see how brain entropy varies during performance of specific mental challenges, and how caffeine and other substances might affect entropy during such tasks.</p>
<p>In contrast to the entropy–intelligence association, participants’ age and years of education did not correlate with their IQ test scores. “These results suggest that entropy is a reliable predictor of intelligence, and provides unique information not captured by developmental status and educational status alone,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>The new findings add to past research measuring neural entropy that’s shown <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24183857">entropy is reduced in adults diagnosed with ADHD</a>, for example, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654848">in people addicted to cocaine</a>. However, the story is not as simple as more entropy is good, less is bad. For instance, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095146">patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have greater neural entropy</a> than healthy controls, perhaps indicative of “an underlying dysregulation of more complex functional networks”.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the research on neural entropy develops in the future. For now, it is enough to marvel that as you enjoy your morning coffee, you are increasing the entropy throughout your brain – the bitter tonic is not merely waking you up, but apparently also boosting your brain’s useful anarchy, its complexity and information processing capacity.</p>

While it might seem like a tiresome administrative job, setting the budget has a big influence on your chances of success – both in terms of winning the funding and administering the project successfully.  It’s also an area where junior PIs are offered little or no guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s start with a few definitions. </strong></p>
<p>Grant budgets are often divided into <em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em> costs.  In a nutshell, direct costs are for things that just wouldn’t happen without the grant – wages for dedicated staff in new posts, paying participants for their time, the cost of any questionnaires or other materials you’re using. Indirect costs are contributions to things which would be paid anyway – like a portion of the time of an existing member of staff. You might cost for 5% of the salary of a technician, or senior advisor, which should equate to them spending a couple of hours per week on your project.</p>
<p>Another key phrase is Full Economic Costing, or FEC (don’t smirk). This is when a funder pays for various <em>indirect costs</em> and <em>estates costs</em> linked to your grant.  For example, a University provides buildings with heating and electricity, furniture and IT support, kitchens and meeting rooms. Staff on your grant will have access to a library and various support services.  All of these cost money and FEC is a way to assign some of that cost to incoming grants.  Not all funders cover FEC (e.g. charities tend not to, but UK research councils do make a contribution). Warning: FEC is always way more than you think. It can as much as double the cost of a single member of staff. So if there is an upper limit on what you can apply for, and FEC is included in this, you need to rein in your plans for what you’ll spend on equipment or post-doc salaries. Seek advice early on from a grants officer (more on this below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Budgeting basics</strong></p>
<p>You’re going to want to start with a nice Excel spreadsheet or similar – ask a colleague if they have an old one you can use as a template. It might be that your department has a financial administrator that can send you an up-to-date one – Universities have a habit of changing the details of how costs are calculated. Once you have your template, it can be easiest at the start to break down costs by activity – so you list all the participant payment, questionnaires, and travel costs associated with Study 1, Study 2 etc. However, when you submit your budget to the funder, you will want to group them by category.  All the travel costs will get summed together, and all the ‘consumables’ (anything that gets used once and can’t be used again – like postage or IQ-test forms – as distinct from “equipment” which can be re-used, like a laptop) will be in a different total. So make sure you label each cost according to type and then you can easily re-order your file and get the totals you need.</p>
<p>Each funder asks for costs organised in subtly different ways too.  They might want them broken down by year of the project, or use particular headings. EU funding want salary costs organised into “person-hours” which are utterly fiendish. Some funders might define “equipment” as only things that cost £2000 or more.  Others might pay for salaries but only allow them to be a certain proportion of the total budget. Check these constraints at the start and make sure you label and organise your budget accordingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Getting support and approval</strong></p>
<p>Another key thing to check up front is the relevant permissions you need to go through, in your host institution. At the University of Cambridge (and probably others), certain forms may need submitting weeks in advance (sometimes months), and in many cases these will need some details from your budget. Check this out well in advance to avoid stress. Salaries in particular will need to be aligned with your institution’s pay-scales.  You should have a conversation with someone – probably a grants officer in your department – about the right pay grade to cost for a research assistant with a Masters degree, versus a lab technician, versus a post-doc. Don’t cost at the bottom point of the grade for a new post that you are going to advertise – costing at the middle or top of a grade range will give you freedom to negotiate with the applicant and offer an attractive salary. Normally the amount you should put in your budget for, say, a two-year full time post-doc, will be provided by the grants officer. You don’t just google it like Sue did with her first ever grant! Get the ballpark figures early on so you know what you’ve got to play with in the total budget. And always remember that your grants officer is being constantly bombarded with requests for costs, often at very short notice.  Contact them early on, keep them in the loop, and agree a rough timeline for preparing the application as partners.</p>
<p>Some funders only cover partial costs for large items of equipment.  Others won’t pay salary contributions for existing staff but will pay for teaching “buy out”.  This is when a grant will pay the salary of someone (normally at a mid-level pay grade) to replace the time that a senior lecturer or professor might otherwise have spent teaching.  This frees-up the Prof to help with your grant, while costing the original funder a lot less. If you have these sorts of constraints on the funding, make sure you understand them and, crucially, try to get something in writing from your department to guarantee that they will comply with the grant terms and provide any top-up funding you will need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Costing staff</strong></p>
<p>Staff will normally be the biggest cost. If you’re applying for a Fellowship you’ll probably be requesting your full-time salary and maybe a %FTE (full-time equivalent: 20% FTE = one working day per week) for a senior colleague. A contribution to the time of a department administrator is also a great idea if there’s someone available, and you will have tasks for them – they could run expenses claims, book travel and monitor your budgets, saving you valuable time that you’d rather spend on science. Try not to ask for favours or trade authorship on articles for work – if you can, pay for things like specialist statistics and programming support, or for access to an assessment space. Otherwise, if the project gets funded, you are potentially beholden to others’ goodwill and availability to get things done.</p>
<p>You might also employ a research assistant or post-doc. Think carefully about the kind of skills you need, the level of independence you want from your staff, and the number of days per week you need them.  While it might seem like having someone more experienced is always a good thing, actually recruiting a research assistant with a good Masters degree is much better if you have a tightly-defined project and want someone to just get on with it. Post-docs, and PhD students, will have agendas that extend beyond the goals of your project.  While we don’t mean to suggest you shouldn’t also be offering an RA career-development opportunities and intellectual input to the work, their career stage means that just by recruiting participants, collecting and analysing data they are building and extending their skills. You need a good match between what you’re asking your employees to do, what they already know, and what they are ready to learn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What else should I ask for? </strong></p>
<p>Other big costs will be conferences, including travel, registration, accommodation – budget generously for these and try to specify the meetings so the reviewers can see you have considered carefully the appropriate place to share your findings.  Don’t just cost for you to attend – bring your team along too, or at least give each of them one chance to attend a scientific meeting. Another way to support your staff is to ensure you cost for some training expenses – obviously these need to be relevant to the project but it also means they will finish their time working with you with more skills than when they started.</p>
<p>You might want to cost for a study advisory board including community representatives – their travel to meetings, some good quality catering, maybe a stipend. If you think this is overkill or too expensive for your project, you can at least cost an “honorarium” (one-off payment) for one or two consultants to advise on your work. Sue pays autistic consultants on all new autism projects now, normally aiming for £500 per year for about ten “contact points”.  A contact point might be commenting on documents by email, attending a meeting to design the methods, or advising on recruitment pathways. Be generous in your funds for participant reimbursement too, normally estimated as an hourly rate with extra for their travel costs. For children, budget for a box of gifts that they can choose from at the end of an assessment session. If working with charities or schools you might want to include a one-off gift to the organisation. If doing an online survey you can offer a prize draw, which increases response rates without pushing your budget through the roof.</p>
<p>Don’t neglect the impact costs either.  Open access fees for journal articles are important – though some funders like the Wellcome Trust cover these for you under a separate budget. If you want to reach out to stakeholders with your results think about costing for a graphic designer, professional printing, or an animator to help you share your findings creatively. Budget generously for dissemination events – you don’t want your exciting ideas buried because of a lack of resources. Funders are becoming increasingly suspicious of researchers promising the world in terms of impact, but with no budget attached.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about cost effectiveness? </strong></p>
<p>A grant should be cost-effective.  Reviewers will be specifically asked whether they think your work represents good value for money. This doesn’t mean though that you should just cut cut cut. An under-funded project is a big risk and reviewers and funding committees will be reluctant to support something that doesn’t seem appropriately resourced. On the other hand, if you want multiple staff, or large items of new equipment you will need to properly justify these.  In the case of staff, you should be able to describe their responsibilities and these should clearly match to their proposed pay-grade and full or part-time hours. An easy way to save costs if you need to is to ask whether you need staff for the entire duration of the project – can you set it up yourself and just employ an RA when data collection begins?</p>
<p>In the case of equipment, if you are buying large and expensive items, reviewers might well ask themselves why your department doesn’t have these already, and whether you know how to use them properly. Tackle these concerns head on – maybe you have tons of EEG experience, but you need brand new kit because you’re going to be working with infants for the first time.</p>
<p>A successful grant application requires so much more than a good research idea. Your costs are a key way to show that you have thought about the practical aspects of your research.  You have a clear plan, appropriately resourced. By costing for community consultants, open access fees, or staff conference attendance, you show the reviewers your commitment to ethical science and good lab management. Budgeting your research should be an integral part of a funding application process so don’t leave it as a final afterthought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Be thorough. Be practical. Be a good scientist. </strong></p>

Her talk was a treasure trove of quotable witticisms (paraphrased):<br /><ul><li>How much ambiguity can you live with in your attempt to understand the brain?

She initially expressed some ideas that almost everyone endorses:<br /><ul><li>Good connectivity data is essential</li><li>Simultaneous recordings from many neurons is a good idea<span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">[<i>but how many is enough?</i>]</span></span></li></ul>But then she turned to the nightmare of trying to understand large-scale brain networks, as is the fashion these days in human fMRI and connectivity studies. <br /><ul><li>It's not clear what changes when circuits get big</li><li>Assuming a “return to baseline” is always hiding a change that can be cryptic</li><li>On the optimization issue... nervous systems can't optimize for one situation if it makes them unable to deal with other <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[unexpected]</span></span> situations.</li><li>How does degeneracy relieve the tyranny?</li></ul>No one knows... <br /><br />Dr. Marder was also a speaker at the <a href="http://gias.nyu.edu/canonical-computation-brains-machines-2018/" target="_blank">Canonical Computation in Brains and Machines</a> meeting in mid-March (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/neuroecology/status/974795579216809985" target="_blank">@neuroecology</a>), and her talk from that conference is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW3h6s1u3Fw" target="_blank">available online</a>.<br /><br />I believe the talks from the present symposium will be on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLEjbzpCeqJ39xD2BaxXg" target="_blank">CNS YouTube</a> channel as well, and I'll update the post if/when that happens.<br /><br />Speaking of canonical computation, now I know why Gary Marcus was apoplectic at the thought of “one canonical cortical circuit to rule them all.” More on that in a moment...<br /><br /><br />The next speaker was <b>Dr. Alona Fyshe</b>, who spoke about computational vision. MLE, MAP, ImageNet, CNNs. I'm afraid I can't enlighten you here. Like everyone else, she thought theory vs. data is a false dichotomy. Her memorable tag line was “Kill Your Darlings.” At first I thought this meant delete your best line <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[of code? of your paper?]</span></span>, but in reality “our theories need to be flexible enough to adapt to data” (always follow <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40vukovicnikola%20%23cns2018&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">@vukovicnikola #cns2018</a> for the best real-time conference coverage).<br /><br /><br />Next up was <b>Dr. Gary Marcus</b>, who started out endorsing the famous Jonas and Kording (2017) paper <span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span> <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268" target="_blank">Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?</a> <span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span> which suggested that current data analysis methods in neuroscience are inadequate for producing a true understanding of the brain. Later, during the discussion, Dr. Jack Gallant quipped that the title of that paper should have been “Neuroscience is Hard” (on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/KordingLab/status/977711252255461376">@KordingLab</a> thought this was unfair). For that matter, Gallant told Marcus, “I think you just don't like the brain.” <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[Gallant is big on data, but not mindlessly]</span></span><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j9lWyC32JJc/WslXt00w69I/AAAAAAAAMgw/OK1M4BJtkqUxLsjwK5hySBpytDkp_I8HwCLcBGAs/s1600/Jonas%2Band%2BKording%2527s%2Bconclusions.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="864" height="291" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j9lWyC32JJc/WslXt00w69I/AAAAAAAAMgw/OK1M4BJtkqUxLsjwK5hySBpytDkp_I8HwCLcBGAs/s400/Jonas%2Band%2BKording%2527s%2Bconclusions.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span>image via <a href="https://twitter.com/vukovicnikola/status/977639849019789312" target="_blank">@vukovicnikola</a></span></div><br /><br />This sparked a lively debate during the panel discussion and the Q&amp;A. <br /><br /><br />Anyway, back to Marcus. “Parsimony is a false god,” he  said. I've long agreed with this sentiment, especially when it comes to  the brain <span class="Y0NH2b CLPzrc">—</span> the simplest explanation isn't always true. Marcus is pessimistic that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">deep learning</a>  will lead to great advances in explaining neural systems (or AI). It's  that pesky canonical computation again. The cerebral cortex (and the  computations it performs) isn't uniform across regions (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/551.long" target="_blank">Marcus et al., 2014</a>).<br /><br /><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="color: red;"><b>This is not a new idea.</b></span></span> In my ancient dissertation, I cited <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016622369090082L" target="_blank" title="Is the cerebral cortex modular?">Swindale (1990)</a> and said: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Swindale  (1990) argues that the idea of mini-columns and macro-columns was drawn  on insufficient data. Instead, the diversity of cell types in different  cortical areas may result in more varied and complex organization  schemes which would adequately reflect the different types of  information stored there <i>[updated version would be </i><i>“types of computations performed there</i>”].<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span></blockquote><br />Finally, <b>Dr. Jack Gallant</b> came out of the gate saying the entire debate is silly, and that we need both theory <i>and</i> data. But he also thinks it's silly that we'll get there with theory alone. We need to build better measurement tools, stop faulty analysis practices, and develop improved experimental paradigms. He clearly favors the collection of more data, but in a refined way. For the moment, collect large rich naturalistic data sets using existing technology.<br /><br />And remember, kids, “the brain is a horror show of maps.”<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aNWVpDTb7Zo/WslyO_6wS5I/AAAAAAAAMhA/CZurNJBKfTwCKKFS2nlSR1TdOrPnTW1gQCLcBGAs/s1600/the%2Bbrain%2Bis%2Ba%2Bhorror%2Bshow%2Bof%2Bmaps.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="648" data-original-width="864" height="300" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aNWVpDTb7Zo/WslyO_6wS5I/AAAAAAAAMhA/CZurNJBKfTwCKKFS2nlSR1TdOrPnTW1gQCLcBGAs/s400/the%2Bbrain%2Bis%2Ba%2Bhorror%2Bshow%2Bof%2Bmaps.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span> image via <a href="https://twitter.com/vukovicnikola/status/977645728192520192" target="_blank">@vukovicnikola</a></span> </div><br /><br /><br /><u>Big Data AND Big Theory: Everyone Agrees</u> (sorta)<br /><br /><b>Eve Marder</b> – The Important of the Small for Understanding the Big<br /><br /><b>Alona Fyshe</b> – Data Driven Everything<br /><br /><b>Gary Marcus</b> – Neuroscience, Deep Learning, and the Urgent Need for an Enriched Set of Computational Primitives<br /><br /><b>Jack Gallant</b> – Which Presents the Biggest Obstacle to Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience Today: Lack of Theory or Lack of Data?<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RqHURR6NCRw/Wsj7V1jJwjI/AAAAAAAAMgc/R6JCgfW5PGQhwLmfe5DqazYF-J1QqUJvACLcBGAs/s1600/Gallant%2Bvs.%2BMarcus%2Bby%2B%2540CogNeuroNews.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="549" data-original-width="864" height="253" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RqHURR6NCRw/Wsj7V1jJwjI/AAAAAAAAMgc/R6JCgfW5PGQhwLmfe5DqazYF-J1QqUJvACLcBGAs/s400/Gallant%2Bvs.%2BMarcus%2Bby%2B%2540CogNeuroNews.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span>Gary Marcus talking over Jack Gallant.

This idea is tightly linked to several models of cognition including predictive coding, embodied cognition, and enactivism, among others. For simplicity, I’ll refer to the ideas presented here simply as enactivism. My goal is to visually present the most compelling aspects of this family of ideas, and then speculate (likely with excessive optimism) on just how far it can take us in explaining many aspects of what our brains do.</p><p>To start, here’s the key idea: <strong>our</strong> <strong>brains build complex models of the world around us capable of producing accurate simulations of both unperceived aspects of the present, and not yet perceived aspects of (multiple) potential futures. </strong>I want to argue that these simulations are not one tool in the cognitive shed that can be pulled out whenever complex strategic problems surface, but rather operate continuously and directly compose cognitive tasks from the lowest subconscious levels such as scanning a visual scene, to the highest forms of social awareness.<strong> </strong>Understanding how these simulations are created, updated, and leveraged for decision-making may give us insights into an array of functions which we know to be key to human intelligence, such as causal induction, prediction, planning, and even empathy.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/generative-predictive-models-f39eb8f10584">Previously</a> I suggested that, according to one theory of cognition, our brains continuously:</p><ol><li>Identify and represent increasingly abstract patterns in sensory input</li><li>Build a model of the world that generates downward flowing predictions</li><li>Calculate prediction errors to correct the model</li></ol><p>In this post, we will make these ideas ‘enactive’ by highlighting the adaptive benefits for a living thing able to model its own physical agency, that is, the way the world responds to its actions. We will start by looking at affordances as building blocks of an enactive environment and see how they may aid the identification of causes and structure in ambiguous input. We’ll then reframe prediction as simulation and test the extent to which this concept can shed light on a range of cognitive tasks.</p><h4>The Windowless Control Room: The Challenge of the Infant Brain</h4><p>In <em>Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking </em>[Ch 23]<em>, </em>Daniel Dennett poses a thought experiment that I frequently come back to as fuel for intuition about the brain’s daunting task. It goes like this. One day, instead of in your own bed you wake up in a small windowless room. Two of the walls are covered in thousands of lights blinking seemingly randomly, and the opposite two walls are covered in equally many buttons, none of them labeled. A note informs you that you’re in the head of a large robot, and warns you to be careful, because the robot’s home is full of hazards that could kill it (and you) if you make a mistake. But don’t worry! The lights on the wall are connected to thousands of sensors, cameras, etc on the robot’s body, and each button controls some actuator or behavior (like moving a leg or arm, or turning the robot’s head).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uCF66QojWMaOa0MBzW7jmA.png" />Inside the robot brain.</figure><p>In this thought experiment, you (as a personified stand-in for an infant’s brain) must somehow learn how to choose actions to make your way through the world. The problem this illustrates is that, as stated, the task is impossible: though you may notice some patterns in the lights (groupings, repeating series, even regularities that look like causal relationships) you have no direct access to the outside world (no window), and as such there’s no way to identify when the robot is in the vicinity of good things, or bad things, when it’s hanging precariously close to a cliff, or when a useful object lies in front of it.</p><p>Now imagine how much the problem changes if we say that one of those lights among the thousands glows green (while the others are red), and our note tells us that this light indicates that the robot is experiencing reward — something good is happening. Intuitively, this feels a bit more tractable since we now have a starting point, a single dimension which we can use to provide a context of valence (good thing/bad thing) to patterns we notice in the other lights. That said, this remains an incredibly challenging problem requiring our brains to develop a system to ‘understand’ the world in sufficient detail to aptly move within it, all without ever directly ‘seeing’ itself or its environment. Our best evidence that this questionably feasible problem is solvable is that each of us did survive infancy, and whatever the solution might be, we benefit from our brain’s implementation of it every millisecond.</p><h4>Active Transformations as Affordances</h4><p>The affordance is a concept from psychology that, if familiar, probably came to you via the world of user experience design, where it has become ubiquitous (and more than a little jargon-y). Defined by the concept’s originator JJ Gibson: “The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill… It implies the <em>complementarity of the animal and the environment</em>.” [Gibson 1979]. In enactivism, the internal representation of such opportunities for interaction play a critical role. We will expand the definition accordingly: enactive affordances are cognitive modules that have learned to both <em>recognize</em> and <em>facilitate</em> transitions in sensory input, whether we physically cause these transitions or simply observe them in the environment.</p><p>We can think of enactive affordances as being grouped into two species: motor affordances learn contextualized transitions realized by motor commands, while hidden affordances learn sensory transitions realized by external causes in the world. There are two types of sensory information that it is here useful to distinguish: exteroception (sensitivity to stimuli originating outside of the body), and interoception (sensitivity to stimuli originating inside of the body such as affective/emotional responses). A button affords (in the motor sense) pushing, ie <em>I</em> can push the button to realize the transformation <em>Button.Off</em> → <em>Button.On</em>. Similarly, a dog affords (in the hidden, external sense) barking, ie the dog may (of its own volition) bark, which has an immediate impact on the sensory environment: <em>Noise.Quiet</em> → <em>Noise.Barking. </em>Though it is sometimes easier to think about these exteroceptive transitions, a given enactive affordance can learn transitions of either type.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8J_lnQDZMRiEdYV2GzWXFw.gif" />Recruiting affordances: learning to perceive and generate perceptual transitions in the world. Left: the motor affordance ‘push’ learns the transition from B<em>utton</em>.Off to Button.On. Right: the hidden affordance ‘bark’ learns the transition from Noise.Quiet to Noise.Barking.</figure><p>Let’s consider how such afforded transitions might be learned and imagine the grid of lights from Dennett’s thought experiment. Since we are told these lights indicate sensed information from the environment, we expect there to be structure in the signal (both spatial: groups of lights that are often on simultaneously, and temporal: relationships in which one group of lights frequently turns on after another). Assume you noticed that a group of lights (which we’ll call S1) is often (but not always) followed by another group (which we’ll call S2). Imagine now that you notice a third group of lights that appears to predict whether S1 will be followed by S2. You might infer that this third group (illustrated as P or B above) is responsible for (a cause of) the transition S1 → S2. If, as in the ‘Push’ example, P is linked to the motor system, you have just learned to detect a useful affordance: in the present context, when perceiving S1, if I take action P, I’ll perceive S2.</p><p>As we’ll see shortly, the exact same networks that detect such afforded perceptual transitions may themselves allow the brain to generate the perception of (ie simulate) the transition, regardless of the state of the outside world.</p><h4>Context: Maps of Associated Affordances</h4><p>One of the key ideas behind enactivist theories is that these affordances are the building blocks of our perceptive environment: we do not perceive individual features or discrete objects, only the opportunities for action they offer. When we view an object in a particular state our brains automatically present us with several, or perhaps a multitude of possible states that could be achieved via our learned affordances. As we take action we move into new hierarchical contexts and our affordance repertoire is updated as well, offering a new set of possibilities for bringing the capabilities of our motor system in line with the external world. The result might be visualized as a map, or more formally, a graph.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/782/1*vulNry9NKspEK0umY9rAjA.gif" />A simple robot living in a trivial ‘ring world’, by learning affordances in a given context, can generate an internal map useful for prediction, and perhaps action selection.</figure><p>Above we can see a trivial case of such an affordance map, that of a robot in a ring world. It can rotate left and right to move between three visual states (red, green, and blue). Having learned the simple dynamics of this world, when the robot perceives red, this map indicates that two affordances are available: the robot can change its state in the world to perceive green (by turning left), or blue (by turning right). In this illustration, only an overt action (actually turning either right or left) can produce the visual transformation. The concept of an affordance map becomes much more useful when we consider how this relates to prediction, and hence simulation. Our robot, even with a trivial cognitive capability that can be fully represented in the four nodes at left, ‘knows’ something about the world, e.g., it can predict its future from its present.</p><h4>Simulation &amp; Active Inference</h4><p>In the previous post I framed the problem of causal induction (identifying the right cause based on the data currently available) as one of pattern recognition, generation of predicted sensory inputs, and finally a calculation of prediction error when the input disagrees with the expectation. Here I want to suggest a subtle adjustment to this perspective which I alluded to before.</p><p>Once it has learned a causal graph, a group of enactive affordances, our brain can realize a powerful tactic: each affordance can be inverted to simulate its effects, and by doing so not just predict but <em>simulate</em> the future. In the absence of sensory contradiction the generative simulation is allowed to run forward under its own power. And even more usefully, we are not limited to a single passive projection of what’s likely to happen next, we can leverage our array of cognitive and motor affordances to simulate <em>multiple </em>futures, each unfolding probabilistic step after probabilistic step as a result of a different contingency, and each with a distinct expected sensory result.</p><p>The beauty (and surrealism) of the representation suggested here is that our brains both model and experience every aspect of the world with the only raw materials available: there is no light, no sound, just billions of networked neurons. Within this representation, our brains don’t need to wait for the dog to jump, they can imagine it; we don’t need to grab a scalding pot handle, we can activate the <em>Handle.Grab</em> affordance prior to action and physically experience a low level simulation of the (painful) interoceptive results. It’s easy to allow the misnomer of ‘imagination’ to fool us here — there is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_theater">theater</a> in the brain to project dramatized images of reality for some intelligent decider to act upon — the experience of the simulation is made of the exact same stuff as the physical (grounded) sensation.</p><p>These simulations are a new look at the generative piece of the generative predictive model, and seeing them as such will help illustrate the immense functional benefits of simulation within this theory of empirical enactivism.</p><blockquote>“When used in the forward direction (from action to outcome), these associations permit the prediction of the sensory consequences of possible actions. When used in the backward direction (from outcome to action), the implicit mapping enables the selection of an action that produces the (desired) consequences.” —<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779150/"> Pezzulo et al 2015</a></blockquote><p>Our simulations are things of change — we do not model and investigate frozen worlds — they unfold temporally in parallel with (but importantly not constrained by) our perception of time. This cognitive strategy can, like a DJ with a turntable, run simulations faster than physics allows; it can skip the predictable nodes in the affordance map and focus on the most ambiguous anticipated moments. And this is where empiricism comes in: it can simulate multiple alternative decisions (or, more generally, competing hypotheses), weigh the outcomes of each, and choose a path accordingly.</p><p>Neuroscience has provided evidence for neural representations (observed as correlations of activity as measured by an fMRI machine) of everything from low level visual properties like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050589">color</a>, to <a href="http://gallantlab.org/index.php/publications/natural-speech-reveals-the-semantic-maps-that-tile-human-cerebral-cortex/">words</a>, to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3251">specific people</a>. Simulation theory posits that not only do these neurons activate in <em>response</em> to a conscious experience of these concepts, but that a key role of each representation is generation. In this way, coalitions of activating contexts produce perceptual simulations that unfold in time in a way that is consistent with the learned probabilistic dynamics (the most likely sequences) in the world. This shouldn’t be too surprising since we can verify our brain’s incredible knack for this easily: imagine hitting a nail into a two-by-four. What happened? Not only did you just confirm that it’s possible to get a cylinder of iron into a block of wood, but you probably visualized that to do so you’d typically use a hammer, and you probably experienced an echo of the sensations you’d feel when performing this action: the handle pushing back against your hand, the sound of metal against metal, and possibly even a hint of fear as you consider a painful miss.</p><h4>Simulation in Perception, Prediction, and Planning</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KfgC2KOghxVIqOHbHi9NFw.png" />Ocular simulation as perceptual ‘filling in’ — abstract representations of potential gaze targets produce the experience of a complete and rich visual field</figure><p>One of the fascinating potential extensions of simulation theory is in the realm of perception. Could it be that the magical ‘filling in’ of our perceptual world (remember that the fovea of your eye produces a shockingly small radius of detail, despite what appears to be a rich visual scene), can be explained by simulation as well? Consider that just as we have motor affordances such as extending a finger to push a button, actions as subtle and typically subconscious as eye movements (saccades) are also generated by our motor system. Contexts that present themselves to us visually may, then, present ocular affordances: the percept of the trunk of a tree affords the ocular motor commands necessary to produce a visual transition to its branches above. If simulations are indeed happening constantly, and exploring (and generating) multiple futures conditioned on a variety of afforded actions, by extension we must at all times be simulating the effects of plausible saccades — imagining the visuals we’d experience if we were to look up, left, wherever.</p><p>Let’s look at the case of simulating visual actions in a little more detail. Imagine viewing a printed letter through a microscope, and seeing the cropped image in the left box below. You’d likely have guessed you were looking at an ‘i’, a ‘j’, or noted the ambiguity — it’s one or the other but impossible to tell which.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/711/1*IMdkzApakVxn0e6wCjtOfg.png" />Visual perception as ocular simulation. Saccade.Down produces conflicting futures (‘bottom of i’ and ‘bottom of j’) that demand resolution via action. Saccade.Up is simulated with consensus from both hypotheses, and does not require validation via action.</figure><p>Resolving what we might call causal ambiguity is a crucial and rarely conscious part of perception. When viewing the ambiguous image of the cropped letter, we might recruit two possible actions: we can move our eyes slightly up or slightly down to reveal the content above or below the current field of view. Simulations of these two afforded actions partially activate the same networks we’d use in the overt action (the actual saccade), but without executing them. Because we’ve seen the letters i and j many times before we have a memory of the features that compose each. <em>Saccade.Up</em> is guaranteed to produce the percept of a dot atop a letter, but the simulation of <em>Saccade.Down </em>is ambiguous. To use a term coined by the father of active inference, Karl Friston, this action has a high <em>epistemic value</em>: it is very likely to resolve a conflict in our simulation, the ambiguity of ‘I’m looking at i’ vs ‘I’m looking at j’.</p><p>Though it is well beyond the scope of this post, some recent formulations of enactive cognition propose that the brain’s decision-making can be modeled by a simultaneous drive for epistemic value (resolving ambiguity in the world) and direct (intrinsic) reward.</p><h4>Implications</h4><p>There are numerous fascinating implications of enactivism and the concept of cognitive embodied simulation, especially when we apply these ideas to higher level planning on longer time scales, as well as simulations of the actions of others. For me this theory also frames an important reality: the stuff of simulation, its primary driver, might be summed up as cognitive bias. Give a brain a seed of a few abstract concepts (hammer<em>, </em>nail, two-by-four… go), and it will not only generate, but experience futures that have not yet (and maybe never will) become reality. Imagining the future by running a simplified model in this way is a computationally powerful tool, but getting it was an expensive bargain, the cost of which is a propensity for an array of misconceptions, overconfident projections, and every kind of prejudice. At times, our simulations are paper thin, and this highlights a jarring weakness in what may be a key mechanism behind each decision we make.</p><p><strong>Want to read more or see some data?</strong></p><p>See <a href="https://github.com/onejgordon/embodied-cognition-simulation/blob/master/papers.md">here</a> for a partial list of papers sharing empirical results related to enactivism or simulation theory.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=613aefe38391" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/empirical-enactivism-613aefe38391">Empirical Enactivism: How our brains simulate the world in order to experiment on the future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/">Facebook Science: How Facebook Breaks Effect Stress and Wellbeing</a></h4>

<p>Inadvertently, in the wake of recent Facebook data harvesting scandals, Elon Musk and Brian Acton spurring on Facebook users to #DeleteFacebook in past weeks and the resulting Facebook breaks could (potentially) do some good for the average users stress levels. While differences between being deleted, deactivated, or abandoned have yet to be explored, new research is the first to report that the average user can relieve physiological measures of stress by taking a break from Facebook—at least in the short-term.   </p>
<p>Findings from a 2013 survey in the Pew Research Center’s Internet &amp; American Life Project, posit that 61% of current <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/11/24/facebook-are-we-over-connected/">Facebook users</a> reported taking a “Facebook vacation,” in which they voluntarily stopped using Facebook for several weeks or more. Moreover, 20% of adults reported having once used Facebook but that they no longer did so.</p>
<p>In a study that was just published in the <em>Journal of Social Psychology</em>, researchers in Australia investigated how taking a Facebook break (i.e., abstaining from using Facebook) effects stress and wellbeing. They recruited 138 active Facebook users and split them into two groups: the Facebook use as normal and five-day Facebook break groups. </p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/02/16/cerebral-congestion-why-giving-your-brain-a-break-improves-productivity/">Taking a break </a>from Facebook lowered levels of salivary cortisol (a stress biomarker) after just five days. Yet despite this physiologically stress-relieving effect, users taking a Facebook break reported feeling lower levels of life satisfaction and wellbeing than users that continued Facebook use as normal (as measured by subjective reports from the users).</p>
<p>These seemingly contradictory effects are consistent with the general love-hate feelings about Facebook that may typify most active users, exemplified by “I’m done with Facebook” posts one minute and regular selfies and check-ins the next—its a super social tool with tonnes of obvious benefits, but often feels taxing, addictively time-wasting, forces social comparison, lowers self-esteem, and can be an <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/22/do-you-suffer-from-techno-stress/">information overload</a>.</p>
<p>Its important to remember that Facebook users in this study were not users that had reached Facebook breaking point and desired a Facebook vacation themselves. They were essentially “cut off” from Facebook for the purpose of the experiment, with the researchers reasoning that subjective feelings of life-satisfaction and well-being were lowered by removing a currently desired means of contact and connection with others, despite the break lowering stress levels by other means.    </p>
<p>At first glance, two other Facebook break studies may seem to contradict the reduced wellbeing observed from taking a Facebook break. They reported that subjects reported feeling increased wellbeing when taking a Facebook break over a one-week (study 1) or two-week (study 2) period, particularly for the heaviest Facebook users. </p>
<p>The 5-day break in the newly published cortisol study was perhaps too short to observe the decline in subjective wellbeing previously reported from longer periods of regular Facebook use. Moreover, the Facebook break was also over a weekend, which is typically a <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/12/how-to-boost-vacation-health-benefits-and-avoid-exhaustion/">wellbeing booster</a> and may have counteracted negative effects of regular Facebook use. </p>
<p>It is also important to note that the participants were recruited based on a willingness to give up Facebook for five days (and not naturally occurring Facebook vacations), and may have over-selected for people already overburdened by Facebook and seeking a good reason to have a Facebook break. However, this didn’t seem to be the case as only a handful of users reported that they expected the Facebook break to be a pleasant experience—the majority of the participants did not think a Facebook break would be a nice experience. As one participant speculated: </p>
<blockquote><p>I will probably feel…upset as my social life will be totally stopped if I cannot use Facebook and<br />
cannot find my friends in Facebook, I will also feel like left behind as I will not be able to know<br />
what has happened with my Facebook friends in the coming five days. </p></blockquote>
<p>Many participants (unprompted) expressed happiness that they could get back onto Facebook again because they felt so cut off. Naturally occurring Facebook breaks, on the other hand, may come with better improvements in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/08/stress-shortens-life/">stress levels </a>that coincide with improved wellbeing because the break is truly desired and needed.</p>
<p>This may also be why the self-reports of stress were not significantly affected (statistically speaking), despite a trend towards reporting lower stress, where their negative perceptions about being cut off from Facebook (e.g., “I’m disconnected!”) influenced their perceived stress.</p>
<p>Additionally, a moderator effect was found when participants were divided on the basis of Dunbar’s number, 150—the number of individuals with whom Dunbar suggested that any one person can maintain stable relationships with. Those with 150 or fewer friends showed a decline in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/04/less-stress-less-psychosis/">cortisol</a>, whether they took a break or continued to use Facebook as usual. However, the small number of participants who actually had fewer than 150 friends prevented them from having sufficient power to fully test these effects.</p>
<p>To really get to the bottom of all this, researchers should be asking what happens to cortisol levels (and subjective stress and wellbeing) when people are disconnected from Facebook for much longer periods (e.g., months), the mechanisms involved, and to what extent naturally occurring cyclical patterns of Facebook activity occur (where stress from Facebook builds, users disconnect and go cold turkey, and then return as their desire to feel connected again builds).   </p>
<p>The amounting evidence supports that taking short breaks from Facebook could be beneficial to both mental and physical health due to the significant role of stress and the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/20/neurological-basis-of-anxiety/">HPA axis</a> in mental and physical disorders. This is particularly beneficial for people who heavily use the platform or experience too much social comparison and envy that harms their wellbeing.</p>
<p>Soon, research will likely tell us how long the breaks should be and how often and under what circumstances they should occur to get the most out of being both connected and disconnected from Facebook and perhaps <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/27/social-media-anxiety-disorders-whats-going-on-in-the-brain/">social media use</a> in general. Science can’t yet say with confidence the ways that deleting facebook and the #DeleteFacebook movement could impact users health and wellbeing, but it certainly suggests taking a #FacebookBreak if your #donewithfb. Maybe consider taking a Facebook break for lent next year. </p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2018/04/09/advances-parkinsons-disease-treatment/">Advances in Parkinson’s Disease Treatment</a></h4>

<img alt="Deep Brain Stimulation" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/Deep_Brain_Stimulation-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It has been 200 years since Dr. James Parkinson published the <em>An Essay On the Shaking Palsy</em> describing the signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite the fact that there are lots of treatment options out there to ameliorate the patient’s symptoms and to improve their quality of life, we still don’t have any neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapy to slow down disease progression. But for patients with PD, the past few years have never been so hopeful in that new candidate therapies are being developed at a very fast pace.</p>
<h3><strong>Medical Therapies</strong></h3>
<p>One of the most exciting new drugs in the pipeline is probably <strong>exenatide</strong>, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist which is currently used to treat type II diabetes. <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd171192">Preclinical studies</a> have suggested its role in inhibiting cell death, reducing oxidative stress, enhancing mitochondria function, and promoting neuronal functioning.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31585-4/fulltext">placebo controlled trial</a> evaluated the efficacy of exenatide. In this study, 62 patients with moderate PD received weekly injections of exenatide or placebo in conjunction with their regular medication.  After 48 weeks those treated with exenatide showed improvements in motor functioning while those treated with placebo worsened. Of particular interest, 12 weeks after patients discontinued the medication the beneficial effects of exenatide remained. This study showed that a GLP-1 agonist may be able to improve symptoms and be neuroprotective.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of particular interest, 12 weeks after patients discontinued the medication the beneficial effects of exenatide remained.</p></blockquote>
<p>Levodopa is a treatment for PD which increases levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain.  Unfortunately, after prolonged levodopa treatment patients with PD can develop abnormal and involuntary movements referred to as dyskinesia. This suite of symptoms is referred to as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) and it is an unmet need for people with PD.</p>
<p>The drug amantadine, specifically the immediate release form of the drug, has been used to treat LID. This form of amantadine has not been well studied and central nervous system side effects are frequent at higher doses. Recently, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710325/">clinical trial</a> tested an extended-release form of amantadine. In this study, 126 patients with PD and sufferers from dyskinesia were randomized to receive <strong>amantadine extended-release capsules</strong>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5763269/">Patients’ dyskinesia improve at 12 weeks</a>, but more excitingly the patients’ symptoms during the time off the treatment was also less compared to the placebo.</p>
<p>Another challenge that faces patients with Parkinson’s disease is motor fluctuations.  Motor fluctuations involve “on” periods where a patient responds positively while on a treatment and “off” periods where symptoms reemerge while the patient is still on the treatment. Currently there are better choices for adjunct therapy for patients with motor fluctuation.</p>
<p>A pivotal phase 3 trial tested <strong>opicapone</strong>. Opicapone could be of particular benefit for motor fluctuations since it works by preventing the breakdown of levodopa, thereby extending levels of levodopa in plasma. What’s special for this <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2594533">particular drug</a> is that it has a long duration of action and can be given as a once daily regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Istradefylline </strong>is another promising drug for PD with motor fluctuations.  Istradefylline blocks adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18339-1">recent meta-analysis</a>, istradefylline was found to be a well-tolerated drug. It decreased “off” periods and improved motor symptoms. However, since istradefylline has the potential to worsen dyskinesia it is recommended for patients in early PD who have not yet developed motor complications.</p>
<h3><strong>Deep Brain Stimulation</strong></h3>
<p>Another treatment for Parkinson’s disease is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is a rather intensive treatment in which electrodes are implanted into a certain areas of the brain. DBS often targets brain areas critical for movement such as the subthalamus. The electrodes placed in the brain can then send electrical impulses to ameliorate motor dysfunction.</p>
<p>The beneficial effects of DBS on motor function have been well documented, but there is less attention on non-motor symptoms. Overall, DBS has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28725706">shown promising effects on non-motor symptoms</a> such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, there is also evidence that DBS can improve sleep quality, musculoskeletal pain, urinary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (gastric emptying and constipation), weight loss and odor discrimination.</p>
<blockquote><p> The beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation on motor function have been well documented, but there is less attention on non-motor symptoms</p></blockquote>
<p>A new brain area is being targeted with DBS, specifically for Parkinson disease dementia. A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2665407?redirect=true">recently published study</a> used DBS surgery on the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The nucleus basalis of Meynert is the most important source for releasing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, to other brain areas critical for cognitive functioning, such as the neocortex. The rationale of this study is based on the fact that in the parkinsonian brain there is a significant deficit in brain activity related to acetylcholine. In animal models, low-frequency stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert has been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304394089903716">shown to enhance cholinergic innervation of the cortex</a>.</p>
<p>Although the study using nucleus basalis of Meynert DBS surgery didn’t show improvement in the primary cognitive outcomes, the procedure was well tolerated, opening up the possibility of DBS surgery for patients with PDD. Of interest, the authors observed a significant reduction in visual hallucination in 2 patients and decreased in the severity and frequency of dyskinesia in 3 patients, which require further exploration.</p>
<h3><strong>Focused Ultrasound Subthalamotomy</strong></h3>
<p>Prior to the development of DBS, ablative neurosurgery was widely used to treat movement disorders. Ablative neurosurgery involves the removal of a specific brain area. DBS is preferred over ablative neurosurgery due to its reversibility and documented efficacy for PD treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is our responsibility, as physicians, to obtain newest medical information and to select therapies that are most suitable for each patient.</p></blockquote>
<p>A new technique has been developed for ablating specific brain areas. Gamma-knife and MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), allows for deep brain ablating without opening the skull. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration have now approved MRgFUS for patients with essential tremor. A <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(17)30403-9/fulltext">pilot study</a> using focused ultrasound subthalatomy in patients with PD showed that it was effective, well tolerated and the adverse events seemed to be mostly mild and transient. This new technique will possibly become another treatment option in the future for patients who don’t want their brain to be opened. However, more studies with long term follow up are mandatory for confirming MRgURS’s efficacy and adverse effect.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>PD is a heterogeneous disorder and every patient is unique. As more and more new drugs, devices and techniques are being developed, individualized treatment tailoring each patient’s symptoms and needs has never been so important. It is our responsibility, as physicians, to obtain the latest medical information and to select therapies that are most suitable for each patient.</p>

<p>When my kids were toddlers, there were caches of easily-accessible toys in most rooms of our house. But perhaps I should have kept most of them stored away, and brought just a few out at a time, on rotation – because the results of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638317301613">new study</a> in <i>Infant Behaviour and Development</i> suggest that a toddler with few toy options not only spends longer playing with each one – presumably developing their attentional skills – but is also more creative in their play.</p>
<p><span id="more-33662"></span></p>
<p>Carly Dauch at the University of Toledo, US, and her colleagues studied 36 toddlers, aged between 18 and 30 months. The researchers drew from a pool of 32 toys of four types: educational toys (that teach colours, for example), “pretend” toys (that suggested themed scenarios – perhaps playing a being a doctor, for instance), action toys (that required an action such as stacking or building from the toddler, for example) and vehicles. The researchers videoed the toddlers taking part in two, 15-minute supervised play sessions: in one, they were in a room with one toy from each category (so four toys in total) and in the other, there were four from each category (so 16 in total).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that when they presented the toddlers with 16 toys, the toddlers played on average with half of them during the assessment. In contrast, when they presented them with just four toys, the kids played on average with three.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Most importantly, the amount of toys available seemed to affect the way the toddlers played. When only four toys were on offer, each of the, on average, 10 play “incidents” lasted longer – around two minutes – compared with about a minute each for the, on average, 20 play incidents in the 16-toy condition. With fewer toys, the children also came up with about 60 per cent more different ways of interacting with each toy (such as “pretending”, “inserting”, “stacking”, etc).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sixteen toys are more distracting than four, the authors conclude. Fewer available toys allow a child to focus more on a toy, to explore it more thoroughly, and to discover different ways of using it. Given evidence that young children can benefit from attention training, “an environment that presents fewer distractions may provide toddlers [with] the opportunity to exercise their intrinsic attention capabilities,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Certainly, many kids in the US and the UK, for example, are not exactly short on toys. In the UK, the toy market is worth around £3.5 billion annually, while in the US, around US$3.1 billion is spent on toys specifically for infants and pre-schoolers every year. One study of American middle class family homes reported that, on average, 139 toys were visible, with most homes having at least 100 and some as many as 250. Given these numbers, “potential disruption in play created by an abundance of toys may be even more apparent within a naturalistic environment,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, the toys used in this study did not belong to the children involved. As anyone who’s ever taken a young child to the house of another – and witnessed the subsequent play frenzy – knows, unfamiliar toys are far more exciting, and distracting than familiar ones. It isn’t very surprising that the toddlers in the 16-toy condition checked out as many as they could, as quickly as they could.</p>
<p>Of course, one way to stop young kids getting quickly bored of their toys is to restrict access to them. If hiding away most toys and making only a few available at any one time helps toddlers to develop their attentional skills – and be more creative in their play – <i>and</i> increases the odds that you’ll be able to walk through the living room without tripping over – surely it’s the way to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In late 2016, staff at the US embassy in Havana, Cuba, began to report hearing unusual sounds. Over the coming months, some staff were struck down by hearing loss and concussion-like symptoms. The strange sounds were interpreted as the cause, perhaps even reflecting a sonic weapon of an unknown nature.



The story of the 'Havana embassy attack' has been told in detail but, until recently, there were no scientific studies of the event or its aftermath.

<p>Many studies have shown ketamine to be a promising treatment for those suffering from severe <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/">depression</a>, but figuring out how to safely administer the drug has been a challenge for researchers. One hopeful delivery method was a nasal spray device because of its ease-of-use and the fact that it is less invasive than other methods such as injection. </p>
<p>But a new Australian study published in the <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em> reveals some unexpected problems with the nasal spray method. In particular, the study shows the unpredictable nature of intranasal ketamine tolerance from one person to the next.</p>
<p>Lead author Professor Colleen Loo at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), who is based at Black Dog Institute, states:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s clear that the intranasal method of ketamine delivery is not as simple as it first seemed. Many factors are at play when it comes to nasal spray ketamine treatments. Absorption will vary between people and can fluctuate on any given day within an individual based on such things as mucous levels in the nose and the specific application technique used.</p></blockquote>
<p>The pilot trial aimed to analyze the effectiveness of repeated doses of ketamine through an intranasal device amongst 10 volunteers with severe depression, ahead of a larger randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>First, the participants were given extensive training in proper self-administration techniques before receiving either a course of eight <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/28/ketamine-more-than-a-recreational-drug/">ketamine treatments</a> or an active control over a period of four weeks, under supervision at the study center.</p>
<p>Following the observation of each patients’ initial reaction to the nasal spray, the dosages were adjusted to include longer time intervals between sprays.</p>
<p>However, the trial had to be put on hold after testing with five participants resulted in unexpected problems with tolerability. Side effects included <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/01/20/blood-pressure-and-accelerated-brain-aging/">high blood pressure</a>, psychotic-like effects, and motor incoordination which left some participants unable to continue to self-administer the spray.</p>
<p>Professor Colleen Loo commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Intranasal ketamine delivery is very potent as it bypasses metabolic pathways, and ketamine is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. But as our findings show, this can lead to problems with high peak levels of ketamine in some people causing problematic side effects. Other recent studies have questioned whether changes to ketamine’s composition after being metabolised into derivative compounds may actually deliver useful therapeutic effects. It remains unclear whether ketamine nasal sprays can be safely relied upon as a treatment for patients with severe depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>Previous research led by Loo last year revealed the success of ketamine’s <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/">antidepressant </a>effects in elderly patients when delivered in repeated doses, which were adjusted on an individual basis and given by the subcutaneous method (injections under the skin):</p>
<blockquote><p>Our prior research has shown that altering the dose on an individual patient basis was important. However, we wanted to see if a simpler approach using a set dose of ketamine for all people and administered by nasal spray could work just as well in this latest pilot. More research is needed to identify the optimal level of ketamine dosage for each specific application method before nasal sprays can be considered a feasible treatment option.</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers are now recruiting participants for the world’s largest independent trial of ketamine to treat depression, to determine the safety and effects of repeated dosing using subcutaneous injections.</p>

<p>For many, their religion is a core part of their identity, the meaning they find in life, and their social world. It seems likely that changing this crucial aspect of themselves will have significant psychological consequences. A devout person would probably predict these will be unwelcome – increased emotional distress, isolation and waywardness. A firm atheist, on the other hand, might see the potential positives – perhaps the “deconvert” will grow in open-mindedness and thrive thanks to their newfound free thinking and spiritual freedom.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-10226-001">new study</a> in <i>Psychology of Religion and Spirituality </i>is among the first to investigate this question systematically and over time. The findings, which are focused on Protestant Christians, paint a complex picture. At least for this group, there is no single pattern of changes associated with losing or changing one’s religious faith, and the predictions of both the devout person and the atheist are, to some extent, accurate.</p>
<p><span id="more-33642"></span></p>
<p>Harry Hui at the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues asked their Christian Protestant participants, all Chinese, to complete the same set of psychological questionnaires on six separate occasions over a three-year period. These questionnaires measured their personality, values, beliefs and psychological symptoms.</p>
<p>Over 600 participants provided complete data and, of these, 188 stopped describing themselves as Christian at some point through the study. Just over 82 per cent switched to describing themselves as non-believers, a few re-identified as Catholic, Buddhist or Taoist, and the remainder changed their self-label to “other”.</p>
<p>Hui’s team were most interested in any psychological changes that were different in kind or magnitude between those who lost or changed their religious identity and those that kept it (they ensured both groups were matched for gender and age and student status – a majority of both groups were students).</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, there were no clear differences in personality change between the continuously religious and those that lost or altered their religious identity (for some reason the sample as a whole showed some decline in extraversion and agreeableness over time, but this was no different for the two groups). In terms of values and beliefs, the religious exiters increased more in “fate control” (believing that fate governs what happens in life, but that it is also possible to intervene in this process); and not surprisingly, they also showed a sharper decline in religiosity.</p>
<p>The most striking difference between the groups was that those who lost their Christian Protestant identity showed much greater variation in their mental well-being over time. About half of the “de-converts” showed a reduction in depression and anxiety compared with the consistently religious group, and about half showed a greater increase in depression and anxiety, although within these broad strokes were further variations in their precise emotional “trajectory”. The de-converts as a whole also showed a greater improvement in their sleep than the consistently faithful.</p>
<p>A key factor seemed to be the de-converts’ personality and psychological state prior to losing their religion. If they were more extraverted and had adequate psychological resources, losing their faith seemed to be an opportunity for growth and even greater psychological resilience. In contrast, those who were neurotic and more mentally and physically vulnerable prior to losing their faith were more likely to experience greater psychological distress after becoming a non-believer (or in a small minority of cases, a believer in a different faith).</p>
<p>“Any theory asserting that all faith exiters change in the same way should be viewed with suspicion,” the researchers said. “Religious disengagement does not reduce anxiety for all faith exiters; however a reduction does occur for some people.” This contrasts with <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rel0000082">research on converts <em>to</em> Christianity</a>, which suggested a more straightforward picture in which most people showed improvements in psychological symptoms. “The process of faith exit should not be regarded as psychologically similar to or merely a reversal of religious conversion,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>The data also allowed the researchers to look for psychological differences at the start of the study among those who subsequently lost their faith as compared with those who stayed in the same religion. Those participants who exited their religion were more likely to start out scoring lower on emotional stability, to be less trusting of others, and they tended to place less value on conformity, tradition and benevolence, and more value on self-direction, hedonism and the pursuit of power.</p>
<p>It will be up to future research to see if these findings replicate with people exiting other religions in other cultures. The researchers added that “future research with a longer time frame should address questions such as how long the change in psychological symptoms would last and whether they are only transitory for some people.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/537210314/0/oupblogpsychology/">What to do about tinnitus?</a></h4>

<p>Tinnitus (i.e., ear or head noises not caused by external sounds) is common among the general population across the world. Tinnitus can be experienced as a “ringing in the ears.” It can also sound like a hissing, sizzling, or roaring noise. It can be rhythmic or pulsating. Tinnitus can be a non-stop, constant sound or an intermittent sound that disappears and returns without a pattern. It can occur in one or both ears.</p>
<p>Tinnitus may be caused by trauma to the head (e.g., blast exposure, such as bombs or other explosive devices, or injuries to the head. such as traumatic brain injuries). It also can be caused by acoustical trauma (e.g., loud noises from earsplitting concerts, listening to music too loud). While tinnitus is different than hearing loss, individuals may have to deal with both conditions.</p>
<p>Tinnitus is a symptom of neural damage and thus reflects that an injury occurred. As a “phantom sensation” or subjective symptom, it indicates neural damage. Currently, there is no cure for subjective tinnitus. Objective tinnitus differs than the more commonly experienced subjective tinnitus; objective tinnitus can be attributed to an internal sound source, such as a pulsating blood vessel that is adjacent to the auditory nerve. Thus, surgery may improve objective tinnitus, but not subjective tinnitus.</p>
<div class="pull"><blockquote class="pullquote">“Scientists may find a cure for subjective tinnitus someday.”</blockquote></div>
<p>Scientists may find a cure for subjective tinnitus someday. Until a cure is found, extreme caution should be taken about internet promises about pills or techniques to cure tinnitus. We know from decades of research and clinical trials that there <em>are</em> some things that can help reduce suffering while having tinnitus. The following three steps can help you self-manage your tinnitus until a cure is found.</p>
<p>The first step that a person should take when experiencing tinnitus is to get a screening of the outer and inner ear and of one’s medical history by a physician or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to make sure there are no underlying medical issues that need to be treated (e.g., auditory lesions or vascular tumors).</p>
<p>A second step to take if you have tinnitus is undergo an audiological assessment. If you have a hearing impairment and tinnitus, using hearing aids can help in several ways. Hearings aids can amplify sounds from the environment, which help people pay less attention to the ‘internal noise’ created by tinnitus. Modern hearing aids also offer features of providing ‘white noise’ or other sounds that helps people pay less attention to their tinnitus. In general, it is helpful for people to <em>add</em> to their ‘sound environments’ because they will pay more attention to their tinnitus in quiet environments. This includes turning on a radio, listening to music or a podcast, turning on a fan, or using a sound generator when trying to fall asleep at night or when trying to concentrate, such as during work or school tasks.</p>
<p>A third step to take when having tinnitus is to learn stress-management techniques. Tinnitus can be incredibly annoying, frustrating, and for some people, scary when it first occurs. Psychologically-based approaches, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction and other approaches such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), help individuals manage the stress created by experiencing tinnitus. These can be learned from a counselor or psychologist, a tinnitus specialist, or from a variety of books and internet resources. For some people, stress may be a trigger for a reoccurrence of tinnitus. For others, high levels of stress can reduce their patience and increase their frustration with conditions like tinnitus. Programs like Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) teach people how to identify changeable and unchangeable stressors and how to match coping strategies with the type of stressor. For unchangeable conditions like tinnitus, people are taught that while they cannot ‘solve’ or get rid of the problem of tinnitus (given the current state of tinnitus research), they have control over their reactions to tinnitus. When people are less angry and reactive to tinnitus, they have more mental and cognitive space for the things that give them pleasure and satisfaction in life, like focusing on the goals that they want to accomplish or interacting with and helping others.</p>
<p>While subjective tinnitus can be annoying, distressing, and irritating, it is not life-threatening. Our brains will pay less attention to tinnitus when we embed ourselves in rich sound environments and get involved in tasks and events that capture our interest. Further, individuals can learn how to use numerous self-management techniques to increase their quality of life with subjective tinnitus until a cure is found.</p>

<blockquote><p>Acquisition, analysis and simulation of electrophysiological properties of the nervous system require multiple software packages. This makes it difficult to conserve experimental metadata and track the analysis performed. It also complicates certain experimental approaches such as online analysis. To address this, we developed NeuroMatic, an open-source software toolkit that performs data acquisition (episodic, continuous and triggered recordings), data analysis (spike rasters, spontaneous event detection, curve fitting, stationarity) and simulations (stochastic synaptic transmission, synaptic short-term plasticity, integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley-like single-compartment models). The merging of a wide range of tools into a single package facilitates a more integrated style of research, from the development of online analysis functions during data acquisition, to the simulation of synaptic conductance trains during dynamic-clamp experiments. Moreover, NeuroMatic has the advantage of working within Igor Pro, a platform-independent environment that includes an extensive library of built-in functions, a history window for reviewing the user’s workflow and the ability to produce publication-quality graphics. Since its original release, NeuroMatic has been used in a wide range of scientific studies and its user base has grown considerably. NeuroMatic version 3.0 can be found at http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com and https://github.com/SilverLabUCL/NeuroMatic.</p></blockquote>

<p>The US psychologist Walter Mischel famously tested children’s ability – aged four to six – to delay immediate gratification with his “Marshmallow Experiment”. It’s become a classic, not least because the children who were better at resisting one marshmallow now, for the promise of two if they waited, went on to enjoy more success in adult life. Mischel also showed that children with stronger willpower used better distraction strategies, such as looking away or covering their eyes. Now a group of Polish psychologists have extended this line of inquiry to toddlers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638316300972">The findings</a>, published in <em>Infant Behaviour and Development</em>, show that individual differences in self-control are already apparent at the tender age of 18 months. The study also reveals how self-control develops through the second year of life, and it shows the kind of toddler behaviours that were correlated with stronger willpower.</p>
<p><span id="more-33590"></span></p>
<p>Marta Bialecka-Pikul and her colleagues at Jagiellonian University recruited hundreds of toddlers and their parents. At 18 months, each toddler sat on his or her parent’s lap at a desk upon which was a corn puff treat – a hit with toddlers in Poland – under a transparent cup. The female experimenter got up and asked the toddler to wait for the treat until she returned to the room, which she did after 60 seconds. The parent was not allowed to intervene. The researchers videoed what happened while they were gone. At 24 months, the procedure was repeated, but the toddlers had to wait 90 seconds, and now the treat was tailored to their latest tastes, such as a jelly baby or chocolate.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty toddlers took part at both time points. At 18 months, 23 per cent of them successfully waited 60 seconds. At 24 months, 55 per cent of them successfully waited 90 seconds (it seems some toddlers are capable of greater willpower than adults).</p>
<p>There was clear evidence of a developmental trajectory: most of the successful delayers at 24 months had failed to wait at the first test, suggesting they had acquired greater self-control over time. Going backwards was rare: only eight per cent of those who successfully resisted at 18 months failed to do so at 24 months.</p>
<p>Coding the videos of the toddlers’ behaviour while they waited revealed 20 different types of behaviour, including: looking at, touching, playing with, and talking about the treat, as well as looking around, fidgeting, being noisy and touching themselves or their parent. Bialecka-Pikul and her team said these behaviours could be grouped into four main categories: attentional and movement based; communication; focusing on or acting on the treat in some way; and non-specific, such as fidgeting and making noises.</p>
<p>The “attention and movement” category of behaviours was most strongly correlated with successfully waiting for the treat, at both 18 months and 24 months. “Glancing, looking around, or at other objects, or touching their own bodies turned out to be the set of behaviours that most helped children to succeed while waiting,” the researchers said, adding that it “explained 61 to 70 per cent of the variance in the time of delay [i.e. how long the toddlers were able to wait]”.</p>
<p>At 24 months compared with 18 months, the children showed less focus on the treat, while they increased in the other kinds of behaviour. Also, the biggest difference between those toddlers who gained the ability to delay gratification between 18 months and 24 months and those who didn’t was that the newly successful delayers started showing more attention and movement related behaviours than they had earlier.</p>
<p>“It can be supposed that the increase in the ability to delay gratification was due to overcoming temptation by using an active strategy mainly based on the first signs of effortful attention,” the researchers said. “This result confirms the importance of such a set of behaviours for effectively delaying gratification”. Perhaps worth reminding yourself of these strategies the next time you reach for the cookie jar.</p>

<p>When I was appointed PLOS’ CEO last year, I committed myself to transparency with the communities we serve. That’s why, while this is a difficult blog to write, it’s important for me to share that I am making the hard decision to eliminate 18 positions at PLOS. Much of this is related to a strategic decision to shift from developing a proprietary platform for submissions to creating innovation partnerships with a wider community (Most readers are already aware of this from my previous blog.) It’s also driven by the need to be fiscally responsible and remain a sustainable nonprofit organization that continues to lead transformations in scientific communications.</p>
<p>I’d like to reiterate what we’ve communicated internally. Our people and their passion are the most important part of what makes PLOS so special. The people whose roles have been eliminated are all excellent at what they do, and their leaving is a result of operational decisions, not performance.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we’ll be a leaner organization. This doesn’t mean we won’t continue to fully support our researchers and scientists. We’ve been careful in where we’ve streamlined operations and those who engage with us should not see any disruption.</p>
<p>This is a pivotal moment in the life of PLOS and Open Access (OA) as it was envisioned by our founders 17 years ago. While OA has seen strong adoption, much has evolved in the landscape. Changing how and when we share, access and evaluate all research outputs is more critical to science than ever. It will take many of us working together, in various forms of partnership, to accelerate and advance a culture and ecosystem of open innovation.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, I’ve been part of multiple transformations in publishing. This is what’s most exciting and daunting about our industry. Disruption takes stamina and a willingness to embrace the unknown while acting responsibly in the moment. This is our goal and commitment as we explore ways to drive innovation in our industry forward.</p>
<p>You’ll continue to hear from me throughout the year as I share our wins and our challenges toward that vision. It’s my hope that through transparency and open dialogue, we can maintain the trust our community has placed in us.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxix-the-free-energy-principle/">What is computational neuroscience? (XXIX) The free energy principle</a></h4>

<p>The free energy principle is the theory that the brain manipulates a probabilistic generative model of its sensory inputs, which it tries to optimize by either changing the model (learning) or changing the inputs (action) (<a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20-%20a%20rough%20guide%20to%20the%20brain.pdf">Friston 2009</a>; <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20A%20unified%20brain%20theory.pdf">Friston 2010</a>). The “free energy” is related to the error between predictions and actual inputs, or “surprise”, which the organism wants to minimize. It has a more precise mathematical formulation, but the conceptual issues I want to discuss here do not depend on it.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be seen as an extension of the Bayesian brain hypothesis that accounts for action in addition to perception. It shares the <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxviiithe-bayesian-brain/">conceptual problems of the Bayesian brain hypothesis</a>, namely that it focuses on statistical uncertainty, inferring variables of a model (called “causes”) when the challenge is to build and manipulate the structure of the model. It also shares issues with the <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-brief-critique-of-predictive-coding/">predictive coding</a> concept, namely that there is a conflation between a technical sense of “prediction” (expectation of the future signal) and a broader sense that is more ecologically relevant (if I do X, then Y will happen). In my view, these are the main issues with the free energy principle. Here I will focus on an additional issue that is specific of the free energy principle.</p>
<p>The specific interest of the free energy principle lies in its formulation of action. It resonates with a very important psychological theory called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"><em>cognitive dissonance theory</em></a>. That theory says that you try to avoid dissonance between facts and your system of beliefs, by either changing the beliefs in a small way or avoiding the facts. When there is a dissonant fact, you generally don’t throw your entire system of beliefs: rather, you alter the interpretation of the fact (think of political discourse or in fact, scientific discourse). Another strategy is to avoid the dissonant facts: for example, to read newspapers that tend to have the same opinions as yours. So there is some support in psychology for the idea that you act so as to minimize surprise.</p>
<p>Thus, the free energy principle acknowledges the circularity of action and perception. However, it is quite difficult to make it account for a large part of behavior. A large part of behavior is directed towards goals; for example, to get food and sex. The theory anticipates this criticism and proposes that goals are ingrained in priors. For example, you expect to have food. So, for your state to match your expectations, you need to seek food. This is the theory’s solution to the so-called “dark room problem” (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347222/">Friston et al., 2012</a>): if you want to minimize surprise, why not shut off stimulation altogether and go to the closest dark room? Solution: you are not expecting a dark room, so you are not going there in the first place.</p>
<p>Let us consider a concrete example to show that this solution does not work. There are two kinds of stimuli: food, and no food. I have two possible actions: to seek food, or to sit and do nothing. If I do nothing, then with 100% probability, I will see no food. If I seek food, then with, say, 20% probability, I will see food.</p>
<p>Let’s say this is the world in which I live. What does the free energy principle tell us? To minimize surprise, it seems clear that I should sit: I am certain to not see food. No surprise at all. The proposed solution is that you have a prior expectation to see food. So to minimize the surprise, you should put yourself into a situation where you might see food, ie to seek food. This seems to work. However, if there is any learning at all, then you will quickly observe that the probability of seeing food is actually 20%, and your expectations should be adjusted accordingly. Also, I will also observe that between two food expeditions, the probability to see food is 0%. Once this has been observed, surprise is minimal when I do not seek food. So, I die of hunger. It follows that the free energy principle does not survive Darwinian competition.</p>
<p>Thus, either there is no learning at all and the free energy principle is just a way of calling predefined actions “priors”; or there is learning, but then it doesn’t account for goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>The idea to act so as to minimize surprise resonates with some aspects of psychology, like cognitive dissonance theory, but that does not constitute a complete theory of mind, except possibly of the depressed mind. See for example the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> (as in surfing): you seek a situation that is controllable but sufficiently challenging that it engages your entire attention; in other words, you voluntarily expose yourself to a (moderate amount of) surprise; in any case certainly not a minimum amount of surprise.</p>

<p>Crap. <i>Merde. Ibn sharmoota</i>.* Swear words exist in most cultures (Japan is a notable exception), and many of us use them so casually and so frequently that by the time children start school, they have, according to one count, acquired a profanity bank of 30 to 40 words. (My own seven-year-old loves to whisper “fricking” in a friend’s ear, making them both giggle guiltily. My only defence is that he certainly didn’t get that one from me…)</p>
<p>Since even words like “fuck” are used conversationally, at least in the US and UK, surely they’ve lost the power to trigger a negative response in a listener – especially as far as younger adults are concerned? Not according to a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X18758143">new paper</a> published in the <i>Journal of Language and Social Psychology</i>. Melanie DeFrank and Patricia Kahlbaugh, at Southern Connecticut State University, found that teenagers who swear casually were judged by college students as being less intelligent and less trustworthy.</p>
<p><span id="more-33600"></span></p>
<p>DeFrank and Kahlbaugh recruited 138 students, including 101 women. The participants first completed a questionnaire asking them to rate the offensiveness of 10 swear words. (The words in order of most to least offensive, according to the participants’ ratings, were: bitch, fuck, bastard, shit, ass, jerk, screw, butt, crap and dang.) The participants also estimated how often they used and heard these kinds of words. While 17 per cent said they used between zero and five daily, just over 20 per cent reported using more than 21 every day. Thirteen per cent said they heard between zero and five, but 20 per cent reported hearing more than 21 daily.</p>
<p>Next the participants read two purported conversations between two 15-year-olds. They were asked to imagine that they were overhearing these conversations, and in each case, they had to rate the first speaker on overall impression, intelligence, trustworthiness, sociability, politeness and likability.</p>
<p>The dialogues were presented as being either between two males, two females, or a male and a female. Also, either one or both speakers used swear words from the list, or neither of them did. In all other respects, the conversations were exactly the same.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from a female-female conversation in which both parties swore:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jessica: “Hey, what’s up?”</p>
<p>Ashley: “Hey, how are you?”</p>
<p>Jessica: “Good. Just about to head to class. Can’t be late. You know how he is. He’ll bitch.”</p>
<p>Ashley: “I hate that shit. You can’t even be a second late before they get on to you about it.”</p>
<p>Jessica: “I know, and they give us so much work. I already have so much shit to do.”</p>
<p>Ashley: “Me too. It’s not even funny. I have like three fucking tests coming up in the same week.”</p></blockquote>
<p>DeFrank and Kahlbaugh found that, overall, as well as being judged to be less intelligent and less trustworthy, both males and females who swore were considered to be less likeable, more offensive and more aggressive. Also, speakers (male or female) who swore during a mixed-gender conversation were rated as being less sociable. And males who used swear words in conversation with females were rated as being more offensive.</p>
<p>This was despite the fact that just under half of the participants said that they did not consider the swearing version of the dialogue to be “profane”. Even the swear words that the students perceived to be most offensive – bitch and fuck – they still only rated midway on the offensiveness scale, on average, and some students rated them as completely inoffensive. “Despite people not considering the… language offensive, they are still affected by it and use it to judge others, suggesting a subliminal effect,” DeFrank and Kahlbaugh write.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps worth stressing that findings from a group of college students in Connecticut who thought they were judging teenage strangers don’t necessarily apply generally. But since first impressions do matter – and can last – perhaps we should all be more careful about casual swearing.</p>
<p>Over time, “people have become more desensitized to certain swears and even expect them at times,” the researchers note. “Having said that, there is still a language bias. Word choices matter, even when we think they do not or when we think they should not.”</p>

<h3><strong>A hidden layer of regulation selects surviving cancer cells</strong></h3>
<p>It is widely established that cancers develop when cells mutate. However, resistance to therapy might go <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elx001">beyond cancer mutations</a>. Though chemotherapy might kill most of the cancer, tiny populations of drug-resistant cancer cells manage to survive and propagate. Unlike the more familiar case of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, where genetic mutations give rise to resistance, many adaptations in treatment-resistant cancers are not the result of mutation. The DNA may stay the same, but cancer cells adapt to therapy and outsmart the drugs by switching their gene activity.</p>
<p>Such adaptations do not affect the DNA itself, a hidden layer of regulation controlling the activity of genes — <a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.15681">epigenetic</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-017-0173-2">metabolic signals</a> — help cancer cells survive. By targeting this hidden program, it may be possible to overcome deadly cancer resistance.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12918-018-0554-1">new research now published in <em>BMC Systems Biology</em></a>, the cancer systems biology team of Professor Fabian V. Filipp at the University of California Merced introduces a cellular model of cancer resistance. Under the selective pressure of mitogen activated kinase inhibitors cells are completely rewired yet manage to escape the anti-cancer treatment.</p>
<h3><strong>Probing melanoma genomes reveals new targets and challenges</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Many patients respond very positively at first. However, unfortunately many ultimately develop resistance and metastases.</p></blockquote>
<p>To understand how cancer becomes treatment resistant, it is useful to compare pathways in treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant cancers such as melanomas. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep07857">Melanoma</a> is a cancer that originates in melanocytes, the cells that produce the skin-color pigment melanin and is usually caused by UV damage. Though not the most common form of skin cancer, it is the most aggressive. And if it’s not caught and treated early, it’s also among the deadliest.</p>
<p>UV damage gives rise to point mutations — changes in a single letter of the 3 billion letter human genome. These mutations can <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2016.01.003">interfere with signals</a> that tell cells when to grow and divide and when to stop. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep07857">Mutations in a protein called BRAF</a>, a major signaling regulator, cause growth signals to be stuck in the “on” position and drive cancer development.</p>
<p>Although scientists have managed to come up with drugs that target and turn off aberrant BRAF signaling, cancer cells are clever and learn to adapt to these BRAF-inhibitors. Today, many patients respond to targeted treatment against BRAF signaling very positively at first. However, unfortunately many ultimately develop resistance and metastases.</p>

<h3><strong>Rewiring of gene expression and metabolism to bypass drug blockage</strong></h3>
<p>Melanoma is able circumvent BRAF inhibitors not by changing the genes themselves, but by changing gene activity, making them more or less active. Some of the genes with reduced activity were in the same or related signaling pathway as BRAF, the mutated protein that gave rise to the cancer and the main target of chemotherapy. The resistant cells managed to evolve in a way to bypass the signaling blockade or come up with a new way to maintain proliferation. Genes with increased activity were in metabolic pathways that allowed cancer cells to bypass BRAF altogether and continue to grow and divide. Cancer cells had essentially figured out how to survive by rewiring their metabolism in response to chemotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Systems biology predicts adaptive responses</strong></p>
<p>Daunting as this may sound, it actually offers hope to scientists and clinicians who want to treat chemo-resistant cancers. Non-genomic drug adaptation can be accomplished reproducibly in cultured cells, and combination therapies that block adaptive mechanisms in vitro have shown promise in improving rates and durability of response. Thus, better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.</p>
<blockquote><p>A better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Cancer models in combination with systems biology will pave the way for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention</strong></p>
<p>The systems biology approach reveals that signaling pathways undergo major rewiring at the transcriptional level while acquiring inhibitor resistance. The outcome of such transcriptional plasticity is dysregulation at the level of different upstream master regulators, while maintaining similar effector genes. Combination therapies including targeted approaches and immune checkpoint inhibition are promising and rapidly improving.</p>

<p>For these therapies to show durable, progression-free successes in the clinical setting, adaptation mechanisms of treatment resistances need to be understood. Cellular models in combination with <a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1477-3163.115423">systems biology analyses</a> across epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes provide insight into how non-genomic drug adaptation is accomplished.</p>
<p>Ongoing efforts are focused on utilizing the established <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep32611">preclinical models</a> to overcome drug adaptation as well as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10555-017-9662-4">precision medicine</a> profiling of cancer patients. Over time, a better understanding of mechanisms involved in drug adaptation is likely to improve the effectiveness of melanoma therapy by delaying or controlling acquired resistance.</p>

Regular readers will know of my interest in the theory that ketamine is a rapid-acting antidepressant. I've blogged about developments in ketamine-depression research for several years now, my interest being spurred partly by my own struggles with depression.



As I've said previously, the research on ketamine as an antidepressant is promising, but I do not think it is possible to say yet how ketamine works in depression. I think it is possible that ketamine's apparently powerful effects ar

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/536790534/0/oupblogpsychology/">Modernization of mortuary practice and grief</a></h4>

<p>Modern western mortuary practices are characterized by the professionalization of the management and presentation of the corpse. These practices serve as a stark contrast to those in traditional societies across the world and those throughout history. Changes to how we treat and dispose of the dead are such that industrialized societies have become outliers on the spectrum of the world’s cultures. Modernity has afforded us with a more efficient system for handling the dead, yet research suggests that these alterations may be negatively impacting long-term grief outcomes.</p>
<p>One way that modern practices influence grief is that they remove cues of death. Today, bereaved individuals in developed nations rarely participate in the ritualized preparation of the corpse, and, indeed, have minimal exposure to cues of death of any sort. Death specialists, such as mortuary cosmetologists and morticians, now wash, dress, and embalm the dead, amongst <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342958/What-really-happens-die-Behind-scenes-funeral-homes-America-dead-prepared-final-resting-place.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other invasive procedures</a>. They have replaced <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ideas.ted.com/11-fascinating-funeral-traditions-from-around-the-globe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many traditional rituals</a> of handling of the dead person by family and other community members. As a result, most people do not have the opportunity to see or interact with their loved one in a natural state of death.</p>
<p>Human relationships require huge investments and generate massive benefits, and we are not willing to let go of them unless we have unequivocal evidence that the person is dead. This is one reason why it is common for bereaved individuals who have not seen their loved-one’s corpses, such as death through tragedy, to demand to see the body or evidence that the person died and why <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.who.int/hac/techguidance/management_of_dead_bodies.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the World Health Organization recommend it</a>. Conversely, any suggestions that the person may still be alive weighs heavy on our minds. We typically use cues of agency and appearances to determine if a person is alive, or dead. If the person moves, or if they look like a living person, then we assume that he or she is alive. Oftentimes people comment that the dead person looks as though he or she were simply sleeping.</p>
<div class="pull"><blockquote class="pullquote">“One way that modern practices influence grief is that they remove cues of death.”</blockquote></div>
<p>Research from the evolutionary sciences suggests that this tendency to assume an agent is alive was once adaptive and is now instinctual. For instance, assuming that a predator was dead when it was in fact alive would have been detrimental to our survival, so as a general rule of thumb, people are more receptive to cues of life than cues of death. When this basic tendency is coupled with the motivation to want to continue the relationship with the dead person, it takes only minimal cues to convince us that the person is still around. Often there is a conflict between what the bereaved person consciously believes and how they reason momentarily, such as a widow thinking that the sound of footsteps on the stairs is her deceased husband.</p>
<p>Many people now opt for a closed casket for their loved-ones, and even if they do see the corpse, it most often follows complex professional preparation of the corpse aimed at minimizing cues of death. The “disneyfication of death” is common practice, where the deceased are artificially manipulated to resemble their appearance during life. Often photographs depicting the person when they were alive are placed on top of the casket or with a funerary order of service. With the rise of social media, such as in memorandum Facebook pages enable the community to endlessly revisit the person when he or she was alive with the click of a mouse.</p>
<p>In addition, researchers have shown that ritualization helps us to feel more in control of life events and they also provide us with an opportunity to receive social support from the community, which also has positive mental health benefits. Yet much of the ritualization involved in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://gizmodo.com/the-morbid-art-of-making-dead-bodies-beautiful-1221696867" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preparing the corpse for disposal has been given to professionals</a>.</p>
<p>It is now generally accepted in the clinical literature that long-term outcomes are better for those who view the body of a loved one, as doing so is thought to help people come to terms with the death. Naturalistic data suggests that even in traumatic circumstances, viewing the body of a loved one may increase anxiety and distress in the short term, but is associated with less distress in the longer term. Conversely, not seeing the body is associated with more difficult, prolonged grief. Health care professionals often observe that spending time both viewing and touching the body of a deceased loved one is conducive to better outcomes. Grief is one of the most intensely stressful experiences faced by humans and modern practices may be retarding the process.</p>

<p>Great leaders show composure during stressful situations. But remaining cool and collected in times of crisis is easier said than done, partly due to our own behavioral patterns. Allowing ourselves to become tethered to a particular agenda or resolution puts us at risk for increased stress and diminished communication.</p>
<p>Being open to personal change is the first step to improving conflict-resolution habits. Self-management allows leaders to more effectively manage conflicts. Mantras (or internal chants) are a great way to self-manage: these small reminders can help us control our emotions and, in turn, any conflicts that arise.</p>
<p>With insights from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/what-you-dont-know-about-leadership-but-probably-should-9780190620820" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>What You Don’t Know about Leadership, but Probably Should</em></a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/change-9780190866853" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Change: What Really Leads to Lasting Personal Transformation</em></a><em>, </em>we put together a list of mantras for effective conflict-resolution.

<p>The idea that we learn better when taught via our preferred modality or “learning style” – such as visually, orally, or by doing – is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/">not supported by evidence</a>. Nonetheless the concept remains hugely popular, no doubt in part because learning via our preferred style can lead us to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/05/it-feels-as-though-we-learn-better-via-our-preferred-learning-style-but-we-dont/">feel like we’ve learned more, even though we haven’t</a>.</p>
<p>Some advocates of the learning styles approach argue that the reason for the lack of evidence to date is that students do so much of their learning outside of class. According to this view, psychologists have failed to find evidence for learning styles because they’ve focused too narrowly on whether it is beneficial to have congruence between teaching style and preferred learning style. Instead, they say psychologists should look for the beneficial effects of students studying outside of class in a manner that is consistent with their learning style.</p>
<p>For a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ase.1777">new paper</a> in <em>Anatomical Sciences Education</em>, a pair of researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine have conducted just such an investigation with hundreds of undergrads. Once again however the findings do not support the learning styles concept, reinforcing its reputation among mainstream psychologists as little more than a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/29/10-of-the-most-widely-believed-myths-in-psychology/">myth</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-33559"></span></p>
<p>At the start of term, Polly Husmann and Valerie Dean O’Loughlin asked hundreds of undergrads on an anatomy course (which involved lectures and practical lab classes) to take one of the most popular online learning styles surveys, <a href="http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">the VARK</a>. Taken by millions of people worldwide, the VARK categorises students according to how much they prefer to learn visually, via auditory information, through reading and writing, or through kinaesthetics (by doing or by practical example).</p>
<p>The VARK website also offers study tips based on your supposed preferred learning style(s). The researchers encouraged their student participants to take the survey and to adopt the study practices consistent with their dominant learning style. Later in the term, the researchers surveyed them about the methods they’d actually used when studying outside of class, to see if they used methods in line with their supposed dominant learning style. Finally, the researchers accessed the students’ end-of-year grades to see if there was any association between grade performance, dominant learning style, and/or studying outside of class in a way consistent with one’s dominant learning style.</p>
<p>The results are bad news for advocates of the learning styles concept. Student grade performance was not correlated in any meaningful way with their dominant learning style or with any learning style(s) they scored highly on. Also, while most students (67 per cent) actually failed to study in a way consistent with their supposedly preferred learning style, those who did study in line with their dominant style did not achieve a better grade in their anatomy class than those who didn’t.</p>
<p>Instead, there were specific study strategies, such as practising microscope work and using lecture notes, that were associated with better grade performance, regardless of students’ learning style. Other activities, such as using flash cards, were associated with poorer performance, perhaps because they were a sign of learning by rote rather than deeper learning.</p>
<p>Husmann and O’Loughlin don’t pull any punches in their conclusion. Their findings, they write – especially when considered in the context of <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/">past research</a> – “provide strong evidence that instructors and students should not be promoting the concept of learning styles for studying and/or for teaching interventions. Thus, the adage of ‘I can’t learn subject X because I am a visual learner’ should be put to rest once and for all.”</p>

<p><em>4.
Dreams</em></p>
<p>Ah, dreams, the most intriguing, mysterious and exciting part of sleep. How much we know about it? You guessed it -- not enough to be sure of anything.</p>
<p>Let’s skip all the Freudian “wishes of the unconscious” (it is a blog about science after all…) and get straight to the facts. 
Some researchers think that there is a link between newly made memories, their consolidation and the formation of dreams.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04288">1</a></sup> One hypothesis is that when elements from a new memory appear in dreams it gets easier for the brain to save them as they get replayed in their original state (=you “perceive” the memories again). There are studies showing that in the morning, after dreaming about newly learnt stuff, people are better at recalling this stuff than people who did not dream about it.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04288">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the exact brain regions responsible for dream generation remain elusive, in a couple of recent studies scientists have made some progress in identifying which brain part makes us dream. It turns out that the parieto-occipital region, working for mental imagery and processing of all your perceptions during the day, is a hot zone for dreaming during the nighttime.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5462120/">2</a></sup> And if enjoy your nighttime adventures (Jesus, that came out wrong), you should take really good care of this region -- studies show that brain damage affecting it leads to the loss of the dream experiences.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21227155">3</a></sup>
Moreover, the scientists looked into what brain areas are activated while you dream of certain stuff. For that, they created five rough categories (thinking/perceiving, speech, faces, movement and any kind of a spatial setting) and found that when people dream of a certain category the brain area which is responsible for it in the waking state was also significantly more active than the others. Meaning that the “perception” of specific information activates the same brain parts, no matter, real or dreamt. </p>

<p><em>5.
What can go wrong?</em></p>
<p>As with everything in life, sleep can go wrong -- and there are many ways for it to do so: from the once in a while insomnia we are all familiar with to the incurable “fatal family insomnia”, a disease which prevents you from falling asleep at all, resulting in hallucinations, dementia and death. Woah. Intense. But let’s start with something less heavy.</p>
<p>There are insomnias -- when you cannot fall asleep,  hypersomnia -- when you sleep too much, parasomnias -- when you display abnormal behavior during sleep and some others (such as sleep apnea when you have troubles breathing during sleep). </p>
<p>Insomnia can be caused by a myriad of factors -- you might just be too nervous before an exam tomorrow, or you keep going through this stupid thing you said five years ago (or it is a side effect of another medical condition you have). However, sometimes your brain just sabotages your sleep -- research suggests that the brain of people with primary insomnia (that is, insomnia not connected to any other condition) might be lacking a certain neurotransmitter, GABA, which acts as a “brake fluid” of the brain. It was shown that adults with chronic insomnia have 30% less GABA than the average population.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=27298">4</a></sup> Consequently the brain is unable to shut down the waking signals, leaving the brain hyperactivated. Moreover, it was found that these patients also have some problems with their brain connectivity -- the connections to and from thalamus, the region of the brain that regulates tons of stuff, among others consciousness, sleep and alertness, were weakened.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2016152038">5</a></sup> It is not clear yet whether the disrupted connections are the cause or the consequence of insomnia but at least it’s shedding some light on this mysterious disease.</p>

<p>Hypersomnias, on another hand, make you sleepy all the time. Narcolepsy, a disease when you are excessively sleepy and uncontrollably fall asleep during the day time, is a prime example of a hypersomnia. It was found that people with narcolepsy have too little hypocretins in their brains.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9419374">6</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9491897">7</a></sup> Hypocretins (what a slightly offensive term) are chemicals produced in hypothalamus (remember, we mentioned it in the first part?) which signal to the brainstem, a region which keeps us alert and awake, to.. well, keep us alert and awake. So when these hypocretin cell die off for some reason (mostly autoimmune response) it becomes hard for the affected person to stay awake for the longer period of times as nothing is signaling the brain that it should keep itself awake. </p>

<p>Now parasomnias include such things as sleep-walking, sleep terror and even sleep sex (although sometimes sleep sex is grouped in the same category as sleep-walking). 
A 2012 study revealed that 29,2% of Americans have had at least one sleepwalking episode in their lives.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://n.neurology.org/content/78/20/1583">8</a></sup> It typically occurs during the deep sleep of the stage 4 (the one that leaves you groggy should you wake up during it). While most occurrences are harmless, sometimes sleepwalking can really escalate (cue Kenneth Parks who sleep-drove 23 kilometres to his in-laws house and sleep-killed them and then sleep-drove himself to the police station). Studies suggest that such episodes might be due to our more “primitive” brain parts involved in emotional response (limbic system) and complex motor activity staying awake while the higher developed brain areas controlling rationality and memory remain dormant. The brain is stuck in the wake-sleep-limbo and is regulated by an archaic survival system as our normal control mechanisms are still asleep. 
<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23415568">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The man who murdered his in-laws during a sleepwalking episode.</p><p>Now lastly let’s look at what happens how not getting enough sleep actually affects your brain. We all know sleep deprivation is a bitch -- you don’t feel well, you start forgetting things, you snap at people and you are just operating on an autopilot. But what exactly does it do to your brain?</p>

<p>Just recently, scientists found that 24 hours of sleep deprivation can cause symptoms similar to schizophrenia: people developed strong attention and concentration deficits and were not able to filter incoming sensory information which in turn led to a sensory overload.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/27/9134.short">10</a></sup> They also reported an altered sense of time and smell and some people even said they had an impression that they were able to read thoughts. </p>
<p>Not long ago there was also a study making rounds on all social media titled something like “Brain EATS ITSELF when you don’t sleep enough!!!”. What the study actually found was that the cells responsible for cleaning out trash, destroying and digesting worn-out cells and pruning unnecessary connections between brain cells (synapses) go into overdrive in sleep-deprived mice.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/21/5263">11</a></sup> Astrocytes, cells which take care of redundant synapses, were active in only about 5% of cells in the brains of the well-rested mice; in the sleep deprived mice, however, this number increased to 13%. Not only that, astrocytes in sleep deprived mice began to not only carefully prune the synapses to refresh brain’s wiring, but to actually eating them in a process known as “phagocytosis” (from an Ancient Greek word meaning “to devour”). However, despite how bad it sounds (and how well the sensationalist headers like “the brain eats itself!!!” sound) the scientists said that the synapses which are getting eaten are one of the strongest, oldest and most heavily used. So in a way it is like old pieces of furniture being taken care of with a little bit of tough love. Which the researchers did not deem to be too catastrophic. Another result was a bit more worrisome. Microglia, cells which clear out old and worn-out cells (also using phagocytosis) went into overdrive after chronic sleep deprivation as well. This is not that good because microglial hyperactivation was linked to diverse neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834890/">12</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862638">13</a></sup> It has also been shown that disturbed sleep makes people more vulnerable to dementia<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5955/1005">14</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2670749?redirect=true">15</a></sup> -- so maybe there is a link there.</p>
<p>Another study has found that sleep deprivation led to a much slower reaction to outside events -- caused by the slower transmission rates between neurons.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4433">16</a></sup> So basically brain cells got tired too and just couldn’t transfer information in a normally fast way leading to cognitive lapses and slowed down reaction times. Instead of a post-8-hour-sleep Bugs Bunny-like race the thoughts were crawling like a turtle. 
So the moral of the story is: go to bed. No more Netflix and facebook for today.</p>

<p><em>6.
So how much sleep do we need and how to sleep well?</em></p>
<p>We all have heard of the magic 8 hours of sleep. Eight hours for the most restful sleep, eight hours to align your chakras, eight hours this eight hours that. But is it actually accurate? It seems that articles challenging the 8 hour notion and offering hot new takes on the optimal sleep duration are popping up more often than I actually manage to get a full-night sleep.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sleep-experts-close-in-on-the-optimal-nights-sleep-1405984970">17</a>, <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/sleep-hacking-1-million-people-prove-sleeping-5-hours-is-healther-than-sleeping-8-hours/">18</a></sup> So what’s the truth?</p>
<p>Well, although there is no ultimate exact-to-the-minute answer there is at least an estimate scientists seem to converge on. 
Of course, there are people, aptly called “short sleepers”, who, due to a rare genetic mutation, wake up fully rested after a very short amount of sleep (such as 4 or 5 hours) and for whom the normal rules don’t apply.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884988/">19</a></sup> However, the majority of the population is less lucky and for us ordinary people seven to eight hours seem to be a pretty good estimate. There are studies investigating the relationship between sleep and things like cardiovascular disease<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12546611">20</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624831/">21</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2643470/">22</a></sup>, obesity<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21696306">23</a></sup>, depression<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16566613">24</a></sup>, and mortality rate<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20469800">25</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19645960">26</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17969458">27</a></sup> and showing that this relationship looks like a U-shaped curve with the above mentioned things being the lowest at 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Furthermore, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/pressroom/adult-sleep-duration-consensus.pdf">28</a></sup> and the National Sleep Foundation<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/s2352-7218%2815%2900015-7/fulltext">29</a></sup> have released the sleep time duration recommendations and they both agree that it should be 7 or 8 hours (the AASM cryptically calls it “7 or more” while stating that more than 9 hours might also have adverse effects). Oversleeping does, indeed, have adverse effects: one study has found that long sleepers might be at a higher risk for dementia<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473367">30</a></sup>, some studies have shown that over-the-top long sleep duration (as well as too short btw!) lead to decrease in cognitive functioning<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26791423_Self-reported_sleep_duration_and_cognitive_functioning_in_a_general_population">31</a></sup> and impaired memory<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079936/">32</a></sup> and some more studies have found that inflammation levels are much higher in people sleeping more than 8 hours.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2635584/">33</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17322482">34</a></sup></p>

<p>By this criteria it appears that the Western society is constantly toying with sleep deprivation -- some surveys estimate that 35% of the US adults and three quarters of Brits participating in the questionnaire are getting less than 7 hours of sleep.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://sleepcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-Great-British-Bedtime-Report-2017.pdf">35</a>, <a href="https://aasm.org/cdc-publishes-new-estimates-of-u-s-adult-sleep-duration/">36</a></sup> This is pretty unfortunate since, as we remember from the previous sections, lack of sleep can take a heavy toll on your health. Moreover, it is estimated that in the US alone the sleep deprivation costs the economy billions of dollars in lost efficiency and performance.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19958/">37</a></sup> So, it is important to plan your days the way that you get at least 7 hours of sleep most of the days -- I know, I know, it is annoying considering that an average adult in our society needs like 30 hours every day just to catch up on all the chores and workload and social life and relaxation and and and, but in the long run it is really important to not deprive our body of the precious sleep time and to make time for a full recovery. </p>
<p>You are probably asking: can I catch up on sleep? What if I just sleep 12 hours on the weekend: will it make my body forget the terrible all-nighters I pulled all week? Unfortunately it doesn’t work like this. One study has found that catching up on sleep on a weekend after having a sleep deprived week only decreased the subjective feelings of sleepiness and the level of inflammation.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941878">38</a></sup> The impaired cognitive performance (speak focus and attention) resulting from the sleep deprivation did not improve after the extensive weekend sleep session. Meaning: sleeping a lot in advance (or retroactively) won’t help your impaired concentration and attention levels; you have to sleep an adequate amount every night to keep them high. </p>

<p>Now how to actually sleep better?</p>
<p>As we learnt in the previous part, blue light is not a friend when it comes to falling asleep. Meaning a power-down routine including putting away your devices around an hour or two before going to bed, not using the said devices in bed in order to not associate rest with work or the overwhelming information flow (she typed on her laptop while laying in bed) or at least downloading an app called <a href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> which decreases the brightness of the screen before bedtime and eliminates the blue light from it. </p>
<p>Another method to wind down before bed includes relaxation. A mindfulness meditation (meaning no more and no less than just concentrating on your breathing, bodily experiences, your environment and noticing your thoughts instead of engaging with them) has been shown to help people with insomnia and to improve sleep quality (aside from its other 10000 health benefits).<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3328970/">38</a>,<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2110998">39</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9411784">40</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24298493">41</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090609072719.htm">42</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000578940700072X">43</a></sup> Something as simple as concentrating on your breath for 10 minute instead of looking at r/funny can go a long way. Your mind calms down and stops racing with the To-Do-List for tomorrow or the embarassing situations list from today. Personally I use the <a href="http://www.10percenthappier.com">10% Happier App (Meditation for Fidgety Sceptics)</a> and I couldn’t be happier with it. They also have free meditations! (I was not paid for this ad… Unfortunately).</p>
<p>Another intuitive thing to help you sleep is to avoid caffeine before bed -- and by before bed I mean already after lunch. One study found that consuming caffeine as early as 6 hours before bedtime delays reduced total sleep time by 1 hour.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://jcsm.aasm.org/viewabstract.aspx?pid=29198">44</a></sup> So to make sure caffeine does not interfere with your sleeping habits it is probably a good idea to drink it at maximum 7-8 hours before bed. Another study has found that caffeine also can delay the timing of your internal clock and thus reduce your sleeping time by keeping you awake longer<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/305/305ra146">45</a></sup> -- just another small reminder not to drink coffee in the second half of the day. To sum up, the sleep-friendly way to consume your daily drug would be the following: stick to the 2pm cut-off and taper caffeine as the day goes on.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to keep it cool in the bedroom (insert an awkward sex joke here) -- it has been suggested that the optimal range for sleeping is between 18 and 21 degree Celsius (65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit).<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/the-sleep-environment">46</a>,<a href="http://www.sleepnumber.com/eng/individualNeeds/sleepTemperature.cfm">47</a>,<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-christopher-winter/best-temperature-for-sleep_b_3705049.html">48</a>,<a href="http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/cant-sleep-adjust-the-temperature">49</a></sup> Some hours before falling asleep our body temperature starts to fall -- and the mild drop in the room temperature helps induce sleep. One study has found that just a 0.4C increase in skin temperature (which allows the body to release more heat) led to sounder sleep and fewer wake-ups.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192289">50</a></sup> In fact, some studies show that disturbed thermoregulation (and thus a too high body temperature during the night) is associated with some forms of insomnia.<sup data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18603220?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">51</a></sup></p>
<p>So now you have a good idea of how to make the most of your sleep, what are the adverse effects of thinking 3 hours of sleep after an all-nighter are enough and also that some guy killed people during a sleep-walking episode. Good night and stay tuned for a neuroscience news block coming soon!</p>

Overall recall isn't that great...}<br /><br />Lateral temporal cortex (n=18) meant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_temporal_gyrus" title="Middle temporal gyrus">MTG</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_temporal_gyrus" title="Superior temporal gyrus">STG</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_temporal_gyrus" title="Inferior temporal gyrus">IFG</a> (mostly on the left). Non-lateral temporal cortex (n=11) meant elsewhere (see <b>Appendix</b> below). The improvements were greatest with stimulation in the middle portion of the left middle temporal gyrus. There are many reason for poor encoding, and one could be that subjects  were not paying enough attention. The authors didn't have the electrode  coverage to test that explicitly. This leads me to believe that electrical stimulation was enhancing the semantic encoding of the words. The MTG is thought to be critical for semantic representations and language comprehension in general (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3039157/" target="_blank">Turken &amp; Dronkers, 2011</a>).<br /><br />Thus, my interpretation of the results is that stimulation may have  boosted semantic encoding of the words, given the nature of the stimuli  (words, obviously), the left lateralization with a focus in MTG, and the lack of an  encoding task. The verbal memory literature clearly demonstrates that when  subjects have a deep semantic encoding task (e.g., living/non-living decision),  compared to shallow orthographic (are there letters that extend above/below?) or  phonological tasks, recall and recognition are improved. Which led me to ask some questions, and one of the authors kindly replied (Dan Rizzuto, personal communication). <span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>4</sup></b></span><br /><br /><ol><li>Did you ever have conditions that contrasted different encoding tasks? Here I meant to ask about semantic vs orthographic encoding (because the instructions were always to “remember the words” with no specific encoding task).</li><ul>  <li><i>We studied three verbal learning tasks (uncategorized free recall, categorized free recall, paired associates learning) and one spatial navigation task during the DARPA RAM project.

Nonetheless, it is an accomplished piece of work to demonstrate closed-loop memory enhancement in humans.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> Since that time, however, the UCLA group has reported that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/29515" target="_blank">theta-burst microstimulation</a> of....     <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">....the right entorhinal area during learning significantly improved subsequent memory specificity for novel portraits; participants were able both to recognize previously-viewed photos and reject similar lures.

<p><b>PALO ALTO, CA, March 30, 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span><a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s leading and most secure enterprise platform for outsourced research and development (R&amp;D) services, today announced it has been named a finalist in two categories for the esteemed World Procurement Awards, the most sought-after and recognized accolade in procurement, run by Procurement Leaders. Alongside industry leaders like Microsoft, Coupa, IBM, and KPMG, Science Exchange is on the shortlist for two awards: Best New Procurement Consultancy Project, with pharmaceutical client GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Health, and Best Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Specialist Provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Exchange was recognized for its <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/enterprise">P2P platform</a>, which empowered procurement teams and increased R&amp;D operational efficiency at GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Health (GSK-CH) and another major global pharmaceutical client with rapid access to innovation through outsourced R&amp;D.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are honored to be recognized once again by Procurement Leaders for the work we are doing with our clients to help accelerate breakthrough discoveries,” said Dr. Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder of Science Exchange. “Outsourcing with scientific service providers is crucial for increasing R&amp;D efficiency, but finding and qualifying providers can be a time-consuming process. Our platform accelerates scientific breakthroughs by  connecting researchers to thousands of scientific services from a network of thoroughly vetted providers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winners of the awards will be announced on May 17, 2018 at the World Procurement Awards Ceremony in London, England. To find out more and see a list of all the finalists, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">visit the website at </span><a href="http://www.worldprocurementawards.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.worldprocurementawards.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Best New Procurement Consultancy Project</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the category Best New Procurement Consultancy Project, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Health (GSK-CH) implemented Science Exchange to increase the productivity of their R&amp;D operations. Through the <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/enterprise">Science Exchange platform</a>, GSK-CH researchers gained instant access to the 2,500+ outsourced service providers on the Science Exchange network, including niche and innovative technologies. Science Exchange was able to broaden the GSK-CH R&amp;D organization’s geographical reach, capitalize on local demand, help spur innovation, and advance their timelines to bring products to market faster. Some of the results included an 11% increase in GSK-CH’s access to innovative providers (YTD) and 44 new niche providers selected by GSK-CH during scouting efforts this year.</span></p>

<p><b><b>Best P2P Specialist Provider</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the category Best P2P Specialist Provider, a leading global pharmaceutical company explored the potential to increase their R&amp;D productivity by using the Science Exchange technology platform to improve its outsourcing processes. Instead of spending hours a day exploring service providers, the scientists logged into Science Exchange and quickly reviewed service provider satisfaction ratings, secured competitive quotes, and selected a supplier to meet their research needs.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">After one year of using Science Exchange, this global pharmaceutical company’s preclinical services group reported that scientists saved 1,300 hours, the legal and procurement teams saved 2,730 hours, and the combined time-savings translated to hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost savings.</span> </b></p><br />
<p><b><b>About World Procurement Awards </b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The World Procurement Awards, in association with SAP Ariba, are the most celebrated and sought-after awards in procurement, representing the best projects, people and organizations across the world. They reward the collective efforts of individuals and teams and are an affirmation of the hard work, innovation and dedication of those at the forefront of this dynamic global profession.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This year saw a record number of entries from some of the most influential companies across 36 countries for the 12th annual awards. The judges were impressed with the sheer quality of this year’s submissions, commenting that the bar had once again been raised, with innovation at the heart of each project as teams across the globe work hard to position themselves as valuable business partners.</span></b></p></div></div><p></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Ahead of the world heavyweight boxing championship reunification fight on March 31, 2018, featuring Great Britain’s Anthony Joshua versus Joseph Parker from New Zealand – the first time that two undefeated heavyweight world champions competed in the UK – we trawled the psychology literature looking for intriguing findings involving boxers and other sporting fighters. From the curse of the pre-match smile, to the cognitive biases that sway your choice of greatest ever boxer, here’s the psychology of fighting, digested:</p>
<p><span id="more-33609"></span></p>
<h2><strong>You can judge a lot from a fighter’s face</strong></h2>
<p>When Joshua and Parker stood face to face for the customary stare down earlier this week, there were no smiles to be seen. Perhaps the fighters heard about <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/03/11/smiling-fighters-are-more-likely-to-lose/">a study</a> we covered five years ago involving competitors from the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which showed that those who smiled more intensely at the pre-match face-off were more likely to lose that upcoming fight. The researchers’ theory is that smiles are an involuntary signal of submission and lack of aggression, just as teeth baring is in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Another line of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/06/20/a-mans-fighting-ability-is-written-in-his-face/">research</a>, also involving UFC fighters, found that those with faces that are wide relative to their length are more formidable fighters. The same paper showed how we pick up on this cue instinctively, judging fighters with wider faces as more deadly. One theory is that face-width is correlated with testosterone levels – men with higher basal testosterone have wider faces, as well as greater strength and aggression.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/26/6/1470/204957">another study</a> found that people could predict, at better than chance levels, the winners of mixed martial arts fights purely from looking at the faces of any two competitors. The participants seemed to be picking up on facial cues linked to masculinity, strength and aggressiveness.</p>
<h2><strong>A beard doesn’t offer any protection</strong></h2>
<p>At this week’s pre-match press conference Joshua Parker appeared clean-shaven, having previously sported a fulsome beard. Given the research on the facial cues linked with fighting success, boxers could be forgiven for wanting to wear a thick beard as a way to appear more intimidating and masculine. But if they are hoping it might also offer some protection, they are mistaken, according to <a href="http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(17)30266-0/abstract">a recent study</a> of 395 UFC fighters that found those with beards were just as vulnerable to being knocked out, and were no more likely to win. “We suggest that beards represent dishonest signals of formidability,” the researchers concluded. However, Parker may wish to take note of another finding from the study – fighters with a longer reach were more likely to win (Joshua has a longer reach than Parker by 10cm).</p>
<h2><strong>Pre-match mind games are an important part of the sport</strong></h2>
<p>Early in the media build up to the Joshua–Parker fight, Parker’s camp released a video featuring all the times that Joshua has previously been “dropped” – a clear attempt to get under his skin. These kind of mind games are an important part of the contest, of which Mohammed Ali was arguably the master.  Despite their importance, these games have been little studied by psychologists. <a href="https://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/9342/1/Wilson_Rushton_and_Kenny_Greenough%20-%20journal%20article.pdf">A recent interview-based study</a> of four elite male amateur boxers from Manchester is a rare exception. The boxers described their mind game tactics during the pre-match weigh-in (including exuding confidence by tensing their muscles, and flashing a smile at their opponent – perhaps a mistake, see above); at the warm up immediately prior to a fight (e.g. switching stances deliberately to confuse their opponent); and during the ring entrance (e.g. making prolonged eye contact, and wearing a robe with badges implying prior success).</p>
<h2><strong>The challenge of “making the weight” has costs and benefits</strong></h2>
<p>In boxing and other combat sports that have weight divisions, competitors often go to extreme lengths to lose weight prior to a pre-match weigh-in, and then they rehydrate and refuel in the short time they have left before the fight. This is not such an issue for Joshua and Parker because as super heavy-weights, they do not need to make a particular weight limit for the fight. However research suggests that the practice of drastically cutting weight prior to weigh-ins may be harmful to fighters in many ways – for instance, <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/35/6/390">a recent study of amateur boxers</a> found that it led to “higher scores on anger, fatigue, and tension with reduced vigour” and that the boxers performed worse on a circuit training task after weight loss.</p>
<p>Perhaps more surprising is how cutting weight seems to also have a positive psychological component. Elite Swedish competitors in wrestling, judo and taekwondo <a href="http://www.natajournals.org/doi/full/10.4085/1062-6050-48.1.04">described</a> how making the weight led them to feel more like “real athletes”. Others told how it signals power and control and gave them a mental advantage: “You feel a bit like that Rocky Balboa character, in the scene when he is running up those stairs. You know, the preparations, because you have to give yourself a decent chance.”</p>
<h2><strong>Southpaws have an advantage</strong></h2>
<p>Left-handers have an advantage in many sports because of the simple fact that they are used to competing against right-handers, whereas right-handers are far less accustomed to competing against left-handers. This left-hand advantage applies in boxing where left-handed fighters are called southpaws (right-handers may also switch to a southpaw stance, leading with their right hand). For instance, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1357650X.2014.961471?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">an analysis</a> of nearly 2,500 professional boxers’ records from 1924 to 2012 found that southpaws had a better win-lose ratio, on average. A much smaller <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/43/2/142">study</a> involving semi-professional Turkish boxers came to the same conclusion. Indeed, one explanation for the persistence of left-handedness at a similar rate through human history is the so-called “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9025310">fighting hypothesis</a>“, which is that idea that being left-handed confers a fighting advantage. Joshua and Parker are both orthodox right-handed fighters so they need not concern themselves too much with this research.</p>
<h2><strong>Boxing and martial arts train your brain</strong></h2>
<p>Blows to the head are profoundly harmful to the human brain – make no mistake. There is a wealth of research on the neurological toll of being a boxer, including at an <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060915204035.htm?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=ScienceDaily_TMD_1&amp;utm_source=TMD">amateur level</a>.</p>
<p>While the head-impacts in combat sport cause neurological harm, conversely the training of reflexes and reactions that are an integral part of boxing and related sports have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition. For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452216306960#b0060">a recent brain-wave study</a> of boxers and fencers responding to go and stop commands found that both groups showed enhanced preparatory brain activity and faster response times than controls (fencers showed the greater advantage because their responses were faster <em>and</em> more accurate).</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-014-0719-y">study</a> compared the ability of young and old martial artists and controls to detect dots in their visual periphery as fast as possible: the participants who practised judo or karate were faster, and older participants who practised a martial art competitively when they were young showed less age-related slowing in their reactions.</p>
<p>Which combat sport is associated with the greatest cognitive enhancement? There’s an argument that Kung Fu is king, at least based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier_Sanchez-Lopez2/publication/276493620_Differences_between_Judo_Taekwondo_and_Kung-fu_Athletes_in_Sustained_Attention_and_Impulse_Control/links/567a6cb608ae40c0e27f4cbe.pdf">tests</a> of sustained attention and impulse control among Judo, Taekwondo and Kung-fu athletes. The last group showed “better inhibition ability (indicated by fewer commission errors) and less response time variability and performance decrement” than the others. The researchers attributed this to “the greater dedication demanded by kung-fu training as well as the martial art’s promotion of discipline, self-control and meditation”.</p>
<h2><strong>Martial arts reduce aggression and aid emotional intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>Advocates of boxing and martial arts often argue that, while the sports undeniably involve aggression, they also teach self-control and restraint, thereby encouraging better behaviour outside of the ring or dojo. This seems to be backed up by research, at least among children and teenagers. For instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/07/the-art-of-not-fighting-martial-arts-reduce-child-and-teen-aggression/">a recent meta-analysis</a> of 12 prior studies found that participating in martial arts reduced child and teen aggression, including lowering their physical aggression, verbal and physical bullying, theft and vandalism. One recent <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.904.9148&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> even suggested that boxing can boost “emotional intelligence”. Comparing boxers, judokas and controls, the researchers found that both combat groups scored higher on appraising others’ emotions, while the boxers scored highest on using and controlling their emotions, and they scored lowest on trait neuroticism.</p>
<h2><strong>Sparring is very different from the real thing</strong></h2>
<p>They say that one secret to becoming a sporting champion is learning to perform under pressure with the same freedom and composure as you do when training. Key to developing this ability, though, is making sure that training is as realistic as possible, which is arguably a greater challenge in boxing and  martial arts than in non-combat sports. This dilemma was highlighted in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00025/full">an impressive recent paper</a> that took fighting and psychological metrics during taekwondo sparring and compared them with same metrics during a competitive fight. There were many significant differences, both in terms of performance (for instance, when sparring, the fighters were less attacking and kept a greater distance) and psychologically (for example, the fighters were less anxious and felt less mentally challenged during sparring). “This study showed that fighting in training does not adequately simulate the affective and cognitive demands of fighting in competition,” the researchers concluded.</p>
<h2><strong>The psychology behind who you think is the greatest ever boxer</strong></h2>
<p>Whatever the sport, if you play the game of “Who was the greatest?” your judgment will probably be swayed by the “availability heuristic” (we judge as more important those examples that we can bring more easily to mind) and the “reminiscence bump” (we find it easier to recall memories from our teens and early twenties). So if you are in your youth today, it is quite likely, in years to come, that you will tell your children that Anthony Joshua was the greatest ever boxer, though this may of course depend on the outcome of Saturday’s match, and whether he can also defeat Deontay Wilder, if that fight ever happens!</p>
<p>Researchers showed <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/09/what-your-choice-of-best-ever-footballer-says-about-human-memory/">the reminiscence bump effect</a> in an online survey of people’s beliefs about the “greatest ever footballer” – participants overwhelming tended to name players whose career mid-point coincided with participants’ teens and early twenties (for instance, Johan Cruijff was most often selected by participants who were aged 9 to 18 when he was at his career midpoint; Pelé was most often selected by participants who were aged between 12 and 21 years when he was mid-career).</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon was observed for judgments about <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.1998.87.3f.1310">the “greatest boxers of all time”</a> by noted boxing historians for <em>Ring</em> magazine in 1998. In compiling their top 20, the judges, all of whom were born after 1939, showed a clear bias against fighters from the pre-1939 era. Writing in the journal <em>Perceptual and Motor Skills</em>, the researchers said their analysis “does not support the magazine’s contention that ‘history has been served’.”</p>

<p>Good luck on Saturday, AJ.</p>

<p>I have just uploaded an incomplete draft of chapter 6, "<a href="http://romainbrette.fr/WordPress3/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/theory-of-action-potentials-chapter-6.pdf">Spike initiation with an initial segment</a>". This chapter deals with how spikes are initiated in most vertebrate neurons (and also some invertebrate neurons), where there is a hotspot of excitability close to a large soma. This situation has a number of interesting implications which make spike initiation quite different from the situation investigated by Hodgkin and Huxley, that of stimulating the middle of an axon. Most of the chapter describes the theory that I have developed to analyze this situation, called "resistive coupling theory" because the axonal hotspot is resistively coupled to the soma.</p>
<p>The chapter is currently unfinished, because a few points require a little more research, which we have not finished. The presentation is also a bit more technical than I would like, so this is really a draft. I wanted nonetheless to release it now, as I have not uploaded a chapter for a while and it could be some time before the chapter is finished.</p>
