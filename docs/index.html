              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-eukaryote-thiomargarita-magnifica-namibiensis-largest-bacterium">This giant bacterium is the largest one found yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>There&#8217;s a new record holder for biggest bacterium — and you don’t need a microscope to see it.</p>



<p>The newfound species, <em>Thiomargarita magnifica</em>, is <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb3634">roughly a centimeter long</a>, and its cells are surprisingly complex, researchers report in the June 24 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The bacterial behemoth is roughly the size and shape of a human eyelash, marine biologist Jean-Marie Volland of the Laboratory for Research in Complex Systems in Menlo Park, Calif., said June 21 at a news conference. Maxing out at approximately 2 centimeters<em>,</em> <em>T. magnifica</em> is about 50 times the size of other giant bacteria and about 5,000 times the size of most other average-size bacterial species.</p>





<p>What’s more, while the genetic material of most bacteria <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-spy-secret-inner-life-bacteria">floats freely inside the cell</a>, <em>T. magnifica </em>packs its DNA inside a sac surrounded by a membrane (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>). Such a compartment is a hallmark of the larger, more complex cells of eukaryotes, a group of organisms that includes plants and animals.</p>



<p>Study coauthor Oliver Gros, a marine biologist at the Université des Antilles Pointe-á-Pitre in Guadeloupe, France, first discovered <em>T. magnifica</em> while collecting water samples in tropical marine mangrove forests in the Caribbean’s Lesser Antilles. At first, he mistook the long, white filaments as some sort of eukaryote, Gros said at the news conference. But a few years later, genetic analyses showed that the organisms were actually bacteria. A closer look under the microscope revealed the cells’ DNA-containing sacs.</p>



<p>Previous studies had predicted that bacterial cells’ overall lack of complexity meant there was a limit to how large bacteria could grow. But the new discovery is “breaking our way of thinking about bacteria,” says Ferran Garcia-Pichel, a microbiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved with the study. When it comes to bacteria, people typically think small and simple. But that mindset may make researchers miss lots of other bacterial species, Garcia-Pichel says. It&#8217;s a bit like thinking the largest animal that exists is a small frog but then scientists discover elephants.</p>



<p>It’s still unclear what role <em>T. magnifica</em> plays among the mangroves. Also unknown is why it evolved to be so large. One possibility, Volland said, is that being centimeters long helps cells access both oxygen and sulfide, which the bacteria need to survive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-squid-fossil-ancestor-cephalopod-fierce-hunter">Vampire squid are gentle blobs. But this ancestor was a fierce hunter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite the scary name, modern vampire squid are docile denizens of the deep sea — but their Jurassic ancestors may have been a lot fiercer.</p>



<p>Analyses of fossilized soft tissue from three 164-million-year-old specimens of <em>Vampyronassa rhodanica</em> suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12269-3">the ancient cephalopods had some powerful weapons</a>, researchers say June 23 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Unlike its blobby modern relative, <em>V. rhodanica</em> had a more streamlined muscular body, with two of its eight arms twice as long as the other six. Strong suckers on all eight arms could have helped it snatch and hold onto prey.</p>





<p>Modern vampire squid (<em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>) are not actually squid; they’re the only surviving members of an ancient, diverse order of cephalopods, the Vampyromorpha. And <em>V. infernalis</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/real-vampire-squid">are pretty passive about finding food</a> (<em>SN: 6/25/12</em>). Alongside their arms, they have two long, retractable, sticky filaments <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2012.1357">that they use like flypaper</a> to collect ”marine snow,” tiny bits of dead plankton or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-squid-take-mommy-breaks">sinking fecal pellets</a> that happen to drift past (<em>SN: 5/19/15</em>).</p>



<p>Fossilized tissue suggests <em>V. rhodanica</em> had a very different lifestyle, report paleontologist Alison Rowe of Sorbonne University in Paris and her colleagues.</p>

<p>Both the ancient and the modern creatures have eight arms bearing suckers flanked by hairlike cirri. But the ancient cephalopod’s suckers are attached to the arms by stalks embedded in round layers of muscle. That muscular arrangement, the team says, would have greatly increased the pressure differential inside the sucker — making its suction more powerful. The creature’s numerous, closely packed cirri may have helped it sense prey, similar to a strategy used by some modern octopuses.</p>



<p><em>V. infernalis’</em> suckers, lacking that muscle arrangement, don’t have such a strong grip. Instead, its suckers secrete mucus that coats whatever the creatures have captured with their filaments. The cirri then slide that slippery food along the arms and into its mouth.</p>

                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/06/guns-and-the-precarity-of-manhood/"><img width="480" height="184" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Guns-and-the-precarity-of-manhood-480x184.png" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><h6>This is an excerpt from chapter 6, “Enraged, Rattled, and Wronged” of&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/enraged-rattled-and-wronged-9780197578438"><em>Enraged, Rattled, and Wronged: Entitlement&#8217;s Response to Social Progress</em></a>&nbsp;by Kristin J. Anderson.</h6><hr><p>Manhood is precarious. Unlike womanhood, manhood is hard won and easily lost and therefore men go to great effort to perform it—for the most part for other boys and men—sometimes to their own and others’ detriment.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/white-fragility-why-its-so-hard-to-talk-to-white-people-about-racism-twlm/">[63]</a>&nbsp;Men will go out of their way to not appear unmanly or feminine—they adhere to an anti-femininity mandate. For example, men are reluctant to take jobs that women do. Men hold out for diminishing coal-mining jobs when they should be applying for home health aid jobs. Women have been flexible and have pushed themselves into men’s jobs; men have not pushed themselves into women’s jobs.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029826">[64]</a>&nbsp;</p><p>There are consequences of the investment in maintaining manhood for individual men, as well as the rest of us. Men learn to be fixated on performing masculinity which often entails aggression. Men tend to believe that aggression is more typical than it actually is—as we learned earlier. They falsely believe that women are attracted to aggressive men, when, in fact, women tend to view aggression as weak and impulsive, a loss of self-control, and not sexy or charming.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653339162/-man-up-how-a-fear-of-appearing-feminine-restricts-men-and-affects-us-all.">[65]</a>&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>Gun popularity among men is linked to threats to their gender status &#8230; How do we know? First, men with higher sexism scores believe it should be easier to buy guns; men with lower sexism scores say it should be more difficult to buy guns.</p></blockquote></div><p>Entitlement tells White men that they shouldn’t have to bow down to those they perceive to be below them. In 2018, Markeis McGlockton, an African American man, pushed a White man to the ground because the man was yelling at his partner outside a convenience store. The man pulled out a gun and shot and killed McGlockton and was not prosecuted because of Florida’s stand-your-ground law.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029826">[66]</a>&nbsp;Stand-your-ground laws and gun ownership are manifestations of feeling entitled to never back down. Gun owners often justify owning or carrying a gun with fears of violent crime however, over the same period in which gun purchases have risen, violent crime has dropped. In truth, support for gun rights for White men is linked to perceived threats to their racial privilege.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/07/21/hes-accused-of-killing-someone-in-a-parking-spot-dispute-authorities-say-he-was-standing-his-ground/?utm_term=.6cd681eb0bf2">[67]</a>&nbsp;Gun popularity among men is linked to threats to their gender status as well. How do we know? First, men with higher sexism scores believe it should be easier to buy guns; men with lower sexism scores say it should be more difficult to buy guns.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243214554799">[68]</a>&nbsp;Second, firearm background checks increase in communities where married men, but not married women, have lost their jobs.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12565">[69]</a>&nbsp;Presumably, recently unemployed men become interested in guns at a time they feel vulnerable. In addition, when wives out earn their husbands, gun sales increase.&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12565">[70]</a>&nbsp;These men seem to see guns as one way to shore up masculinity. As we saw above, Jonathan Metzl’s work finds that guns are used by White men as a means of preserving racial privilege, even as Whites wind up being disproportionately harmed by the presence of guns.<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12565">[71]</a></p><p>&nbsp;It turns out in laboratory studies it’s pretty easy to threaten men’s masculinity into panic that then motivates them toward compensation. It’s worth taking a second look at a study described in&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780197578438.001.0001/oso-9780197578438-chapter-5">Chapter 4</a>&nbsp;where Julia Dahl [72] and her colleagues asked young and mostly White men to complete a “gender knowledge test.” During this test participants were asked questions such as, “What is a dime in football?” and “Do you wear Manolo Blahniks on your head or feet?” The respondents were then randomly put into either a threat condition—being told they scored similar to the average women—or a no-threat condition—being told they scored like the typical man. Their grouping had nothing to do with their actual answers on the test. Men threatened by being associated with women were more likely to feel embarrassed by their responses, angry, and wanted to display dominant behaviors. Anger predicted greater endorsement of ideologies that implicitly promote men’s power over women. Specifically, men’s social dominance orientations and benevolent sexism (and both are correlated with entitlement) increased if they were exposed to the masculine threat. How did the threatened men in this study appease that threat to their masculinity? By endorsing the legitimacy of men’s societal power over other groups, particularly women.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@jarispics?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jari Hytönen</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>, public domain</sub></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/700238372/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/700238372/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f06%2fGuns-and-the-precarity-of-manhood-480x184.png"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/700238372/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/05/the-possibility-of-a-world-without-intimate-violence/">The possibility of a world without intimate violence</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/06/a-caution-in-exploring-non-western-international-relations/">A caution in exploring non-Western International Relations</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/06/how-can-we-build-the-resilience-of-our-healthcare-systems/">How can we build the resilience of our healthcare systems?</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/23/we-dont-trust-extraverts-more-than-introverts/">We don’t trust extraverts more than introverts</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>When you think of an extravert, what personality traits come to mind? Sociability? Fun? While we often make positive judgments about&nbsp;extraversion, the picture is more complex, with negative traits also projected onto extraverts. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/27/extraverts-are-considered-to-be-poorer-listeners/">Some research suggests</a> that extraverts are seen as poorer listeners, for example.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221086768">new study</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, looks specifically at how much people trust those who are extraverted. The team finds that agreeableness, not extraversion, is the key to gaining trust in social situations.</p>



<span id="more-47869"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants were told they would be matched with another participant (who in reality did not exist) to play a trust game, in which decisions they made would affect both their payoffs and the payoffs of the other participant. All participants were given the role of the &#8220;trustor&#8221;, while their apparent partner played the &#8220;trustee&#8221;. They started with £1. If they chose to keep the money, this did not increase, but if they transferred it to their partner it was tripled. The partner could then choose how much of the £3 to transfer back to the participant.</p>



<p>After being given the £1, participants were told that their partner was either agreeable or disagreeable, and extraverted or introverted. They were then asked to indicate whether they would transfer the money or not.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants were more likely to trust agreeable than disagreeable partners: participants were four times more likely to transfer the £1 to agreeable trustees than disagreeable ones. Extraversion, however, was not significantly related to trust. This finding was replicated in a second study.</p>



<p>A third study found that even without explicitly knowing a person’s personality, it still seems to affect our judgement of their trustworthiness. Participants first rated their own personalities. Then, 1 to 2 weeks later, they completed an in-person lab session in groups&nbsp; of three to six people, most of whom did not know each other. Participants were told they would solve tasks as a group: three riddles, and two &#8220;unusual uses&#8221; tasks, which involve thinking of as many uses as possible for an object. They then took part in a similar trust game to the first studies.</p>



<p>Results again showed that people who had rated themselves as higher in agreeableness were more likely to be trusted by the other members of their group. No other Big Five trait, including extraversion, was related to trust. So it seemed that participants made judgements of others’ personalities based on their behaviour, and trusted those who they judged as agreeable.         </p>



<p>In the final study, the team found that we seem to instinctively know that agreeable people are more likely to be trusted. Participants were told they would interact with another participant and were given details of the trust game. However, this time, they were all assigned as the trust<em>ee</em>, not the trust<em>or</em>. They then rated themselves on extraversion&nbsp;and agreeableness.&nbsp;In one condition, participants were told their answers would be shown to their partner; in another, they were told the answers would remain private and they should answer as accurately as possible.</p>



<p>Participants in the public condition reported being more agreeable than those in the private condition: in other words, they presented themselves as more agreeable when they thought someone was judging them on how trustworthy they were. This was not the case with extraversion, however: participants did not report being more extraverted in the public condition compared to the private one.</p>



<p>Overall, the results from the four studies suggest that we don’t place any more trust in people with higher levels of extraversion. Agreeableness, however, is a trait that not only seems to facilitate trust but that we also want to emphasise when we ourselves want to be trusted.</p>



<p>Future research could explore exactly what it is about agreeableness that makes us trust people who embody it: non-verbal behaviour such as smiles or body language, types of verbal expression, or particular traits such as honesty or altruism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-chew-catnip-plant-insect-repel-chemistry-defense">Cats chewing on catnip boosts the plant’s insect-repelling powers</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many cats, a mere whiff of catnip can send them into a licking, rolling, plant-shredding frenzy.</p>



<p>That destruction amplifies catnip’s natural defenses against insects and its appeal to cats, a new chemical analysis finds. Compared with intact leaves, crushed-up leaves emit <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)00726-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS258900422200726X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">more volatile compounds called iridoids</a>, which act as an insect repellant, researchers report June 14 in <em>iScience</em>. The higher emissions also seem to encourage cats to continue rolling around in the remains of the plant, effectively coating themselves in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-catnip-plant-repels-insects-mosquitoes-chemical-receptor">natural bug spray</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>).</p>





<p>Masao Miyazaki, a biologist at Iwate University in Morioka, Japan, and his colleagues analyzed the chemistry of both catnip (<em>Nepeta cataria</em>) and silver vine (<em>Actinidia polygama)</em>, a plant common in Asia that has a similar euphoric effect on cats. Both plants naturally produce iridoids, which discourage insects from snacking on leaves.</p>



<p>As cats toyed with silver vine, the damaged leaves released about 10 times more iridoids than intact leaves did, and also changed the proportion of the chemicals released. The researchers also found that catnip when crushed up released over 20 times more of its insect repellant, mostly a type of iridoid called&nbsp;nepetalactone.</p>



<p>With both plants, lab-made iridoid cocktails mimicking those of damaged catnip and silver vine chased off more mosquitoes than chemical solutions that mirrored those of intact leaves, the study found.</p>



<p>The team also presented cats with two dishes — one with intact silver vine and one with damaged leaves. Without fail, the cats would go to the damaged leaf container and lick and play with the dish and roll against it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-early-universe-star-formation-hot-gas-space">An otherwise quiet galaxy in the early universe is spewing star stuff</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PASADENA, Calif.</strong> — A lucky celestial alignment has given astronomers a rare look at a galaxy in the early universe that is seeding its surroundings with the elements needed to forge subsequent generations of stars and galaxies.</p>



<p>Seen as it was just 700 million years after the Big Bang, the distant galaxy has gas flowing over its edges. It is <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas240/press-kit#Tue_pm">the earliest-known run-of-the-mill galaxy</a>, one that could have grown into something like the Milky Way, to show such complex behavior, astronomer Hollis Akins said June 14 during a news conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting. </p>





<p>“These results also tell us that this outflow activity seems to be able to shape galaxy evolution, even in this very early part of the universe,” said Akins, an incoming graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. He and colleagues also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06939">submitted their findings</a> June 14 to arXiv.org. </p>



<p>The galaxy, called A1689-zD1,­ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/going-distance-galaxies-may-hail-early-universe">shows up in light</a> magnified by Abell 1689, a large galaxy cluster that can bend and intensify, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-general-relativity-magnify-cosmos">gravitationally lens</a>, light from the universe’s earliest galaxies (<em>SN: 2/13/08; SN: 10/6/15</em>). Compared with other observed galaxies in the early universe, A1689-zD1 doesn’t make a lot of stars — only about 30 suns each year — meaning the galaxy isn’t very bright to our telescopes. But the intervening cluster magnified A1689-zD1’s light by nearly 10 times.</p>



<p>Akins and colleagues studied the lensed light with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, a large network of radio telescopes in Chile. The team mapped the intensities of a specific spectral line of oxygen, a tracer for hot ionized gas, and a spectral line of carbon, a tracer for cold neutral gas. Hot gas shows up where the bright stars are, but the cold gas extends four times as far, which the team did not expect.</p>



<p>“There has to be some mechanism [to get] carbon out into the circumgalactic medium,” the space outside of the galaxy, Akins says.</p>



<p>Only a few scenarios could explain that outflowing gas. Perhaps small galaxies are merging with A1689-zD1 and flinging gas farther out where it cools, Akins said. Or maybe the heat from star formation is pushing the gas out. The latter would be a surprise considering the relatively low rate of star formation in this galaxy. While astronomers have seen outflowing gas in other early-universe galaxies, those galaxies are bustling with activity, including converting thousands of solar masses of gas into stars per year.</p>

<p>The researchers again used the ALMA data to measure the motions of both the cold neutral and hot ionized gas. The hot gas showed a larger overall movement than the cold gas, which implies it’s being pushed from A1689-zD1’s center to its outer regions, Akins said at the news conference.</p>



<p>Despite the galaxy&#8217;s relatively low rate of star formation, Akins and his colleagues still think the 30-solar-masses of stars a year heat the gas enough to push it out from the center of the galaxy. The observations suggest a more orderly bulk flow of gas, which implies outflows, however the researchers are analyzing the movement of the gas in more detail and cannot yet rule out alternate scenarios.</p>



<p>They think when the hot gas flows out, it expands and eventually cools, Akins said, which is why they see the colder gas flowing over the galaxy’s edge. That heavy-element-rich gas <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-galaxy-may-contain-primeval-stars">enriches the circumgalactic medium</a> and will eventually be incorporated into later generations of stars (<em>SN: 6/17/15</em>). Due to gravity’s pull, cool gas, often with fewer heavy elements, around the galaxy also falls toward its center so A1689-zD1 can continue making stars.</p>



<p>These observations of A1689-zD1 show this flow of gas happens not only in the superbright, extreme galaxies, but even in normal ones in the early universe. “Knowing how this cycle is working helps us to understand how these galaxies are forming stars, and how they grow,” says Caltech astrophysicist Andreas Faisst, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Astronomers aren’t done learning about A1689-zD1, either. “It’s a great target for follow-up observations,” Faisst says. Several of Akins’s colleagues plan to do just that with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tetraneutron-four-neutron-cluster-physics-nuclear-forces">Physicists may have finally spotted elusive clusters of four neutrons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physicists have found the strongest sign yet of a fabled four of a kind.</p>



<p>For six decades, researchers have hunted for clusters of four neutrons called tetraneutrons. But evidence for their existence has been shaky. Now, scientists say they have observed neutron clusters that appear to be tetraneutrons. The result strengthens the case that the fab four is more than a figment of physicists’ imaginations. But some scientists doubt that the claimed tetraneutrons are really what they seem.</p>





<p>Unlike an atomic nucleus, in which protons and neutrons are solidly bound together, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04827-6">the purported tetraneutrons seem to be quasi-bound, or resonant, states</a>. That means that the clumps last only for fleeting instants — in this case, less than a billionth of a trillionth of a second, the researchers report in the June 23 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Tetraneutrons fascinate physicists because, if confirmed, the clusters would help scientists isolate and probe mysterious neutron-neutron forces and the inner workings of atomic nuclei. All atomic nuclei contain one or more protons, so scientists don’t have a complete understanding of the forces at play within groups composed only of neutrons.</p>





<p>Conclusively spotting the four-neutron assemblage would be a first. “Up to now, there was no real observation of … such a system that is composed only from neutrons,” says nuclear physicist Meytal Duer of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.</p>



<p>To create the neutron quartets, Duer and colleagues started with a beam of a radioactive, neutron-rich type of helium called helium-8, created at RIKEN in Wako, Japan. The team then slammed that beam into a target containing protons. When a helium-8 nucleus and proton collided, the proton knocked out a group of two protons and two neutrons, also known as an alpha particle. Because each initial helium-8 nucleus had two protons and six neutrons, that left four neutrons alone.</p>



<p>By measuring the momenta of the alpha particle and the ricocheting proton, the researchers determined the energy of the four neutrons. The measurement revealed a bump on a plot of the neutrons’ energy across multiple collisions — the signature of a resonance.</p>

<h3>Particle smashup</h3>



<p>Physicists collided a helium-8 nucleus with a target proton and measured the momenta of the ricocheting proton and an escaping alpha particle — a clump of two neutrons and two protons. Those measurements revealed signs that the four neutrons released in the smashup formed a long-sought cluster called a tetraneutron.</p>

<p>In the past, “there were indications, but it was never very clear” whether tetraneutrons existed, says nuclear physicist Marlène Assié of Laboratoire de Physique des 2 Infinis Irène Joliot-Curie in Orsay, France. In 2016, Assié and colleagues reported <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-find-signs-four-neutron-nucleus">hints of only a few tetraneutrons</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>2/8/16</em>). In the new study, the researchers report observing around 30 clusters. The bump on the new plot is much clearer, she says. “I have no doubts on this measurement.”</p>



<p>But theoretical calculations of what happens when four neutrons collide have raised skepticism as to whether a tetraneutron resonance can exist. If the forces between neutrons were strong enough to create a tetraneutron resonance, certain types of atomic nuclei should exist that are known not to, says theoretical nuclear physicist Natalia Timofeyuk of the University of Surrey in Guildford, England.</p>



<p>Because of that contradiction, she thinks that the researchers have not observed a true resonance, but another effect that is not yet understood. For example, she says, the bump could result from a “memory” that the neutrons retain of how they were arranged inside the helium-8 nucleus.</p>



<p>Other types of theoretical calculations are a closer match with the new results. “Indeed, theoretical results are very controversial, as they either predict a tetraneutron resonance in good agreement with the results presented in this paper, or they don&#8217;t predict any resonance at all,” says theoretical nuclear physicist Stefano Gandolfi of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Further calculations will be needed to understand the results of the experiment.</p>



<p>New experiments could help too. Because detecting neutrons, which have no electric charge, is more difficult than detecting charged particles, the researchers didn’t directly observe the four neutrons. In future experiments, Duer and colleagues hope to spot the neutrons and better pin down the tetraneutrons’ properties.</p>



<p>Future work may reveal once and for all whether tetraneutrons are the real deal. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-radar-map-invisible-universe-spacetime-dark-matter">Gravitational wave ‘radar’ could help map the invisible universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>It sounds like the setup for a joke: If radio waves give you radar and sound gives you sonar, what do gravitational waves get you?</p>



<p>The answer might be “GRADAR” — gravitational wave “radar” — a potential future technology that could use <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/fc078Y59A511c968a9428d26fb4ca40571e0710e5">reflections of gravitational waves to map the unseen universe</a>, say researchers in a paper accepted to<em> Physical Review Letters</em>. By looking for these signals, scientists may be able to find dark matter or dim, exotic stars and learn about their deep insides.</p>





<p>Astronomers routinely use gravitational waves — traveling ripples in the fabric of space and time itself, first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">detected in 2015</a> — to watch cataclysmic events that are hard to study with light alone, such as the merging of two black holes (<em>SN: 2/11/2016</em>).</p>



<p>But physicists have also known about a seemingly useless property of gravitational waves: They can change course. Einstein’s theory of gravity says that spacetime gets warped by matter, and any wave passing through these distortions will change course. The upshot is that when something emits gravitational waves, part of the signal comes straight at Earth, but some might arrive later — like an echo — after taking longer paths that bend around a star or anything else heavy.</p>



<p>Scientists have always thought these later signals, called “gravitational glints,” should be too weak to detect. But physicists Craig Copi and Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, took a leap: Working off Einstein’s theory, they calculated how strong the signal would be when waves scatter through the gravitational field inside a star itself.</p>



<p>“The shocking thing is that you seem to get a much larger result than you would have expected,” Copi says. “It’s something we’re still trying to understand, where that comes from — whether it’s believable, even, because it just seems too good to be true.”</p>



<p>If gravitational glints can be so strong, astronomers could possibly use them to trace the insides of stars, the team says. Researchers could even look for massive bodies in space that would otherwise be impossible to detect, like globs of dark matter or lone neutron stars on the other side of the observable universe.<br><br>“That would be a very exciting probe,” says Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>There are still reasons to be cautious, though. If this phenomenon stands up to more detailed scrutiny, Fishbach says, scientists would have to understand it better before they could use it — and that will probably be difficult.</p>



<p>“It’s a very hard calculation,” Copi says.</p>



<p>But similar challenges have been overcome before. “The whole story of gravitational wave detection has been like that,” Fishbach says. It was a struggle to do all the math needed to understand their measurements, she says, but now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">the field is taking off</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/21)</em>. “This is the time to really be creative with gravitational waves.”</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>Elections can be stressful. Research has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/10/liberal-americans-distress-at-2016-election-result-shouldnt-be-labelled-depression-study-argues/">looked into</a> the distress of Americans when Trump was elected, and elections have also <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-15050-005">been linked to</a> an increase in anxiety and stress, and poorer sleep quality. Most of this research, however, has looked at what happens <em>after</em> an election result, not before.</p>



<p>A new study takes a different look, asking how the approach of an election result can impact people&#8217;s mental health. Writing in the <em>International Journal of Psychology,</em> a team from North Carolina State University <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijop.12852">finds</a> that simply anticipating election stress has a negative effect on our mood.</p>



<span id="more-47849"></span>



<p>The study took place in 2018, starting just before a midterm election in the US; election day was November 6th, and the study took place between October 15th and November 13th. Participants first rated their own political ideology, and indicated whether they were identified as a Republican, Democrat, or something else. They then took part in a daily survey every day for the next 29 days.</p>



<p>Each day, participants indicated how negative they were feeling on a scale from 1 to 5. Negative mood was separated into five different feelings: upset, hostile, ashamed, nervous and afraid. They then indicated how likely it was they would experience stress related to the midterm in the next 24 hours, again on a scale from 1 to 5. Finally, participants indicated whether or not they had been exposed to information about the midterms that day via TV, newspaper, and other forums.</p>



<p>As expected, there was a significant association between anticipated election-related stress and negative mood: on days when people indicated that they were highly likely to experience stress around the midterms, their level of negative feeling was higher than on days when they did not expect to experience much stress. People were more likely to anticipate stress before the election and on election day than after election day. Conservatives also anticipated experiencing higher levels of election-related stress than liberals, which the team believes has something to do with the &#8220;Blue wave&#8221; that was taking place in the US at the time.</p>



<p>The team writes this is the first evidence linking an anticipatory form of stress around elections to negative mood, and adds to evidence that simply anticipating future stressors can be as impactful as experiencing those stressors directly. Anticipatory stress is also likely to be present in other areas of life, too, whether political or personal: future research could explore how this manifests itself in different domains.</p>



<p>If this is the case for all elections, then resources could be put in place to help people deal with their anxiety and stress. Overall, the study suggests that such feelings could have a serious impact on people’s wellbeing — and that anticipatory stress, around elections or other big events, should be taken seriously.</p>

          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, PLOS&rsquo; Editorial Director, Suzanne Farley, is among eight people appointed to the new </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/uk-committee-on-research-integrity-panel-members-announced/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK Committee on Research Integrity (UK CORI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This committee will take a deep dive into research integrity issues, and look for actionable steps to help prevent and resolve them. Prior to joining PLOS, Suzanne was the Research Integrity Director at Springer Nature. We asked her about her new role with UK CORI. </span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>PLOS:</strong> What is the remit of this group?</p>



<p><strong>Suzanne:</strong> In short, to promote research integrity across the UK and internationally. As recommended by a 2018<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/350/350.pdf"> parliamentary committee</a>, UK CORI will be a hub for discussion, consensus-building and development of co-ownership of integrity issues across research communities.</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong> What are the tangible objectives that this group hopes to achieve?</p>



<p><strong>Suzanne: </strong>First, to consolidate and communicate the evidence base: exactly what problems is the UK grappling with, and how does the research integrity landscape here compare to that in other countries? Second, to coordinate dismantling of the drivers of poor research practice. All within a framework of co-ownership: everyone involved in the research enterprise has a role to play.</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong> What&rsquo;s your timetable?</p>



<p><strong>Suzanne: </strong>As the inaugural committee, we first need to formulate a strategy, work plan and governance structure. With most members having only about 20 days per year for committee work, and there being a strong desire to consult widely across research communities, that will take the best part of 2022. But strategy development will run concurrently with several workstreams focused on short-term tangible deliverables; more to come on those soon.</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong> The makeup of this group consists of more than academics. Who else is involved in this group? Why the diversity?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Suzanne </strong><a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/uk-committee-on-research-integrity-panel-members-announced/">We have members</a> with publishing, government and policy backgrounds, as well as academics. Membership reflects the need for a broad range of disciplinary and career experience to be brought to bear on research integrity. All subject areas and all parts of the research cycle have issues to address, but the drivers and ways of working can differ markedly across the research sector. A &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach just won&rsquo;t work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong> Why is this group being formed now?</p>



<p><strong>Suzanne</strong>: Awareness of research integrity is at an all-time high. And stakeholders are much more willing to discuss the problems openly. New groups and initiatives are springing up all the time; we need to ensure coordination of efforts to maximise efficiency and efficacy of interventions. Add emergent public mistrust to the mix, and there&rsquo;s never been a better time for national and international collaboration to increase confidence in research.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong> A lot of research today involves international collaborations. Are there similar committees in different regions, and if so, does UK CORI intend to collaborate with them in the short/long term?</p>



<p><strong>Suzanne: </strong>Yes and yes! Many other parts of the world have similar national bodies. UK CORI is already liaising with many and intends to expand its network. What&rsquo;s worked in other countries that we can apply to the UK? With whom can we share knowledge and resources? Many UK researchers work with colleagues located elsewhere, or move from the UK to work abroad: fostering joint standards for best practice is in everyone&rsquo;s best interest.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-soil-agriculture-crops">Russia’s invasion could cause long-term harm to Ukraine’s prized soil</a></h4>

              
                <p>By now, wheat planted late last year waves in fields across Ukraine. Spring crops of sunflowers and barley are turning swaths of dark earth into a fuzz of bright green. But with Russia’s war being waged in some of the most fertile regions of Ukraine, uncertainty looms over summer harvesting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-farmers-don-bulletproof-vests-plough-frontline-fields-2022-04-26/">Ukrainian farmers braved a war zone</a> to carry out <a href="https://minagro.gov.ua/en/news/ukraine-farming-front-line">close to 80 percent of spring planting</a>, covering roughly 14 million hectares. Still, Russia’s invasion has raised fears that not only are this year’s crop yields in jeopardy, but also that Ukraine’s agricultural output could be diminished for years. At the root of this worry, in part, is how warfare impacts soil.</p>





<p>Ukraine is home to some of the most fertile soil in the world, making it a top global producer of cereals, such as wheat and maize, as well as seed oils like sunflower oil. The country’s exports feed millions of people from Europe and Africa to China and Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>With the war in its fourth month, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/cc0120en/cc0120en.pdf">at least 20 percent of Ukraine’s crops planted in winter will remain unharvested</a> or went unplanted. And despite farmers’ best efforts, many spring crops went unplanted. This summer’s <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/cb9171en/cb9171en.pdf">winter wheat harvest could be cut approximately in half</a> (a loss of about 2 million hectares) and sunflower products cut by a third.</p>



<p>With warfare able to degrade and contaminate soil for years, crop yields — and the people who depend on them — could suffer long after a cease-fire.</p>



<p>“In many ways, the welfare of the soil system in postwar nations is really intricately tied to the welfare of the people,” says soil scientist Asmeret Asefaw Berhe of University of California, Merced. “And in many ways, it’s going to dictate their long-term future, too.”</p>



<h4>Super soil</h4>



<p>A type of grassland soil called chernozem covers nearly two-thirds of agricultural lands in Ukraine<em>.</em> Meaning “black earth,” chernozem is a Ukrainian and Russian word that describes highly fertile soils distinguished by one to two meters of dark, rich organic matter. Over the last 10,000 years, it accumulated along the Eurasian steppes, slowly building up as a black bed atop fine, windblown sediments called loess, which coated the region as the glaciers retreated. At the same time in North America, grassland soils similar to chernozems called mollisols formed over the Great Plains, creating twin breadbaskets.</p>

<p>Chernozems are rich in elements that plants need to grow, such as nitrogen, potassium and calcium. Those nutrients come from organic matter and underlying loess. Chernozems also hit the sweet spot of clay content — just enough to help hold the soil together and cling onto nutrients but not so much that roots have a hard time penetrating the ground.</p>



<p>In their natural state, chernozems come preloaded with vitamins and minerals, like a super-smoothie of plant nutrition. “Plants growing in these soils are lucky,” Berhe says. “They’re growing in an environment that has everything they need to grow, with or without additional fertilizers or extra supplements.”</p>



<h4>Bombing fields</h4>



<p>There’s a term for what war does to soil: bombturbation. It’s grim wordplay on the natural process of bioturbation — earthworms and other animals stirring up soil. In this case, though, exploding bombs and artillery fire fling clods of dirt and dig craters. Joseph Hupy, a soil geomorphologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., <a href="https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/2006/11000/INTRODUCING__BOMBTURBATION,__A_SINGULAR_TYPE_OF.1.aspx">coined the term</a> with coauthor Randall Schaetzl in 2006 while studying soils’ battlefield scars.</p>



<p>At France’s World War I battlefield at Verdun, Hupy dug meter-long trenches with a backhoe across bomb craters and in their vicinity, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706108000281?via%3Dihub">looking for signs of disturbance</a>. He wanted to understand how the landscape recovered, with or without human help. He found decades-old chaos beneath the surface. His cross sections revealed rubble, chunks of limestone bedrock embedded in a slurry of sandy soil and organics. That chaos was reflected on the surface too: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X1100300X">Where there were craters, water flow had changed</a>, leading to different patterns of vegetation growth, Hupy and a colleague reported in 2012 in <em>Geomorphology</em>. Because of shifts in hydrology and a lack of human management, the landscape reverted from agriculture to forest. “It’s a completely new ecosystem,” he says.</p>

<p>Hupy noted similar changes at Vietnam’s Khe Sanh, which the United States heavily bombed in 1968. <a href="https://twitter.com/nolanwpeterson/status/1517960828020047873">Aerial images of Ukrainian battle zones</a> show pockmarked fields, reminiscent of the sites Hupy studied in Vietnam. Problems in Ukrainian soil may not be limited to the surface. Even if farmers smooth over the top of the soil, underground rubble can act like a barrier or sluice for water, which could make it harder to grow crops.</p>



<p>When there’s a highly compacted area beneath where the teeth of a plow can go, that impermeable layer of soil “can create standing water, and all other sorts of problems from an agricultural standpoint,” Hupy says.</p>



<h4>Trouble with tanks</h4>



<p>Bombs may leave some of the most obvious impacts, but they aren’t the only thing that can physically disturb soil. Soggy, thawing soils in Ukraine bogged down Russian tanks as if a metaphor of resistance: The land itself was fighting back. But what’s bad for invading tanks is also bad for the soil. When tanks roll over a field, their weight makes soil clump and stick together. Wet soil can compound the problem, exacerbating compaction. And chernozems are particularly vulnerable to compaction: With their thick layer of organic matter, they’re fluffy and light.</p>



<p>Compaction can <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-011-0071-8#Sec4">temporarily cut crop yields</a> by anywhere from 10 percent to nearly 60 percent because it makes it more difficult for roots to reach nutrients and prevents water and fertilizers from penetrating the soil. A study in <em>International Agrophysics</em> on compaction and crop yields in Eastern European chernozems, for instance, found <a href="http://www.international-agrophysics.org/pdf-106728-37570?filename=Effect%20of%20soil%20compaction.pdf">chernozem-grown barley plants</a> yielded about half the amount of crops when highly compacted. Earlier work suggested compaction could impact yields for up to five years if it reached deep enough into the chernozem. For all but the worst compaction, though, several seasons of typical planting will help heal the land, says soil scientist DeAnn Presley of Kansas State University in Manhattan.</p>



<p>“If you had tank traffic go right through a crop field, the farmer is probably going to go out and just till up the field pretty well after the conflict is over. And you may never see that [compaction] again,” Presley says. Compaction “will definitely look terrible and you’ll have yield losses, but I don’t think they’ll be forever or permanent.”</p>

<p>A study of military vehicles rolling over prairie soils outside Fort Riley, Kan., revealed it took as little as one year for dry soil to <a href="https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2009.0091">recover from being compacted</a>, but up to four years for wet soil to recover, both without tilling, scientists reported in <em>Soil Science Society of America</em> <em>Journal</em>. Tank traffic can alter the community of soil microbes and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092913930900119X?via%3Dihub">reduce the abundance of other organisms, like soil-aerating earthworms</a>, for several years as well, members of the same team reported in <em>Applied Soil Ecology</em>.</p>



<p>Chernozems’ <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1064229307090062.pdf">fluffiness might put it at greater risk of compaction, but it can also help the soil spring back</a> afterward, helping prevent it from becoming a longer-term problem. Hardy, deep-rooting plants like some of Ukraine’s native grasses could also loosen stubborn soils, Presley says, but it would take years.</p>



<h4>Chemical contamination</h4>



<p>Countering compaction can be a relatively quick fix; not so with chemical contamination. Fuel spills, spent ammunition, chemical weapons, and animal and human remains can all foul the soil, sometimes for decades or longer.</p>



<p>Potentially toxic metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury can leach out of ammunition and weaponry and into the soil. Pollutants from warfare are still found in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/21/9002">soils contaminated by wars as old as World War I</a>, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Sustainability</em>. At Ypres, a World War I battlefield in Belgium, scientists estimate that <a href="https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.01014.x">shells and artillery left more than 2,800 metric tons of copper</a> in the top half-meter of soil. In Iran, soils remain laced with mercury and chlorine from the 1980s.</p>



<p>As crops grow, they can <a href="http://psjd.icm.edu.pl/psjd/element/bwmeta1.element.ojs-doi-10_17951_pjss_2015_48_1_111">draw up these potentially toxic elements</a>. Other elements, such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00425-021-03642-z">zinc</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02149717">nickel</a>, can severely stunt crop growth, says Ganga Hettiarachchi, a soil chemist also at Kansas State University. But soil contamination can be a hidden danger. If it doesn’t damage the plants, there may be no way of knowing if the soil is contaminated without careful testing, she says.</p>



<p>In some ways, chernozems are well-equipped to stop contaminants in their tracks in a matter of months. The soil’s organic matter and clay can trap toxic elements before they can enter a plant, sucking out contaminants – even in a matter of days in optimal lab conditions, Hettiarachchi says. But in real life, many chernozems are also slightly acidic, which can let those elements stay in a form that plants can take up for months before being stopped.</p>



<p>Because of this uncertainty, every potentially contaminated patch of soil must be checked to see if crops can be safely grown. “We have to monitor the soil and the crops as well, at least until we understand what’s going on,” says Hettiarachchi.</p>

<p>For some elements, farmers could remediate by planting plants known to extract those elements over time, says Hettiarachchi, but that would require several years of planting. Other options include altering the soils’ pH to lock away metals or adding extra fertilizer, which can also immobilize potentially toxic elements. But even after remediation occurs, farmers must test to see if soil conditions are keeping the contaminants locked away, or if the war is coming back to haunt them from the ground.</p>



<p>Depending on the extent of contamination, “it might not be possible for Ukrainian farmers to avoid growing in contaminated soils,” she says. Soil testing and time will tell.</p>



<h4>Looking toward the future</h4>



<p>With Russia’s bombardment of Ukraine still ongoing, the effect on the country’s soil is still uncertain. There are some hints, though. This isn’t the first time the Donbas region — a disputed area in eastern Ukraine — has come under fire. Russian-backed separatists attacked it beginning in 2014 too.</p>



<p>Scientists working in the Donbas to improve soil health there have faced <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olena-Panova-2/publication/340823460_GEOLOGY_IN_ENVIRONMENTAL_MANAGEMENT_ISSUES_OF_THE_DONBAS_WITHIN_THE_CONTEXT_OF_ITS_FORTHCOMING_RESTORATION/links/5ed0f20845851529451b8936/GEOLOGY-IN-ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT-ISSUES-OF-THE-DONBAS-WITHIN-THE-CONTEXT-OF-ITS-FORTHCOMING-RESTORATION.pdf">a litany of challenges</a>: The region’s agriculture already suffered from degradation due to irrigation waters polluted by coal mines, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Mineralogical Journal</em>. Decades of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ludmila-Vorotyntseva/publication/329361817_Productivity_of_grain_of_early_hybrids_of_corn_of_different_strain_changings/links/613225cc0360302a007a5675/Productivity-of-grain-of-early-hybrids-of-corn-of-different-strain-changings.pdf">intense farming had also taken a toll</a>. Since 2014, conflict has exacerbated those problems, creating new issues and hampering scientists’ ability to help.</p>



<p>The region’s “chernozems have suffered and are <a href="http://agronomyjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/2021/issue_2/Art22.pdf">experiencing irreparable military degradation</a>,” Ukrainian soil scientists and a lawyer wrote in 2021 in <em>Scientific Papers. Series A. Agronomy</em>. “It is easy to predict [the degradation of chernozems], but very difficult to overcome.”</p>



<p>Even as the fighting has been concentrated in eastern Ukraine, this assessment now may apply to a far broader swath of the country. “Our unique soils, chernozems, are in unprecedented conditions,” representatives from Ukraine’s Institute for Soil Science and Agrochemistry Research wrote <em>Science News</em> in an e-mail. “The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained. In fact, we have just begun to work in this direction … in difficult military conditions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-falling-dominoes-friction">How fast a row of dominoes topples depends on friction</a></h4>

              
                <p>It may seem like fun and games, but understanding how dominoes topple isn’t child’s play.</p>



<p>“It’s a problem that is so natural; everybody plays with dominoes,” says David Cantor, a researcher at Polytechnique Montreal with a background in civil engineering. So Cantor set out to create computer simulations of a row of dominoes collapsing in a chain reaction.</p>



<p>Domino games are more fun with a buddy — and so is research on the rectangular blocks. Cantor teamed up with a friend, physicist Kajetan Wojtacki of the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.</p>





<p>Friction is crucial for determining <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.17.064021">the speed at which the collapse cascades through a row of dominoes</a>, the pair report in the June <em>Physical Review Applied</em>. That includes both the friction between colliding dominoes, and between the dominoes and the surface they sit on.</p>



<p>The computer simulations revealed the conditions needed for a speedy collapse. Toppling cascaded quickest for closely spaced dominoes that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-seek-materials-defy-friction-atomic-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had little friction between them</a> and that stood on a high-friction surface (<em>SN: 8/1/19</em>).</p>



<p>Less friction between dominoes — as occurs for tiles with more slippery surfaces — means less energy is lost. And more friction between the dominoes and the surface they stand on, such as rough felt, means that the tiles don’t slide too far backward as they fall. Such backsliding would otherwise slow the cascade.</p>



<p>In some simulations, the chain reaction stopped short. For instance, dominoes spaced far apart on a slippery surface backslid so much they avoided hitting each other.</p>



<p>Based on the simulations, the two domino dynamos came up with an equation that predicts the speed of collapse and showed that the predictions matched results of previous experiments. Turns out, there’s serious science behind the satisfying spectacle.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/21/religious-people-are-less-likely-to-avoid-reminders-of-human-mortality/">Religious people are less likely to avoid reminders of human mortality</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Do you know how far you’d have to walk to get from the central railway station in Wuhan, China to the nearest cemeteries? I’ll tell you: an average of just over 25 kilometres. For Berlin, the figure is less than 5. “Chinese tourists are surprised by unexpectedly running into cemeteries when visiting cities in Europe,” write the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221096281">new paper</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. “They are curious when seeing how close to a graveyard people live and spend their leisure time there because these are rarely encountered in China.”</p>



<p>In fact, when the team plotted the mean walking distance between the central railway station and the five nearest cemeteries in 10 European capital cities and 10 major cities in China, the difference was clear: the longest European distance was still less far than the shortest distance in China.</p>



<p>Why might this be? Xiaoyue Fan at Peking University and colleagues wondered if differences in religiosity might explain it. The majority of the Chinese population has no religious affiliation, the team notes, whereas this is not the case in Europe. Perhaps, then, people who believe in an afterlife are less troubled by seeing symbols of mortality — like graveyards — and this is why they are closer to the centres of so many European cities.</p>



<span id="more-47843"></span>



<p>To explore this idea, the team drew on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/terror-management-theory">Terror Management Theory</a> to develop a task to measure &#8220;behavioural avoidance of symbols of mortality&#8221; (BASM). A cue word — &#8220;death&#8221; or &#8220;life&#8221; — was placed in the centre of a circle. Participants then had to position seven other target words within that circle. These target words consisted of &#8220;self&#8221;, &#8220;family&#8221;, a favourable celebrity’s name, an unfavourable celebrity’s name, the name of a stranger and also &#8220;stone&#8221; (the only inanimate object).</p>



<p>In an initial study, the team found that Chinese participants tended to position &#8220;self&#8221;, &#8220;family&#8221; and the favourable celebrity’s name furthest from &#8220;death&#8221;, with &#8220;stone&#8221; closest. The distances between the cue word and each target word were used to generate a measure of each individual’s BASM. And in a fresh study, the team gained support for the task’s validity by finding that individuals with a higher BASM — those who put words like “self” and  “family” further away from “death” — tended to also sit further away from a fake skull. </p>



<p>Next, the team found that Chinese Christians had lower BASM scores than a group of Chinese non-believers. (This effect held when various potential confounding factors, such as self-esteem and feelings of inter-dependence vs independence, were taken into account.)</p>



<p>Finally, the team studied groups of Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists as well as non-believers in other countries, including the US. Across the studies, they consistently found that believers got lower scores than non-believers. (They also found that priming non-believers with Christian or Buddhist afterlife beliefs — with Christian pictures of heaven and angels, for example —&nbsp;before they took the test reduced BASM scores, suggesting that afterlife beliefs do have an influence.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the major functions of religious beliefs is to reduce a person’s fear of death,” the researchers write. They suspect that belief in an afterlife — whatever its exact nature — acts as an emotional buffer against reminders of our mortality.</p>



<p>If believers are less affected by seeing a graveyard than non-believers, is this why people are buried so relatively close to European city centres?</p>



<p>It might be part of the reason. But of course parish churches, with their graveyards, were once the centre of local life in the UK and many European countries. As cities like London expanded gradually over centuries, these churches and graves were engulfed. They became part of the fabric of the city. Occupants of European vs Chinese major cities might also be happier to spend some leisure time surrounded by graves simply because churchyards are available as quiet spots to escape the urban commotion, rather than because belief in an afterlife makes them less of a threat.</p>



<p>Still, parts of Europe are becoming less religious.  In 2011, a quarter of the UK population said they had no religion. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/articles/howreligionhaschangedinenglandandwales/2015-06-04">In 2001, that figure was just 15%</a>. Many of us live in close proximity to graveyards. Do they in fact represent a growing driver of death-related anxiety in the population? Only further research will tell.</p>

<p>Were hadrosaurid hatchlings in need of extensive parental care? Although eggs from these dinosaurs are relatively common, they usually do not contain enough embryonic material to help define the early ontogeny of these large herbivores that lived near the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. In this recent BMC Ecology and Evolution publication, researchers from the University of Geosciences in China and the Carletown University in Canada studied two well preserved fossil embryos from an egg cluster found in the Upper Cretaceous red beds of the Ganzhou Basin in China and reached the conclusion that altriciality was probably the original ancestral condition for hadrosaurids. Although the embryos were yet several embryonic stages away from hatching, their limb bone structure indicated that the younglings of this small and primitive lineage of hadrosaurs were incapable of moving around on their own soon after hatching, having to spend some time in the nest until their limb bones finished forming.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><img class="size-medium wp-image-12895 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/smoke-pregnancy-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/smoke-pregnancy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/smoke-pregnancy-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/smoke-pregnancy-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/smoke-pregnancy.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />There is enough robust evidence to say that smoking during pregnancy carries harmful effects, including an increased risk of miscarriage and placental abnormalities. Scientific studies also suggest that smoking cessation prior to 20 weeks of gestational age can eliminate that excess risk. However, socially disadvantaged pregnant women present lower success rates of tobacco discontinuation during pregnancy. In an effort to understand the barriers impeding antenatal smoking cessation in this population, researchers from the University of Adelaide conducted a series of interviews with 17 female smokers attending a metropolitan antenatal clinic in South Australia. Authors found that smoking was deeply embedded in these women’s socially disadvantaged lives. Quitting smoking was often a low priority as it was considered a necessary habit for coping with the challenges associated with their socioeconomic circumstances. These facts were the foundation of feelings of isolation, disempowerment, and marginalization around smoking from the general community, health service providers and sometimes their smoking social circle. The authors appeal to provide a more comprehensive health care approach able to cover the physiological, psychological, and sociological barriers to successful antenatal smoking cessation.</p>

This characteristic has been exploited to establish DNA repair-targeting therapies in different cancer types, such as tumors where the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway is affected. In these cases, BCRA1/2 mutations have been classically used as a powerful tool for clinical risk assessment and management, but for patients without these mutations, the thresholds of genetic and epigenetic alterations able to trigger HRR deficiency phenotypes still need to be established. In their latest publication, Dr. Leivowitz and colleagues developed and validated a predictive diagnostic platform for assessing homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in a wide number of cancer types. The authors combined an HRD-DNA approach, measuring genome-wide loss-of-heterozygosity with a HRD-RNA approach based on a logistic regression model trained on whole-exome capture RNA sequencing data. The model provides a gene expression HRD biomarker signature in different tumors, also detecting HRD driven by non-BRCA1/2 mechanisms. The study highlights how this approach may provide new biomarkers for HRD-status across different solid tumors with a lower frequency of biallelic BRCA loss.</p>

In their latest BMC Infectious Diseases publication, researchers from the Penn State College of Medicine and Milton S. Hershey Medical Center conducted a meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials and cohort studies aimed to assess how immunity wanes over time after full COVID-19 vaccination. Using a pooled cohort of 7 million individuals followed up for months, the authors offer data on how vaccine efficiency against infection decreases from 83% to 22% after just five months, while the protection against symptomatic COVID-19 declines from 94% to 64% after four months. Positively, their results support a robust and persistent 90% protection against developing severe COVID-19 after full vaccination. The study concludes with a data-based recommendation of booster vaccination for individuals over 65 years old and those who received Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.</p>

In their recent study, researchers from the University of Colorado and the CareQuest Institute for Oral Health in Boston explore dentist perceptions and barriers to the implementation of this technology. Although the authors state that previous studies have proven that teledentistry delivers similar or better outcomes than conventional healthcare while also being cost-effective, their results show that only 23% of the 2767 dental providers participating in the study use virtual platform consultations routinely. Among the reasons for not adopting teledentistry, the authors found that a considerable amount of practitioners are still concerned about the level of care delivered through virtual platforms. The authors conclude that there is a need to develop training programs, supportive legislation, and insurer regulations to help promote the uptake and suitability of the use of teledentistry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dwarf-galaxy-m81-astronomy-space">Seven newfound dwarf galaxies sit on just one side of a larger galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PASADENA, Calif.</strong> — The faint dwarf galaxies in a nearby galaxy group seem to have missed the memo. Instead of being dispersed evenly around the group’s most massive galaxy, which is what happens in our own galaxy group, these newly found dwarfs cluster in one region. And astronomers don’t know why.</p>



<p>“This satellite distribution is just weird,” astronomer Eric Bell said June 13 at the American Astronomical Society meeting.</p>



<p>Bell, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and colleagues used the Subaru telescope in Hawaii to hunt for faint clumps of stars, indicating dwarf galaxies, around the galaxy M81. This Milky Way–like galaxy is the most prominent member in a relatively nearby group of galaxies, all about 12 million light-years from Earth. The team found one definite dwarf galaxy and six possible fainter ones.</p>

<p>“The part that’s just bananas,” Bell said, is that the newfound satellite galaxies all sit on one side of M81.</p>



<p>Computer simulations of galaxy evolution suggest that the largest galaxies have many faint, small galaxies sprinkled uniformly throughout the outer part of the dominant galaxy’s diffuse cloudlike halo. Observations in our galaxy group back this up: The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-nine-new-dwarf-galaxies-found-outside-milky-way">dozens of dwarf galaxies</a> known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eight-more-galaxies-found-orbiting-milky-way">orbit in the Milky Way</a>’s outskirts are distributed evenly around the galaxy, as are most of the dwarf galaxies seen around our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy (<em>SN: 3/11/15</em>; <em>SN: 8/19/15</em>).</p>



<p>But in the M81 group, the seven newly identified star clumps appear to surround a smaller member of that group, NGC 3077, which is about one-tenth the mass of M81. “The fact that the bigger thing doesn’t have more satellites,” Bell says, “nobody expects that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">Western wildfires’ health risks extend across the country</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">After a relaxing day at the Jersey Shore last July, Jessica Reeder and her son and daughter headed back home to Philadelphia. As they crested a bridge from New Jersey into Pennsylvania, they were greeted with a hazy, yellow-gray sky. It reminded Reeder of the smoky skies she saw growing up in Southern California on days when fires burned in the dry canyons.</p>



<p>Smelling smoke and worried about her asthma and her kids, Reeder flipped the switch to recirculate the air inside the car instead of drawing from the outside. At home, the family closed all the windows and turned their air purifiers on high.</p>





<p>The smoke had traveled from fires raging on the other side of the continent, in the western United States and Canada. Although air quality in Philadelphia didn’t come close to the record-bad air quality that some western cities experienced, it was bad enough to trigger air quality warnings — and not just for people with asthma or heart problems.</p>



<p>Most large U.S. wildfires occur in the West. But the smoke doesn’t stay there. It travels eastward, affecting communities hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from the fires. In fact, the majority of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GH000457">asthma-related deaths and emergency room visits attributed to fire smoke</a> in the United States occur in eastern cities, according to a study in the September 2021 <em>GeoHealth</em>.</p>

<p>The big problem is fine particulate matter, tiny particles also known as PM<sub>2.5</sub>. These bits of ash, gases and other detritus suspended in smoke are no more than 2.5 micrometers wide, small enough to lodge in the lungs and cause permanent damage. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular problems and can lead to premature death. The particles can also <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/links-between-air-pollution-and-childhood-asthma">cause asthma and other chronic conditions in otherwise healthy adults and children</a>.</p>



<p>Over the last few decades, U.S. clean air regulations have cut down on particulate matter from industrial pollution, so the air has been getting cleaner, especially in the populous eastern cities. But the regulations don’t address particulate matter from wildfire smoke, which recent studies show is chemically different from industrial air pollution, potentially more hazardous to humans and increasing significantly.</p>



<p>So far, a lot of the research on how wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> can make people sick has been based on people living or working near fires in the West. Now, researchers are turning their attention to how PM<sub>2.5</sub> from smoke affects the big population centers in the East, far from the wildfires. One thing is clear: With the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">intensity and frequency of wildfires increasing</a> due to climate change (<em>SN: 12/19/20 &amp; 1/2/21, p. 32</em>), people across North America need to be concerned about the health impacts, says Katelyn O’Dell, an atmospheric scientist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p>





<h4>Bad air travels</h4>



<p>Air pollution regulations limit PM<sub>2.5</sub> from exhaust-emitting cars and trucks and fossil fuel–burning factories and power plants. These regulations have done “a really good job” reducing anthropogenic air pollution in the last couple of decades, says Rosana Aguilera, an environmental scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. In the United States, concentrations of six of the most common air pollutants have <a href="https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2021/#home">dropped by 78 percent</a> since the Clean Air Act of 1970, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations have come down as well — at least until recently.</p>



<p>Western wildfires, which are growing more frequent, more severe and larger, are erasing some of the gains made in reducing industrial pollution, says Rebecca Buchholz, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.</p>



<p>Fires in the Pacific Northwest are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29623-8">“driving an upward trend” in particulate matter air pollution</a>, Buchholz and colleagues wrote April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Such smoke pollution peaks in August when fires in the region tend to spike and the atmosphere’s ability to clean itself through, say, rain, is limited. This spike of late-summer air pollution is new, Buchholz says. It’s especially noticeable since 2012.</p>

<p>And, as Reeder and her family experienced last year, transported wildfire pollution is causing substantial particulate matter spikes in the central United States and northeastern North America, Buchholz and colleagues found. Pacific Northwest wildfires thus “have the potential to impact surface air quality, even at large distances downwind of the wildfires,” the team wrote, putting some 23 million people in the central United States and 72 million in northeastern North America at increased risk of health impacts from the imported wildfire smoke.</p>



<p>How far and where PM<sub>2.5</sub> travels depends on weather patterns and how high wildfire smoke reaches — the stronger the fire, the longer it can last and the farther smoke can go, and thus the farther particulate matter can reach. Last year, far-away wildfires created unhealthy air quality conditions in locations from the Great Plains to New York City and Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>New York City saw some of its worst air quality in two decades. Philadelphia had two “code red” days — meaning air quality was unhealthy for all — because of the U.S. West and Canadian fires. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, those fires pushed PM<sub>2.5</sub> to unhealthy levels in much of Minnesota. In fact, a 2018 study showed that <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/1745/2018/">wildfire smoke plumes now waft above Minnesota for eight to 12 days per month</a> between June and September.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Air safety yardstick</h3>



<p>The Air Quality Index, or AQI, ranges from 0 to 500, based on the amount of pollution in the air at a given time. Ground-level ozone, particulate matter (both PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are the primary parameters considered in the index. Code orange (above a score of 100) is unhealthy for people with heart and lung disease, older adults, children and people with diabetes. Code red and above (151–500) is unhealthy for everyone.</p>

<h4>Human impacts</h4>



<p>Smoke in the West is already having a tangible effect on human health in the East, says O’Dell, lead author of the 2021 <em>GeoHealth</em> study.</p>



<p>Reviewing smoke and health data from 2006 to 2018, O’Dell and colleagues found that more people visit emergency rooms and are hospitalized in the East than in the West from asthma problems attributable to smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Asthma-related ER visits and hospitalizations were higher east of the Rockies in 11 of the 13 years.</p>



<p>Over the study period, an average of 74 percent of asthma-related deaths and 75 percent of asthma ER visits and hospitalizations attributable to smoke occurred east of the Rockies. Of the estimated 6,300 excess deaths from asthma complications due to smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> that occurred annually over the study period, more than 4,600 were in the East.</p>



<p>Smoke affects so many more people in the East primarily because more people live there, O’Dell notes. Her team defined “West” as west of the Rockies, with a population of 64 million, and “East” as east of the Rockies, home to 226 million people. In the West, smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> causes a higher portion of regional asthma deaths. In the East, it’s a lower portion of the total population, but a far higher total number of people affected.</p>



<p>“We may be already seeing the consequences of these fires on the health of residents who live hundreds or even thousands of miles downwind,” Buchholz said in a press release.</p>

<h3>August peaks</h3>



<p>Although aerosols, including fine particulate matter, from Pacific Northwest fires have been increasing since 2002, they began a sharp increase in 2012, spiking in the warm, dry summer months. As smoke from the Northwest wafted eastward, similar smaller spikes were seen in the central United States and northeastern North America. </p>

<h4>Vulnerable youth</h4>



<p>“Asthma is a very widespread, common health condition,” says Yang Liu, an environmental scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. In the United States, about 25 million people have asthma, or 8 percent of adults and 7 percent of children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Fine particulate matter can spark asthma attacks, but it can also be a danger to people without the condition. Children are especially vulnerable primarily because of physiology. Children breathe faster so they end up taking in more particulate matter, plus their lungs are smaller so more of their lung surface is likely to be damaged when they breathe in particulate matter. And their lungs are still developing, says Jennifer Stowell, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.</p>



<p>Stowell led a study, reported in the January <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4138">estimating how much wildfire smoke will exacerbate asthma attacks in the West</a>. Stowell, Liu and colleagues estimate that, in the 2050s, there will be an additional 155,000 asthma-related ER visits and hospitalizations per wildfire season in the West just from smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The biggest concern, Stowell says, is for children and younger adults.</p>



<p>Aguilera, of Scripps, and her colleagues found associations between wildfire-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> and pediatric respiratory-related ER and urgent care visits. In San Diego County from 2011 to 2017, <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/4/e2020027128/180791/Fine-Particles-in-Wildfire-Smoke-and-Pediatric">wildfire-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 10 times as harmful to respiratory health</a> in children 5 and younger as ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Pediatrics</em>. In fact, the same increase in levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from smoke versus ambient sources caused a 26 percent higher rate of ER or urgent care visits. The researchers didn’t note whether the children had preexisting asthma.</p>



<p>And even when a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860802/">wildfire increased PM<sub>2.5</sub> by a small amount</a>, respiratory ER and urgent care visits in kids 12 and under increased, Aguilera and colleagues reported in 2020 in the <em>Annals of the American Thoracic Society</em>. “Even relatively smaller wildfires can still generate quite an impact on the pediatric population,” Aguilera says. “And really, any amount of PM or air pollution is harmful.”</p>



<p>Studies of nonhuman primates have also shown permanent effects of smoke on the young — results researchers expect would also apply to humans, given genetic similarities. In 2008, a group of infant rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis was exposed to high PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels from a series of devastating wildfires in Northern California. Researchers have been comparing those monkeys with macaques born a year later that weren’t exposed to smoke.</p>

<p>At around age 3, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28208028/">macaques exposed to smoke displayed immune disorders</a> and reduced lung capacity, lung function and lung volume, says Hong Ji, a molecular biologist at UC Davis and the primate center who wasn’t involved with this study. The lungs look like they had fibrosis, Ji says. “Early life smoke exposure &#8230; changed the trajectory of lung development,” and it doesn’t appear to be reversible, she says.</p>



<p>The monkeys exposed to wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021006188?via%3Dihub">have important changes to how their DNA works</a>, Ji and colleagues reported in the January <em>Environment International</em>. Exposure to wildfire smoke in infancy can cause life-altering, long-term changes to the monkeys’ nervous and immune systems, as well as brain development, Ji says. Even worse, she says, the DNA changes are the type that can be passed down and may result in generational damage.</p>



<p>Even <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29436-9">macaques born after in utero exposure to wildfire smoke can suffer cognitive, immune and hormone problems</a>, primate center researchers reported April 1 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>Now, Ji and colleagues have teamed with Rebecca Schmidt, a molecular epidemiologist at UC Davis who’s leading a study on the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on pregnant women and young children. This research group, as well as other teams, is also looking into whether PM<sub>2.5</sub> is causing genetic changes to babies exposed to smoke in utero, Ji says. The more results gathered on the effects of wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> on babies and children — and even in pregnancy — the more dangerous we realize it is, Ji says.</p>



<h4>Chemical differences</h4>



<p>Particulate matter changes as it travels through the atmosphere, both in volume and in chemistry. Some PM<sub>2.5</sub> is emitted directly from fires, and some is born from chemicals and trace gases emitted from fires that get chemically processed in the atmosphere, Buchholz says. Reactions that happen in the smoke plume, combined with sunlight, can create even more PM<sub>2.5</sub> downwind of the fires. How these particulates change chemically — through interactions between the atmosphere and the particulate matter, and between fire pollution and human pollution — and what that means for human health “is a really active area of research right now,” she says. “It’s super complicated.”</p>



<p>Epidemiological and atmospheric chemistry studies indicate that wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> is more hazardous to human health than ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, says Stowell, the Boston epidemiologist. One such study compared particulate matter from Amazonian fires with urban sources such as vehicle exhaust in Atlanta. Nga Lee Ng, an atmospheric chemist at Georgia Tech, and colleagues found that <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00060">smoke particulate matter is more toxic than urban particulate matter</a>, “inducing about five times higher cellular oxidative stress,” Ng says. Oxidative stress damages cells and DNA in the body.</p>



<p>In addition, as smoke travels through the atmosphere and ages, it seems to become even more toxic, Ng says. Reactions between the particulate matter and sunlight and atmospheric gases change the particulate matter’s chemical and physical properties, rendering it even more potentially harmful. So, even though particulate matter dissipates over time and distance, “the health effects per gram are greater,” says Daniel Jaffe, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington Bothell.</p>



<p>That means that the studies of health effects near wildfires in the West may not represent the full story of how smoke from distant fires affects people in the East.</p>



<p>Liu, at Emory, hopes to see the U.S. government revisit policies related to what PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels are dangerous, since they’re based on ambient and not wildfire-related PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In March, an EPA advisory panel recommended just that. <a href="https://www.lawandenvironment.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/casac-review-of-the-epas-policy-assessment-for-the-reconsideration-of-the-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-particulate-matter-external-review-draft-october-2021.pdf">In a letter to the agency</a>, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee wrote: “Regarding the annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard, all CASAC members agree that the current level of the annual standard is not sufficiently protective of public health and should be lowered.” The committee added, “There is substantial epidemiologic evidence from both morbidity and mortality studies that the current standard is not adequately protective.”</p>



<p>Local communities throughout the country need to determine when to close schools or at least keep kids inside, Liu says, as well as when to advise people to close windows and turn on air purifiers. Good masks — N95 and KN95 — can help too (yes, masks that block viruses can also block particulate matter).</p>



<p>City, county and state governments also need to prepare the health care system to respond to increased asthma issues, Liu says. Some states are starting to respond. In 2017, for example, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency increased its air quality monitoring stations around the state from two to 18. The agency is also working with the National Weather Service, the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to better communicate air quality warnings.</p>

<p>In the meantime, much more research is needed into the human health implications of increasing wildfire smoke, Buchholz says, as well as the chemical interactions in the atmosphere, how climate is changing fires, how fires change year after year, and how they impact the atmosphere, not to mention how different trees, buildings and other fuels affect particulate matter.</p>



<p>“Wildfires are perhaps one of the most visible ways that [climate change] is linked to health,” Stowell says. And the reality is, she says, “we’re going to see it remain as bad or worse for a while.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Smoke gets on the brain</h4>



<p>Health impact studies of air pollution, including wildfire smoke, have mostly focused on the lungs. But toxicologist Matthew Campen of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque is looking at the brain.</p>



<p>In a study of the inflammatory effects of smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> on the brains of mice, Campen and colleagues found that inflammation in the lungs was modest compared with the “profound” inflammation in the brain, Campen says. Given what’s known about how damaging smoke can be in the lungs, to find even greater effects on the brain is troubling, he says.</p>



<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-abstract/186/1/149/6449455">The inflammatory effect on the mice’s brains was almost immediate</a>, within 24 hours of exposure, the researchers reported in the March <em>Toxicological Sciences</em>. The particulates enter the body through the respiratory system, get in the blood, and are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier and start affecting the brain. Inflammation has been linked with dementia in older people and neurodevelopmental issues in younger people, plus mood disorders like anxiety and depression, Campen says.</p>



<p>“I’m hoping that our study with mice spurs … epidemiologists to take a look,” he says. “The effects we see are much stronger and more worrisome than what we see in the lungs,” he says, but we don’t know yet at what PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels the danger begins. “We need to explore this more rigorously.” <em>— Megan Sever</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-kids-babies-under-5-fda-united-states">Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines are OK’d for the youngest kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The littlest kids in the United States are done waiting for their own COVID-19 vaccine.</p>



<p>On June 18, an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unanimously recommended Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccines for babies, toddlers and preschoolers. CDC director Rochelle Walensky endorsed that recommendation hours later. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-children"> granted emergency use authorization</a> of the vaccines on June 17, two days after the FDA’s advisory committee had voted unanimously in favor of the authorization.</p>





<p>The recommendation — a relief to many families of young children who&#8217;ve endured multiple COVID-19 surges, restricted outings and daycare disruptions — comes a year and a half after<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval"> adults were first vaccinated</a> against COVID-19 in December 2020 (<em>SN: 12/18/20</em>). This young age group consists of approximately 18.7 million children.</p>



<p>“This recommendation does fill a significant unmet need for a really ignored younger population,” said FDA committee member Michael Nelson, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville. He hopes every child in the United States “gets vaccinated in the near future.”</p>



<p>The first shots for the littlest kids could be available as early as June 21. According to<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/09/fact-sheetbiden-administration-announces-operational-plan-for-covid-19-vaccinations-for-children-under-5/"> plans released by the Biden administration</a>, an initial 10 million doses for young children will come first, with millions more arriving in the following weeks. Families will be able to get the shots at pediatrician offices, community health centers, public health clinics, children’s hospitals and pharmacies, among other locations. The goal is that 85 percent of kids under 5 will be within 5 miles of a vaccination site.</p>



<p>The FDA and CDC advisory committee meetings were a reminder yet again that the youngest are not free of risk from COVID-19. Among children, those 0 to 4 years old have the highest number of deaths compared with those who are older:<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics"> &nbsp;485 kids ages 0 to 4 have died</a>, topping the 366, 384 and 311 reported in the 5–11, 12–15 and 16–17 year age groups, respectively, according to the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker as of June 17.</p>



<p>From March 2020 through April 2022, COVID-19 was the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.23.22275458v2">fourth leading cause of death for children under 1 year old and the fifth leading cause for kids ages 1 through 4</a>. COVID-19 is the only infectious disease among the top five. The burden of deaths from COVID-19 is similar to or greater than that of other pediatric vaccine-preventable diseases, said Sara Oliver, a medical officer with the CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, during a presentation at CDC’s advisory committee meeting.</p>



<p>The winter<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious"> surge driven by the omicron variant</a> of the coronavirus was especially hard on the littlest kids (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>). For children under 5, there were<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7111e2.htm"> 14.5 hospitalizations per 100,000</a> children in the United States during the peak of omicron, a rate five times as high as that seen during the delta variant’s peak, researchers reported in March in the <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Roughly 1 in 4 children under 5 hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in the intensive care unit, said pediatrician Evan Anderson of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta during a presentation at the FDA’s advisory committee meeting. “Having cared for many children that have been in the ICU on ventilators for COVID … and having cared for several children that have died of COVID, we need to be able to prevent COVID-19,” Anderson said.</p>



<p>The seriousness of the illness means that “prevention is really the way to go,” said FDA committee member and pediatric infectious disease specialist Hayley Gans of Stanford University School of Medicine. The COVID-19 vaccine is “a breakthrough that has allowed us to move through the pandemic … [with] less suffering and disease.”</p>



<p>The benefits of vaccination also extend to young children with a prior COVID-19 infection, Oliver said during the CDC’s advisory committee meeting. An estimated 71 percent of 6 month to 4-year-olds in the United States have evidence of a past bout of COVID-19 as of this spring. But the protection from infection-induced antibodies is not as robust as that from antibodies produced after COVID-19 vaccination, research has found. In children and adolescents, those <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30649-1">vaccinated twice had higher levels of virus-blocking antibodies</a> against different coronavirus variants, including omicron, than did those who only had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers reported in May in <em>Nature Communications</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccination against COVID-19 even in those previously infected is still important to help protect against future infections and prevent severe disease, Oliver said.</p>



<p>At both advisory committee meetings, members reviewed immunity and safety data for&nbsp; Moderna’s and Pfizer’s shots for the youngest children. The two vaccines have different dosing and timelines. Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for kids 6 months through 5 years is a two-dose series, 25 micrograms per dose, given four weeks apart. (Adults get two 100 microgram doses for their initial two-dose series of shots.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfizer’s option, for kids 6 months through 4 years, is a three-dose series with 3 micrograms per dose. The first two shots are given three weeks apart, followed by a third dose at least eight weeks later. (The initial two-shot series for adults consists of 30-microgram doses.) Younger<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-children-kids-teens-ready-summer"> kids tend to get smaller doses</a> of vaccines because of the need to balance their robust response to the shots with keeping expected side effects, like fever, manageable (<em>SN: 2/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>Determining how well a vaccine is expected to work in children is tested differently than in adults. The adult COVID-19 vaccine trials included tens of thousands of people per trial, enough to<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean"> determine the efficacy of the vaccines</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). That’s a measure of how well the shots protect those in the vaccinated group compared with those given a placebo, based on how many cases occur in each group. For kids, it would have taken even larger trials to have enough COVID-19 cases (since overall totals among kids have been lower than for adults) for a close read on efficacy.</p>



<p>So as a proxy for efficacy, the trials compared the antibody response kids generate to the shots with what was measured for the youngest adults in the efficacy trials. For Moderna, the comparison group is 18- to 25-year-olds, while for Pfizer, the response is matched against those 16 to 25 years old (Pfizer included older teens in their adult trial).</p>



<p>Among more than 6,600 participants, Moderna reported that the little kids’ antibody response to its two-dose series met that seen among the young adult comparison group. Pfizer reported the same for the more than 4,500 participants in its young kids’ trial: the three-dose series produced antibody levels that reached that seen among the 16- to 25-year-old comparison group, which had gotten two shots.</p>



<p>The advisory committee also reviewed the safety of the vaccines for little kids. There were no alarming allergic reactions to the shots, no deaths and no cases of heart inflammation,<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis"> a very rare side effect</a> of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (<em>SN: 6/23/21</em>) that poses a<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7114e1.htm?s_cid=mm7114e1_w"> much higher risk during COVID-19 illness</a>. Common side effects for both vaccines included sore arms, crying, irritability, sleepiness and fever. It’s fine to give pain relievers after vaccination for children with fever or soreness, Oliver said at the CDC’s advisory committee meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the vaccines get the go-ahead,<a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-april-2022/"> close to 20 percent of parents of the very young plan to be in line right away</a>, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor. The survey from mid-April reported that another 38 percent plan to wait and see how things go with the vaccine rollout before deciding, while 11 percent say they will get their youngest immunized only if the shots are required. That leaves 27 percent in the “definitely not” category, which is similar to the percentage of parents who say they won’t vaccinate kids 5 and up.</p>



<p>An issue that remains is whether the littlest kids will need boosters added to the initial series of shots, as adults and older kids have. For immunocompromised children, a third dose of Moderna would be included in the initial series of shots, based on data for older children and adults who are immunocompromised and were vaccinated with Moderna. There isn’t yet data on whether another dose should be added for the Pfizer series of three shots for young children who are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safety monitoring for COVID-19 vaccines will also continue, through different U.S. surveillance systems such as the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html"> Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System</a>. So far, around 600 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been given in the United States, and the safety demonstrated is reassuring, said FDA committee member Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “I think having a COVID vaccine available for this younger population is critically important, given that pediatric cases can be, [have] been and may be problematic in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kangaroo-island-dunnart-marsupial-extinction-feral-cats-wildfires">These tiny marsupials survived wildfires only to face extinction from feral cats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Few marsupials have gone from miraculous survival to the brink of extinction as quickly as the Kangaroo Island dunnart.</p>



<p>In 2019 and 2020, devastating fires burned nearly 10 million hectares of southeastern Australia. The flames threatened hundreds of species with extinction, but the Kangaroo Island dunnart (<em>Sminthopsis aitkeni</em>) — which already numbered less than 500 before the fires — seemed to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">one that defied expectations</a> in the aftermath (<em>SN: 3/9/21).</em></p>



<p>But now these rare creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11383-6">may be more at risk than ever</a>, researchers say June 16 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The danger, as domestic as it sounds, is getting eaten by a cat.</p>





<p>As of 2008, invasive <a href="https://abcbirds.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medina_et_al_2011-Global_review_of_invasive_cat_impacts_on_endangered_vertebrates.pdf">feral cats had contributed to at least 13 percent of extinctions worldwide</a>. That&#8217;s one reason the government has been euthanizing cats on Kangaroo Island for years. The scientists who conducted the dunnart study knew all this — but when they studied the remains of cats euthanized in 2020, they were still surprised by what they saw: Seven out of 86 cats had recently dined on dunnart.</p>



<p>“We were not expecting to find so many,” says Louis Lignereux, a field researcher at the University of Adelaide School of Animal and Veterinary Science. It’s particularly bad news, he says, if you think of what was in the cats as only a snapshot of what they ate in the last 36 hours. Taking that into account, those seven cats alone could have eaten enough to wipe out the Kangaroo Island dunnart within a few months, if they had survived — and there are hundreds of other cats on the island.</p>



<p>A small habitat makes the dunnarts especially vulnerable. It’s like putting all your eggs in one basket, Lignereux says. Since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-fires-incinerated-habitats-threatened-species-ecological-disaster">the fires</a>, the Kangaroo Island dunnart is thought to now live in an area about one-tenth of the size of Manhattan <em>(SN: 1/13/20)</em>.</p>



<p>“If something happened to this spot,” he says, “then [the dunnart] is gone forever.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-greeland-sea-ice-glacial-melange-climate-change">Some polar bears in Greenland survive on surprisingly little sea ice</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Pihoqahiak” means “ever-wandering one,” and is an Inuit name for the polar bear, a creature known to roam vast expanses of sea ice, sometimes plodding thousands of kilometers a year in search of seals.</p>



<p>But along the fjord-cut coastline of southeast Greenland, where the sea freezes over for just a few months of the year, some isolated polar bears are surviving as homebodies.</p>



<p>Unlike most polar bears, these bears don’t follow the sea ice during its annual recession or move onto land to hunt. Instead, the crafty ursids <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq5267">stalk seals on nearby glacial mélange</a> — a floating mishmash of icebergs, sea ice fragments and snow that persists year-round near the front of glaciers in the fjords, researchers report in the June 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“They’re residents in fjords that are sea ice–free for more than eight months of the year,” says Kristin Laidre, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “Normally, a polar bear wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive without sea ice for that long.”</p>



<p>For polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>), sea ice isn’t just frozen seawater; it’s the platform they usually use to hunt their preferred prey — seals. But as human-caused climate change raises Earth’s global temperature, <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/233/2021/tc-15-233-2021.html">that ice is disappearing</a>. The number of polar bears that live on sea ice in the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean and Canada’s Hudson Bay is already declining. Researchers estimate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0818-9">most other subpopulations of the bears will collapse by 2100</a> unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as “vulnerable.”</p>



<p>The fjords of southeast Greenland and similar, limited areas could become a last, temporary refuge for a small number of bears, though only curbing climate change can save the ice-dependent species, Laidre and her colleagues say. Glacial mélange isn’t widespread in the Arctic, and what exists could disappear if temperatures rise too much.</p>



<p>Laidre and her colleagues estimate that several hundred bears may dwell in the fjords of southeast Greenland, though further work is needed to obtain a more precise count.</p>



<p>The southeast Greenland group came to the researchers’ attention while they were studying polar bears along east Greenland’s coast to provide advice to the Indigenous peoples who hunt the bears for subsistence. An analysis of 83 receiver-tagged polar bears from 1993 to 2021 revealed that, for the most part, bears living south of about 64° N latitude don’t interact with bears to the north, and vice versa.</p>



<p>Southeast Greenland bears may be mostly isolated by Greenland’s ice sheet to the west and a rapid current to the east, which could sweep seafaring bears south and stifle northward movement, the researchers say.</p>



<p>In northeast Greenland, the median distance traveled by tagged bears was 40 kilometers every four days. But in the southeast region, the median distance traveled was just 10 kilometers every four days, with bears sometimes traveling between neighboring fjords and sometimes remaining in the same fjord all year.</p>



<p>“For a polar bear, that&#8217;s nothing,” says Steven Amstrup, a zoologist and chief scientist of the conservation organization Polar Bears International, based in Bozeman, Mont., who was not involved in the study. “Apparently they&#8217;re finding enough resources there that they don&#8217;t have to make these huge, big movements.”</p>



<p>Southeast Greenland bears hunted on sea ice when it was present during a few months in winter and spring, the researchers found. For the rest of the year, the ursids used the glacial mélange that packed the fjords as hunting grounds. <a></a></p>



<p>“They use it just like sea ice,” Laidre says. “They&#8217;re able to walk [and hunt] on the mélange … and they can swim around between the pieces of ice and ambush seals.”</p>

<p>It’s not entirely surprising that polar bears have settled at the fronts — or toes — of glaciers in the fjords, Amstrup says. “Oftentimes, the toes of these glaciers are very productive areas,” he says, because glacial meltwater can flush nutrients from deeper in the ocean up toward the water’s surface. “You might expect that they would have seal populations [that] could support bears.”</p>



<p>The researchers also analyzed rare genetic variations in the southeast Greenland bears. That work revealed that the sampled animals shared a common ancestor about 200 years ago and have essentially kept to themselves since. “They’re the most genetically isolated polar bears in the world,” Laidre says. Conserving the distinctive bears will be important for protecting the species’ genetic diversity, which is already low, she says.</p>



<p>But for all their peculiarity, even southeast Greenland polar bears will perish without <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-action-could-save-polar-bears">human climate action</a>, Laidre and Amstrup agree (<em>SN: 12/15/10</em>). “Loss of Arctic sea ice is still the primary threat to all polar bears,” Laidre says. “This study does not change that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-sun-carbon-nitrogen-metals-elements">Neutrinos hint the sun has more carbon and nitrogen than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>After two decades of debate, scientists are getting closer to figuring out exactly what the sun — and thus the whole universe — is made of.</p>



<p>The sun is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. There are also heavier elements such as oxygen and carbon, but just how much is controversial. New observations of ghostly subatomic particles known as neutrinos suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15975">the sun has an ample supply of “metals,”</a> the term astronomers use for all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, researchers report May 31 at arXiv.org.</p>





<p>The results “are fully compatible with [a] high metallicity” for the sun, says Livia Ludhova, a physicist at Research Center Jülich in Germany.</p>



<p>Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are crucial for creating rock-iron planets like Earth and sustaining life-forms like humans. By far the most abundant of these elements in the universe is oxygen, followed by carbon, neon and nitrogen.</p>



<p>But astronomers don’t know exactly how much of these elements exist relative to hydrogen, the most common element in the cosmos. That’s because astronomers typically use the sun as a reference point to gauge elemental abundances in other stars and galaxies, and two techniques imply very different chemical compositions for our star.</p>



<p>One technique exploits vibrations inside the sun to deduce its internal structure and favors a high metal content. The second technique determines the sun’s composition from how atoms on its surface absorb certain wavelengths of light. Two decades ago, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2009ARA&amp;A..47..481A/doi:10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145222">a use of this second technique</a> suggested that oxygen, carbon, neon and nitrogen levels in the sun were 26 to 42 percent lower than <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1989GeCoA..53..197A/doi:10.1016/0016-7037(89)90286-X">an earlier determination found</a>, creating the current conflict.</p>



<p>Another technique has now emerged that could decide the long-standing debate: using solar neutrinos.</p>



<p>These particles arise from nuclear reactions in the sun’s core that turn hydrogen into helium. About 1 percent of the sun’s energy comes from reactions involving carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which convert hydrogen into helium but do not get used up in the process. So the more carbon, nitrogen and oxygen the sun actually has, the more neutrinos this CNO cycle should emit.</p>



<p>In 2020, scientists announced that Borexino, an underground detector in Italy, had spotted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-sun-core-nuclear-fusion-reactions-borexino">these CNO neutrinos</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/20</em>). Now Ludhova and her colleagues have recorded enough neutrinos to calculate that carbon and nitrogen atoms together are about 0.06 percent as abundant as hydrogen atoms in the sun — the first use of neutrinos to determine the sun’s makeup.</p>



<p>And though that number sounds small, it’s even higher than the one favored by astronomers who support a high-metal sun. And it’s 70 percent greater than the number a low-metal sun should have.</p>



<p>“This is a great result,” says Marc Pinsonneault, an astronomer at Ohio State University in Columbus who has long advocated for a high-metal sun. “They’ve been able to demonstrate robustly that the current low-metallicity solution is inconsistent with the data.”</p>



<p>Still, because of uncertainties in both the observed and predicted neutrino numbers, Borexino can’t fully rule out a low-metal sun, Ludhova says.</p>



<p>The new work is “a significant improvement,” says Gaël Buldgen, an astrophysicist at Geneva University in Switzerland who favors a low-metal sun. But the predicted numbers of CNO neutrinos come from models of the sun that he criticizes as too simplified. Those models neglect the sun’s spin, which could induce mixing of chemical elements over its life and change the amount of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen near the sun’s center, thereby changing the predicted number of CNO neutrinos, Buldgen says.</p>



<p>Additional neutrino observations are needed for a final verdict, Ludhova says. Borexino shut down in 2021, but future experiments could fill the void.</p>



<p>The stakes are high. “We’re arguing about what the universe is made of,” Pinsonneault says, because “the sun is the benchmark for all of our studies.”</p>



<p>So if the sun has much more carbon, nitrogen and oxygen than currently thought, so does the whole universe. “That changes our understanding about how the chemical elements are made. It changes our understanding of how stars evolve and how they live and die,” Pinsonneault says. And, he adds, it&#8217;s a reminder that even the best-studied star — our sun — still has secrets.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a his paper &quot;Effect of Extracellular Volume on the Energy Stored in Transmembrane Concentration Gradients&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The amount of energy that can be retrieved from a concentration gradient across
a membrane separating two compartments depends on the relative size of the
compartments. Having a larger low-concentration compartment is in general
beneficial. It is shown here analytically that the retrieved energy further
increases when the high- concentration compartment shrinks during the mixing
process, and a general formula is derived for the energy when the ratio of
transported solvent to solute varies. These calculations are then applied to
the interstitial compartment of the brain, which is rich in Na+ and Cl- ions
and poor in K+. The reported shrinkage of this compartment, and swelling of the
neurons, during oxygen deprivation is shown to enhance the energy recovered
from NaCl entering the neurons. The slight loss of energy on the part of K+ can
be compensated for by the uptake of K+ ions by glial cells. In conclusion, the
present study proposes that the reported fluctuations in the size of the
interstitial compartment of the brain (expansion during sleep and contraction
during oxygen deprivation) optimize the amount of energy that neurons can store
in, and retrieve from, their ionic concentration gradients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">Here’s why pumpkin toadlets are such clumsy jumpers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some frogs just can’t stick the landing.</p>



<p>After launching into a leap, pumpkin toadlets careen through the air as if flung from a toddler’s fist. They roll, cartwheel or backflip and then plummet to the ground, often belly flopping or crash-landing on their backs.</p>



<p>“I’ve looked at a lot of frogs and these are the weirdest things I’ve ever seen,” says Richard Essner, Jr., a vertebrate zoologist at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.</p>



<p>Essner and colleagues now propose an explanation for <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn1104">why the tiny frogs are such clumsy jumpers</a>. The animals lack the proper gyroscopic equipment to sense small changes in rotation, the team suggests June 15 in&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption><em>Brachycephalus pernix</em>&nbsp;frogs have trouble sensing small changes in rotation, which makes landing jumps difficult, a new study suggests. The frogs can roll, cartwheel or backflip through the air, and then hit the ground on their backs or bellies.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When&nbsp;Essner saw videos of&nbsp;<em>Brachycephalus</em>&nbsp;frogs’ awkward aerial maneuvers, he was so shocked that he hopped on a plane to study the animals with his colleagues in Brazil. Small enough to fit on a person’s thumbnail, the frogs are tricky to find in the wild. Scientists listen for the amphibians’ high-pitched, buzzy calls and then scoop leaf litter into a bag, hoping to find a few toadlets.</p>





<p>In the lab, the team used high-speed video to record more than 100 tiny frog jumps. The klutzy tumbles suggested that the toadlets have trouble orienting themselves in space.</p>



<p>Typically, fluid sloshing through bony tubes in the inner ear help vertebrates sense their body’s position. CT scans revealed that the frogs’ tubes are the smallest ever recorded for adult vertebrates. Studies of other tiny animals suggest that the tubes don’t work so well in miniature. It’s difficult for the fluid to flow freely, Essner says. That means the frogs probably can’t sense how they’re twirling through the air, making it tough to prep for landing.</p>



<p>It’s possible that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-glowing-bony-plates">bony back plates</a> offer some species crash protection, but the animals may stay grounded for safety (<em>SN: 4/3/19</em>). As Essner observed, the frogs are “almost always crawling really slowly.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plague-black-death-ancient-dna-bacteria-europe-origin-asia">Ancient bacterial DNA hints Europe’s Black Death started in Central Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although best known as a plague that killed millions of Europeans from 1346 to 1353, the Black Death originated about a decade earlier in Central Asia, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A strain of the plague-causing <em>Yersinia pestis</em> bacterium that killed people in what’s now Kyrgyzstan in 1338 and 1339 was a common ancestor of four <em>Y. pestis</em> strains previously linked to the deadly European outbreak, say archaeogeneticist Maria Spyrou of Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen in Germany and colleagues.</p>





<p>Spyrou’s group identified <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA in teeth of three individuals from an ancient Central Asian cemetery where tombstone inscriptions say that they, as well as many others buried there, died in 1338 and 1339 from an unspecified “pestilence.” Comparisons of that genetic material to modern and historic samples of <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA indicate that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04800-3">Central Asian folks perished from an initial version of the plague bacterium that would wreak havoc on Europe</a>, the Middle East and northern Africa until the early 1800s, the scientists report June 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“The source location and time when this plague emerged was most likely in Central Asia in the first half of the 14th century,” Spyrou said in a June 14 news briefing.</p>



<p>Origins of the Black Death, or bubonic plague, have long been debated. What’s certain is that <em>Y. pestis</em> gets transmitted to humans by fleas that live on rodents. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/125/5/1601/6040962">One current proposal holds that the plague bacterium originated in East Asia</a> and was carried across the continent starting in the 1200s as the Mongol Empire expanded. That scenario leaned on genetic evidence from European Black Death victims and written accounts of an unidentified plague outbreak encountered by Mongol invaders of Baghdad in the 1200s.</p>



<p>But the first archaeological and genetic clues to the Black Death’s place and time of birth come from Central Asia, Spyrou says. Excavations at two cemeteries in northern Kyrgyzstan almost 140 years ago revealed tombstones indicating that many people buried there in 1338 and 1339 had died of an unknown epidemic. The cemeteries were used from the mid-1200s to the mid-1300s, but tombstone inscriptions indicated that deaths spiked in 1338 and 1339. Of 467 dated tombstones, 118 mark deaths in those two years.</p>

Leybin, August 1886</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Spyrou’s group was able to reconstruct the entire <em>Y. pestis</em> genome for two of three Central Asian individuals who died in 1338 or 1339 and whose teeth contained remnants of bacterial DNA. Comparisons with the genetic instructions of 203 modern <em>Y. pestis</em> samples and 47 <em>Y. pestis</em> samples dating from the 14th to 19th centuries pegged the Central Asian genomes as a single strain that was a direct ancestor of Black Death strains.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that marmots and other rodents now living in the same region of Central Asia carry forms of <em>Y. pestis</em> closely related to the ancient variant. The <em>Y. pestis</em> variant that killed Central Asians in 1338 and 1339 may thus have emerged locally, the investigators suggest.</p>



<p>Reasons for the rise of a particularly deadly form of <em>Y. pestis</em> in Central Asia during the early 1300s remain unclear. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-plague-bacteria-strain-human-victim-bones">earliest known <em>Y. pestis</em> strain</a>, which dates to around 7,100 years ago in Eastern Europe, lacked a plague-inducing gene that enables rapid transmission from fleas to humans (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Spyrou’s group convincingly traces the origin of <em>Y. pestis</em> strains involved in Europe’s Black Death to Central Asia, says evolutionary biologist Nils Stenseth of the University of Oslo, who did not participate in the study. He regards the new findings as consistent with a scenario in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubonic-plague-was-serial-visitor-european-middle-ages">periods of warm weather in Central Asia triggered repeated plague outbreaks</a> in Europe starting in the 1300s (<em>SN: 2/23/15</em>). Troops, travelers and merchants moving along <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2101940118">trade routes from Asia kept bringing the plague into Europe</a>, Stenseth suspects.</p>



<p>While the newly identified <em>Y. pestis</em> strain appears to be an ancestor of later European strains, clear-cut origins of the Black Death — and other pandemics, including COVID-19 — are notoriously hard to pin down, says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.</p>



<p>For instance, it will be challenging to determine whether the ancient <em>Y. pestis</em> strain from Central Asia existed even earlier across a broad swath of the continent, he says. If so, then a precursor strain of the Black Death may have arisen prior to 1338 in an as-yet-undetermined part of Asia. Temptations to translate ancient DNA findings into a story of the Black Death’s precise place and time of origin “need to be tempered,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butterfly-wing-tail-loss-break-birds-escape">Butterflies may lose their ‘tails’ like lizards</a></h4>

              
                <p>On some butterfly wings, “tails” may be more than just elegant adornments. They’re survival tools too, a study suggests.</p>



<p>The tails seem to attract the attention of attacking birds, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.0562">keeping them away from a butterfly’s more vital body parts</a>, researchers report May 25 in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. The finding could help explain why wing tails have independently evolved multiple times across different moth and butterfly groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Ariane Chotard of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris studies the wings of swallowtail butterflies, which make up the hundreds of species in the family Papilionidae.&nbsp;“A lot of these butterflies display tails,” Chotard says. “And we don&#8217;t really know why.”</p>





<p>Some butterfly species with false head or eyespot patterns on their wings are known to receive more attacks from predators in those regions. And Chotard and her colleagues wondered if tails were also a target.</p>



<p>So in the summer of 2020, the researchers collected 138 sail swallowtail butterflies (<a><em>Iphiclides podalirius</em></a>) from the wild in Ariege, France. Sail swallowtails — found throughout Eurasia — sport two, conspicuous black tails on hind wings with some blue and orange spotting, contrasting greatly with the rest of the insects’ yellow, striped coloration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the collected swallowtails, 65, or 41 percent, had damaged wings, all of which had at least one tail damaged. When all 130 wings in this group of damaged butterflies were counted, more than 82 percent of the wings had damaged tails, suggesting that predators may be targeting the spindly parts.</p>



<p>To test that idea, the team kept wild-caught songbirds called great tits (<em>Parus major</em>) in cages. The researchers then showed the birds dummy butterflies made from gluing real swallowtail wings to a fake body made of small pieces of black cardboard, and filmed the birds’ attacks on the faux insects.</p>



<p>Forty-three out of 59 beak strikes, or nearly 73 percent, were on the hind wings. Twenty-three, or 39 percent, of the strikes touched both a tail and colored areas on the upper part of a hind wing simultaneously, more than any other body area on the dummies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Butterfly &#039;tails&#039; may help the insects escape hungry birds | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sshOdQv5ypI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>A captive great tit (<em>Parus major</em>) attacks the hind wings and “tails” of a dummy made with real wings from a sail swallowtail butterfly (<em>Iphiclides podalirius</em>). A new study suggests that the tails deflect attacks away from key body parts to brittle extensions that easily tear off, allowing the insect to flee.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chotard and her colleagues also measured how much force was needed to tear various sections of the swallowtail wing. They found that the vein of the hind wing tail was the most fragile part of the wing and is probably the location most apt to break off in a hungry bird’s beak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together, the findings suggest that swallowtail tails deflect attacks away from the butterfly’s vulnerable body to brittle extensions that easily tear off, allowing the insect to escape, the researchers say. This may be similar to the strategy some lizards use when sacrificing their detachable tails to hungry predators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear if there are any costs to losing one or two tails, Chotard says. “You survived, you escaped from a predator, but maybe there&#8217;s a trade-off and maybe your flight will be [slower].”</p>



<p>Some moth tails can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fooled-you-whirling-tails-luna-moths-deflect-bat-attacks">deflect the attacks of echolocating bats</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 2/16/15</em>). “Now we have evidence that butterfly tails provide a similar benefit against visual predators,” says evolutionary biologist Juliette Rubin of the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Future work determining the survival benefits of the tails could be one next step, Rubin says. “It would be informative to see how live swallowtail butterflies — both with and without tails — fare against bird predators.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541674899">Bitch</a><br><em>Lucy Cooke</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>To Charles Darwin, nature had a certain order. And in that order, males always came out on top. They were the leaders, the innovators, the wooers and the doers.</p>



<p>“The males of almost all animals have stronger passions than the females,” Darwin wrote in 1871. “The female, on the other hand, with the rarest of exceptions, is less eager.” The founder of evolutionary theory posited that throughout the animal kingdom, males are active, females are passive, and that’s pretty much that. Females, in sum, are boring.</p>





<p>That’s poppycock, Lucy Cooke writes in her latest book, <em>Bitch</em>. This blinkered view of nature as a man’s world was conceived and promulgated by Victorian men who imposed their values and world view on animals, she says. Cooke, a documentary filmmaker and the author of <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/truth-about-animals-isnt-always-pretty">The Truth About Animals</a></em> and two children’s books (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 26</em>), has traveled the world and met scientists who are exposing the truth about the sexes. She takes readers on a wild ride as she observes the ridiculous mating rituals of sage grouse, searches for orca poop (to monitor sex hormones) and watches female lemurs boss around males.</p>



<p>Through such adventures, Cooke learns that females are anything but boring. “Female animals are just as promiscuous, competitive, aggressive, dominant and dynamic as males,” she writes.</p>



<p>That may not sound radical to today’s feminists, but in the field of evolutionary biology, such a pronouncement has long bordered on the heretical. Generations of biologists have focused on male behavior and physiology, on the assumption that females are little more than baby-making machines to be won over by the strongest, showiest males.</p>





<p>Historically, when females did something potentially interesting, like exercise leadership over their social groups, many scientists scratched their heads and chalked it up as an aberration. When behavior didn’t fit the mold, like female-dominant spotted hyenas or peaceable male pinyon jays, it was either ignored or shoehorned into existing theory. For instance, ornithologists posited that aggressive female pinyon jays must suffer “the avian equivalent of PMS,” Cooke writes. The reality is that pinyon jays have a complex social hierarchy that doesn’t include the “alpha male” that scientists had expected. In recent years, scientists (many, but not all of them, female themselves) have begun to challenge Darwinian dogma about the sexes and submit it to rigorous testing.</p>



<p>Cooke draws on this recent science to systematically take down myths about females. She begins by asking what biological sex actually is — what makes a male a male, and a female a female — and shows that it’s far less black-and-white than we’ve been led to believe. Take the case of the European mole, in which the female sports gonads called ovotestes that produce eggs during the short breeding season, and testosterone the rest of the time. As a result, the female’s genitalia look just like the male’s, with a penislike clitoris and a vagina that vanishes after the breeding season.</p>



<p>The mole is just one example of sexual ambiguity among many that Cooke outlines. As the science of recent decades has revealed, even the genetics of sex is far more complicated than having either XX or XY chromosomes (which themselves are just one of many genetic systems for determining sex across the animal kingdom). In humans, males and females have the same set of about 60 sex-determining genes, which can create either testes or ovaries. Because of shared biology, the sexes are far more alike than they are different, and they exist in more of a continuum of bodies and behaviors than many people may be comfortable with.</p>



<p>Cooke also takes on many other ways scientists have misread sexual dynamics over the years, such as the myth that males benefit evolutionarily from promiscuity and females from monogamy. She addresses misconceptions about sexual cannibalism and animal genitals, complete with silicone replicas of animal vaginas. And she challenges ideas about the maternal instinct. As Cooke points out, males and females share the same neural circuitry, leading to fascinating experiments that stimulate certain nerve cells to flip male mice from infanticidal to doting dads.</p>



<p>In short, Cooke demolishes much of what you probably learned about the sexes in biology class. This may be disconcerting, even confronting for those who feel comfortable in the warm embrace of Darwinian order. But it’s also exciting, and fascinating, and very well might change the way you see the world. </p>

                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">Three years ago</a> PLOS implemented our version of open peer review, which we named with our typical scrupulous precision and total disregard for word count: <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/">Published Peer Review History</a>. Since then, the PLOS journals have together published over 18,000 articles with accompanying peer review history. We&rsquo;re pleased to share more preliminary observations based on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#numbers">our first three years of data below</a>. But first, a bit of background&hellip;</p>



<h2>How published peer review works at PLOS</h2>



<p>Open peer review can mean many different things. The main unifying feature is an element of openness somewhere in the peer review process, which can range from public comments on all submissions, to an open decision letter after acceptance. PLOS&rsquo; version of open peer review is simple, flexible and modular, dictated by the choices reviewers and authors make during the peer review and publication process.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals default to anonymous peer review. Reviewers have the option to sign their peer reviews if they wish to do so, and are advised of the potential for the review to be published. After an article has been accepted for publication, authors can opt-in to publish the Peer Review History, which includes the key documents from the peer review assessment:</p>



<ul><li>Editor decision letters</li><li>Peer reviews (with reviewers&rsquo; signatures, if applicable)</li><li>Authors&rsquo; responses to reviews</li></ul>



<p>The result is four possible gradations of openness in peer review.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="862" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1024x862.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20442" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-300x253.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-768x647.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1536x1293.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-2048x1725.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It is very important, we think, to note that the benefits of Published Peer Review History are by no means predicated on reviewers signing their reviews. While reviewers have the opportunity to claim credit if they so choose, the value to the wider scholarly community stems from the availability of their comments. We want to make this absolutely clear because, too often, critique of open peer review can focus on signing, missing the more vital aspect of constructive feedback.</p>



<p>PLOS Peer Review History is organized, time stamped, and machine readable, with the goal of enabling future meta-research. Each element of the history package has a sub-DOI and is tagged and indexed, making it easy to discover and cite, even if you&rsquo;re not reading it on one of the PLOS journal websites. It&rsquo;s also included in <a href="https://plos.org/text-and-data-mining/">AllofPLOS</a> for easier mining and analysis.</p>

<h2>What makes PLOS Published Peer Review History different?</h2>



<p>You might be thinking <em>&lsquo;so what?&rsquo; </em>When PLOS introduced Peer Review History in 2019, various versions of public review had been available in the scholarly marketplace for a decade or more&mdash;at BMJ, EMBO Press, and <em>eLife</em>, just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All implementations of open review&mdash;signed and unsigned, posted as public commentary or published after the fact&mdash;serve to improve transparency and accountability, to demonstrate the quality of peer review and reinforce the validity of the published research, to acknowledge and honor peer reviewers&rsquo; contributions to the literature, and to enrich the scientific record with more expertise.</p>



<p>Our own particular version emphasizes flexibility and author control. After acceptance, PLOS authors must click a check box and <strong>opt-in</strong> to have their peer reviews published. As a large international publisher with a very broad scope, our goal with Published Peer Review History, as with Open Science in general, has been to bring openness within easy reach for all, while at the same time respecting researchers&rsquo; different values and requirements across disciplines, career stages, and regions. Opt-in works at scale for all the researchers across our portfolio.</p>



<p>The opt-in model is somewhat unusual, as compared to the more established pioneers in Open Peer Review, many of whom mandate openness (e.g. BMJ) or use an opt-out model (e.g. EMBO Press). PLOS&rsquo; opt-in approach results in lower uptake: on average, 40% of PLOS authors opt-in, as compared to the reported greater than 95% of EMBO Press authors who <a href="https://www.embo.org/features/a-decade-of-transparent-peer-review/">don&rsquo;t opt-out</a>. At the same time, PLOS&rsquo; large publication volume means that, even with a lower rate of uptake, the journals contribute significantly to the total number of articles with public peer reviews available across the published literature. (PLOS journals together published nearly 18,000 articles in 2020. For comparison, the same year <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/6771f3db/annual-report-2020-in-review"><em>eLife </em>published</a> 1,870 articles, <em>BMJ Open</em> published 3,610<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#asterisk">*</a>, and the five EMBO Press journals published 1,063*.) This absolute scale is helpful with normalizing practices and behaviors.</p>



<p>The opt-in model, in combination with our size and breadth of scope also produces a wealth of data, which we hope can help us to better understand the communities we serve, and inform our future direction with regard to published review.</p>



<h2 id="numbers">Published Peer Review History by the numbers, May 2019 to May 2022</h2>



<p>Since PLOS Published Peer Review History was first introduced, opt-in has remained a remarkably consistent 40%, year after year.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#asterisk">**</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year of acceptance</strong></td><td><strong>Opt-ins</strong></td><td><strong>Total eligible articles&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Percent opt-in</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>1,300</td><td>3,383</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>7,107</td><td>17,775</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>7,585</td><td>18,923</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>2,387</td><td>5,983</td><td>40%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; two highly selective journals, <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, also saw the highest rates of Published Peer Review opt-in&nbsp; among accepted authors, followed by two of the four community journals, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, and <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.<em> PLOS ONE</em> and the remaining two community journals,<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> and <em>PLOS NTDs</em> saw the lowest opt-in rates. <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s broad scope and high publication volume accounts for its lower average opt-in rate. Lower adoption among <em>Pathogens </em>and <em>NTDs </em>authors as compared with the other community journals may likewise relate to subject-specific norms and preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal</strong></td><td><strong>Opt-ins</strong></td><td><strong>Total eligible articles</strong></td><td><strong>Percent opt-in</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td>294</td><td>463</td><td>63%</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>425</td><td>688</td><td>62%</td></tr><tr><td>Computational&nbsp; Biology</td><td>1,038</td><td>1,883</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>Genetics</td><td>561</td><td>1,129</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>532</td><td>1,369</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td>ONE</td><td>14,911</td><td>38,918</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>NTDs</td><td>618</td><td>1,614</td><td>38%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>When <em>PLOS ONE </em>opt-in rates are broken out by discipline a pattern of subject-area preference becomes apparent. In fields with more than 100 published articles in the time period, opt-ins were strongest in computational biology, public health fields (women&rsquo;s health, public health, mental health), research on caregiving (healthcare, nursing), and specific medical disciplines (emergency medicine, neurology, obstetrics, urology, anesthesiology, pulmonology, clinical trials, etc.). Lower opt-in rates were observed in engineering, math, chemistry, materials science, earth science, geography and various branches of biology (molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, biotechnology), as well as in fields where medical and bench science intersect, such as basic cancer research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While clinical in their potential translational applications, <em>PLOS NTDs </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> frequently publish research on the molecular and cellular aspects of disease, and therefore might expect commensurately lower opt-in rates.</p>



<p>However, <em>PLOS Biology</em> also publishes in the biological fields where <em>PLOS ONE</em> opt-in tends to be weaker&mdash;yet it has the highest opt-in rate of any journal. Why is that? Perhaps, the journal&rsquo;s hands-on, personalized editorial and peer review process influences author opt-in. This would be a fascinating area for investigation.</p>



<h2>Observations on peer review signing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>PLOS has always allowed reviewers to sign their reviews if they choose, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the system updates introduced at the same time as Published Peer Review History (May 22, 2019) that we gained the ability to easily and systematically measure signing. Since then, we&rsquo;ve received 49,555 signed reviews (17.81% of all completed reviews). Those signed reviews were performed by 40,276 individuals (about 19.26% of active reviewers) and were linked to 32,869 manuscripts (35.55% of manuscripts considered).</p>



<p>Overall, reviewers&rsquo; decisions to sign reviews are distributed across journals and subject areas in a pattern similar to authors&rsquo; decisions to publish reviews. Signing rates were higher in public health, medicine, and related disciplines and less common in some branches of biology, as well as the physical sciences, earth sciences, engineering and math. Of articles with published peer reviews, 44% also had at least one signed review.</p>



<p>The clearest determinant of signed review was the reviewer&rsquo;s recommendation (although reviewer recommendations are visible only to Academic Editors and the journal office). Signing rates were highest among reviewers recommending accept or revise decisions. For that reason, rates of signing on published articles (42.19%) are higher than for manuscripts generally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal Name</strong></td><td><strong>Accept</strong></td><td><strong>Minor</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Revision</strong></td><td><strong>Major Revision</strong></td><td><strong>Reject</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td>19.74%</td><td>17.32%</td><td>11.59%</td><td>3.62%</td></tr><tr><td>Computational Biology</td><td>16.49%</td><td>16.15%</td><td>12.30%</td><td>4.59%</td></tr><tr><td>Genetics</td><td>12.15%</td><td>11.23%</td><td>7.60%</td><td>3.19%</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>35.03%</td><td>35.23%</td><td>31.99%</td><td>25.50%</td></tr><tr><td>NTDs</td><td>18.29%</td><td>19.20%</td><td>13.01%</td><td>5.30%</td></tr><tr><td>ONE</td><td>17.42%</td><td>17.48%</td><td>14.38%</td><td>7.85%</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>8.40%</td><td>7.89%</td><td>5.56%</td><td>1.71%&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Listening to authors and reviewers</h2>



<p>At PLOS we have formal and informal conversations with our stakeholders and community members; we gather feedback in person and by email; we conduct surveys and structured interviews; we do meta-research; we observe.</p>



<p>Three years ago, PLOS chose an opt-in over an opt-out model of published review for a number of reasons. Our in-house editorial teams and editorial boards alike were committed to open peer review, and committed to ensuring it was only received positively by giving authors a real choice in the decision. More practically, PLOS serves more than 200 communities of research, each with their own needs and priorities. Open peer review is too important a development to force on those who have concerns and need to see a community embrace it first. Therefore, we chose to make openness easy. By leaving the door open, hopefully we can learn more from those who choose to walk through. And, it&rsquo;s our hope that information like this can help inform the next round of discussions, innovations, and policies, leading ultimately to a more efficient, equitable, and trustworthy peer review system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-rogue-wandering-mass-sun-gravity-neutron-star">A celestial loner might be the first known rogue black hole</a></h4>

              
                <p>A solitary celestial object — more massive than the sun, yet far smaller — is wandering the galaxy a few thousand light-years from Earth. It might be the first isolated stellar-mass black hole to be detected in the Milky Way. Or it might be one of the heaviest neutron stars known.</p>



<p>The interstellar wanderer first revealed itself in 2011, when its gravity briefly magnified the light from a more distant star. But at the time, its true nature eluded researchers. Now, two teams of astronomers have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images to unmask the traveler’s identity — and have come to somewhat different conclusions.</p>





<p>The mysterious rogue is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13296">a black hole roughly seven times as massive as the sun</a>, one team reports in a study in press in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01903">Or it’s a bit lighter</a> — a mere two to four times the weight of our nearest star — and therefore either an unusually lightweight black hole or a curiously hefty neutron star, another group reports in a study in press in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes form when massive stars — at least several times the heft of the sun — collapse under their own gravity at the end of their lives. Astronomers believe that about a billion neutron stars and roughly 100 million stellar-mass black holes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/we-share-milky-way-100-million-black-holes">lurk in our galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/17</em>). But these objects aren’t easy to spot. Neutron stars are so tiny — about the size of a city — that they don’t produce much light. And black holes emit no light at all.</p>



<p>To detect these kinds of objects, scientists typically observe how they affect their surroundings. “The only way that we can find them is if they influence something else,” says Kailash Sahu, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</p>



<p>To date, scientists have detected nearly two dozen stellar-mass black holes. (These relatively lightweight black holes are puny compared to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">supermassive behemoths that sit at the center of most galaxies</a>, including our own (<em>SN: 1/18/21</em>).) To do so, researchers have watched how these objects interact with their nearby celestial neighbors. When a black hole is locked in a gravitational dance with another star, it rips away matter from its partner. As that material falls onto the black hole, it emits X-rays, which telescopes orbiting the Earth can detect.</p>



<p>But finding black holes in binary systems doesn’t paint a whole picture of the black hole kingdom. Because these objects are continually accreting matter, it’s challenging to determine the mass at which they formed. And since birthweight is a key characteristic of a black hole, that’s a significant drawback to looking at binary systems, Sahu says. “If we want to understand the properties of black holes, it’s best to find isolated ones.”</p>



<p>For more than a decade, researchers have been scanning the heavens for solitary black holes. The searches have hinged on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of general relativity</a>, which states that any massive object, even an unseen one, bends space in its vicinity (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). That bending causes light from background stars to be magnified and distorted, a phenomenon known as gravitational microlensing. By measuring changes in the brightness and apparent position of stars, scientists can calculate the mass of the intervening object that’s acting like a lens — a technique that’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fewer-big-rogue-planets-roam-galaxy-recount-shows">rounded up a few extrasolar planets</a> as well (<em>SN: 7/24/17</em>).</p>



<p>In 2011, researchers announced that they had spotted a star <a href="http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/ews/2011/blg-0462.html">that suddenly had gotten more than 200 times brighter</a>. But those initial observations, made using telescopes in Chile and New Zealand, were unable to reveal whether the star’s apparent position was also changing. And that information is key to pinning down the mass of the intervening object. If it’s a heavyweight, its gravity would distort space so much that the star would appear to move. But even a “big” shift in the star’s position would have been extremely small and hard to detect. And unfortunately fine details in astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-ice-dome-world-clearest-views-night-sky-milky-way">tend to be blurred out</a> because of our planet’s turbulent atmosphere (<em>SN: 7/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>To circumvent this Earthly limitation, two independent teams of astronomers turned to the Hubble Space Telescope. This observatory can capture extremely detailed images since it orbits above most of Earth’s atmosphere. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Both groups found that the star’s location shifted over the course of several years. One of the teams, led by Sahu, concluded that the star’s apparent dance was caused by an object roughly seven times as hefty as the sun. A star of that mass would have been blazingly bright in the Hubble images, but the researchers saw nothing. Something that heavy and dark must be a black hole, the team reports.</p>



<p>But another group of researchers, led by astronomer Casey Lam at the University of California, Berkeley, found different results. Lam and her colleagues calculated that the mass of the lensing object was lower, only about two to four times the mass of the sun. It could therefore be either a neutron star or a black hole, the group concluded.</p>



<p>Whatever it is, it’s an intriguing object, says astronomer Jessica Lu, a member of Lam’s team also at UC Berkeley. That’s because it’s a bit of an oddball in terms of mass. It’s either one of the most massive neutron stars discovered to date, or it’s one of the least massive black holes known, Lu says. “It falls within this strange region we call the mass gap.”</p>



<p>Despite the disagreement, these are thrilling results, says Will M. Farr, an astrophysicist at Stony Brook University in New York not involved in either study. “To be working at the instrumental limit at the real forefront of what’s measurable is very exciting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supersonic-sonic-booms-acoustics-cities">Why even small sonic booms are more annoying in cities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sonic booms can be particularly annoying in cities, where tall buildings and narrow streets boost noise levels and cause the noise to linger, new research shows.</p>



<p>Planes traveling faster than the speed of sound create a shock wave in the form of a short-lived boom. These intense sonic booms have harmed people’s hearing, shattered windows and caused other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/supersonic-transports-come-closer-reality">physical damage to homes and buildings</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/64</em>). NASA is developing aircraft with more subdued booms, but the sound won’t go away entirely. Even modest booms might be a problem in cities.</p>





<p>“The noise levels induced by these lower-level booms are still expected to be significant,” says study coauthor Didier Dragna of the École Centre de Lyon in France.</p>



<p>Dragna and colleagues simulated booms from supersonic planes passing over buildings. For a building standing out in the open, boom-induced noise lasted about a tenth of a second. Sound reflecting from the building boosts noise levels slightly for the side facing an approaching plane and reduces it on the side facing away.</p>



<p>For packed cityscapes, however, noise reflected from buildings following a sonic boom fills in the regions between buildings and <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/10.0010452?dm_i=3Q4Y%2C1G8HT%2C68V2ZI%2C5B8ET%2C1">resonates like the echoes of a hand clap in an empty hall</a>, the team reports in the June <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>. Their simulations showed that even after the initial boom has passed the noise persists for several seconds, creating what Dragna describes as a thunderous, window- and door-rattling rumble.<br><br>Civilian aircraft in the United States are generally prohibited from traveling over land at supersonic speeds. But NASA will begin test flights of its “quiet” <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/Quesst/">X-59 supersonic aircraft</a> over cities in 2024. “It is important to predict what will be the noise levels and the annoyance due to these supersonic planes,” Dragna says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/13/showing-off-your-status-and-wealth-makes-you-seem-less-co-operative/">Showing off your status and wealth makes you seem less co-operative</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>People who can afford luxury goods tend to buy them, and to show them off.  “This is unsurprising given the myriad social benefits associated with being perceived as well-off and high status,” note the authors of a<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53095-001"> new study</a>, led by Shalena Srna at the University of Michigan. But in some situations, there might be downsides to conspicuous consumption. After all, as the team writes: “it conveys a boastful self-interest, which is incompatible, in people’s minds, with pro-sociality”.</p>



<p>So what happens when — as is so often the case — it’s in our interests to work with others? Given the opportunity, do we show off, and signal high status — or do we choose to be more modest? The team’s findings, reported in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em>, contain some important insights.</p>



<span id="more-46394"></span>



<p>In an initial online study, the team adopted a version of the widely used <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/">Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD)</a> game. Participants were told that they’d have to decide whether to co-operate with a partner to do half each of 60 units of work (solving captchas) — or to defect. If both partners chose to defect, they’d have to complete 60 units of work each. If only one did, the co-operator would have to do 90 units, while the defector wouldn’t do any.</p>



<p>Before they made their decision, they were shown an avatar that was purportedly made by their partner. They were informed that their partner had chosen the hairstyle, skin tone and clothing — and also whether to include a luxury logo on the clothing, or to opt for unbranded clothing. In fact, the partners were fictional and the avatars were created by the team. They generated one male and one female avatar (the gender was matched to the participant’s gender), which were identical, except that some wore a shirt featuring a Gucci, Louis Vuitton or Burberry logo, while the other had an unbranded shirt.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants elected to co-operate with partners whose avatars had unbranded clothing 57% of the time, but when the avatar sported a luxury logo, this figure dropped to 45%. A subsequent questionnaire revealed that the participants indeed perceived partners with logo-wearing avatars as trying harder to signal status and wealth (and indeed to have more status and wealth) — and expected them to be less co-operative, and more self-interested.</p>



<p>A second study, in which participants could first choose the design of their own avatar, found that those who chose branded rather than unbranded clothing themselves were still less likely to choose to co-operate with partners with brand-boasting vs logo-free avatars.</p>



<p>The team then switched to a more real-world setting — social network profiles. They found further support for these initial results: participants who saw (fictional) profiles that used status-signalling posts and hashtags were less likely to recommend that individual for admittance into a group that prioritized co-operation, selflessness and generosity.</p>



<p>The work also produced another key result: when it was useful to appear co-operative  — when a group that participants wanted to join stressed its desire for co-operative, prosocial people — the participants tended to become strategically modest; when choosing from prewritten social media posts that described various activities, they were less likely to go for posts that signalled status. (It’s worth noting, however, that when the goal was to be perceived as <em>competitive</em>, status-signalling was beneficial.)</p>



<p>This last finding suggests that we’re aware that status-signalling can be counter-productive, and understand when to avoid it. However, we surely all know people who get this wrong. Many people show off their status to &#8220;friends&#8221; through posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the team notes. “Such posts may be beneficial for communicating one’s wealth and status, but as we have shown, they can also have negative effects.” In 2019, Stephen M. Garcia and colleagues even found that people <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550618783712">believe signalling status will make them more attractive potential friends — but when seeking friends, we in fact prefer people who are more modest</a>. So while we might have some implicit understanding of when not to signal status, it’s clearly not perfect.</p>



<p>Garcia’s research was in the US and the new work was on participants mostly from Western countries. Clearly, non-WEIRD work in this area is needed.  But this new paper certainly highlights a clear disadvantage of status signalling in Western contexts, and suggests that we should be more careful. There are all kinds of environments, including schools and workplaces, where this could clearly have implications for relationships. There’s an ongoing debate about the pros and cons of school uniforms, for example. In schools without uniforms, kids who choose to wear luxury brands might think that they’re benefitting from signalling high status — but if this makes the rest of the class view them as less co-operative and more self-interested, that’s a clear downside for everyone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">New Gaia data paint the most detailed picture yet of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>1.6 billion stars. 11.4 million galaxies. 158,000 asteroids.</p>



<p>One spacecraft.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s Gaia space observatory, which launched in 2013, has long surpassed its goal of charting more than a billion <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-missions-milky-way-map-pinpoints-locations-billion-plus-stars">stars in the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 10/15/16)</em>. On June 13, the mission extended that map into new dimensions, releasing more detailed measurements of hundreds of millions of stars, plus — for the first time — asteroids, galaxies and the dusty medium between stars.</p>





<p>“Suddenly you have a flood of data,” says Laurent Eyer, an astrophysicist at the University of Geneva who has worked on Gaia for years. For some topics in astronomy, the new results effectively replace all the observations that were taken before, Eyer says. “The data is better. It’s amazing.”</p>



<p>Data in the new survey, which were collected from 2014 to 2017, are already leading to some discoveries — including the presence of surprisingly massive&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">“starquakes”</a> on the surfaces of thousands of stars (<em>SN: 8/2/19</em>). But more than anything, the release is a new tool for astronomers, one that will aid their efforts to understand how stars, planets and entire galaxies form and evolve.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the long-standing puzzles the data could help solve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Asteroid mishmash</h4>



<p>The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is a mess of history. After the Earth and other planets formed, the rocky building blocks that were left over smashed into each other, leaving behind jumbled fragments. But if scientists know enough about individual asteroids, they can reconstruct when and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">where they came from</a> <em>(SN: 4/13/19)</em>. And that can provide a peek into the solar system’s earliest days.</p>

<p>Gaia’s massive new dataset may help solve this puzzle, says Federica Spoto, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. It includes data on the chemical makeup of over 60,000 asteroids — six times more than researchers had such details on before using other tools. That information can be essential for tracing asteroids back to their shattering origins.</p>



<p>“You can go back in time and try to understand all the formation and evolution of the solar system,” says Spoto, a Gaia collaborator.<strong> “</strong>That’s something huge that before Gaia we couldn’t even think about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asteroids aren’t just pieces of the past, though; they’re also dangerous. The new data could reveal asteroids that are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-asteroid-has-been-found-nearer-sun-than-venus">next to impossible to spot</a> from Earth because they orbit too close to the sun, says Thomas Burbine, a planetary scientist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., who is not involved with the mission <em>(SN: 2/15/20)</em>. Since these asteroids would have originally come from farther out (say, the asteroid belt), they can tell us about the rocks going past Earth that can potentially hit us. “We’ll know our neighborhood better,” Burbine says.</p>



<h4>Dating a star</h4>



<p>It is notoriously difficult to measure <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">the age of stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21)</em>. “It’s not uncommon to have uncertainty of more than a billion years,” says Alessandro Savino, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley who is not involved with Gaia. Unlike brightness or location, age is not directly visible. Astronomers have to rely on theories of how stars evolve to predict ages from what they can measure.</p>



<p>If past versions of the Gaia survey were like a photograph of stars, the new release is like shifting the photograph from black and white to color. It provides a deeper look at hundreds of millions of stars by measuring their temperature, gravity and chemistry. “You imagine the star as this point in space, but then they have so many properties,” Spoto says. “That’s what Gaia is giving you.”</p>



<p>Although these kinds of measurements are far from new, they have never been collected in the Milky Way on such a scale before. Those data could provide more insight into how stars evolve. “We can improve the resolution of our clocks,” Savino says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Milky Way snacks</h4>



<p>Though it may seem unchanging, the Milky Way is actually gorging on a steady diet of smaller galaxies —it’s even in the process of eating one right now. But for decades, predictions of when and how these cosmic mergers happen have been at odds with evidence from our galaxy, says Bertrand Goldman, an astrophysicist at the International Space University in Strasbourg, France, who is not involved in the Gaia data release. &nbsp;“That has been controversial for a long time,” Goldman says, “but I think that Gaia will certainly shed light.”</p>



<p>The key is to be able to pick apart <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-wave-gas-star-nursery-lurks-near-our-solar-system">different structures in the Milky Way</a> and see how old they are (<em>SN: 1/10/20)</em>. Gaia’s latest release helps in two ways: By mapping the chemistry of stars and by measuring their motion. Previous versions of the survey described how millions of stars were moving, but mostly in two dimensions. The new catalog quadruples the number of stars with full 3-D trajectories from 7 million to 33 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has implications beyond our neighborhood. Most of the mass in the universe is contained in galaxies like the Milky Way, so knowing how our own galaxy works goes a long way to understanding space on the largest scales. And the more scientists understand the parts of galaxies they can see, the more they can learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-milky-way-galaxy-central-bar-stars-slow-rotation">dark matter</a>, the mysterious substance that exerts gravity but doesn’t interact with light (<em>SN: 6/25/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Even as astronomers mine this latest dataset, they are already looking ahead to future treasure hunts. The next round is years off, but it is expected to enable the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, produce rare measurements of black holes and help astronomers clock how fast the universe is expanding. In part, this is because Gaia is designed to track the motion of objects in space, and that gets easier as more time passes. So Gaia’s observations can only get more powerful. “Like good wine, they age very, very well,” Savino says.</p>

Dr. Barlow and Dr. Steven C.

To this day, publications written by ABCT members – including members in prominent leadership roles – are used by anti-SGM activists to justify their ongoing use of these damaging so-called “therapies.” ABCT deeply regrets behavior therapists’ role in the creation, study, and use of these practices, and recognizes and accepts responsibility for the ways in which both our actions and inactions have harmed SGM people. ABCT recognizes it is time for us to document our history and legacy and say that we are truly sorry.<span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span></blockquote><p><br />But documentation of this history and legacy is rather sketchy... Without naming names, the Apology cited the recent review of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jaba.884" target="_blank">Capriotti and Donaldson (2022)</a>, which in turn asked “Why don’t behavior analysts do something?” about retracting the unethical paper of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1311956/" target="_blank" title="Behavioral treatment of deviant sex-role behaviors in a male child">Rekers and Lovaas (1974)</a>.

Barlow sent a forthcoming book chapter from his 2016 retrospective, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barlow-Neurotic-Paradox-Routledge-Library/dp/1138850799" target="_blank"><i>The Neurotic Paradox, Volume 1: Progress in Understanding and Treating Anxiety and Related Disorders</i></a>. A sort-of not-really apology appeared on p. 6-7:</p><blockquote>But it was also during this time [late 60s-early 70s] that I undertook what has come to be from my own personal point of view the most regrettable initiative in my clinical research career. Specifically ... I began treating and evaluating the effects of [covert sensitization]&nbsp; treatment in individuals with what came to be called paraphilias but what was then called sexual deviation (Barlow, 1974a). While our focus was mostly on pedophilia (e.g. Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969), the aggressive behavior of rapists (e.g. Abel, Barlow, Blanchard, &amp; Guild, 1977), and other paraphilias (e.g. Hayes, Brownell, &amp; Barlow, 1978), included in this series of studies were participants presenting with same-sex arousal patterns with consenting adults. (e.g., Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969). At that time homosexuality was considered a disorder in all systems of nosology and, under extreme pressures from society and the associated stigma, these individuals sought out treatment; so very few clinicians even gave it a second thought. But by the mid-1970s several individuals began questioning these treatment goals.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These practices were “embedded in the continually shifting landscape of cultural values and mores”<i> and</i> homosexuality wasn't de-pathologized until “later in the decade” of the 1970s [<i>it was actually <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/122341839/DSM-II-Homosexuality-Revision" target="_blank">1973</a></i>] <i>and</i> “most of the work was on paraphilias” [<i>but <b>many</b> papers were on attempted conversion of gay men and transgender women (who were called </i><i>male transsexuals)</i>]. Most importantly, Barlow did not acknowledge the harm inflicted on the recipients of his treatments. </p><p>Besides the bizarre <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/921523" target="_blank">exorcism in a transsexual article</a>, three more papers described covert modeling procedures and a “therapeutic package” to change the gender identity of transgender youth and young women (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/490883" target="_blank">Barlow et al., 1973</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/492176" target="_blank">1979</a>; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-26335-001" target="_blank">Hay et al., 1981</a>).

<h4>Particle perspectives</h4>



<p><em>Scientists are tracking the movements of subatomic particles called muons to reveal the inner worlds of pyramids, volcanoes and more, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">Muons open doors</a>” (</em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader and longtime subscriber<strong> John Ewald</strong> praised <strong>Conover’s</strong> “enjoyable and detailed” reporting. “She alerted us to concepts and investigations that are honestly new to me,” <strong>Ewald</strong> wrote. “She carried us through those things with a pace that let me emerge [at the end] to say, ‘No particle like it.’ ”</p>





<p><strong>Ewald</strong> also appreciated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/to-solve-mysteries-scientists-look-to-muons">the issue’s editor’s note</a> gave an inside look into how the idea for <strong>Conover’s</strong> feature bloomed (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 2</em>). Editor in chief <strong>Nancy Shute</strong> wrote that physicists sometimes consider muons a nuisance because they get in the way of many experiments. But <strong>Conover</strong> noticed an exciting trend: scientists reimagining the pesky particles as useful tools for discovery. <strong>Shute</strong> “added information, so I learned from her writing too,” <strong>Ewald </strong>wrote.</p>



<h4>A dynamic brain</h4>



<p><em>A study linked COVID-19 with reduced gray matter in parts of the brain associated with the sense of smell, but it’s still unclear if the changes are harmful or permanent, <strong>Laura S­anders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-brain-change-size-shape">COVID-19 can change a person’s brain</a>” (</em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>News coverage of the study, with headlines about brain damage and shrinkage, concerned many in the public, <strong>Sanders</strong> reported. But the brain typically transforms throughout life — including during adolescence and pregnancy — and those changes are not necessarily a cause for alarm. Some readers were relieved to learn that the brain is not so static. “The fact that the brain is constantly changing shape due to various stimuli makes me feel less worried about COVID changes,” Facebook user <strong>Bel Vedere</strong> wrote. “It would certainly be interesting to see the long-term follow-up to these studies.”</p>



<p>The story also eased the mind of reader <strong>Lynne Mullins</strong>. After seeing some alarming coverage of the study’s results, “it is reassuring that answers won’t be available for a while,” <strong>Mullins </strong>wrote.</p>

<h3>Above and beyond</h3>



<p>NASA’s tally of known planets beyond our solar system reached a new milestone, <strong>Liz Kruesi</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-nasa-confirmed-5000-milestone-galaxy">NASA’s exoplanet count tops 5,000</a>” (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p.&nbsp;5</em>). Of the confirmed exoplanets as of March 31, those the size of Neptune are the most common (see graph below).

<h4>Online corner</h4>



<p><em>As part of </em>Science News<em>’ centennial celebration, we created a quiz to test our readers’ knowledge of 100 years of science stories. The quiz, posted on our website in late April, asked people to guess <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-history-headline-quiz">when in the last century 15 headlines were published</a>.</em></p>



<p>An article featured in the quiz, “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-history-headline-quiz">The Earth is a soup-kettle</a>,” was published in (spoiler alert!) 1932 and reported on geologist Arthur Holmes’ idea for how continents could float atop “boiling” rock (<em>SN: 9/10/32, p. 162</em>). At the time, the theory of plate tectonics did not yet exist. Reader <strong>Martin Kappeyne</strong> asked why the piece didn’t reference meteorologist Alfred Wegener’s continental drift theory, which dates back to 1912.</p>



<p>That story, written by Frank Thone, “focused primarily on the question of Earth losing heat — and not the idea of continental drift,” says special projects editor <strong>Elizabeth Quill</strong>.</p>



<p>But Thone <em>did</em> slip in a mention of the theory: “Thus are mountain folds thrown up on the edge of continents, Prof. Holmes thinks; for he is one of those geologists who believe in the theory of shifting and migrating continents, most notably advocated by the great German scientist, von Wegener.”</p>



<p><strong>Quill </strong>doesn’t claim to know what was going on in Thone’s mind, “and his coverage choices probably had a lot to do with what was occupying the attention of scientists in his circle at that snapshot in time,” she says. “But the lack of emphasis on continental drift might have something to do with how contentious the idea was.” In a look back at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">the emergence of plate tectonics</a> as a unifying theory, <strong>Carolyn Gramling</strong> reported that debates between “mobilists” who supported continental drift and “fixists” who opposed it were raging in the 1920s. In the next decades, many geologists turned their attention to other matters until interest in the idea rekindled in the 1950s, when new data surfaced from the bottom of the oceans (<em>SN: 1/16/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p>Online readers scored an average of 7.8 out of 15 on the headline quiz. Think you’ll get more? <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-history-headline-quiz">Take the quiz yourself</a>. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predicting-damage-caused-by-extreme-storms">Predicting the damage caused by extreme storms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Growing up in Miami, <em>Science News</em> earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling knew that hurricanes were a part of life. When Hurricane Andrew hit in 1992, she and her mom huddled in the innermost room of their house, listening all night to a battery-powered radio as winds of more than 250 kilometers per hour shook the house. “I was listening to people calling and saying the hurricane was in their house, what do they do?” Gramling told me.</p>



<p>Her family’s house survived, but many other families weren’t as lucky. The Category 5 storm destroyed or damaged more than 125,000 homes, leaving 160,000 people homeless. “It was transformational for Miami,” Gramling says. After the storm, Florida adopted some of the nation’s strictest building codes to reduce wind damage.</p>





<p>The winds and rain from tropical storms are expected to get more intense as the planet warms. Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas in 2019 with winds up to 300 km/h, flattening entire neighborhoods. And as Gramling reports in this issue, scientists are racing to figure out what communities will need to do to survive the coming megastorms fueled by climate change.</p>



<p>To learn more about that effort, Gramling visited the Wall of Wind at Florida International University, or FIU, her alma mater, while on a recent trip to Miami. It’s an airplane hangar kitted out with humongous fans that can generate wind speeds of up to 252 km/h. Engineers from around the world visit the Wall of Wind to test how models of buildings and landscapes fare in the blast, with the goal of designing and developing infrastructure that can better withstand extreme forces.</p>



<p>A new facility to be built at FIU, funded by the National Science Foundation, will be an even more powerful tool. It will test structures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricane-season-testing-extreme-wind-water-conditions">against stronger winds and against water</a>, adding giant water tanks to the mix. That’s essential since storm surges cause much of a hurricane’s damage and loss of life. “We really don’t know what Mother Nature is going to do,” Gramling says. Researchers will be able to combine data from the facility, which is still in the planning stages, with field observations after natural disasters and computer simulations to predict how different regions could be affected.</p>



<p>Experiencing Hurricane Andrew helped shape her career as a scientist, Gramling says. She studied geology in college, and then oceanography in graduate school. “Living in Miami, climate and ocean are part of your formative experience,” she says. “I wanted to understand it, and I wanted to help other people understand it.” </p>



<p>I’m glad Gramling has put her scientific chops and reporting skills to work for <em>Science News</em> and our readers. Earth’s climate and weather systems are dauntingly complex, and so is the research about them. Gramling has a knack for describing that science in a way that even this lowly magazine editor can understand, while also sharing her fascination with how the world around us works (see, for instance, her admiration for the epic story of mammals in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-world-evolution-innovation-dinosaurs-paleontology">this book review</a>). And if a visit to the Wall of Wind helps us grasp it, so much the better.</p>
