<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Natalie Foote, Director of Service Provider Operations, Science Exchange | </span><a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.scienceexchange.com</span></a><a href="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnRamp-Bio-Logo.png"><img alt="OnRamp Bio Logo" class="aligncenter wp-image-1143" height="134" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnRamp-Bio-Logo-1024x229.png" width="598" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Tim Wesselman, CEO of today’s featured provider OnRamp Bioinformatics, there are only </span><a href="https://www.onramp.bio/blog/data-management-storage-partnership-announcement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,000 bioinformaticians worldwide today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support more than 2 million biologists and other researchers. As a result, analysis has become the rate-limiting step in next-generation sequencing studies, and very large datasets may go un-analyzed to the point of obsoletion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ease this bottleneck, OnRamp Bio offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">services that empower researchers with insights that they can understand and put into action.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software as a service: accessible bioinformatics for non-experts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnRamp Bio has made significant progress in making bioinformatics accessible to larger numbers of researchers. Earlier this year, OnRamp Bio launched a new software-as-a-service for RNA-Seq analysis, to meet the needs of researchers needing assistance in making decisions based on the large data sets yielded by RNA-Seq experiments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genomics big data and complex software analyses have historically required highly trained PhDs in Bioinformatics using complicated command-line tools. OnRamp Bio’s intuitive user interface, automated analyses and robust data management make it faster and easier for scientists, biologists, clinicians and other medical professionals to obtain interpretations of genomic data without the complexity of traditional deployments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“IT complexity has stood in the way of progress for far too long. We’ve combined our deep knowledge of IT and biology to provide intuitive, integrated systems and services that accelerate mainstream adoption of NGS analyses within biotech and pharma,” said Tim Wesselman, CEO of OnRamp Bio. “For institutions focused on drug discovery, cancer research, diagnostic, or therapeutic development, OnRamp Bio can help show how to implement next generation sequencing to securely build into future research, while getting immediate answers more cost-efficiently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to offering end-to-end genomic analysis services, OnRamp Bio recently made the news when it launched Rosalind™, the first-ever software platform specifically designed to simplify genomic analysis (named for one of the researchers who discovered the double helix structure of DNA). </span></p>

<p>Once again I was on the phone to my friend, sobbing. She’d put up with my tears every day since I left the hospital. Two or three daily meltdowns were the norm.</p>
<p>Many of my tears were over things that would have merely irritated me before: misplaced scissors, dirty socks in the middle of the living room, a brief computer glitch.</p>
<p>I have cavernous angiomas, tangles of malformed blood vessels, scattered throughout my brain. Two of them—one larger than a golf ball in my right parietal lobe, and the other, smaller, in my brain stem—had bled, and I underwent <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/07/29/heading-into-brain-injury-should-we-be-concerned/">brain surgeries</a> to remove them.</p>
<p>The bleeds and surgeries led to side effects including loss of balance, vertigo, nystagmus, trouble with sensory overload, and a number of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/04/03/cognitive-theories-and-brain-damage/">cognitive deficits</a>. My emotions also seemed volatile. I expected that my emotions would settle down as my brain healed. They didn’t.</p>
<p>After putting up with about a month’s worth of meltdowns, my friend spoke up. “I think you need meds.”</p>
<p>I was shocked. The possibility of psychiatric medication had not occurred to me. The people I knew who needed it had major issues: a cousin whose mother had died when she was ten years old, a friend who had been suicidal, a student with bipolar disorder. I wasn’t <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/27/ketamine-for-rapid-treatment-of-depression/">depressed</a>. I just got really upset too easily. I was just fragile, and, given what I’d been through, that was understandable.</p>
<p>I wasn’t in denial over my emotional state. Aware of my extreme vulnerability, I’d been proactive: I’d started seeing a <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/15/psychotherapy-and-clinical-boundaries/">psychotherapist</a> regularly within days of my return home from the hospital. I had things under control. </p>
<p>I knew that brain injury can cause chemical imbalances, which can lead to clinical depression. In one account I read, a patient lamented not having gone on antidepressants sooner. Feeling fortunate that I wasn’t in that bad of shape, I sympathized with those who were.</p>
<p><i>I</i> didn’t need meds. </p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, as the tears flowed more often and more freely, my friend grew more insistent. I continued to resist, explaining away my vulnerabilities. It was normal to grieve over losses. I blamed really bad days on my menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>But as the severity and frequency of my meltdowns increased, I had more trouble rationalizing.</p>
<p>I spiraled into the abyss and finally reached the bottom. I felt desolate. I knew I was a burden on everyone around me and that my life wasn’t much of a life. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/10/back-to-school-suicides/">Suicide</a> seemed logical, perhaps the only solution.</p>
<p>I kept my suicidal thoughts secret—I didn’t want my friend or my therapist to try to talk me out of it.<br />
Weeks later, when I began to emerge from the abyss, I kept my silence because I felt ashamed, and later still, I added guilt to the shame—I had betrayed the trust of both my friend and my therapist. </p>
<p>I tried to rationalize my lie-by-omission: I told myself that I could never really take my life, that I didn’t have it in me. </p>
<p>But in some corner of my mind there must have been doubt mixed with the rationalization because a few days later I decided to discuss <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/">antidepressants</a> with my therapist. She agreed with my friend: it was time to consider meds.</p>
<p>Until the brain bleeds, I was averse to pill popping. I took painkillers for my migraines and antibiotics for bacterial infections—no other medications. After the bleeds, I started taking blood-pressure meds (Verapamil) to cut back on the chances of another bleed and anti-seizure meds (Lamictal). I was concerned about messing with my body chemistry, and worried about drug interactions—I wanted to avoid medications that listed seizures as a possible side effect. Given my concerns, my therapist sent me to a psychiatrist who specialized in psychopharmaceuticals. </p>
<p>I wasn’t sure whether there was a viable solution within my comfort zone, but the answer turned out to be straightforward: the psychiatrist suggested simply increasing my daily dose of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/08/03/anti-epileptic-drugs-and-the-risk-of-suicide/">Lamictal</a>. Anti-seizure meds not only prevent seizures; they also act as mood stabilizers and are often used to combat depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>My psychiatrist conferred with my neurologist, who, concerned about adverse reactions to the Lamictal, was firm about capping my daily dose at 600 milligrams. My psychiatrist, determining that my depression was severe, decided to increase the dose directly from the 400 milligrams I was on to 600 milligrams, instead of ramping up in increments, which is the standard procedure.</p>
<p>I responded well to the increase. Feeling like myself once again, I realized just how badly off I’d been. Like my cousin, my student, and my friend, I too had major issues. Except that I really <i>wasn’t</i> like them—<i>my</i> issues were temporary. Once my brain healed, my depression would be over, and I’d be able to get off the meds.</p>
<p>It took a good four years and a couple of trial runs with lowered dosages before I managed to fully shrug off that piece of denial.</p>
<p>A decade later, I’m still on antidepressants, for good reason.</p>
<p>This depression isn’t “situational.” Good friends and therapy help me survive, but they aren’t enough. The bleeds and surgeries changed my neurochemistry. These changes are real, and they’re here to stay. The meds are here to stay, too.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/800px-Pangolin_brought_to_the_Range_office_KMTR_AJTJ-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Pangolins are quite possibly the most adorable creatures on the planet. They are mammals (despite being covered in keratin scales), over eighty million years old as a species, and have inquisitive, intelligent personalities.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-9550 aligncenter" height="396" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/pangolin-1-300x244.jpg" width="487" />
<p>The pangolin has no teeth, and feeds off a diet of mostly insects using their long, thin tongues (longer than the length of their bodies) to probe ant and termite colonies. Pangolins have very few if any natural predators since their scales protect them by withstanding attacks from teeth and claws; a quick YouTube search will show lions trying and failing to eat a round shiny ball, who happily scampers away unscathed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pangolins have been pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal businesses that market the meat and scales as “magical and medicinal”, and their rarity and cost has made them into a culinary status symbol in East Asian restaurants. This high market value has created a black market where pangolins have been cruelly poached from their natural environments of Africa and Asia to the point that all eight varieties of the pangolin are currently listed as critically endangered. Zoos have thus far been unsuccessful in keeping them, as very little is known about this shy and solitary animal.</p>
<p>Researchers Zelda du Toit and colleagues at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa have set out to understand more of the mitogenomics of the four African varieties of the Pangolins; Temminck’s ground pangolin (<em>Smutsia temminckii</em>), the giant ground pangolin (<em>S. gigantea</em>), the white-bellied pangolin (<em>Phataginus tricuspis</em>) and black-bellied pangolin (<em>P. tetradactyla</em>).</p>
<p>Once the full mitochondrial DNA genomes from these specifies and subspecies has been sequenced and verified, researchers will hopefully be able to assist in providing a better understanding of the evolution of pangolins, which in turn will be essential for conservation genetic studies.</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-9547 aligncenter" height="360" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Phataginus_tricuspis-e1507052502276-300x191.jpg" width="565" />
<p>Mitochondrial DNA is well suited for evolutionary studies due to its high mutation rate, well-structured genome with restricted non-coding DNA sequences, and lack of recombination.</p>
<p>Du Toit and colleagues set out to perform next generation sequencing for all four African pangolins using Illumina HiSeq 2500 in order to reconstruct complete mitochondrial genomes, two of which have previously not been sequenced; the black-belied pangolin and the giant ground pangolin. Du Toit and her team of researchers have also managed to conduct a phylogenetic assessment in order to provide a genus level classification of African pangolins.</p>
<p>By using six deceased pangolins which comprised of the four African subspecies, full mitogenomes were generated and aligned with eleven other carnivore genomes using MAFFT v7, as they are reported to be evolutionary closely related to pangolins. The best fit model of sequence evolution for the dataset under the AIC was the General Time Reversal model (GTR+I+G) with invariable site and gamma distribution of 0.822, and the best fit model under the BIC and DT was the Transition model two (TIM2+I+G) with invariable site and gamma distribution values of 0.998 and 0.990, respectively.</p>
<p>From these two models, three Bayesian phylogenetic trees along with three maximum likelihood trees were generated for the datasets. The different trees all showed consistent branching patterns, posterior probability values for the BI trees and bootstrap values for the ML trees.</p>
<p>From the three trees, a consensus tree was created, as seen in Figure 2 of the study:</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9552" height="770" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/Pangolin-fig-2.jpg" width="1502" />
<p>From this tree, it can be deduced that all African pangolins group according to the species, with the exception of the black-bellied pangolin genome. That mitogenome has previously been reported to be misclassified based on partial Cob analysis and was confirmed in the analysis as a white-bellied pangolin genome. Additionally, the phylogenetic tree in figure 2 provides support for the separation of Asian and African pangolin species into two distinct monophyletic clades with the latter consisting of all four African pangolins species. Within the clade, the giant and Temminck’s pangolin cluster separately from the white-bellied and black-bellied pangolins with significant Bayesian and ML support.</p>
<p>The authors further go on to claim that the observed branching pattern provides support for the classification of the group-dwelling and arboreal species into two separate genera; <em>Phataginus</em> and <em>Smutsia</em>. Results from their analysis also suggest the overall classification of pangolin should be in three genera: <em>Manis</em> (Asian pangolins), <em>Phataginus</em> (African tree pangolins), and <em>Smutsia</em> (African ground pangolins). However, the authors caution that further analysis of the Asian pangolin genome is necessary. The branching patterns were also confirmed using individual loci.</p>
<p>This study is very unique in that it sheds a light on the diversity of the endangered pangolins remaining in the world. By discovering two new reference genomes for the black bellied pangolin and the giant ground pangolin, researchers will be able to better understand the evolutionary diversity of the extant pangolin species. Additionally, this study offers the first phylogenetic assessment of six of eight species using whole mitochondrial DNA genomes, and the data suggests that the African and Asian pangolin species are indeed separate monophyletic clades, and there is further separation of genera between tree-dwelling and ground-dwelling African pangolins.</p>
<p>These studies are essential for the conservation efforts of this species, and hopefully will be able to help boost dwindling wild pangolin numbers before they go extinct; this species has existed for over 80 million years, and to lose them now would be to lose a very unique and majestic animal.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf">Helge Hasselmann</a></p>
<p>Surveys and opinion polls are notoriously bad at predicting election results, as a chain of rather unexpected events last year demonstrated. These instruments usually ask people about their explicit attitudes and opinions. Often, however, these “external” proxies are not entirely representative of what a person is really thinking. For example, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00635.x/abstract">several</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25956912">studies</a> have shown that implicit attitudes – that is, subtle preferences or biases outside the realm of our consciousness – can be more useful in predicting our future choices.</p>
<p>As scary as this may sound, there is also mounting evidence that our physiological responses can be even more accurate in revealing how we’re likely to vote. In a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/4111142/Brain-indices-of-disagreement-with-one-s-social">new paper</a> in <i>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</i>, researchers from Kingston University and the University of Essex have taken a closer look at a voting outcome in the UK that, last year, came as a surprise to a lot of people. Their findings suggest that people’s brain responses to statements about the EU were a more accurate predictor of they way they went on to vote in the Brexit referendum than their stated intentions.</p>
<p><span id="more-30917"></span></p>
<p>The researchers used electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the brain’s electrical activity at the scalp, to record a particular brain signal called the N400. These are brainwaves that peak roughly 400ms after a relevant stimulus, such as unexpected words in a sentence (e.g., “I drink my coffee with milk and<i> socks</i>”), or even violations of our values. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656340">a particularly illustrative study</a> found that devout Christians showed a strong N400 signal when reading statements that contradicted their core beliefs (e.g., “I think that euthanasia is an acceptable course of action”).</p>
<p>The researchers recorded the N400 of 62 participants in the five weeks preceding the UK’s EU referendum last year. All participants were eligible to vote, with 18 intending to vote leave and remain, respectively, and 26 saying they were undecided. The three groups had similar years of education and gender composition, but the leave group (mean age 33.1 years) was significantly older than the remain group (mean age 22.8 years).</p>
<p>To elicit N400 brain waves, participants were exposed to both “remain” (e.g., “Free access to healthcare for all EU migrants should be allowed) and “leave” (e.g., “If Britain leaves Europe our quality of life will be enhanced”) positions. All statements had been retrieved from official material used by both sides of the campaign, and their number was split evenly between the two positions. To make sure that the statements were politically unambiguous, they had been rated by an independent group of participants and only the 112 strongest were retained for the actual experiment.</p>
<p>Each statement was presented one word at a time, with each word appearing for 200ms followed by a white screen for 300ms, which is a common set-up for EEG experiments. Participants had to indicate consent or dissent with each statement by pressing a key on a keyboard in front of them. There was a clear-cut difference between agreement and disagreement to statements by “leavers” and “remainers”, showing that the experiment captured political differences reliably.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesised that “leavers” and “remainers” would show higher N400 signal strength in response to statements from the political position opposite to their own. And this is exactly what happened, at least among decided voters.  Participants with the intention to vote leave showed a higher N400 signal to remain- compared to leave-associated statements, while remainers showed the opposite pattern.</p>
<p>Next, the authors looked at whether N400 strength was able to predict the actual vote participants casted several weeks later. For this, they contacted the original participants again after the referendum and fed their vote into a statistical model (two participants were excluded because they had not voted in the referendum). And, indeed, the magnitude of the N400 response predicted (i.e. correlated with) the final vote in the referendum. What is even more interesting, this did not depend on whether the participants had already made up their mind when they came in for the EEG measurement. In fact, the N400 brain signal was a significantly better predictor of voting behaviour than participants’ explicit agreement or disagreement with pro- and contra-EU statements. This means that even though participants might not have been explicitly aware of their intentions at the time of the experiment, their brain responses were indicative of them having, in fact, already made up their mind.</p>
<p>For the majority of undecided participants, their ultimate vote was to remain (22 out of 25) – which was representative of the London area where they were recruited. This is the study’s main shortcoming because we do not know if N400 would have also predicted voting behaviour among undecided people who went on to vote leave. Still, the study offers some very fascinating insights. It shows that under some circumstances physiological parameters provide a more accurate reflection of personal values and in this case, voting behaviour, than people’s overt opinions. This has crucial implications for opinions polls and surveys, which in the majority of cases rely on explicit information such as agree/disagree responses. On a side note, but no less fascinating than the study’s main results, political information seems to be processed in the brain within as little as 400ms, which is outside our scope of consciousness. This should give pollsters some food for thought.</p>

<p>
 The tumour suppressor complex BRCA1–BARD1 functions in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. During this process, BRCA1–BARD1 facilitates the nucleolytic resection of DNA ends to generate a single-stranded template for the recruitment of another tumour suppressor complex, BRCA2–PALB2, and the recombinase RAD51. Here, by examining purified wild-type and mutant BRCA1–BARD1, we show that both BRCA1 and BARD1 bind DNA and interact with RAD51, and that BRCA1–BARD1 enhances the recombinase activity of RAD51. Mechanistically, BRCA1–BARD1 promotes the assembly of the synaptic complex, an essential intermediate in RAD51-mediated DNA joint formation. We provide evidence that BRCA1 and BARD1 are indispensable for RAD51 stimulation. Notably, BRCA1–BARD1 mutants with weakened RAD51 interactions show compromised DNA joint formation and impaired mediation of homologous recombination and DNA repair in cells. Our results identify a late role of BRCA1–BARD1 in homologous recombination, an attribute of the tumour suppressor complex that could be targeted in cancer therapy.

<p>
 Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS–STING (cyclic GMP–AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin–cGAS–STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.

<p>
 RNA has important and diverse roles in biology, but molecular tools to manipulate and measure it are limited. For example, RNA interference can efficiently knockdown RNAs, but it is prone to off-target effects, and visualizing RNAs typically relies on the introduction of exogenous tags. Here we demonstrate that the class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for mammalian cell RNA knockdown and binding. After initial screening of 15 orthologues, we identified Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) as the most effective in an interference assay in Escherichia coli. LwaCas13a can be heterologously expressed in mammalian and plant cells for targeted knockdown of either reporter or endogenous transcripts with comparable levels of knockdown as RNA interference and improved specificity. Catalytically inactive LwaCas13a maintains targeted RNA binding activity, which we leveraged for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells. Our results establish CRISPR–Cas13a as a flexible platform for studying RNA in mammalian cells and therapeutic development.

<p>
 Mammalian organs vary widely in regenerative capacity. Poorly regenerative organs, such as the heart are particularly vulnerable to organ failure. Once established, heart failure commonly results in mortality. The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade that prevents adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration, is upregulated in human heart failure. Here we show that deletion of the Hippo pathway component Salvador (Salv) in mouse hearts with established ischaemic heart failure after myocardial infarction induces a reparative genetic program with increased scar border vascularity, reduced fibrosis, and recovery of pumping function compared with controls. Using translating ribosomal affinity purification, we isolate cardiomyocyte-specific translating messenger RNA. Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes have increased expression of proliferative genes and stress response genes, such as the mitochondrial quality control gene, Park2. Genetic studies indicate that Park2 is essential for heart repair, suggesting a requirement for mitochondrial quality control in regenerating myocardium. Gene therapy with a virus encoding Salv short hairpin RNA improves heart function when delivered at the time of infarct or after ischaemic heart failure following myocardial infarction was established. Our findings indicate that the failing heart has a previously unrecognized reparative capacity involving more than cardiomyocyte renewal.

<p>
 Observations from cultured cells, animal models and patients raise the possibility that the dependency of tumours on the therapeutic drugs to which they have acquired resistance represents a vulnerability with potential applications in cancer treatment. However, for this drug addiction trait to become of clinical interest, we must first define the mechanism that underlies it. We performed an unbiased CRISPR–Cas9 knockout screen on melanoma cells that were both resistant and addicted to inhibition of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, in order to functionally mine their genome for ‘addiction genes’. Here we describe a signalling pathway comprising ERK2 kinase and JUNB and FRA1 transcription factors, disruption of which allowed addicted tumour cells to survive on treatment discontinuation. This occurred in both cultured cells and mice and was irrespective of the acquired drug resistance mechanism. In melanoma and lung cancer cells, death induced by drug withdrawal was preceded by a specific ERK2-dependent phenotype switch, alongside transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. In melanoma cells, this reprogramming caused the shutdown of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a lineage survival oncoprotein; restoring this protein reversed phenotype switching and prevented the lethality associated with drug addiction. In patients with melanoma that had progressed during treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, treatment cessation was followed by increased expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, which is associated with the phenotype switch. Drug discontinuation synergized with the melanoma chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine by further suppressing MITF and its prosurvival target, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and by inducing DNA damage in cancer cells. Our results uncover a pathway that underpins drug addiction in cancer cells, which may help to guide the use of alternating therapeutic strategies for enhanced clinical responses in drug-resistant cancers.

<p>
 Viruses express several classes of non-coding RNAs; the functions and mechanisms by which most of these act are unknown. Herpesvirus saimiri, a γ-herpesvirus that establishes latency in the T cells of New World primates and has the ability to cause aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas in non-natural hosts, expresses seven small nuclear uracil-rich non-coding RNAs (called HSURs) in latently infected cells. These HSURs associate with Sm proteins, and share biogenesis and structural features with cellular Sm-class small nuclear RNAs. One of these HSURs (HSUR2) base-pairs with two host cellular microRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-16) but does not affect their abundance or activity, which suggests that its interactions with them perform alternative functions. Here we show that HSUR2 also base-pairs with mRNAs in infected cells. We combined in vivo psoralen-mediated RNA–RNA crosslinking and high-throughput sequencing to identify the mRNAs targeted by HSUR2, which include mRNAs that encode retinoblastoma and factors involved in p53 signalling and apoptosis. We show that HSUR2 represses the expression of target mRNAs and that base-pairing between HSUR2 and miR-142-3p and miR-16 is essential for this repression, suggesting that HSUR2 recruits these two cellular microRNAs to its target mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that HSUR2 uses this mechanism to inhibit apoptosis. Our results uncover a role for this viral Sm-class RNA as a microRNA adaptor in the regulation of gene expression that follows precursor mRNA processing.

<p>
 Nature uses a limited, conservative set of amino acids to synthesize proteins. The ability to genetically encode an expanded set of building blocks with new chemical and physical properties is transforming the study, manipulation and evolution of proteins, and is enabling diverse applications, including approaches to probe, image and control protein function, and to precisely engineer therapeutics. Underpinning this transformation are strategies to engineer and rewire translation. Emerging strategies aim to reprogram the genetic code so that noncanonical biopolymers can be synthesized and evolved, and to test the limits of our ability to engineer the translational machinery and systematically recode genomes.

<p>
 The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, to regulate growth and metabolism. GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors, nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important but poorly understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast, glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity) triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain). Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1 inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and/or disassembly of higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of protein kinases.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/nnqmdCVPxGA/nature23907">The transcription fidelity factor GreA impedes DNA break repair</a></h4>

<p>
 Homologous recombination repairs DNA double-strand breaks and must function even on actively transcribed DNA. Because break repair prevents chromosome loss, the completion of repair is expected to outweigh the transcription of broken templates. However, the interplay between DNA break repair and transcription processivity is unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor GreA inhibits break repair in Escherichia coli. GreA restarts backtracked RNA polymerase and hence promotes transcription fidelity. We report that removal of GreA results in markedly enhanced break repair via the classic RecBCD–RecA pathway. Using a deep-sequencing method to measure chromosomal exonucleolytic degradation, we demonstrate that the absence of GreA limits RecBCD-mediated resection. Our findings suggest that increased RNA polymerase backtracking promotes break repair by instigating RecA loading by RecBCD, without the influence of canonical Chi signals. The idea that backtracked RNA polymerase can stimulate recombination presents a DNA transaction conundrum: a transcription fidelity factor that compromises genomic integrity.

<h4>Work will use state of the art imaging techniques to provide new insights critical for addressing numerous visual, neurological, and psychiatric disorders</h4>
<p>Dr. David Fitzpatrick, Scientific Director and CEO at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has been awarded a $2.4 million five-year grant from the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the functional organization of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex, specifically, in the area of brain responsible for processing visual information.</p>
<p>The cerebral cortex is the largest and most complex area of the brain, comprising 20 billion neurons and 60 trillion synapses–a neuronal network whose proper function is critical for sensory perception, motor control, and cognition. </p>
<p>“With the research supported by this grant, we aim to address a major gap in our understanding of how neurons in the cerebral cortex process information,” said Dr. Fitzpatrick. “A deeper understanding of how neural circuits develop and work together to process and transmit information is crucial for addressing numerous visual, neurological, and psychiatric disorders resulting from the dysfunction of these circuits in the brain.”</p>
<p>Since MPFI opened its doors in 2012, its scientists have received over $20 million dollars in NIH funding in support of its innovative and pioneering neuroscience research, including a $177k fellowship from the NEI recently awarded to Dr. Joseph Schumacher, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. David Fitzpatrick’s lab. </p>

A new paper in Nature Human Behaviour has generated lots of debate. In Redefine Statistical Significance, authors Daniel J. Benjamin and colleagues suggest changing the convention that p-values below 0.05 are called 'significant'. Instead, they suggest, the cut-off should be set at 0.005 - a stricter criterion.



Over at The Brains Blog, John Schwenkler organized a discussion of the Benjamin et al. proposal, featuring commentary from several statisticians and researchers.

<p>There are behavioural differences, on average, between the sexes – few would dispute that. Where the debate rages is over how much these differences are the result of social pressures versus being rooted in our biology (the answer often is that there is a complex interaction between the two).</p>
<p>For example, when differences are observed between girls and boys, such as in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/">preferences for play</a>, one possibility is that this is partly or wholly because of the contrasting ways that girls and boys are influenced by their peers, parents and other adults (because of the ideas they have about how the sexes ought to behave). Studying non-human primates allows us to identity sex differences in behavior that can’t be due to human culture and gender beliefs.</p>
<p>Learning more about the biological roots of behavioural sex differences should not be used as an excuse for harmful stereotyping or discrimination, but it can help us better understand our human nature and the part that evolved sex differences play in some of the most important issues that affect our lives, including around diversity, relationships, mental health, crime and education.</p>

<p>In human cultures across the world, <a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=psychfacpub">boys tend to spend more time away from their mothers</a> as compared with girls, which may reflect an early tendency toward greater risk taking. The same is true in chimps. For a 2014 paper, Lonsdorf and her colleagues, including famed zoologist Jane Goodall, conducted <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099099#">the most detailed ever analysis of the development of wild chimpanzees</a>, observing 40 chimps from birth to age 5. They found that, by age 3, male infants showed greater physical distance from their mothers than females. The males began moving about on their own earlier than females and covered more distances independently. These and other findings from the study “suggest that some biologically based sex differences in behavior may have been present in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, and operated independently from the influences of modern sex-biased parental behavior and gender socialization,” the researchers said.</p>
<h2><b>Baby girl monkeys are more social </b></h2>
<p>In humans, girls tend to show more precocious social interest and development than boys. For example, at less than two-days old, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638300000321">girls spend more time than boys looking at a human face than at a mechanical toy</a>. Though a replication attempt of this specific finding for humans is needed, a very similar pattern has been found in rhesus macaque monkeys. For <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4726418/">a paper published last year</a> a research team led by Elizabeth Simpson observed 48 two- to three-week old monkeys as they were presented with videos of a macaque monkey face. The females spent more time looking at the videos than males and they later displayed more social behaviour toward a human. “In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life, and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience,” the researchers said.</p>
<h2><strong>Boy monkeys enjoy more rough and tumble </strong></h2>
<p>In human children, average sex differences in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/03/infants-show-a-preference-for-toys-that-match-their-gender-before-they-know-what-gender-is/">play</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/10/why-pink-lego-might-be-bad-for-girls/">preferences</a> are among the most striking, consistent (and controversial) behavioural contrasts found between boys and girls. It never seems to take very long for little boys to pick up sticks and pretend that they are armed with a sword. In contrast, girls typically spend more time pretending to nurture toy dolls or similar. Of course, many say this simply reflects the way that boys are raised to be more aggressive and girls more nurturing. And yet very similar sex-linked play preferences are seen in our primate cousins.</p>

Males also initiated play more often than females. In her review, Lonsdorf notes that similar findings have been observed in blue monkeys, patas monkeys, Japanese macaques and olive baboons.</p>
<h2>Girl monkeys spend more time playing parent</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1128681?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Human boys, on average, are less interested than girls in babies</a>. There’s a similar pattern among non-human primates. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03327332">Observational research</a> at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center with one-year-old Rhesus Macaque monkeys found that the females spent significantly more time than the males with infants. “The focus of young females’ attention on infants has been suggested to be important for the development of later maternal skills,” the researchers said. They noted that a similar observation has been found for another species: “Juvenile female vervet monkeys that live in the wild carry and cuddle small infants, an experience that may provide them with the motor skills necessary for later matemal behavior, as weIl as give them exposure to the maternal role. It is likely that this experience is similarly useful for a yearling rhesus monkey”. Lonsdorf observes in her review that a female bias for nurturing style play has also been seen in lowland gorillas and blue monkeys.</p>
<h2><b>Boy monkeys like learning from their dads, girl monkeys from their mums</b></h2>
<p>There’s little doubt that biological differences between the sexes are amplified by parenting practices and parent-child relationships, including boys’ tendency to want to emulate their dads and girls to emulate their mothers – as seen both in humans and our primate cousins. For instance, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728904/">in a study of capuchin monkeys</a>, Susan Perry looked to see whether infants adopted one of two different techniques (pounding or scrubbing) for extracting seeds from fruit – girls, but not boys, typically adopted whichever technique was used by their mothers. In wild tufted capuchins, meanwhile, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.20120/abstract">male juveniles typically stick with their dads and copy their dietary preferences</a>, such as favouring eating animals over fruit (the latter preferred by females). It’s <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205001831">a similar story for chimps and termite fishing</a> with research showing how females are better at this task than males and that female infants spend more time than their boy peers watching and learning from their mothers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>“Taken as a whole,” Lonsdorf concludes, “these consistent and accumulating reports of sex differences in primate behavioral development suggest that, although gender socialization in humans plays a role in magnifying the differences between young males and females, these behavioral sex differences are rooted in our biological and evolutionary heritage.”</p>

<p>The mission of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation is to improve health by “accelerating support for medical research through recognition of research excellence, education and advocacy.” Each year, Lasker Awards are given to scientists that embody this mission. Organizations are also eligible for awards through the <strong><a href="http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/essential-health-services-and-reproductive-care/" target="_blank">Lasker~Bloomberg Public Service Award</a></strong> that alternates years with the Lasker~Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_7762" style="width: 300px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7762 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/10/Sommer-Jacket-Square-5x5-300x300.jpg" width="300" />Dr. Alfred Sommer; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</figure>
<p>This year’s recipient of the Public Service Award is Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), “for providing essential health services and reproductive care to millions of women for more than a century.” PPFA began in Brooklyn, New York, where in 1916 Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the US; in 1942 the organization changed its name from The American Birth Control League to Planned Parenthood. To place the 2017 Lasker~Bloomberg Public Service Award in context, PLOS interviewed Chair of the Jury <strong><a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/admissions/scholarships/institutional-scholarships/sommer-scholars/about/alfred-sommer-bio.html" target="_blank">Alfred Sommer</a></strong>, University Distinguished Service Professor and Dean Emeritus, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p>
<p>With this award, PPFA joins other collaborative efforts including <strong><a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-receives-lasker-bloomberg-public-service-award" target="_blank">Médecins Sans Frontières</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Lasker-Bloomberg-Award-Acceptance" target="_blank">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://www.cc.nih.gov/ccaward.html" target="_blank">NIH Clinical Center</a></strong> as Lasker Public Service Awardees. Since recent previous awardees in this category were individuals, PLOS asked Sommer what does this say about how science and medicine work today, or about the efforts needed to impact human health. <strong>“The intent of the Public Service Award has always been recognition of contributions to expanding investments in biomedical/health research and advancing the public’s health,”</strong> he responds. “In recent years there has been slightly greater attention paid to the latter, and therefore to the individuals and institutions that have made a real difference.”</p>
<p>Sommer was circumspect and honest when asked to reflect on the timing of the committee’s decision process, in relation to political discourse in the US at that time over the proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that would defund approximately 40% of Planned Parenthood’s annual budget. “The discussion is always free-wheeling, and every member is free to raise whatever perspectives they like,” he says. “I am not at liberty to discuss the actual vote, but I can say there was broad agreement with this year’s choice (as there usually is every year, once the discussion and votes are taken).” He continues that the Lasker Awards are “meant to recognize extraordinary achievements, and bring these achievements to the attention of the public. It was no different in this case.”</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/essential-health-services-and-reproductive-care/" target="_blank">origin story</a></strong> of Planned Parenthood is fascinating. While family planning may be the founding service, it’s likely the public doesn’t realize the breadth of services offered by the organization, from sex education programs that reach 1.5 million people annually to over 4 million tests and treatments to both men and women (in 2015 alone) for sexually transmitted infections. “The purpose of all Lasker Awards is to better inform the public about the individual, work, and organization that is being honored,” says Sommer. In recognizing PPFA, he continues, “we would hope that the public will have a better understanding of all the contributions to health made by PPFA.”</p>
<p>While publications and publicity are not a requirement for receipt of the Public Service Award, placing this type of information into the public domain helps to inform policy and to improve health outcomes. Among the PLOS journals, two articles have corresponding or contributing authors affiliated with PPFA. In the recent <strong><em><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" target="_blank">PLOS ONE</a></em></strong> article, “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180250" target="_blank">Parents’ views on sex education in schools: How much do Democrats and Republicans agree?</a></strong>” researchers from Planned Parenthood found that comprehensive sex education is supported by a vast majority of parents, both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>In the <strong><em><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/" target="_blank">PLOS Medicine</a> </em></strong>article, “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002110" target="_blank">Comparison of Outcomes before and after Ohio’s Law Mandating Use of the FDA-Approved Protocol for Medication Abortion: A Retrospective Cohort Study</a></strong>” researchers followed outcomes of a law that took effect in 2011 requiring abortion providers to follow specific US Food and Drug Administration guidelines, created in 2000, when giving patients a combination of two drugs to induce abortion. Their findings, covered by <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/30/ohio-abortion-pill-law-mifepristone-study" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em></a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-abortion-complications-ohio-20160830-snap-story.html" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a></strong>, indicate that women experienced a higher rate of complications and were nearly three times more likely to require additional medical intervention after the law was implemented.</p>
<p>Some say that receiving a Lasker Award hints at prediction of a Nobel Prize. To put this attention to awards and prizes in context, it’s worth understanding the compelling origins and motivations of the Lasker Foundation directly from “<strong><a href="http://www.laskerfoundation.org/about/" target="_blank">The Lasker Legacy</a>” </strong>video. After watching you might want to make your voice heard through suggested resources on the <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/march-for-science" target="_blank">PLOS Stand Up for Science</a></strong> webpage. Work from individual scientists receiving this year’s Lasker Awards is described <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/09/2017-lasker-awards/" target="_blank">in a previous post</a></strong>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/10/02/new-fibromyalgia-treatment-emotional-awareness-and-expression-therapy/">New Fibromyalgia Treatment: Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy</a></h4>

<p>Psychotherapy that encourages addressing emotional experiences related to trauma, conflict, and relationship problems has been found helpful for people with the chronic pain condition fibromyalgia.In the randomized clinical trial at Wayne State University in Detroit, 230 adults with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/31/new-treatment-option-for-difficult-diseases/">fibromyalgia</a> received one of three treatments. Each was presented for eight weekly sessions to small groups of patients.</p>
<p>The new therapy, called Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET), helps patients view their pain and other symptoms as stemming from changeable neural pathways in the brain that are strongly influenced by <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/10/22/comparing-the-5-theories-of-emotion/">emotions</a>, the researchers explain.</p>
<p>EAET helps patients process emotional experiences, such as disclosing important struggles, learning how to adaptively express important feelings—especially anger and sadness, but also <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/26/learning-how-to-practice-being-grateful-and-reap-the-benefits/">gratitude</a>, compassion, and forgiveness—and empowering people to be more honest and direct in relationships that have been conflicted or problematic, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>The EAET intervention was compared to both an educational intervention, as well as the gold standard psychological approach in the field, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/06/05/the-cognitive-behavioral-miracle-controlling-your-emotions/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>. Six months after treatments ended, patients were evaluated for the severity and extent of their pain and other problems that people with fibromyalgia often experience.</p>
<p>Patients who received EAET had better outcomes—reduced widespread <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/27/neurofeedback-therapy-for-the-management-of-pain/">pain</a>, physical impairment, attention and concentration problems, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/14/got-anxiety-got-smarts/">anxiety</a>, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/">depression</a>, and more positive emotions and life satisfaction—than patients who received the education intervention, the researchers report.</p>
<p>More than twice as many people in EAET (34.8 percent) reported that they were “much better” or “very much better” than before treatment, compared to 15.4 percent of education patients.</p>
<p>An important additional finding was that the new emotion therapy also had greater benefits than cognitive behavior therapy in reducing widespread pain and in the number of patients who achieved at least 50 percent pain reduction, the researchers point out.</p>
<p>Mark A. Lumley, Ph.D., a professor of psychology said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many people with fibromyalgia have experienced adversity in their lives, including victimization, family problems, and internal conflicts, all of which create important emotions that are often suppressed or avoided. Emerging neuroscience research suggests that this can contribute strongly to pain and other physical symptoms.</p>
<p>We developed and tested an approach that tries to help people overcome these emotional and relationship problems and reduce their symptoms, rather than just help people manage or accept their fibromyalgia. Although this treatment does not help all people with fibromyalgia, many patients found it to be very helpful, and some had dramatic improvements in their lives and their health.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>By the time a terrorist attack has begun, the security services have already failed. But the challenge they face in detecting potential attacks is substantial, especially since the tactic of terrorism has increasingly been taken up by individual attackers inspired by, but not directly beholden to, formal movements. Spotting a lone wolf among the flock is no easy task, especially when it relies on a bottleneck of human analysis. A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301495">new paper</a> in the journal <i>Aggression and Violent Behavior</i> uses a test case of a real lone wolf attack to explore ways we may be able to deal with this in the future. Using online language analysis tools, it hunts within blocks of text for the warning signs we might otherwise miss, with the hope of helping us to more effectively detect the predator.</p>
<p><span id="more-30673"></span></p>
<p>Giti Zahedzadeh of the Centre for Neuroeconomic Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California wanted to see what insights could be gleaned about violent tendencies by analysing text using the open-source web application <a href="http://voyant-tools.org">Voyant</a>. The application has a number of features such as creating word clouds, word frequency lists, and word association chains to pull out patterns from blocks of text.</p>
<p>The raw data Zahedzadeh used were writings by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidal_Hasan">Nidal Hasan</a>, the US military psychiatrist who turned traitor and went on an ideologically motivated mass shooting in 2009 in Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 and injuring many more. Hasan, who is now incarcerated awaiting execution, received some attention from authorities before his crime but he was never classified as “being involved in terrorist activities,” leaving him a free hand to commit his attack. Were warning signs missed?</p>
<p>The Voyant programme was first applied on a powerpoint presentation Hasan gave two years before the attack, as part of the final stage of his medical training. He chose the topic “The Qur’anic World View As It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military.” Its purpose was ostensibly to explore the topic to inform policy and treatment, but with the benefit of hindsight, one can see an individual working out in public his own misgivings and sounding out justifications for a course of action. Using Voyant, Zahedzadeh was able to visually zoom through key words and explore their associations, such as “fight”, “cause”, and “important”, and generate a word cloud highlighting the prominence of the words “god” and “submission” in one of the sections.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting is the email exchange between Hasan and a radical cleric, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> (who was later killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011). Al-Awlaki presided over the funeral of Hasan’s mother some years prior to Hasan’s atrocity, but had since moved to Yemen to continue his activities with less interference. The exchange shows Hasan testing out ideas and probing whether certain violent actions could be consistent with Islamic law. These messages were picked up at the time by the Joint Terrorism Task Force but ultimately not acted on. However, the Voyant analysis pulled out a number of red flags, such as a high coincidence of the term “permissible” in the context of the word “suicide”, and the pairing of “intention”, “kill,” and “soldiers” – the latter precisely reflecting the act Hasan was to go on to conduct.</p>
<p>Again, reading the text with the benefit of hindsight, the warning signs feel like they jump out at you without the need to collate word patterns, but of course, it’s easy to spot signs of something once you know about it. The purpose of using a technology approach is to foreground patterns that may seem otherwise innocuous, objectively presenting frequencies and interconnections in black and white. Moreover, gathering this kind of data into a larger corpus, based upon many cases, could help us understand “the process in which an individual moves from radical opinion to violent action,” Zahedzadeh said.</p>

Subtle symptoms such as forgetfulness and word finding problems may progress to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606685425" target="_blank">mild cognitive impairment</a> (MCI), and then escalate to full-blown dementia. Recent efforts to classify <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881320/" target="_blank" title="Defining 'Prodromal' Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia: Are we there yet?">prodromal states</a> have included automated analysis of spontaneous speech, which loses complexity as the disease progresses.<br /><br />In one study, <strike>Frazier</strike> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150520" target="_blank">Fraser et al. (2015)</a> applied machine learning methods to speech transcripts and audio files from the <a href="http://www.talkbank.org/DementiaBank/" target="_blank">DementiaBank</a> database. The participants were 167 patients with probable AD and 97 controls. The authors considered a total of 370 linguistic features, and found that a subset of 35 was able to classify patients vs. controls with 82% accuracy.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> While an advance over previous studies, this is not yet useful for diagnostic purposes. Another limitation was the relatively short length of the speech samples.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> <br /><br />Using factor analysis, the researchers found that <a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2015/12/15/alzheimers-disease-markers-found-speech-patterns/" target="_blank">four dimensions of speech</a><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>3 </sup></b></span>were most indicative of dementia: <br /><ul><li>Semantic impairment<span class="_Tgc"> – </span>using overly simple words</li><li>Acoustic impairment <span class="_Tgc">– </span>e.g., speaking more  slowly </li><li>Syntactic impairment  <span class="_Tgc">– </span>using less complex grammar </li><li>Information impairment <span class="_Tgc">– </span>not clearly identifying the main aspects  of a picture they were told to describe</li></ul><br />Public figures who give repeated interviews leave a searchable record of spontaneous speech that can be analyzed for changes over time. Presidential press conferences provide another rich source of data for linguistic analysis. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633673" target="_blank">Berisha et al. (2015)</a> examined <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">transcripts</a> from the press conferences given by Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and George H.W. Bush (1989-1993). We know that President Reagan received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, five years after leaving office. And as far as we know, the elder Bush is still cognitively intact for his age (he's 92 now).<br /><br />The quantified linguistic features included:<br /><ul><li>Number of unique words<i><br /></i></li><li>Non-specific nouns – e.g., <i>thing, something, anything</i></li><li>Filler words – <i>well, so, basically, actually, literally, um, ah</i></li><li>Low-imageability, high frequency verbs <i>– e.g., <i>get, give, go, have, do</i> </i></li></ul><br />Reagan showed a significant decline in the number of unique words over the course of his presidency, but Bush did not.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s1600/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="177" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3MMHZEZQqg/WKloZbS7jEI/AAAAAAAAMB4/oJKTD80k2o0HFZLiepXi0dVUEKS43k6YACLcB/s400/unique%2Bwords_linked%2Bto%2BAD%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Likewise, Reagan showed a significant <i>increase</i> in the use of non-specific nouns and fillers, but Bush did not.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s1600/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="167" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L2r3dyRDBak/WKloZfPjJ4I/AAAAAAAAMB0/fbUHrn28BPgSlF1ZKIMXycTB1fMrDZN_wCLcB/s400/non-specific%2Bnouns%2Band%2Bfillers%2Bfor%2BReagan%2Band%2BGHW%2BBush.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />There are several caveats here. Reagan was 69 when he was elected, while Bush was 64. Reagan was president for eight years and Bush for only four years; yet Bush held over twice as many press conferences as Reagan. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with a decline in cognitive function (which is not uncommon when aging from 69 to 77). Can we can classify Reagan as having MCI on the basis of these results? I don't think so. We'd really need comparable data from a population of demographically matched elderly participants.<br /><br /><br /><b>President Donald Trump</b><br /><br />After his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/16/remarks-president-trump-press-conference" target="_blank">Feb. 16 press conference</a>, the public debate over whether President Trump is mentally unbalanced has intensified. Much of the current and past discussion has centered on the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder" target="_blank">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a> (NPD), as speculated in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a> and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/17/donald-trump-narcisissm-mentally-ill-personality?CMP=share_btn_tw" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. Sure, Trump has many of these qualities (that predate his <i>actual</i> grandiose status as POTUS): <br /><ol><li>Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others</li><li>Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.</li><li>Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions</li><li>Needing constant admiration from others</li><li>Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others</li><li>Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain</li><li>Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs</li><li>Intensely envious of others and the belief that others are equally envious of them</li><li>Pompous and arrogant demeanor</li></ol>And we can call him <b>narcissistic</b> in the generic sense of the word. But do we need to diagnose him with a quasi-psychiatric disorder, as in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/opinion/mental-health-professionals-warn-about-trump.html" target="_blank"><i>NY Times</i> letter</a> signed by 35 mental health professionals?<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>4</sup></b></span> <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).<br /><br />In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.</blockquote><br />Dr. Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0" target="_blank">forcefully argued</a> that Trump does not meet criteria for NPD, because he is not distressed by his behavior:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Mr. Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has  been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity,  self-absorption and lack of empathy. It is a stigmatizing insult to the  mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped  with Mr. Trump (who is neither).</blockquote><br /><b>Discourse Analysis</b><br /><br />Here I'll suggest a different approach: can we quantify age-related neurological change using spontaneous speech?<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This is probably my favorite part so far <a href="https://t.co/n61y5I8UrN">pic.twitter.com/n61y5I8UrN</a></div>— Rachel Riederer (@readerer) <a href="https://twitter.com/readerer/status/832303185826033664">February 16, 2017</a></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“You know what uranium is, right?  It's this <span style="color: red;"><b>thing</b></span> called nuclear weapons  and other <span style="color: red;"><b>things</b></span>.  <span style="color: red;"><b>Like</b></span>, lots of <span style="color: red;"><b>things</b></span> are <span style="color: red;"><b>done</b></span> with uranium,  including some bad <span style="color: red;"><b>things</b></span>.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't <span style="color: red;"><b>do</b></span> <span style="color: red;"><b> anything</b></span> for Russia.  I've <span style="color: red;"><b>done</b></span> <b><span style="color: red;">nothing</span></b> for Russia.”</blockquote><br />This is the most egregious example in the one hour, 17 minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct0H_ndjavM" target="_blank">train wreck</a>. But there are other signs. He used the construction “very, very” 20 times. The word “thing” (and its variants) was uttered 102 times.<br /><br /><b>Am I going to diagnose him with anything? Of course not. That's unethical!</b> But I will say that since Mr. Trump has been a public figure for nearly 40 years, we can objectively analyze his spontaneous speech and quantify any changes over time. I must emphasize that there is no magical scale to use for classification or comparison purposes (at least not yet). We don't know what's normal age-related decline and what's pathological.<br /><br />I suggest that the best corpus of spontaneous speech data is the collection of Trump interviews/conversations with David Letterman. I believe they're unscripted, and there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-mWCMiytLi0RV53IHrGXA/search?query=donald+trump" target="_blank">many</a> of them on YouTube (I've linked to eight below).

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/29/how-ketamine-acts-on-the-brain/">How Ketamine Acts on the Brain</a></h4>

<p>Ketamine is a medication mainly used for starting and maintaining anesthesia although it has also been used to provide rapid relief of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/02/electroshock-therapy-for-mental-illness-it-depends-on-your-genes/">treatment resistant depression</a>. </p>
<p>The ability to rapidly stabilize severely depressed patients has been demonstrated in several studies and has led researchers to search for the exact mechanism by which ketamine works.</p>
<p>The effort is important as ketamine is sometimes illicitly used for its <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/05/psychedelic-assisted-therapy-the-mental-health-trip-of-the-future/">psychedelic properties</a> and could also impede memory and other brain functions.</p>
<p>The multiple actions of ketamine has spurred scientists to identify new drugs that would safely replicate its <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/07/is-placebo-more-powerful-than-antidepressants-and-psychotherapy/">antidepressant</a> response without the unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>Now, emerging research from University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center scientists has identified a key protein that helps trigger ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects in the brain. This is a crucial step to developing alternative treatments to the controversial drug being dispensed in a growing number of clinics across the country.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute have now answered a question vital to guiding future research: What proteins in the brain does ketamine target to achieve its effects?</p>
<p>As Dr. Lisa Monteggia, Professor of Neuroscience at UT Southwestern’s O’Donnell Brain Institute states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that we have a target in place, we can study the pathway and develop drugs that safely induce the antidepressant effect.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study published in <em>Nature</em> shows that ketamine blocks a protein responsible for a range of normal brain functions. The blocking of the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/03/rna-storage-in-neurons-contributes-to-brain-plasticity/">N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor</a> creates the initial antidepressant reaction, and a metabolite of ketamine is responsible for extending the duration of the effect.</p>
<p>The blocking of the receptor also induces many of ketamine’s <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/08/04/hallucinations-vs-delusions-whats-the-difference/">hallucinogenic</a> responses. The drug—used for decades as an anesthetic—can distort the senses and impair coordination.</p>
<p>But if taken with proper medical care, ketamine may help severely depressed or <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/06/recent-drug-warnings-about-suicide/">suicidal</a> patients in need of a quick, effective treatment, Dr. Monteggia said.</p>
<p>Studies have shown ketamine can stabilize patients within a couple of hours, compared to other antidepressants that often take a few weeks to produce a response—if a response is induced at all.</p>
<p>As explained by Dr. Monteggia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Patients are demanding ketamine, and they are willing to take the risk of potential side effects just to feel better. This demand is overriding all the questions we still have about ketamine. How often can you have an infusion? How long can it last? There are a lot of aspects regarding how ketamine acts that are still unclear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Researchers will work to answer these questions as they plan two clinical trials with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/28/ketamine-more-than-a-recreational-drug/">ketamine</a>, including an effort to administer the drug through a nasal spray as opposed to intravenous infusions.</p>
<p>The results of these trials will have major implications for the millions of depressed patients seeking help, in particular those who have yet to find a medication that works.</p>
<p>A major national study UT Southwestern led more than a decade ago (<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/12/24/major-depression-in-the-real-world-the-stard-trial/">STAR*D</a>) yielded insight into the prevalence of the problem: Up to a third of depressed patients don’t improve upon taking their first medication, and about 40% of people who start taking antidepressants stop taking them within three months.</p>
<p>Ketamine, due to the potential side effects, is mainly being explored as a treatment only after other antidepressants have failed. But for patients on the brink of giving up, waiting weeks to months to find the right <a href="http://psychcentral.com/psychotherapy/">therapy</a> may not be an option.</p>
<p>Dr. Monteggia touches on expected future developments, where:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ketamine opens the door to understanding how to achieve rapid action and to stabilize people quickly. Because the (NMDA) receptor that is the target of ketamine is not involved in how other classical serotonin-based antidepressants work, our study opens up a new avenue of drug discovery.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am an Associate Dean (Postgraduate) and Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences  at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<h3><strong>What type of research are you involved in?</strong></h3>
<p>I’m mostly involved in regenerative medicine involving stem cells and cell reprogramming for ocular disorders</p>
<p><strong>Why did you become interested in this area of research?</strong></p>
<p>Originally I worked in Parasitology but became interested in vision research and Ophthalmology when I moved to New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>How did you become interested in photography?</strong></p>
<p>I have always been interested in photography but only as an enthusiastic amateur.  When you work in biological research you do a lot of imaging and when I did my Ph.D. we had to do a lot of our own developing and printing in the darkroom.</p>
<h3><strong>Where and how was this photo taken?</strong></h3>
<p>This image was taken on the Otago peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand with just an everyday point and shoot digital camera.</p>
<h3><strong>Why were you there at the time?</strong></h3>
<p>I was on holiday with my family.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain a bit more about the image?</strong></p>
<p>We were walking past a dishevelled boat house early in the morning and I was struck at just how many oyster catchers were congregated on the one roof.</p>
<p><strong>What about this scene particularly interested you?</strong></p>
<p>The fact that there were only oyster catchers and I had only ever seen them in pairs before, this meant that I had to stop and take the photo.</p>

<p>Around the world, neuroscience evidence is being introduced into courtrooms at an increasing rate, including findings from behavioural genetics. Specifically, some legal teams for the defence have been allowed to argue that the defendant has a low activity version of the MAOA gene, which codes for an enzyme that regulates the levels of several neurotransmitters. In combination with experiencing child abuse or maltreatment, having this low activity gene has been linked with increased impulsivity, including aggression. Defense lawyers presumably hope that jurors will interpret this as meaning the defendant was less culpable for their violent crime. However, before now, little research has examined how jurors will treat this evidence.</p>
<p>For a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881042">new study</a> in <em>Behavioral Sciences and the Law</em>, Natalie Gordon and Edie Greene presented 600 mock jurors (half were students, half were from the wider community) with a detailed trial summary based on a real US murder trial in which the defendant, already in jail for an earlier crime, had murdered his cell-mate. The jurors’ task was to decide whether he should face the death penalty.</p>
<p><span id="more-30595"></span></p>
<p>The jurors were presented with different versions of the trial – for example, some read that a medical geneticist had described the gene-environment interaction (that the defendant had the low activity MAOA gene and had suffered maltreatment as a child, which can lead to increased impulsivity); others read only about genetic evidence; others only heard about the environmental factor (maltreated as a child). The jurors also read about evidence from a clinical psychologist about whether the defendant was high or low risk for being dangerously violent in the future.</p>
<p>Overall the results suggested that “evidence of a genetic x environment interaction did little to reduce the likelihood of a death sentence”, the researchers said.</p>
<p>The clinical psychologists’ evidence was the most powerful mitigating factor. When the psychologist said the defendant was low risk, the jurors were less likely to choose the death penalty regardless of what other evidence they heard about genes, childhood, or the interaction between the two. Preference for death penalty (at 13 per cent) was lowest among jurors who heard the defendant was low risk and who heard the gene-environment evidence.</p>
<p>When the defendant was classified as high risk, the gene-environment interaction evidence didn’t have much of a mitigating impact – a similar proportion of jurors still proposed the death penalty compared with those who heard only about his maltreatment as a child (30 per cent vs. 34 per cent). Meanwhile, genetic evidence on its own actually led to more recommendations for the death penalty (41 per cent when he was high risk; 35 per cent when low risk).</p>
<p>“While the defence might continue to use [gene-environment evidence] – wishfully according to our data – to argue that genetic and environmental factors interact to impair a defendant’s ability to control behavior, the prosecution could argue that these same factors show that the defendant has a stable, criminal disposition and poses an ongoing threat to society,” the researchers concluded. “If presented by the prosecution in this way, evidence of a G x E interaction could result in an increased likelihood of a death sentence.”</p>

A report that nerve stimulation was able to partially restore consciousness in a patient in a vegetative state has attracted a great deal of attention this week.



The paper, published in Current Biology from French researchers Martina Corazzol and colleagues, is certainly promising, but I didn't find it entirely convincing.



Corazzol et al.'s patient was a 35-year old man who had been in a vegetative state for 15 years following a car accident. After receiving consent from his family
