<p><i>You can have £10 today or £12 next week. Which do you go for?</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Being able to forego a reward now in favour of gaining something better later is known to be important in determining all kinds of desirable outcomes in life, including greater educational attainment, social functioning and health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, choosing to delay gratification won’t <i>always</i> be the best option. If you’re in desperate circumstances – you badly need money to buy food, for example – taking the £10 today could be sensible. But this isn’t necessarily an entirely conscious judgment – there may be biological systems that automatically shift your decision-making priorities according to what is most likely to enhance your survival. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41437-1.epdf">new open-access study</a> published in <i>Scientific Reports</i> provides evidence that having raised levels of inflammation in your body, which is generally caused by the immune system’s response to infection or injury, can skew your judgment to focus more on present rewards, and on instant gratification. If further research backs this up, there could be wide-ranging implications not only for understanding why some people are more impulsive than others, but even for treating substance abuse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36967"></span></p>
<p>Jeffrey Gassen and colleagues at the Texas Christian University, US, reasoned that inflammation should enhance a person’s desire for immediately available resources, as the body’s response to sickness requires extra energy, and, for a sick person, their future is less certain. To explore whether this is actually the case, they recruited 159 healthy, non-obese, young college students who abstained from behaviours that can cause an acute increase in inflammation, such as smoking, exercise, sex and drinking alcohol, for two days prior to the study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants completed a widely-used impulsiveness scale, an instant gratification inventory, as well as two behavioural assessments – one of which explored their preferences for smaller and immediate vs. larger, delayed rewards. The participants also reported their body mass index, physical activity levels, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep quality, stress and other variables (all of which relate to having a greater focus on the present, to inflammation levels, or both).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants then gave blood samples, which were checked for levels of three pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins that indicate greater inflammation). The researchers found that participants with higher levels of inflammation also tended to have a style of decision-making characterised by impulsivity, a focus on the present, and an inability to delay gratification.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This analysis alone of course cannot indicate the direction of the relationship. Might it rather be the case that harmful, present-focused behaviours were driving higher levels of inflammation? The researchers explored this possibility by looking to see whether particular behaviours – usual levels of smoking, alcohol intake and risky sexual behaviours, for instance – predicted greater inflammation. But none did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This might sound surprising (as smoking, for example, has been clearly associated with inflammation in past studies). But these participants were chosen on purpose to be healthy and young. They were also instructed to avoid such behaviours for 48 hours prior to the study, in theory to make it easier to isolate any effects of inflammation on decision-making.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All in all, “these results suggest that the activities of the immune system may play an important role in shaping decision-making preferences,” Gassen and his colleagues write. In doing so, they add “…to the growing body of research demonstrating that the internal, physiological condition of the body plays an important role in modulating decision-making and behaviour.”</p>
<p>If further experimental work can firm up this link, there could be “exciting new possibilities” for treating substance abuse disorders, the researchers suggest, and there could be implications for people who have experienced early life stress, who are known to be more prone to inflammation. Drug-based or behavioural interventions targeted at reducing circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines might possibly “sever the link between an individual’s propensity to inflammation and undesirable behaviours, improving outcomes for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers themselves point out, clearly a lot more work has to be done. But as they also note, this study was on healthy young people, with relatively low levels of inflammation. People with chronic illness or obesity have persistently high levels and the activity of their immune system may then have an even greater effect on the way that they behave and even think.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/tick-2371827_640-620x342-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The incidence of Lyme disease, caused by tick-borne <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> bacteria, has now reached epidemic proportions in the US. There are an estimated 400,000 cases per year, with numbers rising due to climate change and habitat expansion of the tick vector. Early symptoms include skin rash, fever, and joint pain. With timely diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most patients recover.</p>
<p>However, treatment fails in at least <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430045/">10-20% of patients</a>, who develop persistent symptoms including chronic pain, cognitive dysfunction, and debilitating fatigue. This is known as post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD). These symptoms are often severe, frequently leading to profound personal, educational, and monetary losses.</p>
<blockquote><p>Using six sets of assumptions we estimate that by 2020 there will be between 81,713 to 1,944,189 individuals with PTLD in the US.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until now, estimates of the number of people in the US living with PTLD were not available. This manuscript provides the framework for a mathematical modeling technique that can be used to estimate the prevalence of PTLD in the US. We apply our technique to three incidence scenarios and two failure rates to estimate the cumulative prevalence of PTLD in the years 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>Using six sets of assumptions we estimate that by 2020 there will be between 81,713 to 1,944,189 individuals with PTLD in the US. The 95% confidence intervals suggest that incident rates could even reach as high as 2.3 million cases. All results indicate the prevalence of PTLD is rising over time. The approach we present provides a framework for updating prevalence estimates in future years and when more precise input data become available.</p>
<p>Our PTLD estimates are calculated using mathematical modeling and simulation, counting survivors of cases originating from 1980 until two index dates, 2016 and 2020. This framework incorporates multiple data types from several sources. We first propose three possible trajectories for the annual incidence of Lyme disease, and model the growth of the epidemic during the years the disease has been documented in the US. These trajectories were based on previously published information about Lyme disease incidence rates, originating from two sources.</p>
<p>One source was based on public health surveillance, when medical clinicians report Lyme disease cases to local and state health authorities. This method estimated 34,449 cases per year by 2005. The second source was obtained by US CDC epidemiologists and was based on studies of either Lyme disease testing lab results or health insurance claims. These sources calculated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26291194">more than 300,000 incident cases per year</a> by 2005.</p>
<p>The disparity between these two numbers indicates vast under-reporting by health authorities, is consistent with community-based reports that suggest large numbers of cases, and exemplifies shortfalls in the current Lyme disease knowledge base. It is possible that actual incidence rates are much higher.</p>
<p>Based on these two figures of annual incidence, we modeled three scenarios of growth of the Lyme disease epidemic: linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 34,449 by 2005, then remaining stable at 34,449 thereafter (Scenario A in Figure 1); linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 329,000 by 2005, then remaining stable at 329,000 thereafter (Scenario B); or linear growth from 0 cases in 1980 to 329,000 by 2005 and continued linear growth onward (Scenario C).</p>

Circles represent the mean under three Lyme incidence patterns (see text) and failure rates of 10 and 20%. The vertical bars represent 95% coverage intervals about the means.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The second important input measure in calculating cumulative PTLD cases was a treatment failure rate, which has been estimated at up to 40% of cases in some studies. We chose to more narrowly define this as either 10% or 20%. These two failure rates, combined with three incidence scenarios, resulted in six mathematical simulations.</p>
<p>All simulations accounted for age and gender distributions of Lyme disease diagnosis, as well as life expectancy. For example, if a five-year-old girl diagnosed in 1983 with Lyme disease was among the 10-20% with PTLD, she might still be alive and counted in 2020. However, a 55-year old man diagnosed at the same time might not be.</p>
<p>Our prevalence estimates reveal there are likely millions of people struggling with chronic illness and disability due to the effects of Lyme disease. In addition, they and their families are impacted financially, because they are often unable to work or complete educations, and are forced to bear the medical costs themselves.</p>
<p>Treating acute Lyme disease alone has been estimated to cost <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2015/lyme-disease-costs-more-than-one-billion-dollars-per-year-to-treat-study-finds.html">over $1 billion per year</a> in the US. The costs of treating this chronic disease have not been determined, but are expected to be high. Our study is a first step toward more understanding of the burden of PTLD, and reinforces the need for greatly expanding research that will lead to better treatment of these patients.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>What is the problem with informal sector abortions?</strong></h3>
<p>Despite abortion being legal in many countries, women in both high- and low-income countries commonly seek to terminate unwanted pregnancies outside of the formal healthcare system. Informal sector abortions (ISAs) are not inherently unsafe, particularly when performed by a skilled healthcare provider using safe drugs. However, when clinical guidelines are not followed, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521693414001059" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the procedure carries a high risk of complications</a> such as hemorrhage, renal failure, infertility, trauma to internal organs, and, in some cases, death. As a result, ISAs are an important contributor to the global burden of maternal mortality and morbidity.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we do?</strong></h3>
<p>In our recently published <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-019-0751-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">systematic review</a>, we looked at all the qualitative evidence published in English and French on the reasons why women may decide to seek ISAs where abortion is legal, in both high- and low-income settings. We found a total of 16 studies carried out between 1998 and 2018 in ten countries, including five in Sub-Saharan Africa along with Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Cambodia, and the United States. Thirteen of the studies recruited women who had undergone or attempted to undergo an ISA, while the others were based on the analysis of secondary data on the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we learn?</strong></h3>
<p>The studies we surveyed confirmed the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30380-4/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantitative evidence</a> that the practice of ISA is a widespread phenomenon. The medical risks associated with ISA were well known to the women involved, but fears over medical safety were outweighed by the reservations they had about abortions in formal health facilities.</p>
<p>Ten key reasons were identified for opting for informal sector abortion, ranging from privacy and attitude of healthcare staff, costs involved with formal abortions and timeliness of the procedure. Concerns over <em>privacy</em> in legal health facilities were listed as a key reason in thirteen of the studies. <em>Costs</em> associated with legal abortion services was an issue that came up in ten of the studies included. A <em>lack of knowledge of abortion laws</em> was frequently mentioned too, together with a widespread perception that abortion is not legal, even when it really is. Pregnant women’s <em>fears of mistreatment by staff</em> and <em>staff unwillingness to provide abortion or to make a referral</em> were mentioned as deterrents to seeking a legal abortion in some of the studies. A preference for <em>self-managed abortions at home</em> and <em>timeliness</em> of service were also cited in a few of the studies.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10982" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10982 size-medium" height="155" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/ISA-choice-300x155.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">from Chemlal and Russo, 2019</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>A key finding of this study is the existence of two pathways to seeking an informal sector abortion. In the first category, women first sought a legal abortion at a formal health facility and only turned to the informal sector when they were unable to proceed through the legal route.</p>
<p>The second trajectory involved women who directly sought an informal sector abortion for the above reasons, without first trying to obtain a legal service; for women in this pathway, ISA was regarded as the normal trajectory for seeking abortion. Formal sector abortion was the last resort after multiple, ineffective clandestine abortion attempts or for treatment after post-abortion complications.</p>
<p>Among the study participants, unsafe abortion was not spoken of solely in terms of medical and physical safety, but also in terms of social and economic security. Abortion facilities that did not protect women’s anonymity were deemed to be unsafe. This was mainly due to the fact that societal attitudes to abortion were largely negative and that severe repercussions, such as loss of livelihood and being shunned by their community, hold back women from openly seeking termination of unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h3>
<p>Preventing unsafe abortions requires a comprehensive understanding of all the drivers behind each stage of the decision-making process. These include the reasons for unwanted pregnancy, the initial decision to seek an abortion, the choice of provider and method, as well as post-abortion care seeking.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is potential to address informal sector abortions through education and information campaigns</p></blockquote>
<p>There has been a tendency for studies to focus almost exclusively on countries where abortion is prohibited, neglecting the issue of ISAs in countries where abortion is legal. Our review addresses this gap and identifies a number of issues with formal service providers that in some cases push women to obtain abortions through the informal sector, while highlighting that too little is known about this topic in North Africa, the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<h3><strong>What can we do with this information?</strong></h3>
<p>A number of areas for potential intervention have also been highlighted. For example, the influence of women’s social networks in shaping their abortion trajectories was an important point discussed in this review – this means there is potential to address ISAs through education and information campaigns in those communities.</p>
<p>The use of medical abortion pills for self-induction, as a harm reduction program, is another area of interest. When women are provided with information on recommended dosages and administration of the drug, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23228504" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evidence shows that self-induction using misoprostol can be safe</a>. Women’s preference for self-managed abortions for early stage pregnancies also lends credibility to recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20067668" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies on women’s views on the acceptability of home managed abortions</a>; governments should recognize this is rapidly becoming an option for unwanted pregnancies, and avoid driving the practice underground, where it can truly become dangerous.</p>

<p>We all know the powerful effect that music can have on mood. You might be feeling rather chirpy, but then a tear-jerker comes on the car radio and you arrive home feeling morose (conversely, of course, happy tunes can lift our spirits). For most of us, these effects are not a big deal. But what if you are living with depression? Now the implications become more serious. And, according to a provocative <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615583295">study</a> published a few years ago, far from seeking out uplifting music, people diagnosed with depression are notably more inclined than healthy controls to choose to listen to sad music (and look at sad images). The controversial implication is that depressed people deliberately act in ways that are likely to maintain their low mood. Now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10869-001">study</a> in the journal <em>Emotion</em> has replicated this finding, but the researchers also present evidence suggesting depressed people are <em>not</em> seeking to maintain their negative feelings, but rather that they find sad music calming and even uplifting.</p>
<p>“The current study is the most definitive to date in probing depression-related preferences for sad music using different tasks, and the reasons for these preferences,” write the team at the University of South Florida, led by Sunkyung Yoon.</p>
<p><span id="more-36960"></span></p>
<p>The research involved 38 female undergrads diagnosed with depression and 38 non-depressed female undergrad controls. The first part of the study was a replication attempt using the same materials as the 2015 paper that found depressed people preferred sad music. The participants listened to 30-second excerpts of sad (“Adagio for Strings” by Samuel Barber” and “Rakavot” by Avi Balili), happy and neutral music, and stated which they would prefer to listen to again in the future. Successfully replicating the earlier research, Yoon and his team found that their depressed participants were more likely to choose the sad music clips.</p>
<p>However, unlike in that earlier research, Yoon’s team also asked their participants why they made the choices they did. The majority of the participants with depression who favoured sad music said that they did so because it was relaxing, calming or soothing.</p>
<p>The second part of the study used new music samples: 84 pairs of 10-second clips of instrumental film music, contrasting happy, sad, fear-inducing, neutral, and also high and low energy tracks. In each case the same participants as before indicated which music they’d prefer to listen to again later. They also heard all the samples again at the end and stated what effect they had on their emotions. The researchers found again that people with depression had a far greater preference than controls for sad, low-energy music (but not fear-inducing music). Critically, though, when they heard these clips again, they reported that they made them feel more happiness and less sadness, contradicting the provocative idea that depressed people are seeking to perpetuate their low mood.</p>
<p>This study is unable to speak to why depressed people find low-energy, sad music uplifting, although common sense suggests that if you are feeling down, then a fast-paced, happy clappy tune might be irritating and inappropriate, whereas a more soothing, serious tune could be comforting. Further clues come from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/15/why-do-people-like-listening-to-sad-music-when-theyre-feeling-down/">another recent study</a> that investigated why (non-depressed) people generally like listening to sad music when they’re feeling down – for instance, some participants said the sad music acted like a supportive friend.</p>
<p>The new research involved only a small sample of female undergrads, and it only looked at emotional effects over a short time frame. Yoon and his colleagues acknowledge more research is needed to find out why exactly depressed people favour sad music. For now though, the new findings suggest that this preference  “… may reflect a desire for calming emotional experience rather than a desire to augment sad feelings.”</p>

<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, there is an ongoing debate about the existence of differences between women’s and men’s brains, and the extent to which these might be linked to biological or to cultural factors. In this debate, a real game-changer of a study would involve the identification of clear-cut sex differences in foetal brains: that is, in brains that have not yet been exposed to all the different expectations and experiences that the world might offer. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929318301245">recent open-access study</a> published in <i>Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience</i> by Muriah Wheelock at the University of Washington and her colleagues, including senior researcher Moriah Thomason at New York University School of Medicine, claims to have done just that, hailed by the researchers themselves as “confirmation that sexual dimorphism in functional brain systems emerges during human gestation” and in various ways by the popular press as, for example, <i>The Times of London’s</i> headline: “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/proof-at-last-women-and-men-are-born-to-be-different-33k2lvtn5?shareToken=2a2976e6335802e0b61b2f0f86e0092f">Proof at last: women and men are born to be different</a>”.</p>
<p>Does this study live up to the claims made by its authors and, more excitedly, those passing the message on? I think not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36954"></span></p>
<p>The study is certainly heroic in methodological terms, comprising a challenging recruitment and scanning strategy to capture “resting state” data (brain activity during rest rather than during an active task) from over 100 prenatal participants. As well as not having direct access to their participants, the experimenters had to devise extraordinarily complex ways of controlling for their movement – a challenge for any brain scan study, but particularly those hoping to measure connectivity. This involved the researchers identifying the “stillest” periods in each 12-24 minute foetal resting state scan, and then performing subsequent re-alignment and readjustments (or, effectively, cutting and pasting of each of lowest movement epochs together for analysis). We are told that 40 per cent of the acquired data had to be discarded in this process (something that should be borne in mind in assessing the validity and reliability of the data).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Having identified 197 regions of interest (ROIs) in these foetal brain images, the researchers looked at how the activity in each region was correlated with the activity in all the others (a stronger correlation is taken as a sign of greater connectivity), resulting in an analysis of 19,306 connections or pairings between regions. The researchers then used an innovative method to identify significant clusterings in the data, to see if there were any networks or “hubs” of connectivity. It should be noted that the correlations were calculated separately for the males and females and that an uncorrected p-threshold of 0.05 was applied to the resulting correlations, both rather questionable statistical practices when working with data sets such as these.</p>
<p>Early versions of the overall methodological approach used here have previously been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929314000644?via=ihub">reported by the same research team </a>, providing fascinating insights into the formation of neural connectivity systems in utero and how these change with gestational age. The basis for the current paper is a much bigger data set than they used previously, which could have continued to develop these insights. Sadly, and rather inexplicably, their focus here is on differences in connectivity between female and male foetuses. This is unfortunate, not because identifying prenatal sex differences in the brain is not a crucial process in this debate, but because this data set just does not lend itself to this kind of “hunt-the-difference” agenda.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One problem is that, of the 118 participants whose data survived all of the necessary exclusion criteria, 48 were female and 70 were male. This imbalance, together with the skewed distribution of several other demographic factors, such as gestational age when the scans took place, meant that the researchers had to use what are known as “nonparametric statistics” for many of their comparisons. This form of analysis, as well as lacking power, precludes the kind of multivariate analysis which would have allowed the researchers to consider multiple factors at once. For example, there was no way of <i>simultaneously</i> testing the relative contributions of differences in gestational age and differences in foetal sex to different types of network pairs (connections between different brain regions). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A related problem is the wide age range of the participants: from 25 weeks to 39 gestational weeks. That 14 week period covers a time of dramatic cortical development, especially the formation of cortical networks – a 25 week-old brain will be very different from a 39 week-old one. Although the researchers treated gestational age as a continuous variable, there is a query as to the comparability of the male and female groups with respect to this measure. In the age window 36-40 weeks (very near full-term), there were 35 males compared with only 17 females. Even with appropriate statistical controls, this could well have skewed the findings.</p>
<p>Related to this, there are concerns about the “normalisation” process carried out on each scan. This allows group analysis of images from different participants by “warping” them to a standard template so that locations on each image “line up” for comparison. What to select for a standard template is a tricky question for relatively comparable adult scans; here the researchers selected a 32-week foetal brain template, which could well have been inappropriate for <i>any</i> of the individual scans they were processing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><b>False impressions:</b></p>
<p>It is also important to note what was NOT reported in this study. The researchers’ focus was almost entirely on the sex <i>differences</i> they found, with little comment on evidence of the <i>sex similarities</i>. In one of their figures, for example, the researchers illustrate 136 possible sex by connectivity comparisons, of which only 3 showed a statistically significant difference between the sexes. And remember that, overall, there were connections between over 19,000 possible regions to consider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers use the term “sexual dimorphism” or “dimorphism” more than half a dozen times, including in that powerful statement from their abstract that I quoted at the start of my blog post. But their data do NOT demonstrate a dimorphic state – as well as the much greater incidence of <i>no</i> differences between the groups, we have no way of assessing just how different (or not) the connectivity pathways were. As so many of the sex-linked comparisons were based merely on contrasting the number of significant correlations between brain regions for males and females – for instance, one of the figures in the paper shows significant connectivity between 5 pairs of brain networks in female foetuses, as opposed to significant connectivity between 2 different brain networks in males – we have no idea of the effect size (the practical meaning) of any differences, nor the extent of overlap between the two groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Any studies focussing on sex differences in the brain have the potential to help explain gender gaps, not only in behaviour, personality and preferences, but also in differences in the occurrence of physical and mental health problems. Studies such as this could be invaluable for understanding the typical and atypical developmental trajectories which may lead to such gaps. But, equally, studies such as this can contribute to stereotypical essentialist beliefs that there are innate, fixed and inevitable sex differences in the brain (and therefore in behaviour and preferences). This can have significant downstream consequences for how society comes to understand, explain and even sustain these very gender gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data in this study offer an exciting and innovative look at the development of functional brain networks in the human brain, using complex and revelatory analyses. They do <b><i>not </i></b>offer confirmation of sexual dimorphism in human brain networks in utero and the authors of the study should not, I believe, be making this claim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/general/palm-beach-county-students-compete-in-max-planck-floridas-brain-bee-challenge/">Palm Beach County Students Compete in Max Planck Florida’s Brain Bee Challenge</a></h4>

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) held its 8<sup>th</sup> annual Brain Bee Challenge Saturday April 6, 2019. Nervous excitement filled the room as 57 Palm Beach County students readied themselves for a thrilling competition that would show which team knew the most about the brain. But the excitement was quickly replaced by confusion, when the first question was read: “What part of the brain is necessary for a Zombie to walk?”</p>
<p>Wait…<em>Zombies?</em></p>
<p>While the first question was an ice breaker and a joke, the rest of the competition was no laughing matter as students in teams of three answered questions about <span>learning and memory, emotion, sensation, movement, aging, neurobiology, brain anatomy and neural disorders. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>In the end, two teams from FAU Henderson High School took the top two spots, with a third-place team coming from American Heritage School of Boca and Delray.</p>
<p>“We are so impressed with the number of young students in our community who are passionate about science and understanding the brain,” said Dr. Ilaria Drago, MPFI Education Outreach Coordinator. “Brain Bee is one of our signature events that we hold each year to raise awareness of the field of neuroscience and to help inspire the next generation of scientists.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Brain Bee Challenge also featured another competition as students, teachers, and parents tuned into a live webcast of the event hosted by the hosts of Max Planck Florida’s Neurotransmissions Podcast, Misha Smirnov and Joe Schumacher. The school with the most online participation won a 3D printer, courtesy of the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund. More than 245 people watched the competition online, with Jupiter High School making up 60% of the online audience and winning the 3D printer.</p>

Not really.

The source of the scan isn't clear but I'm 99% sure that the image was taken at one of Dr Daniel Amen's controversial clinics. Amen uses similar graphics in his brain scans.

In this case, the paper reports a trial of teaching additional skills to family physicians. The aim of these additional skills was to support people who were currently not working because of poor health to return to work.  We know that, in general, being in work is good for well-being (and wealth), so helping people return to work is a worthwhile aim. We also know that family physicians play a role in maintaining patients’ sickness absence, either directly through certification or indirectly by the advice they give for self-management. It is therefore plausible that an educational intervention for family physicians should have an effect. However, the trial found none.</p>
<h3><strong>So what went wrong?</strong></h3>
<p>The study was certainly well-designed: it was a cluster randomized trial (280 patients from 26 practices) and it was conducted thoroughly. The investigators recognized that the trial might not be big enough to see a difference in hard outcomes like time off work, so they also used an intermediate outcome measure that was closer to the intervention. Specifically, they used a work-related measure of self-efficacy that correlates well with actual return to work. This meant their findings should have been less susceptible to individuals’ circumstances, such as their personal and occupational situation. But there was no effect on either outcome.  And perhaps that’s not surprising, because previous studies suggested that <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/72/7/467.long" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patient factors affected sickness certification</a> more than practitioner factors and that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10926-005-9003-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collaboration between general practitioner and occupational physician</a> showed no effect.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this study tell us?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Papers like this give us the opportunity to share knowledge between healthcare systems of what doesn’t work, which is just as important as sharing knowledge of what does.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suggest that this study teaches us two things. First, it reminds us we need to focus less on “complex interventions” and more on the “complex systems” within which these interventions happen. In their discussion, the authors fall into the trap of thinking “if only we had a better intervention” and suggest that better-tailored interventions might work. This is an appropriate way of thinking about relatively simple interventions – “if only we knew which drug to use for which patient…”, but with complex interventions it may be missing the point.</p>
<p>That is because complex interventions are mostly <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031912-114421" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interventions in complex systems</a> not just in isolated individuals. And complex systems, such as patients’ networks of health, illness, home and work, have the property of absorbing (or buffering) most things which might change them. This doesn’t happen all the time, and indeed sometimes complex systems change dramatically in response to single inputs, but usually they just absorb them. The result is that well-designed complex interventions <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034222" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frequently fail to show</a> the neat, statistically significant effect that we expect. That is not because they are bad interventions, but because they are trying to change one aspect of something (or someone) in a much more complex network of things or people. And the effect of that complex network, or system, is usually to absorb the single change.</p>
<p>The second thing this study reminds us is that we need to share, internationally, what works and what doesn’t work in family medicine. Politicians, commentators and think-tanks across the world will keep coming up with ideas for making things better through family medicine. Not all of these ideas will be as smart as they first seem, and many will repeat the mistaken assumptions of earlier initiatives elsewhere. Papers like this give us the opportunity to share knowledge between healthcare systems of what doesn’t work, which is just as important as sharing knowledge of what does.</p>

<p>So entrenched is the association in our culture between coffee and ideas of arousal, ambition and focus that merely thinking about, or being reminded of, the drink is enough to increase the body’s arousal levels, in turn provoking a more focused, literal cognitive style. That’s according to Eugene Chan at Monash University and Sam Maglio at the University of Toronto Scarborough who, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810018303350?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">reporting their findings in <em>Consciousness and Cognition</em></a>, write that “… people may be more aroused simply after walking by a coffee shop. Not only would they be more aroused, but at a more downstream level, their decision making might shift as well.”</p>
<p>The intriguing results come from four studies involving hundreds of online and lab-based participants, but given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/02/now-john-barghs-famous-hot-coffee-study-has-failed-to-replicate/">replication problems</a> in the general area of “social priming” (concerned with how abstract ideas and sensory experiences can influence thoughts and behaviour, and vice versa), some readers may find that merely hearing about this new research is enough to elevate their pulse and alter their mindset to a more sceptical mode.</p>
<p><span id="more-36914"></span></p>
<p>The four studies followed a similar pattern and no drinks were actually ingested. They started with participants being cued to think about either coffee or tea. In one study, they had to come up with advertising slogans for coffee or tea (depending on which group they were allocated to); in the other studies, they read either a mocked-up health news story about the benefits of drinking coffee or a version pertaining to tea. These reminders were then followed by a measure of the participants’ physiological arousal levels, either self-reported (they rated how alert, energetic and excited they were feeling) or based on their heart-rate. And finally, the participants completed a measure of their construal level – essentially how much they were thinking in a focused or literal way, or more abstractly. This final measure mostly took the form of categorising activities, such as deciding whether “making a list” is an example of “getting organised” (more abstract) or “writing things down” (more literal).</p>
<p>Overall, the results showed that thinking about and being reminded of coffee increased participants’ physiological arousal levels (whether self-reported or based on heart-rate), compared with thinking about and being reminded of tea, and in turn this greater arousal prompted a more literal, focused thinking style – that is, a lower, more concrete construal level.</p>
<p>One of the studies showed that this arousing, cognition-altering effect of coffee reminders only played out for Western participants, not for participants from Eastern countries (recent immigrants to Canada and America from China, Japan and Korea) where coffee is less popular and does not have the same connotations related to energy, focus and ambition.</p>
<p>Another study showed that the cognition-altering effect of coffee reminders was enhanced by watching an exciting clip from the <em>Fast and Furious</em> movie and nullified by a clip from the less exciting <em>House of Rock</em>, which the researchers said bolstered the idea that the effect of the coffee reminders on thinking style was acting via the changes it induced in arousal.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that they were agnostic on whether these apparent effects of coffee reminders are advantageous or not – presumably it would depend on the circumstances. They called for more research to explore the implications of their findings, concluding that “our research adds to the literature documenting that the foods we eat and the beverages we drink do more than simply providing nutrition or pleasure. Mere exposure to or reminders of them can affect how we think.”</p>
<p>Readers might understandably question the practical significance of the effects documented here (for some perspective, the average heart rate for the coffee group was 76 beats per minute, compared with 70 beats per minute for the tea group), and will probably want to see the findings replicated before reading too much into them. Another issue was that there was no baseline condition, rather the coffee reminders were always compared to tea reminders. Therefore one could arguably interpret the results as showing that reminders of tea reduce arousal and induce a more abstract thinking style, rather than that coffee increases arousal and induces a concrete thinking style. Chan and Maglio acknowledged the need for follow-up research, writing “we await further work to replicate our basic effects, providing practitioners and researchers further credence in the validity and reliability of the findings.”</p>

<p>We often think of sleep as a chance to switch off from the outside world, leaving us blissfully ignorant of anything going on around us. But neuroscience research has shown this is a fantasy – we still monitor the environment and respond to particular sounds while we’re sleeping (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/17/eyes-shut-mind-open-what-your-brain-pays-attention-to-while-youre-sleeping/">at least in some stages of sleep</a>) – a fact that will be unsurprising to anyone who has woken up after hearing someone say their name.</p>
<p>Now a study published in <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i> has revealed more about the brain’s surprisingly sophisticated levels of engagement with the outside world during sleep. Not only does the sleeping brain respond to certain words or sounds – <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0502-5?WT.feed_name=subjects_cognitive-neuroscience">it can even select between competing signals</a>, prioritising the one that is more informative.</p>
<p><span id="more-36908"></span></p>
<p>For obvious reasons it’s a challenge for researchers to figure out what people are paying attention to while they’re asleep. Guillaume Legendre at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris and his colleagues overcame this problem by looking at the changing patterns of their volunteers’ brainwaves using EEG (electroencephalography, which uses scalp electrodes to record the brain’s electrical activity).</p>
<p>The team recruited 24 French participants to complete a series of listening tasks while awake and asleep. In the initial part of the experiment, the team recorded the participants’ EEG signal while they listened to one-minute-long excerpts of speech. Some of these excerpts were taken from real news reports, stories, movies, and Wikipedia entries. Others were from passages of so-called “Jabberwocky” text, which had normal sentence structure but with content that was gibberish (as in Lewis Carroll’s nonsense poem of the same name: “’Twas brillig and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe..”).</p>
<p>The team then trained a computer algorithm to learn how the participants’ brainwaves varied according to the audio they’d heard. After this training, the researchers could present the algorithm with a participant’s brainwave recording and it could reconstruct the audio signal that they’d been listening to at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, to see how the brain responded to two competing inputs, the researchers analysed the EEG brainwave data when participants heard both the real and nonsense texts simultaneously, one playing in each ear (this started while they were awake and were focused on the meaningful speech, and it continued after they fell asleep).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers’ computer algorithm was able to reconstruct both of the audio signals from the participants’ brainwaves, suggesting that they were processing both forms of speech even while asleep. And crucially, during both wakefulness and sleep, the reconstruction was better for the signal from the meaningful text than the nonsense text, suggesting that the brain had been “amplifying” the meaningful story in some way so that it left clearer traces in the EEG data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When participants were awake, 60.6 per cent of trials were reconstructed better for the meaningful text, while this number decreased to 52.4 per cent of sleep trials. But the smaller amplification effect during sleep was still significantly higher than the 50 per cent that would be expected by chance had the brain no longer been able to prioritise the meaningful speech.</p>
<p>Several factors appeared to influence whether or not the EEG signal for meaningful stories was amplified during sleep. Depth of sleep was important: meaningful stories were only amplified during light sleep (stage 2) but not deep sleep (stage 3). And the effect appeared only temporary, occurring during the first 30 seconds of a story, but not the last 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers write that their experiment provides evidence that people can selectively process meaningful or important information during sleep – a ninja-like ability which could have evolutionary advantages. “In an ever-changing environment, the ability to process relevant signals during light sleep offers substantial benefits,” they write. “In particular, it would allow signalling the presence of events, necessitating a rapid reversal towards wakefulness.”</p>
<p>That said, the bias towards processing the meaningful stories during sleep appeared very small, so it remains unclear how important it would be in a real-world environment. And because participants had been told to pay attention to the meaningful story, it may be that the amplification effect was driven “top-down” by their attention rather than by the meaningfulness of the stimulus <i>per se</i>. Nevertheless, the study makes it clear that the brain’s engagement with the outside world during sleep is far more complex than we often recognise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity trainings are big business. In the United States, </span><a href="http://time.com/5118035/diversity-training-infuriates-men-fails-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies spend about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.1 billion per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by one estimate, on programmes geared at making companies more inclusive and welcoming to members of often-underrepresented groups (British numbers aren’t easy to come by, but according to one </span><a href="https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/experts/research/businesses-expect-increase-investment-diversity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over a third of recruiters are planning to increase their investment in diversity initiatives).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, there’s little evidence-backed consensus about which sorts of diversity programmes work, and why, and there have been long-standing </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in some quarters that these programmes don’t do much at all, or that they could actually be harmful. In part because of this dearth of evidence, the market for pro-diversity interventions is a bit of a Wild West with regard to quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/26/1816076116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PNAS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a prominent team of researchers, including Katherine Milkman, Angela Duckworth, and Adam Grant of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, partnered with a large global organisation to measure the real-world impact of the researchers’ own anti-bias intervention, designed principally to “promote inclusive attitudes and behaviors toward women, whereas a secondary focus was to promote the inclusion of other underrepresented groups (e.g., racial minorities).” The results were mixed at best – and unfortunately there are good reasons to be sceptical that even the more positive results are as positive as they seem.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-36889"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company in question emailed 10,983 employees, inviting them to “complete a new inclusive leadership workplace training,” as the researchers sum it up. Out of those, 3,016 employees, 38.5 per cent of them American, answered the call and were assigned, in thirds, either to one of two online treatment groups or to a control group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the gender-bias and general-bias trainings,” write the researchers, “participants learned about the psychological processes that underlie stereotyping and research that shows how stereotyping can result in bias and inequity in the workplace, completed and received feedback on an Implicit Association Test assessing their associations between gender and career-oriented words, and learned about strategies to overcome stereotyping in the workplace.” There was little difference between the so-called gender-bias and general-bias trainings, except for minor points of emphasis, and the researchers ended up collapsing them into one training condition, comparing the results to those in a control group who received a “stylistically similar training, but [with a focus on] psychological safety and active listening rather than stereotyping.” On average, the bias training took 68 minutes to complete, and was evaluated on the basis of responses to an attitudes questionnaire and real-world behavioural data taken up to 20 weeks post-intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key chart summarising all the researchers’ findings is shown at the top of this post. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that immediately jumps out is that the top row, which deals with attitudes, shows more impressive results than the bottom row, which deals with actual behavior (though even the top-row results are modest in terms of the size of their effect). But in looking at the attitudinal measures the researchers used, critical readers might fairly wonder whether they’re really measuring what they are supposed to be measuring – i.e. support for women in the workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the “attitudinal support for women” score was drawn from levels of (dis)agreement with items like “Discrimination against women is no longer a problem” and “Society has reached the point where women and men have equal opportunities for achievement.” But arguably, whether an individual believes equality has already been accomplished is different from whether they believe that women should be fully supported in the workplace. Someone can believe that discrimination against women is no longer a problem but still believe they should be treated in exactly the same way as men. These questionnaire statements seem to be more geared at measuring </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">political liberalism or conservatism with regard to gender issues</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than misogynist attitudes directly. So the risk, then, is that the training successfully increases political liberalism (to a modest degree), but it’s not possible to tell from the questionnaire items whether it alters the kind of attitudes that are likely to more directly underlie discriminatory behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arguably, there is also a problem with the “gender-bias acknowledgment” result, which was based on those participants in the training group admitting (more than the control participants) to having gender biases more similar to the average person. This finding is complicated by the fact that the bias training involved taking the gender-bias Implicit Association Test (IAT). Setting aside the </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other well-documented problems with the IAT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the gender IAT, in particular, has produced some strange results. As this chart from FiveThirtyEight </span><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-unconscious-sexism-could-help-explain-trumps-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the normal “pattern” of IATs relating to minority or marginalised groups – in which conservatives (and members of majority groups) tend to score higher for implicit bias toward such groups than liberals (and members of minority groups) – is more or less reversed when it comes to the gender-bias IAT:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, results from the gender IAT suggest that women are more implicitly biased against women than men are, that this is the case at every point on the political spectrum, and that within many subgroups, political liberals are more biased against women than conservatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting aside these questionable patterns, a lot of people in the bias-training condition were likely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they were biased by their IAT result. So when they subsequently filled out a questionnaire asking them to gauge their level of anti-woman bias, were they simply echoing what a dubious test told them? It certainly seems like a possibility, and if so, should that count as an ethical, successful educational intervention? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the behavioral results (based on participants’ choices of who to mentor, which new hires to speak to, and colleagues’ excellence to recognise) were far less impressive than the attitudinal ones. A lot of the effects were clustered right around zero and/or differed greatly on the basis of sex or nationality (which isn’t a good sign for programmes that are designed to be delivered to large, diverse groups of employees). The biggest effect involved an email invitation, 14 weeks after follow-up, to talk on the phone with either a male or a female new hire. There was no overall effect, but among women only, those in the bias-training group were more likely, at a statistically significant level, than those in the control condition, to agree to talk to newly hired women than men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does all this leave us? It’s hard to say. The results definitely weren’t impressive, and the strongest came from questionable attitude measures and, potentially, participants’ responses to a controversial test of implicit bias. This outcome shouldn’t be too surprising: if you surveyed psychologists and asked them whether a single, 68-minute training could generate sizable behavioural effects weeks and months later, most would probably tell you no. Behaviour change is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, even the modest results seen here were for employees who volunteered to take part, rather than a random sample. Yet diversity trainings, at their best, will have a positive effect on the general population of a company or institution, not just those who express a desire to take part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, setting aside quibbles with this particular evaluation and programme, this study is laudable for showing exactly how diversity programmes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be evaluated: with an eye toward behavioural outcomes measured a significant period of time after the programme itself is delivered. Until there are more studies like this one, those who want to use diversity training to make companies and other institutions more welcoming have no option but to feel around in the dark for what works.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any regular at the gym, there’s a noticeable </span><a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/01/do-people-keep-new-years-resolution-fitness-weight-loss-data/579388/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">phenomenon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the beginning of the year: an influx of new members followed by a quick drop-off just a few weeks later. Exercising more is a perennially common New Year’s resolution, but it can be difficult to stick with. For older adults, regular exercise has multiple benefits, including helping to maintain muscle strength, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, and aiding the management of depression. But just as with those new gym members, older adults too face challenges starting and staying with an exercise routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this study, Reitlo et al. analyzed nearly 70,000 exercise logs from one year of the Generation 100 study, which examined the effects of exercise on mortality in older adults in Norway, over a five-year period. The participants were prescribed either two weekly sessions of moderate-intensity training (MCT) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and asked to log their exercise activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, walking was the most popular activity in both groups, followed by cycling, then combined endurance and resistance training. Exercising outdoors proved to be the most common setting for activity in both groups, even in the colder months, while exercising at home was the least common. Importantly, they found that the participants maintained their exercise routines regardless of the intensity, which can vary among different individual levels of fitness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers also noticed some differences between men and women. For example, women exercised with others more often than men, who completed more sessions alone. In the MCT group, men exercised outdoors more frequently than women, but in the HIIT group, the opposite was true. The researchers suggest that these differences should be taken into account to effectively design exercise programs for older adults. As the world’s older population continues to grow, it is essential to understand how to best promote physical activity and keep the aging population healthy. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0867-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>The effects of pet ownership on health in older adults</b></a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10965 alignright" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/walk-1385880__340-300x169.jpg" width="300" />It has been well-demonstrated that owning a pet, especially a dog, is associated with better health. The reasons for this effect are less well understood, and it has even been shown that pets have the opposite effect in older adults. Therefore, the authors of this study set out to measure the effect of pet ownership on particular aspects of health – specifically physical activity, sleep, mental health, and general physical health – in older adults.</p>
<p>Authors Mein and Grant used data from a large study of older adults in London to examine the associations between pet ownership and the factors above, as well as how these were influenced by neighborhood perceptions and social isolation. They found that pet owners had similar overall health to non-owners but had more social activities, less trouble falling asleep, and better perceptions of their neighborhoods. These associations were stronger in dog owners than other pet owners. While this does not definitively answer all of the open questions about how pet ownership influences (or is influenced by) health, it does suggest that walking around the neighborhood with a dog has a positive effect on health and well-being in older adults.</p>

<p>As populations around the world age, new challenges are faced in caring for older adults. One such challenge is understanding how age affects vulnerability to disease, falls, and other negative outcomes, and how this vulnerability varies between individuals of similar age. The concept of ‘frailty’ has been developed to describe and measure increased vulnerability among older adults. Identifying ‘frail’ individuals can allow for personalization of care to avoid changes or stressors that would affect them more negatively than a non-frail individual.</p>
<p>Numerous instruments have been developed to measure frailty in a variety of settings, each with its own advantages and limitations. Associate Editor Olga Theou and colleagues conducted this scoping review to explore the literature around frailty in emergency and hospital settings.</p>
<p>The found that most studies included in the review used the term ‘frail’ as a subjective description rather than as an objectively measured characteristic. However, in those studies that did use established frailty measures, they found that frailty was generally a good predictor of negative outcomes, including death and institutionalization. These results point to the need to further develop the concept of ‘frailty’ as an objectively measured characteristic, to measure it in acute care settings, and to use the knowledge to improve care for frail older adults.</p>
<p><b></b><b><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-018-0910-4">Should older adults stop driving? Who decides?</a></b></p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10964 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/04/vintage-car-1149230__340-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some countries, driving remains the most common form of transportation for older adults and can provide both independence and higher quality of life. However, driving can become more difficult as one ages, which causes older drivers to reduce the amount they drive or stop driving altogether. This process of driving cessation can happen for a number of reasons, from impaired vision or cognitive abilities to low income or advice from a family member. In this study by Piersma et al., 172 participants with cognitive impairment completed fitness-to-drive assessments, were given advice about their driving, then were asked seven months later if they followed that advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers found that most of the participants followed the recommendations given to either continue driving, take driving lessons, or cease driving.  In total, 104 (~60%) of the participants had continued to drive at the time of the follow-up; of these, 13 were given the initial recommendation to cease driving. The remaining 68 participants had stopped driving at follow-up and reported increases in cycling and use of public transportation, although the percentages of overall usage of alternate forms of transportation were actually lower than those of the current drivers at follow-up.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For participants who ceased driving, the most common reason was that they were following a recommendation, mostly from the driving fitness assessment, but many cited advice from a family member or authority figure. Cognitive impairment reduces one’s ability to drive safely, but drivers still can be reluctant to give up driving. The authors suggest that clinicians may want to consider referring patients with cognitive impairment to take a fitness-to-drive assessment, as the patient would be likely to heed the advice given. </span></p>

<p>For most of us, it is difficult to imagine what it must be like to be a synesthete – that is, someone who experiences a crossing over of their senses, such as seeing sounds as colours, or perceiving shapes as having tastes. However, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810018304410?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">new study</a> in <em>Conscientiousness and Cognition</em>, it is actually relatively easy for people with normal perception to have a synesthetic experience (of the sound-to-vision variety). It merely takes a few minutes of visual deprivation, followed by a visual imagery task. The findings are not merely intriguing – and a fun idea for a psychology class experiment – they also have a bearing on the main theories for how synesthesia occurs.</p>
<p><span id="more-36857"></span></p>
<p>Across three studies, involving dozens of non-synesthetic undergrad students, the University of Michigan psychologists Anupama Nair and David Brang asked their volunteers to sit with their eyes closed in a completely darkened room for five minutes. After this, the imagery task began, which was almost identical through the three studies: dozens of times the students heard one of four words followed by a letter, such as “symmetrical T” or “curve A”, and their job was to visualise the letter and judge whether it had the mentioned feature (so, in the previous examples, whether “T” is symmetrical and whether  “A” contains any curves). The other two feature words used in the task were “diagonal” and “closed”, referring to whether the letter had a diagonal line in it or an entirely enclosed feature.</p>
<p>The purpose of the darkness was to remove competing visual perceptions, while the idea of the imagery task was simply to raise the activity levels within the visual cortex (visual imagery is known to recruit brain areas that overlap with those involved in visual perception).</p>
<p>Another key element of the task was that the researchers played occasional, unpredictably timed beeps throughout the task, to see if these induced a visual experience in their participants. Meanwhile, for the duration of the task, the participants were asked to press a button to indicate any instance in which a sound prompted them to have a visual experience in the darkness. At debriefing later, they were asked to provide more details about any visual experiences they’d had.</p>
<p>Overall, across the three studies, nearly 60 per cent of the participants reported at least one instance of experiencing a sound-induced visual sensation in the darkness, including: “colorful small circles, amorphous blobs, scintillation [flash or sparkles of light], extrusion [like visual pulsing or eruptions], and movement”. These experiences were more common on trials of the task in which a beep occurred, although they were sometimes induced merely by the task words. Louder beeps more often induced visual experiences than quieter beeps, and usually the visual sensations were perceived as occurring on the same side of space as where the beep came from.</p>
<p>It’s well-established that there is a lot of cross-wiring and cross-talk between the senses even in non-synesthetes and Nair and Brang said their findings, showing how quickly and easily synesthetic experiences can be induced in people with normal perception, are more consistent with the “disinhibited-feedback model” of synesthesia, which “proposes that synesthesia emerges when the balance of activity across the senses has been altered to allow one sensory modality the ability to exert stronger modulatory effects onto another sensory modality”.</p>
<p>In contrast, the new findings are less consistent with the “cross-activation model”, which states that synesthesia emerges through the development, over many years, of atypical connections between sensory areas in people with the condition. The researchers acknowledge, however, that both mechanisms could contribute to the emergence of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>An obvious criticism of the findings is that the participants may have been saying what they thought the researchers wanted to hear – indeed, the researchers did tell them at the start that they might experience visual sensations during the task. However, Nair and Brang think it unlikely that their participants were fabricating their experiences, not least because of the systematic patterns in the results (such as the visual perceptions occurring more often for louder beeps, and on the same side of space as the beeps).</p>
<p>“Collectively, these results demonstrate that mild visual deprivation facilitates auditory-visual percepts,” the researchers concluded, “indicating a higher prevalence of synesthesia-like experiences in the general population and a novel method to study both the relationship between synesthesia and normal multi-sensory processes and the experience of visual hallucinations in clinical populations.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/04/09/should-i-or-should-i-not-the-tricky-business-about-healthcare-decision-making/">Should I, or should I not? The ‘tricky business’ about healthcare decision making</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Womens-Health-HERO-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We often put a lot of effort into making important decisions for our lives. We ponder things like: <em>“Should I apply for this new job?”</em>, <em>“Should I buy this car?”</em>, or maybe even <em>“Where should we go for our next holiday?” </em></p>
<p>We often spend lots of time gathering information on our options. We seek advice from loved ones, ‘sleep on it,’ and weigh up the pros and cons of each option to find out what is the right decision for us.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of us don’t put the same effort into making decisions regarding our healthcare.</p>
<p>Many patients can feel overwhelmed when presented with information by their healthcare provider. Some patients report that there was not enough or too much information or that the information given to them was just not applicable to their situation. All of a sudden, making a decision – something we do hundreds of times a day – becomes ‘tricky business.’<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10928 aligncenter" height="196" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/decision-making-300x196.png" width="300" /></p>
<h4><strong>The rise of shared decision making</strong></h4>
<p>More and more decisions in healthcare are becoming what researchers call ‘preference-sensitive.’ This means that there is no single best option from a medical point of view. Each option has different pros and cons which patients may value differently.</p>
<p>Thus, it has been argued that patients should be involved in decision making regarding their care, to the extent they desire. For example, the slogan “Nothing about me without me” has been on many activists’ lips. The catchphrase was adopted by participants from 29 countries at a 1998 Salzburg global seminar. The seminar aimed to develop ideas regarding how to improve the quality of healthcare by involving patients. Numerous initiatives have been founded globally to support this idea of shared decision making. Researchers, patient advocates, and policy makers all over the world have been trying for decades to improve patient involvement in healthcare decision making. Despite these efforts, researchers still argue about how to best help patients make decisions regarding their care.</p>
<h4><strong>Sandy has to make a difficult healthcare decision …</strong></h4>
<p>To picture this a bit better, I’d like to introduce to you Sandy. Sandy is 40 years old and has two children. Her mother died of ovarian cancer and her doctor told her that she has an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. She is offered to have her healthy ovaries removed to reduce her cancer risk.</p>
<p>Sandy fears her risk of ovarian cancer, as she knows that ovarian cancer is often detected at a late stage and survival rates are low. Her vivid memories of the way her mother suffered from this dreadful disease contribute to her fear of developing cancer herself.</p>
<blockquote><p>By increasing our understanding of why and how patients decide on their care, we can help patients manage the ‘tricky business’ of healthcare decision making.</p></blockquote>
<p>While having the surgery is likely to reduce her cancer risk, it does come with many side-effects – including surgical complications, such as bleeding or infections, and early menopause with its associated symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, risk of cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, or hip fracture.</p>
<p>Sandy also wonders whether she will still feel like a woman if she has her ovaries removed or whether her sexuality may be affected. She is concerned that the long-term effects of the surgery could impact her relationship and intimacy with her husband.</p>
<p>So, what to do? Sandy speaks to her doctor who gives her numerous facts and figures. However, she is the one who ultimately has to decide whether to undergo the surgery or not. She feels overwhelmed and wishes there was more support with making this decision that will ultimately affect her life and well-being.</p>
<h4><strong>How to help patients like Sandy</strong></h4>
<p>We interviewed women, like Sandy, who had to decide whether to remove their healthy ovaries to reduce their risk of developing cancer. <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0673-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In this paper</a>, we report on how and why these women made their decision. We use a theoretical framework to help guide our research and develop suggestions for how we could better assist women with making difficult healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>We also look at how women use different strategies such as statistical information, ‘gut feeling,’ and their own experiences to decide what is best for them. We explore what they are struggling with most and how doctor-patient communication in this area could be improved. By increasing our understanding of why and how patients decide on their care, this paper provides an important step towards helping people like Sandy manage the ‘tricky business’ of healthcare decision making.</p>
