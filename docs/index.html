                <h4><a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2018/06/championing-change-in-journal-negotiations/">Championing Change in Journal Negotiations</a></h4>

<p>"Because the lion’s share of both the University’s research output and of our library budgets is bound up with the services of journal publishers, advancing these goals [journal affordability and the moral imperative of achieving a truly open scholarly communication system] is inextricably entwined with the University’s ongoing relationships with publishers and must be addressed in the context of the agreements we sign with them.  Our goal, simply put, is to responsibly transition funding for journal subscriptions toward funding for open dissemination.  As we approach major journal negotiations for 2019, the UC system will be guided by the principles and goals outlined below in negotiating agreements with publishers....</p>

<p>We believe the time has come to address these issues head-on through a combined strategy that places the need to reduce the University’s expenditures for academic journal subscriptions in the service of the larger goal of transforming journal publishing to open access.  Through our renewal negotiations with publishers, we will pursue this goal along two complementary paths: by reducing our subscription expenditures, and investing in open access support....</p>

<p>It has become increasingly clear that the problem of rising journal costs in the context of a widespread movement toward open access can only be addressed by tackling the subscription system itself....</p>

<p>As a leading research institution that produces 8% of all US research output, UC is uniquely positioned to both contribute to and accelerate such transformation, locally, nationally, and globally.  Indeed, we believe that as a public university sustained by taxpayer and extramural funding, we have a signal obligation to do so; and we invite our colleagues in the North American research community to embark with us on this journey....</p>

<h2>Strategic Priorities for Journal Negotiations</h2>

<ol>
	<li>We will prioritize making immediate open access publishing available to UC authors as part of our negotiated agreements.</li>
	<li>We will prioritize agreements that lower the cost of research access and dissemination, with sustainable, cost-based fees for OA publication.  Payments for OA publication should reduce the cost of subscriptions at UC and elsewhere.</li>
	<li>We will prioritize agreements with publishers who are transparent about the amount of APC-funded content within their portfolios, and who share that information with customers as well as the public.</li>
	<li>We will prioritize agreements that enable UC to achieve expenditure reductions in our licenses when necessary, without financial penalty.</li>
	<li>We will prioritize agreements that make any remaining subscription content available under terms that fully reflect academic values and norms, including the broadest possible use rights.</li>
	<li>We will prioritize agreements that allow UC to share information about the open access provisions with all interested stakeholders, and we will not agree to non-disclosure requirements in our licenses.</li>
	<li>We will prioritize working proactively with publishers who help us achieve a full transition to open access in accordance with the principles and pathways articulated by our faculty and our libraries.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Strategies guiding our near-term actions</h2>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>We will evaluate all publishers on both cost-benefit and values-based grounds in our cancellation and retention decisions, including conformance to the UCOLASC <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/ucolasc/scholcommprinciples-20180425.pdf">Declaration of Rights and Principles to Transform Scholarly Communication</a>, and sustainable, transparent, cost-based OA fees.</li>
	<li>We will adjust our investments to follow and support transformative initiatives mounted by academic authors, editorial boards, and societies when they seek to establish a journal on fair open access principles, including transitioning support from prior legacy journals when necessary.</li>
	<li>We will actively seek to partner with other national and global research institutions in transforming research output to OA...."</li>

<p>"And this is an important lesson to take into account: open data, just like open source, relies on contributors to audit and verify it. Its interaction and exploration is, however, easier to obfuscate: when dealing with great amounts of data, it is easy to hide flaws and irregularities by just making it inconvenient to work with the files. For that reason, it is important not to only demand open data in sensitive matters that affect the common good, the quality and accessibility of the data is as important. Open data should be straightforward, and not rely on almost-stenographic designs to hide flaws at plain sight."</p>

<p>"Discontent with the scholarly publishing industry continues to grow, as the prevailing subscription model appears increasingly unsustainable and open access big deals, one mooted alternative, unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes either. The Free Journal Network was established earlier this year in order to nurture and promote journals that are free to both authors and readers, and run according to the Fair Open Access Principles. Mark C. Wilson describes the progress the network has made so far, why community ownership is a crucial and underappreciated issue, and what research libraries can do to help."</p>

<p>"Because community-based (rather than corporate) open access aims to address the greatest number of ethical or moral goals, it in the end is part and parcel of the larger project of making anthropology and the other ethnographic fields better—better for those who live and work and study within them and better for all those living and working in the social worlds that these fields seek to engage and understand. Those at the heart of HAU clearly believed themselves to be advancing this work but I feel like I spent seven years watching a fast-moving train speeding towards a wreck. I feared it, but I did not imagine it would be nearly as big as it has turned out to be. If HAU survives, I hope that its next incarnation will have a different—slower and less self-confident—ethos."</p>

<p>"Over the past few years the MIT Libraries – like many US research libraries– have been watching with interest the development of “offsetting” agreements in Europe and the UK.  In offsetting agreements, a single license incorporates costs associated with access to paywalled articles and costs associated with open access publication.   This type of agreement has emerged in Europe and the UK and been the source of both new deals and broken deals.</p>

<p>In the MIT Libraries, we have been following this offsetting approach closely, as it seems to have the potential to transition subscription-based journals to a fully open access model."</p>

Now, nearly four years later, two of those articles have been retracted.

<p>Would you wilfully hurt or kill one person so as to save multiple others? That’s the dilemma at the heart of moral psychology’s favourite thought experiment and its derivatives. In the classic case, you must decide whether or not to pull a lever to divert a runaway mining trolley so that it avoids killing five people and instead kills a single individual on another line. A popular theory in the field states that, to many of us, so abhorrent is the notion of deliberately harming someone that our “deontological” instincts deter us from pulling the lever; on the other hand, the more we intellectualise the problem with cool detachment, the more likely we will make a utilitarian or consequentialist judgment and divert the trolley.</p>
<p>Armed with thought experiments of this kind, psychologists have examined all manner of individual and circumstantial factors that influence the likelihood of people making  deontological vs. utilitarian moral decisions. However, there’s a fatal (excuse the pun) problem. A striking <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617752640">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>finds that our answers to the thought experiments don’t match up with our real-world moral decisions.</p>
<p><span id="more-34043"></span></p>
<p>Dries Bostyn and his colleagues at Ghent University recruited nearly 300 participants. All answered several hypothetical moral dilemmas derived from the classic trolley dilemma – for instance, in a building on fire, they had to say whether they would push a man through a locked window to his death in order to make an exit for the five children trapped inside. The participants also completed several questionnaires tapping psychological factors, such as psychopathy and “need for cognition”, previously identified as being associated with being more utilitarian in one’s moral decisions.</p>
<p>A fortnight later, just under 200 of the participants were invited to the psych lab, one at a time, to take part in a real-life moral dilemma involving live mice. The participants saw two cages – one housing one mouse, the other housing five – each wired to an electroshock machine. They were told that in 20 seconds, if they did nothing, the machine would deliver a very painful but nonlethal shock to the cage containing five mice. However, if the participants pressed a button in front of them, they could divert the electric shock to the cage containing one mouse, thus saving the other five from pain (in actuality this was an illusion and all participants were later informed that in fact no mice were shocked or harmed in the study).</p>
<p>The remaining participants went to the psych lab but performed a hypothetical version of the mouse decision. They heard a description of the same two-cage set up faced by the others and they had to say whether they would press the button or not.</p>
<p>The participants who performed the real-life mouse task behaved differently than those who made a purely hypothetical decision – they were less than half as likely to let the five mice get shocked (16 per cent of them left the button unpressed compared with 34 per cent of the hypothetical group). In other words, faced with a real-life dilemma, the volunteers were more consequentialist / utilitarian; that is, more willing to inflict harm for the greater good.</p>
<p>But the most important finding – at least for the validity of moral psychology which so often relies on thought experiments – is that the participants’ preference for deontological vs. utilitarian responding in their answers to the earlier battery of 10 hypothetical moral dilemmas bore no relation to their decision in the real-life mouse task (in contrast, the decisions of participants in the hypothetical mouse group were related to their answers to the earlier moral dilemmas). What is more, none of the psychological factors, such as psychopathy or need for cognition, were related to decision-making in the real-life moral dilemma.</p>
<p>For so long, moral psychology has relied on the notion that you can extrapolate from people’s decisions in hypothetical thought experiments to infer something meaningful about how they would behave morally in the real world. These new findings challenge that core assumption of the field.</p>
<p>That is not to say people’s hypothetical decisions are meaningless. Although participants’ responses to the earlier moral thought experiments did not predict their later real moral decisions (i.e. whether or not to press the button to divert the electric charge), they were not totally unrelated. Among those who pressed the button in the real-life task, if they’d also earlier shown a preference for utilitarian decisions in the thought experiments then they tended to press the button more quickly; they also expressed less doubt and discomfort about their decision.</p>
<p>An obvious criticism of this research is that the trolley problem and its derivatives involve humans, whereas the real-life moral dilemma used in this study involved mice. However, the researchers believe this is not a critical issue since the moral conflicts (deliberately harming the few to save the many) are the same in both cases. They also note that they used a questionnaire to measure their participants’ levels of empathy for animals, and how participants scored made no difference to the pattern of findings (meaning its unlikely that participants’ levels of concern or not for the mice explains the results).</p>
<p>Bostyn and his team don’t know why people’s judgments on the moral thought experiments didn’t predict their choice in the real-life moral task. Current theory – based on the idea that emotional responding leads to more deontological decisions and rational thinking to more utilitarian decisions – isn’t much help because it would actually predict more deontological decisions in the more vivid and emotive real-life task, which is the opposite of what was found. The researchers speculate that perhaps people are more inclined to virtue-signal when answering in the hypothetical (i.e. signalling that they couldn’t possibly choose to deliberately harm another, even to save the majority), but one could just as easily make this case for the very opposite results.</p>
<p>“Future research will have to investigate these and other possibilities,” the researchers concluded. “… [W]e advance the argument that we will be able to bridge the gap between moral judgment and moral behaviour only by exploring new research paradigms that bring more decision making into the real world.”</p>

<p>Sam Sutton's journal club session where he discusses the paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291952">Signal Propagation and Logic Gating in Networks of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons (Vogels and Abbott, 2005)</a>".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Transmission of signals within the brain is essential for cognitive function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable and accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range. Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate
across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/20/are-dyslexics-more-entrepreneurial/">Are Dyslexics More Entrepreneurial?</a></h4>

<p>Dyslexia is rather common: it is estimated that around 5-10% of individuals are dyslexic. Despite an apparent disability, some are famous, like Tom Cruise or Richard Branson. Obviously, they do not suffer from a lack of intelligence and are, in fact, quite successful in the business world. So what is going on in their brains? Are they developing some compensatory mechanisms that help them to do things better?</p>
<p>Epidemiological research studies indicate that dyslexics develop coping strategies to compensate for their weaknesses, which helps them in later life. The resilience that they acquire while in school often helps them to be more successful in developing a business, in being an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Statistics show that there are twice more dyslexics among entrepreneurs when compared to the general population. However, dyslexics are uncommon in higher management. They also tend to have a different business management style. Thus, they do better in startups and are better at handling particular types of businesses.</p>
<p>Dyslexia is usually first identified when a child goes to school and struggles with scrambled text. Dyslexic children have difficulty in reading texts, interpreting them, and explaining the meaning of the text to others, even though they can be very intelligent otherwise. Dyslexia often results in poor academic performance, undue pressure, and psychological trauma. Each dyslexic child needs to learn to cope with these challenges.</p>
<p>Although dyslexic children are as intelligent as their peers at school, they are often labeled as less capable. Children with dyslexia are often targets of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/03/school-bullying-forgive-ignore-or-revenge/">bullying in school</a>. Poor self-image at school often leads to worsening of self-esteem in many of these kids. As helping dyslexic children is not easy, they are often left to themselves.</p>
<h2>What’s going on in the dyslexic brain? Neurological basis of dyslexia</h2>
<p>As a common disorder, dyslexia is the subject of multiple studies. Researchers agree that those living with dyslexia may have differences in the brain relative to non-dyslexic children, and these differences are the subject of intense clinical research. The recent explosion in brain imaging technology is helping us gain a deeper understanding of the matter.</p>
<p>The neurological theory of dyslexia is one of the earliest. The theory was proposed about a century ago when British physicians Morgan and Hinshelwood described dyslexia as a “visual word blindness.”</p>
<p>The study of adults <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/14/living-with-traumatic-brain-injury/">living with brain trauma</a> in the left parietal region demonstrated that many of these people develop reading difficulties. They find it challenging to process the optical image of letters. Thus, the early theory was that those with dyslexia have developmental defects in the parietal region of the brain.</p>
<p>Left parietal involvement was also somewhat confirmed during pathological examination of the brains of those who died at an earlier age and were known to be dyslexic. </p>
<p>Another important theory focuses on delayed brain lateralization in dyslexia. It is thought that some people have weak or insufficient brain lateralization that hinders the understanding of languages. This theory was the subject of multiple studies in the second half of last century.</p>
<p>The latest research into the neurophysiology of those living with dyslexia seems to indicate that dyslexia is phonological in nature: dyslexics have difficulty in manipulating the phoneme parts of speech. It is possible that there are developmental issues in the visual tract or other visual mechanisms in the brain may be contributing to the difficulty.</p>
<p>Apart from defects in a specific subsystem of the vision pathway, researchers think that there are other brain developmental issues involved as well. It is entirely possible that people with dyslexia have temporal processing impairment, and therefore they are not able to process information fast enough. Thus, dyslexia is considered the result of multi-system deficits</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Dyslexia is probably the result of deficits in the brain at multiple levels. There is an impaired phoneme discrimination resulting in difficulty in understanding spelling. Visual perceptual impairment leads to further worsening of word recognition, and phonological awareness impairment causes speech disturbances. In the center of all this is delayed temporal processing. The end result is delayed speech development, difficulties in reading and comprehending texts, and poor academic performance.</p>
<h2>What makes a dyslexic a successful person?</h2>
<p>From Leonardo da Vinci to Einstein, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/16/opening-the-classroom-door-for-children-with-autism/">children with learning disabilities</a> prove that there is a limited link between disability and intelligence. Children with dyslexia are at least equally intelligent to non-dyslexic children.</p>
<p>The higher success of individuals with dyslexia in certain professions is probably the result of resilience or compensatory mechanisms that they cultivate during the school days to overcome their difficulties.</p>
<p>Some of these kids may develop better skills for interacting with others. They may focus more on specific arts or sciences. Many of them may not concentrate on studies and instead start doing business at an early age. This means that they can be found in any profession, and in the long run they are equally successful.</p>
<p>The compensatory mechanisms developed at a young age may provide an edge over others in specific areas when the children grow up. Even though dyslexics may score poorly in school, they may outscore other children in practical life since they spend more time perfecting their verbal skills.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, dyslexics are known to be good at delegating tasks, they are excellent mentors, and they are often creative. All of these qualities usually make them more successful entrepreneurs, though they may not be that good in roles where there is less space for creativity.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercise – any activity that gets your heart pumping harder – improves <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/19/10-ways-that-running-changes-your-mind-and-brain/">mood, anxiety and memory.</a> It can help people with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. Now there’s evidence, from a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00167/full">randomised controlled trial</a> published in <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i>, that a programme of regular aerobic exercise also reduces psychopathology in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. And it seems to have a particular impact on so-called “negative” symptoms, such as apathy and loss of emotional feeling, which are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528757">not improved by standard drug treatments</a>.</p>
<p>“[W]hile antipsychotics [drug treatments] are essential in treating schizophrenia, interventions other than antipsychotic treatment…may be needed to achieve better outcomes,” write the authors of the new study, led by Peng-Wei Wang at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan.</p>
<p><span id="more-34066"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 62 patients, all of whom had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia at least a year ago, and whose antipsychotic medication dosage had been stable for at least three months. These participants were randomly allocated into either an aerobic exercise group (30 minutes of “vigorous” aerobic exercise, taking into account each participant’s maximum heart rate) or a control group who performed stretching exercises (25 minutes of flexibility, toning and balance exercises), with a goal of five sessions a week, for 12 weeks. Not all participants managed to stick to the minimum requirement of three sessions per week for the full three months. But 24 in the exercise group and 22 in the control group did complete the study.  (There were no significant differences in gender make-up, age of onset of schizophrenia, or mean dosage of antipsychotics between the two groups.)</p>
<p>A psychiatrist who was blind to the group allocations used a standard schizophrenia symptom evaluation scale to interview and evaluate all the participants at the start of the study; at the end of the 12 week intervention; and again, three months on. The control group showed no improvements in positive (e.g. hallucinations and delusions) or negative symptoms, or general psychopathology, during the intervention or the follow-up period. But for the aerobic exercise group, it was a different story.</p>
<p>Over the 12-week intervention, their overall psychopathology and level of negative and positive symptoms decreased. Three months later, these improvements had been maintained (and, in the case of negative symptoms, actually continued to improve). Also, the more severe their negative symptoms and general psychopathology at the start of the study, the bigger their improvements by the end.</p>
<p>“These results imply that [aerobic exercise] could be a good non-pharmacotherapeutic intervention for antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia,” the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>There are various possible explanations for the effects. Vigorous exercise can boost levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate (other work has found that enhancing glutamate function can improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia); increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (which is involved in repairing damaged brain cells and triggering the growth of new ones; low levels of BDNF are associated with symptoms of schizophrenia); and also help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis – the stress response system. “HPA dysfunction is an important characteristic in schizophrenia,” the authors note.</p>
<p>But is a one-off 12-week programme really enough to produce lasting – and even escalating – improvements?</p>
<p>The researchers did not collect data on how much exercise the aerobic group did in the three months between the end of the 12-week intervention and the final assessment. If the participants continued to exercise, this may have accounted for the ongoing improvements. Future research will have to explore this. But if an exercise programme does have to be maintained, given all the manifold benefits, surely that’s no bad thing.</p>

I mean it’s rife across this country…people talk about doing something and don’t do anything about it.”</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">ANNOUNCEMENT &amp; AWARDS</span></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">BIO has become a launching platform for new partnerships, ventures, and awards. To illustrate, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) unveiled a new initiative called DRIVe (Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures) to come up with new solutions to some of the toughest health security challenges we are faced with such as early detection of illness and sepsis. Another announcement that caught everyone’s attention was a five-year alliance between Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) and Boston University – an attempt to change the way we detect and treat lung cancer today. J&amp;J will fund a Lung Cancer Center at Boston University Medical Center as part of this new alliance. Just as important, the Henri A. Termeer Biotechnology Visionary Award was given to Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for the innovative spirit and transformative impact on patients’ lives. This is the first-ever award created in honor of the late Genzyme CEO who was instrumental in transforming Boston into a thriving hub of life science research, development and innovation.</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">WORLD AT BIO</span></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Thousands of attendees from over 74 different countries participated in the event, and most of the essential biotech hubs and nations had a presence in the form of pavilions and summits at the event. For example, a “conference-within-a-conference” called the China Summit was one of the country-specific meetings at BIO which highlighted the complexities of the world’s second-largest biotech market, and among other vital issues focused on the importance of collaboration between U.S. and China in the scientific research and business.</p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-width="550"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Great turnout at the China Summit at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIO2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BIO2018</a> - great timing too given news flow like CStone/Blueprint deal <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BPMC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BPMC</a> <a href="https://t.co/ST1PnJjCsJ">https://t.co/ST1PnJjCsJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/sq13t1Gpxw">pic.twitter.com/sq13t1Gpxw</a></p>— Josh Berlin (@BioPharmaJosh) <a href="https://twitter.com/BioPharmaJosh/status/1003683091515396102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2018</a></blockquote><p></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><i>Tweet gives a</i> <i>glimpse of the China Summit.</i></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Canada’s presence at BIO couldn’t be ignored</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">either.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Economic development and tech transfer teams, businesses, scientists, and government officials from The Great White North were seen everywhere.

One such company is Recombinetics; they employ gene-editing technology not just to improve human health but also to improve the health, well-being and productivity of animals. The company’s gene-editing technology can potentially be used to create animals with welfare traits, such as pigs that don’t need to be castrated, hornless cattle, heat-tolerant livestock and other disease-resistant animals.  </p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Another example is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. In his “Bio Buzz” Interview, John Maraganore, the company’s CEO, talked about an entirely new class of medicines derived from the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of advances in RNA interference (RNAi). With investigational RNAi therapeutics, it is possible to block the production of disease-causing proteins.</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Just as important, Amgen shared its approach to treating migraines.

<p>If personality traits are a genuine concept and not merely an artefact of psychologists’ imagination, then how people choose to spend their time ought to correlate with their scores on personality questionnaires, notwithstanding the constraints of life that prevent us from doing what we want. In fact, there are relatively few studies that have looked at correlations between traits and everyday behaviour, and of those that have, many relied on student volunteers (see <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170518-the-everyday-habits-that-reveal-our-personalities">here</a> for an overview).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.112/">study</a> published earlier this year in <em>Collabra</em> helps plug this research gap – Julia Rohrer and Richard Lucas analysed the “Big Five” trait personality scores of over 1,300 German volunteers (part of a nationally representative sample), average age 51 years, who on three successive years completed detailed diaries of what they had been up to the day before. Specifically, they indicated whether they had spent any time, and if so how much, on nine key activities the previous day, including socialising, work, chores and watching TV.</p>
<p><span id="more-34060"></span></p>
<p>The findings, controlling for age and gender, will mostly make comfortable reading for personality psychologists. For instance, consistent with trait theory, high scorers on conscientiousness spent more time working and studying, whether they were full-time employed or not. Similarly, strong extraverts, the highly agreeable and open-minded were more likely to report socialising.</p>
<p>A few other findings are more nuanced and intriguing. For instance, the highly conscientiousness were no more or less likely to report watching TV the previous day, but they reported watching it for less time. Meanwhile, extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness all went together with less time spent reading. In contrast, openness to experience was correlated with reading, and a trend toward reading for longer. Openness also correlated with time spent playing sports. Cultural activities, which typically correlate with openness, were not assessed in this study.</p>

<p>The most intriguing findings concerned chores – against trait theory, the highly conscientiousness were no more likely to say they’d spent time on chores (even though orderliness is a key facet of conscientiousness), perhaps because they had everything in order already, whereas the highly neurotic (i.e. people with low emotional stability who typically experience more low moods) were more likely to say they’d done some chores the previous day, and for longer. Again it’s speculation, but perhaps this is because the emotionally unstable find disorder and clutter more upsetting, while at the same time not necessarily being particularly adept at keeping order.</p>
<p>There was also a trend toward agreeableness correlating with doing chores. This chimes with a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917303094">previous study</a> that found, more specifically, that agreeableness correlated with spending more time ironing and washing up. The likely explanation in both cases is that highly agreeable people are more concerned with doing things that benefit others.</p>
<p>The approach of asking people whether they’d performed an activity at all, and if so, for how long, also threw up some interesting contradictions. For instance, high scorers on openness were more likely to report socialising, yet at the same time, they tended to report doing so for less time than low scorers, perhaps because they had so many other competing demands on their time.</p>
<p>The main weakness of this new data is its reliance (as in so much personality research) on people’s self-reports of their traits and behaviour, and the memory challenge for them of recalling what they’d been doing the previous day and for how long. Nonetheless, the findings serve to complement similar efforts using different approaches. “Our study suggests that even under the constraints of everyday life, personality shows modest [effect sizes were in the range of .1 to .2] but meaningful associations with daily patterns,” Rohrer and Lucas concluded. “Personality therefore qualifies as a real-world phenomenon, exerting its influence beyond the context of the research laboratory and allowing for strong descriptions of human life.”</p>

<p>Psychology can help people one person at a time, but it also holds the promise of changing society at a mass scale, through campaigns to change attitudes and behaviour. One such endeavour is the development of programmes to reduce the rates of sexual assault of women on university campuses. But in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178917303646">literature review</a> in <em>Aggression and Violent Behavior</em>, researchers from the University of California make the case that such programmes may not just be ineffective, but counterproductive.</p>
<p><span id="more-34047"></span></p>
<p>In 2013 the US passed its Violence Against Women Act; in response most US university campuses launched programmes that aimed to reduce sexual assault by raising awareness, changing attitudes and behaviours and encouraging bystanders to take a stand. But there has been little systematic evaluation of these programmes, and the evidence for any benefits is thus far thin. Of the 140 college-based behaviour change programmes studied by the Center for Disease Control, it recommended only three on the balance of evidence; all three focused on changing bystander action and two of the three merely showed “promise of effectiveness”. Other reviews have produced slightly more positive conclusions but often with weak effects or without evidence of actual behaviour change.</p>

<p>It’s certainly become clear that well-meaning interventions in other contexts can have the opposite effect to that intended; we’ve previously covered instances of backfiring interventions that aimed to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/08/the-imagined-contact-intervention-for-reducing-prejudice-can-backfire/">reduce prejudice</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/">correct false beliefs on vaccine</a>, or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/11/pressuring-employees-to-be-do-gooders-can-backfire-badly/">encourage employees to behave better in the workplace</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The reason boomerang effects are such a concern in the domain of sexual assault is that most interventions are being designed and evaluated around a broad target group – men – rather than looking at effects on the most high-risk individuals. Yet we know from previous evidence that the people most likely to respond contrarily are those most disposed to the problem behaviour in the first place. For instance, an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0193841X16666196">intervention intended to reduce acceptance of violent video games</a> in students was effective for many participants, but post-intervention, those who had been classified as living a delinquent lifestyle became more enthusiastic about playing the games.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S1359-1789(17)30364-6/rf0040">Another study</a> demonstrated that an anti-violence campaign was effective in increasing opposition to violence in people low in trait aggression, but those who were highly aggressive became more enthusiastic about violence.</p>
<p>Boomerang effects seem to happen when participants experience reactance: anger stemming from the sense that a mode of life or thinking is threatened combined with “motivated reasoning” – like finding reasons to doubt the source of the message. In the midst of reactance, the person sees themselves as defiantly resisting preachy attempts to deny them their entitlement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Is reactance likely to happen with the men most likely to commit sexual assault? Well, consider this profile of high-risk individuals: they tend to have hostility towards women, experience sexual arousal when physical force is involved, and have an impersonal sexual orientation (intimacy is not a prerequisite for what they seek in sex). As well as these sex-related factors, they tend to be anti-social, highly entitled and narcissistic. Evidence suggests these individuals are less likely to respond to cues of sexual disinterest, feeling that women are really into them or will be eventually, and they react more aggressively to interpersonal rejection. This seems a potent recipe for reactance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Messages promoting gender equality and greater consideration for women lead to lower aggressive tendencies for men already low in sexist attitudes, but more aggression among those who held more sexist attitudes from the start. A video intended to reduce acceptance of rape myths and increase victim empathy worked for men who had no history of sexually aggressive behaviour, but the high-risk men showed a boomerang effect. On the other hand, some experimental studies have shown some intervention content can have the desired effect on high-risk individuals, e.g. improving victim empathy. But if you hit the target on some occasions, and shoot yourself in the foot on others, you would want to take a good look at your technique before rolling it out nationwide.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The danger is that interventions could produce impressive-seeming results simply because the low-risk majority perceive sexual assault as even more deplorable than they already did – while the (roughly 30 per cent) of higher-risk men become even more intent on their agenda. Of course, such interventions may prevent certain sexual assaults – for example, through limiting predation opportunities through galvanising bystanders to act. But surely we should be working to maximise impact on those likely to commit the bulk of the assaults, rather than fire up their motivation still further.</p>

<p>The neurotransmitter Oxytocin is widely known for its role in the regulation of social bonding as well as romantic attachment. It was initially discovered over 100 years ago after an extract derived from the human posterior pituitary gland was found to cause uterine contractions in pregnant cats. Since 1909 our understanding of this nonapeptide has somewhat progressed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Impairment of methylation appeared to suggest increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oxytocin binds a G protein coupled receptor that is coded for by the OXTR gene. Binding of oxytocin to its receptor unleashes a signalling cascade within the cell, leading to both psychological and physiological changes.  Much attention has been given to the OXTR gene as its expression essentially controls the rate limiting step in the oxytocin signalling process.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in <em>BMC Psychiatry</em> this month looks at the possibility of a link between OXTR gene methylation and corresponding changes in social and emotional behaviour in human populations.</p>
<p>While there is still insufficient evidence to draw strong conclusions, early findings point towards a correlation between specific elevated patterns of methylation and impaired cognitive and social emotional behaviour. Conversely, impairment of methylation appeared to suggest increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>To establish these patterns with greater certainty, more research is required to understand the relationship between OXTR gene methylation and OXTR expression.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Public Health</em>: <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5399-4">Sound pressure levels generated at risk volume steps of portable listening devices: types of smartphone and genres of music.</a> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10261" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/headphones-300x201.jpg" width="300" />It is thought that approximately 36% of the world’s population currently use a smart phone, with around 2.1 billion worldwide users reported in 2016. A significant number of these smartphone owning individuals are likely to take advantage of music playing applications found ubiquitously across most smartphone models.</p>
<p>However, listening to music on a smartphone or personal listening device comes with a risk.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) have warned many young adults are at risk of developing recreational noise induced hearing loss due to frequent exposure to noisy environments. It is thought that nearly 50% of young people aged from 12- 35 years of age in developed counties are exposed to dangerously high levels of music through their personal listening devices.</p>
<p>Smartphone manufacturers have now implemented their own recommendations for minimum volumes at which hearing loss may occur. However these volumes vary, even within different smartphone models issued by the same company.</p>
<p>In <em>BMC Public Health</em>, authors Gibbeum Kim and Woojae Han put 6 smartphones to the test, using four genres of Korean pop music to determine the first risk volume level as defined by each device.</p>
<p>The results indicated a considerable 8-dB difference in sound pressure levels detected across the six devices, with dance-pop music having the highest output level of the genres tested. Based on these conclusions, the implementation of an international standard for safe use output volume is suggested across all devices.</p>
<p><em><strong>BMC International Health and Human Rights:</strong></em> <strong><u><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-018-0160-8">Causes of death among street-connected children and youth in Eldoret, Kenya.</a></u></strong></p>
<p>It is common knowledge that homeless people will have lower life expectancy on average than their housed and settled counterparts. One recent study estimated the homeless youth of San Francisco to have a mortality rate that was 10 times that of the general population. Drug related deaths and suicide featured as the most common causes.</p>
<p>However, little information exists on the causes of youth mortality in low and middle-income countries. A recent study published <em>in BMC International Health and Human Rights</em> has documented the causes of death among street connected youth in Eldoret, Western Kenya.</p>
<p>The causes of death of in Eldoret differ considerably from those in San Francisco. In Eldoret, HIV accounted for 37% of all deaths, killing 59% of females included in the study and roughly a quarter of all men. Among the male population, the greatest cause of death was assault, accounting for nearly 50% of recorded deaths in men.</p>
<p>Deaths for reasons such as these are largely preventable. The authors advocate appropriate responses such as targeted HIV treatment programs and child protection systems to decrease the prevalence of assault and HIV and thus avoidable youth mortality in these areas.</p>

A barrier to understanding the evolution of apoidea has been the difficulty in determining the geological age of bees as well as their phylogenetic origin.</p>
<p>Michael Ohl’s group from the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science in Berlin have pooled and analysed target DNA enrichment sites and transcriptomic sequence data, covering all major lineages in the apoidea superfamily.</p>
<p>The Ammoplanina, a family of predatory wasps, began to lose their taste for thrips around 128 million years ago. Over time, they acquired a plant-based diet and evolved into what we now know as the modern bee. Further research must be done to understand the specific traits that enabled this radical dietary change.</p>

<p>Enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, is the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion. The freedom to manifest these beliefs, however, can be limited by law if thought to pose a risk to public health for example, or infringe on the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<blockquote><p>Conscientious objection was widely accepted, despite largely polarised viewpoints on either side of the debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under most abortion laws enacted across the developed world, a conscience clause is included, permitting the conscientious objection of healthcare professionals to opt out of providing such services on moral grounds.</p>
<p>Heated debate has ensued regarding the extent to which the rights of healthcare professionals to refuse provision of abortion services should be limited, in case this should infringe on a woman’s legal right to the service.</p>
<p>This review, published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em>, aims to elucidate the reasons given for declining to participate in abortion on grounds of conscience. Surprisingly, it was found the viewpoints of midwives and nurses were largely absent from this debate, despite being the recommended providers of abortion services by the WHO. Across the literature studied, conscientious objection was widely accepted, despite largely polarised viewpoints on either side of the debate.</p>
<p>Going forward, better representation of all relevant healthcare professionals in the debate and the consideration of all viewpoints is necessary when discussing such a sensitive topic, in order to inform beneficial health policy in this area.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10263" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10263" height="267" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/skull-300x267.gif" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image taken from manuscript</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Between the ages of 35 to 44, 69% of US citizens are reported to have lost at least one tooth. 15 million of this population will have undergone crown and bridge replacements for missing teeth, while only 3 million of these have been reported to have had dental implants. However this number is said to be growing by half a million every year.</p>
<p>Dental implants may be surgically inserted into a patient’s jaw, in order to support the introduction of a prosthetic element such as a crown or bridge. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful tool, providng high-quality, 3-dimensional images of surrounding tissues to aid this process. The low cost and reasonable dose of radiation administered has caused the popularity of this method to increase over recent years.</p>
<p>In <em>BMC Oral Health</em> this month, Michael Bornstein’s group from the University of Leuven in Belgium review current literature to provide recommendations for the future use of CBCT imaging. Due to relatively high radiation doses, its clinical usage should be justified. For example, the authors advise to limit CBCT to cases involving post-operative complications following dental implant insertion, as well as the avoidance of this procedure in long term maintenance and follow up of dental implants.</p>
<p>A lack of standardisation of radiation dose and image quality between different CBCT machines further prompted calls for more research to consistently achieve the lowest diagnostically acceptable radiation dose possible.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/18/how-weather-influences-the-brain/">How Weather Influences the Brain?</a></h4>

<p>We all know that the weather can strongly influence our mood and productivity. Many people feel better when the weather is nice and sunny. It is thus not surprising that people more often feel unhappy and depressed in winter. There is even a medical condition known as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/">winter depression</a>. Still, some researchers believe that our brain functions better during the cold days. In this article, I’ll briefly analyze what happens in our brain in relation to weather-related mood and mind changes.</p>
<p>Scientific studies indicate that weather conditions such as high temperature and humidity can impair mental performance by affecting brain neurochemistry. For instance, it is believed that thermal stress can cause cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>One recent study has investigated the impact of thermal stress on cognitive functions in soldiers spending at least one year in desert conditions. The evaluation of memory and cognitive functions indicated there is a decline in cognitive performance in hot climates when compared to normal weather. The decline was most pronounced for attention, concentration, verbal memory, and psychomotor performance.</p>
<p>Another recent study has investigated the impact of sand and dust storms on children’s cognitive function. Using mathematical analysis and word-recognition test scores, how prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms affects the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/13/how-does-starting-school-early-impact-educational-attainment/">cognitive performance of children </a>was evaluated. The authors found a decline in both test scores, as well as a later beginning of counting and speaking in whole sentences in children prenatally exposed to storms. The findings imply that this kind of weather jeopardizes the cognitive functions of the next generation.</p>
<p>However, results from scientific research on the effects of temperature on cognitive functions are quite mixed and contradictory.</p>
<p>One study investigated <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">how temperature affects the cognitive performance of subjects with multiple sclerosis</a>. Healthy subjects were included as controls. The researchers correlated cognitive status with temperature in both study groups. In patients with multiple sclerosis, unlike in healthy subjects, the higher temperatures were associated with worsening cognitive status. These findings confirmed that warmer outdoor temperatures lead to a higher incidence of clinical exacerbation and T2 lesion activity in subjects with this condition (T2 lesions represent the white spots observed by MRI that are used to diagnose and track the progress of multiple sclerosis).</p>
<p>With regard to cognitive functions in cold weather, studies have shown both impairments and improvements.</p>
<p>For instance, one study investigated the impact of exposure to the cold and the following rewarming on working memory and executive functions in 10 young males. The results demonstrated a decline in the test results when the subjects were exposed to 10°C, and these impairments persisted for one hour during the rewarming period. Although the underlying mechanisms were not tested, the authors suggested that acute vascular changes in the brain could explain the observed changes. According to the authors, another explanation could be a deregulation of catecholamine levels, particularly important for complex attentional functions.</p>
<p>Other findings suggest that winter helps to wake up our mind and makes us think more clearly. It is well known that the brain utilizes glucose as its main energy source. Thus, when glucose is depleted, brain functioning is jeopardized. Energy, i.e., glucose, is also used for the regulation of body temperature, especially in extremely hot or cold conditions. It seems that more energy (glucose) is needed to cool down than to warm up the body. Thus, warm temperatures are more likely to deplete glucose levels and thus impair brain function and clarity of thinking.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that high temperatures increase the risk of mental disorders, especially in the elderly.</p>
<p>One recent study has analyzed data on emergency admissions linked to mental diseases and daily temperatures over a period of more than 10 years in 6 different cities. The results indicated that high temperatures might jeopardize mental health and be responsible for the exacerbation of symptoms of mental diseases. For instance, according to the results, more than 30% of admissions for anxiety were attributed to hot temperatures. Exposure to hot temperatures leads to reactions in the body that may cause an increase in stress hormone levels and brain temperature. Additionally, extremely hot weather may deregulate the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">dopamine and serotonin levels</a> (these neuromediators are important for the feeling of happiness).</p>
<p>According to widespread belief, weather can affect our mood. Although a lack of sunshine is commonly linked to seasonal depression, some researchers believe that not all individuals respond similarly to weather changes.</p>
<p>Research has linked an individual’s self-reported daily mood with the objective weather over a 30 day period. Large individual differences have been found in how people react to the weather. Accordingly, four distinct types of weather responders have been identified: summer lovers (i.e., a better mood with warmer weather and more sun), summer haters (i.e., a worse mood with warmer weather and more sun), rain haters (i.e.,  a bad mood on rainy days), and unaffected (i.e., no particular association between weather and mood). Interestingly, adolescents and their mothers are often the same type, suggestive of familial weather reactivity.</p>
<p>The analysis of both scientific and popular literature permits the conclusion that extreme weather conditions can affect our cognitive function and mood. Most likely, this is caused by a decline in the brain’s energy source (glucose), which needs to be used for thermoregulation. Also, it is evident that extreme temperatures affect the level of catecholamines in the brain (such as dopamine and serotonin). Still, it seems that there is some individual variability in the brain’s response to weather, and it may run in the family.</p>

<p>From <i>You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feeling</i> to <i>Nothing Compares 2 U</i>, there’s no shortage of songs about heartbreak. None, I suspect, contains the line, “Now it’s time to give negative reappraisal a go.” But whether you’ve just been dumped or you’ve done the dumping, if you’re still in love with your ex, this could be your best strategy for falling out of love and moving on, according to a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2017-37800-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Romantic break-ups can have serious consequences including insomnia, reduced immune function, broken heart syndrome, depression and suicide,” note the authors, Sandra Langeslag and Michelle Sanchez at the University of Missouri, St Louis. Strategies that help people to fall out of love could relieve the agony of unrequited love or make it easier to get out of a dysfunctional relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34035"></span></p>
<p>Langeslag and Sanchez recruited 20 women and four men for their study. (As it was hard to get male volunteers, they decided to sacrifice gender balance in favour of having enough participants for the statistical analysis). All these people had experienced a romantic break-up, were still upset about it, and could supply 28 digital pictures of their ex. These pictures had to include a range of facial expressions, and show the ex-partner in different situations (all non-intimate), to mimic the kinds of real-world reminders the participants might endure – seeing their ex on the street, or on social media, for example.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the lab, the researchers showed the participants their full collection of pictures four times over. In between seeing each shot, they were prompted to engage in one of three potential strategies to down-regulate love, and then report on a sliding scale how “in love” and how generally positive or negative they felt. One strategy was “love reappraisal” (they were presented with statements such as “It’s okay to love someone I’m no longer with”, for example.) Another involved simple distractions (between photos, they were asked to think about their favourite food, for example). There was also a control, in which they were asked to think about nothing in particular. And finally, there was “negative reappraisal” which involved reminding themselves of the negative qualities of their ex partners (prompts included ‘What is an annoying habit of your ex?’ for instance).</p>
<p>While neither love reappraisal or distraction changed how in love the participants reported feeling, negative reappraisal of the ex did. Negative reappraisal also made the participants feel more negative in the moment – but such short-term discomfort may be worth enduring if this strategy helps people to get over a break-up, the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That is an “if”, however. As Langeslag and Sanchez concede, this study only looked at feelings of love immediately after each photo was presented. The practicalities of the strategy also remain unclear. If you know you’re going to bump into your ex at work, say, should you be focusing on their negative qualities during every commute in – or would an occasional bout of negative reappraisal have the same effect? And what exactly would using the negative reappraisal strategy mean in terms of how long it takes you to get over the relationship?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“To evaluate which regulation strategies would best help people cope with a break-up, it would be essential to consider both the short-term and long-term effects,” the researchers write. It will also be important to study more men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A traditional Amazonian psychedelic brew is an effective and rapid-acting antidepressant, according to a paper just published. But the new study revives some long-standing questions.



Ayahuasca is a mixture of herbs, traditionally used for spiritual and therapeutic purposes. The main active ingredients are N,N-DMT, a potent psychedelic, and several molecules that inhibit the enzyme MAO. The MAO inhibitors serve to prevent the N,N-DMT from being broken down by the digestive system, allowing

The main finding was that both groups clicked more after drinking citric acid than the other solutions.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h3NSxvowELA/WyYwfajUsPI/AAAAAAAAMjo/NKMwiaEliIQn8-6ZiC7qQCkk-0Kfr6B3ACLcBGAs/s1600/UK%2Bparticipants.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="338" data-original-width="471" height="286" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h3NSxvowELA/WyYwfajUsPI/AAAAAAAAMjo/NKMwiaEliIQn8-6ZiC7qQCkk-0Kfr6B3ACLcBGAs/s400/UK%2Bparticipants.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HHMqBb3kop8/WyYwfbyVuVI/AAAAAAAAMjk/GGLi-6lrhlYLpMWqCzGAEkVZDlWErYVHgCLcBGAs/s1600/Vietnamese%2BParticipants.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="366" data-original-width="482" height="302" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HHMqBb3kop8/WyYwfbyVuVI/AAAAAAAAMjk/GGLi-6lrhlYLpMWqCzGAEkVZDlWErYVHgCLcBGAs/s400/Vietnamese%2BParticipants.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />Why would this this balloon pumping be more vigorous after tasting a sour solution?

<h4>The project will focus on applying advanced imaging technologies paired with precise genetic techniques to disentangle how inhibitory circuits in the cortex are constructed.</h4>
<p>Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi, Ph.D., a Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has been awarded a $2.4 million five-year grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Over the life of the grant the Taniguchi Lab will take a closer look at a class of brain cells known as inhibitory interneurons, studying how members of this diverse cell type assemble into specific circuits in various regions of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>The cerebral cortex is arguably the brain’s most complex structure, endowing us with extraordinary abilities such as sensory perception, language, and cognition. Underlying these capabilities are the intricate connections made by the neurons that reside within, enabling complex encoding and processing of information. Interneurons in the cortex normally act to balance, refine and shape information processing, but their dysfunction has been implicated in a wide array of brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy.</p>
<p>Despite their critical importance, comprehensive wiring diagrams of interneuron circuits and the exact principles that guide their assembly have remained rather elusive. One challenging aspect hindering the design of a concrete cortical blueprint, is the sheer diversity of interneurons and principle neurons they form connections with. Each individual type of interneuron is thought to make specific connections depending on a principle neuron’s location, function, and depth within the cortex. Until very recently, neuroscientists lacked readily available tools sensitive enough to study these connections at a cell-type specific resolution. Overcoming this obstacle, the Taniguchi lab has designed novel genetic tools and incorporated them into the established technique of retrograde monosynaptic labeling, producing unprecedented results.</p>
<p>Their powerful technique now allows for the precise tracing of connections from individual types of interneurons. MPFI scientists will be able to determine how inhibitory connections form during development and elucidate the organization of specific inhibitory inputs on varying types of principle neurons. Uncovering these principles will dramatically improve our understanding of cortical circuits as well as pioneer novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of prominent brain disorders.<br />
“Cortical interneurons are a unique cell class with rich diversity, containing numerous types with distinctive features and functional properties.” Notes Dr. Taniguchi, “This crucial funding will allow us to probe individual types of interneurons, better establishing the principles behind their wiring. Addressing this critical topic will lead to a better understanding of inhibitory circuit design and the future development of novel therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.”</p>

We are calling for ecologists around the world to submit their images.</p>
<p>We created the competition as a chance for ecologists to share their research and photographic skills, and celebrate the intersection of art and science.</p>
<p>The three previous competitions (the overall winners of which can be seen on this page) have certainly achieved this, providing us with superb images demonstrating the complex web of interactions that ecologists are dedicated to unraveling.</p>
<p>The winning images from previous years have attracted substantial attention not just from ecologists but also from the wider public, featuring in international media outlets such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2017/aug/18/bmc-ecology-image-competition-2017-in-pictures">Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/awardwinning-photos-taken-during-actual-scientific-research-this-year/">IFL</a> Science, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-big-picture-bmc-ecology-image-competition-winners/">Scientific American</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33718151">the BBC</a>.</p>
<p>Judging the competition will be the <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board"><em>BMC Ecology</em> Section Editors</a>, who are experts in biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological models, and behavioral ecology. The overall winner will be chosen by a special guest judge, whose identity will be announced later in the year.</p>
<p>The overall winner will receive a cash prize of £250 (~ €300/$325), while the runner-up will receive £100 (€125/$150). Additional prizes of £50 (€65/$75) will be awarded for those images selected by the Section Editors that best represent their section.</p>

<p><i>Veteran marketing and business development executives join Science Exchange to help lead the company through its next phase of growth</i></p>
<p><b>PALO ALTO CA, June 14, 2018 –</b>(<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)–Science Exchange, the<i> leading marketplace for outsourced R&amp;D<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /></i>, has appointed senior team members Rob Mihalko as Vice President of Marketing and Alex Slater as Vice President of Business Development and General Manager Europe. Both executives, reporting to Science Exchange CEO Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., will add to an already talented management team that is driving industry-leading solutions to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific research around the world.</p>
<p>Rob Mihalko is a leading expert in business commerce and procurement and has extensive experience in successfully implementing go-to-market strategies for business-to-business marketplaces on a global scale. As VP of Marketing, Mihalko will be responsible for Science Exchange’s worldwide marketing activities. He will lead the way in aligning Science Exchange’s brand and product positioning with global marketing programs to boost awareness, sales and adoption of the company’s industry-leading R&amp;D marketplace.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Science Exchange, Mihalko was Global Vice President of Solution &amp; Customer Marketing for SAP Ariba, where he led marketing and product initiatives that transformed SAP Ariba into the world’s leading procurement and business commerce company. He also has held several senior marketing, product and finance roles with leading technology companies, including Microsoft, and was a management consultant with A.T. Kearney, advising senior executives on strategy, sourcing and supply chain transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted to have joined such a passionate and mission-driven team at Science Exchange,” said Mihalko. “I’m looking forward to helping the company build on its leadership position in the outsourced research market and support its growth in new verticals and geographies.”</p>
<p>As a VP of Business Development and General Manager Europe, Alex Slater will be spearheading Science Exchange’s continued expansion into the European market. Slater brings 23 years of business development experience within contract research organizations to Science Exchange, spanning the entirety of drug discovery, from basic research to clinical development. He has also led business development teams in Europe and Asia for Covance and, most recently, was the VP Global Business Development at Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services.</p>
<p>In his new role, Slater will provide key leadership and support of Science Exchange’s business development and expansion efforts in Europe. He will work with the global business development team to stimulate provider and researcher recruitment and expand the European support team that will give researchers the personalized scientific support they expect.</p>
<p>“From my initial interactions with Elizabeth Iorns and the team at Science Exchange, I was impressed by their passion and commitment to simplifying researchers’ access to the services they need,” said Slater. “I look forward to working with such a driven team and helping expand the company’s European presence.”</p>
<p>“We work in a rapidly changing environment, and so it’s critical for us to hire people that share our ambitious vision and have the expertise to help us execute it successfully,” said Elizabeth Iorns, CEO of Science Exchange. “I’m thrilled to be welcoming our two new team members, who each bring vast experience to Science Exchange, and I look forward to working closely with them in our mission to enable scientific breakthroughs through connections.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/smoothies-2253430_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>How do we make sure that nutrition labels making the 5-a-day claim aren’t being used to falsely give the impression that a product is healthy?</p>
<p>The WHO 5-a-day fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines generally recommend consideration of fruit juice as only one FV portion regardless of quantity, for reasons based on processing and fiber breakdown.</p>
<p>If a product claims to contain two or more portions of your 5-a-day FV, this should come from more than one fruit or vegetable and it should also be ensured that that the serving size is appropriate and the amounts of saturated fat, salt and sugar are limited.</p>
<p>Although there are government schemes in place in various countries, manufacturers will sometimes make their own claims on food packaging, which are not covered by government regulations. Provided that manufacturers are following the best practice guidelines for the industry, this should mean that the product contains 80g (or more) of fruit or vegetables in one serving.</p>
<p>Food product labels which highlight the healthy component of a product can have positive impacts of healthy dietary profiles. However, if the ‘healthy component’ of a product is exaggerated, this could lead to negative effects.</p>
<p>With this in mind, researchers from Bournemouth University carried out a study, recently published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, which investigated the impact of a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ versus a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ smoothie product label on subsequent FV consumption. Using an acute experimental design, 194 participants (90 males, 104 females) were randomized to consume a smoothie labelled as either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ in full, following a usual breakfast.</p>
<p>Two FV product labels were used. Each product label stated the product as a ‘smoothie’, included the smoothie flavor, and stated either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’, using the recognized national UK logo for the 5-a-day FV message. All participants were asked to look at their smoothie before consumption and were required to consume their smoothie in full, although neither the label nor the message were mentioned</p>
<p>Subsequent FV consumption was assessed using 24-h recalls.</p>
<p>The authors found that exposure to a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ FV label following a usual breakfast resulted in reduced subsequent FV consumption compared to exposure to a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ label. This can probably be explained by the fact that consumers felt they had achieved higher adherence to the dietary goal by consuming the product with this label and therefore allowed themselves lower adherence with subsequent FV consumption.</p>
<p>The effect viewed was largely driven by changes in consumption in usual high FV consumers, in females, and in vegetable as opposed to fruit consumption.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate the potentials dangers of providing exaggerated information on food product labels with regards to FV provision. Greater regulation may be required to ensure accuracy in these types of messages.</p>

So we were delighted when we were able to enter into discussions with Dove Medical Press, as they fit so well with our plans. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>Dove Medical Press is a small and entrepreneurial company, with staff based in Auckland and Macclesfield, all of whom are committed to excellent service to authors, and high-quality peer review. They publish around 100 journals, of which 12 have impact factors ranging from 1.7 to 7 –  almost all of them placed within the top two quartiles of the Journal Citation Report. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>Two more titles are set to receive Impact Factors in the next release of the JCR. The vast majority of the rest of the journals are indexed in the DOAJ, PubMed and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (<a href="http://mjl.clarivate.com/cgi-bin/jrnlst/jlresults.cgi?PC=EX">ESCI</a>). All of these indexes perform in-depth checks on the quality and integrity of the contents of journals before accepting them for indexing. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>We chose to buy Dove because we were impressed by the quality of their content, the quality of their peer review, their focus on author experience, and their loyal author following, with a high percentage of repeat authors. We rated it a very good business in its own right and knew that we would learn from them as we continued to develop our own open access offerings.</span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: How much did T&amp;F pay for Dove?</span></i></b><span></span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><span>DK:</span></b><span> This wasn’t disclosed at the time of acquisition.

Frankly, I don’t understand why this information needs to be secret, although I suppose it fits with the secrecy that has always surrounded Dove. When I interviewed Dove’s Tim Hill in 2008 he refused to tell me who the owners of Dove were and denied that (despite what some believed) there was any connection between Libertas Academica (LA) and Dove, or with him (aside from the fact that the owner of LA was his son). </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Then, when in 2010 I <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-i-wont-be-doing-that-video.html">emailed him</a> to point out that New Zealand Companies House records that he had one time been the sole director and shareholder of LA, and had in fact  been a director of LA when he told me in 2008 that there was no connection, he responded, “Henceforth I will not be providing you with any comment or information on any subject.” In 2016, I tried to make contact with Dove directors Graeme Peterson and Kevin Toale, neither of whom responded. </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Can you tell me why there has always been this kind of secrecy surrounding Dove? OA advocates argue that scholarly publishing is primarily funded by the taxpayer and so should be transparent both in process and financing. There is now also a widespread belief that there should be even greater transparency with regard to medical research, and those who publish it, not least because it is felt that pay-to-publish OA has made it easier for pharmaceutical and medical device companies to use scholarly papers as marketing tools. Do you agree that there are dangers here and that greater transparency is essential? </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><span>DK:</span></b><span> I do believe that there should be transparency in all scholarly publishing, both in traditional subscription and open access publishing. <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a>, <a href="https://oaspa.org/">OASPA</a>, <a href="http://www.wame.org/">WAME</a> and the <a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a> have collaborated to identify <a href="https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>, and these principles form part of the criteria on which membership applications to those organizations are evaluated. All Dove journals are <a href="https://bit.ly/2JeQrsr">included in the DOAJ</a> and have “<a href="https://doaj.org/faq#thetick">the tick</a>”, which means they have met the high level of compliance to these criteria. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>All Dove journals are also members of COPE and have met their membership criteria also.</span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>I don’t think that there has been secrecy around Dove Medical Press. Information about the company <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04967656">has been available from Companies House</a> since they came into existence in 2003. Nothing in our due diligence suggested anything to the contrary. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>Tim Hill (from Dove) is Tom Hill’s father, and he may have helped his son establish Libertas Academica in the first instance. However, Tim Hill was not involved in the direction or any of the operations of Libertas Academica. No current Dove staff have ever worked with or as part of Libertas Academica, nor do the two companies share any operations.</span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /><a name="more"></a></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: Dove is registered in the UK but, as I understand it, the company actually operates out of New Zealand. Did that present any particular issues during the negotiation process? Does it present any difficulties today?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><span>DK:</span></b><span> Dove has offices in both Macclesfield and Auckland with 1/3 of the staff in the UK and 2/3 in New Zealand.

Companies House records show there were four directors of the company – Graeme Peterson, Philip Smith, Kevin Toale and John Stolz.

This <a href="https://oaspa.org/dove-medical-press-reinstated-as-oaspa-members/">led to their OASPA membership being reinstated</a>, resulted in an extremely robust peer review process described in detail in their peer review schematic on <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3526">this page</a>. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>In fact, some of the additional checks they have added since that schematic was published go way beyond what most publishers do in their peer review process. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>These are in addition to the usual ethical checks which quality medical journals perform, and include: checking the affiliations of all authors and checking retractionwatch.com to identify whether any of the authors have been involved in unethical practices; manuscripts being checked for duplicate submission or publication and run through the SciDetect software; and IP address checks to make sure that there is no COI between author, reviewer and Editor. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Due diligence</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: Publishing a schematic is surely a good idea.

What we do know is that it occurred in the wake of the Amy Bishop affair, in which publicity was given to a controversial paper authored by her and published by </span></i></b><b><span><a href="https://www.dovepress.com/international-journal-of-general-medicine-journal">Dove’s International Journal of General Medicine</a><i>. Controversially, Bishop added the names of her minor children as co-authors of the paper. At the time (February 2010) I <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2010/02/open-access-linked-to-alabama-shooting.html">wrote an article</a> about the incident in which I raised the issue of ownership and transparency, and quoted Peter Suber saying, “I am deeply suspicious of publishers who are unwilling to disclose their owners. We need that kind of transparency to be able to investigate whether the owners have financial interests, e.g. with pharma companies, that might compromise the integrity of their journals.” When I asked OASPA for the reason Dove had withdrawn I was told, “We had a few exchanges by email following your article and they then withdrew their membership. I asked them if they could give me a reason but they gave none.”</i></span></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Here it is worth noting that co-founder of OASPA Gunther Eysenbach <a href="https://oaspa.org/response-to-the-recent-article-in-science/#comment-5201">has repeatedly alleged</a> that Dove engages in “questionable publishing practices”. And at the time when OASPA terminated Dove’s membership in 2013 he referred back to the Amy Bishop paper and said that it had disappeared from its website without “any proper retraction notice/process”. (The <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/effects-of-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-on-motor-neuron-sur-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM">paper</a> appears to have been reposted later, again with no indication of its disappearance and reappearance).

This showed up some inadequacies in the peer review processes of those journals. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>As a result of the Bohannon sting in 2013 and their OASPA membership being terminated, Dove worked closely with OASPA to improve their editorial processes and the OASPA Membership Committee were satisfied with those improvements. As I mentioned earlier, Dove also continue to enhance those processes. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: While we are on the historical issues, in 2011 I was contacted by a US-based publisher who said that Dove had on two occasions launched a journal “identical or nearly identical” to this publisher’s own journals. The publisher added that only after a great deal of pressure from them did Dove change the titles of the two copycat journals. The publisher also pointed out that nine of Dove’s journals had the same EiC, many of which journals were unrelated to that EiC’s specialism.

It is keeping COPE very busy, and there are few journals or publishers who have avoided being featured on Retraction Watch’s pages. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>In the case of the <i>International Journal of Women’s Health</i> paper our investigations show that the peer review was carried out to high standards and that the journal behaved well, and the authors</span><span> responses have satisfied us that the complaints are unfounded.</span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>As per ethical guidelines, we have offered the complainant the chance to write a Letter to the Editor with his concerns, which we would publish along with a response from the authors.

The fact that publishers are amending the scholarly record when they find that there are errors in the literature is a healthy thing.

In fact, this second paper finds that the rising number of retractions is most likely to be caused by a growing propensity to retract flawed and fraudulent papers, and there is little evidence of an increase in the prevalence of misconduct. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>And no, you are misinterpreting my previous comment.
