                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Renee Hoch, Senior Editor &amp; Manager of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team</p>



<p>Since 2003, PLOS has published nearly 300,000 research articles, contributing a tremendous body of knowledge to the scientific corpus. However, our roles in scientific communications do not end at the time of publication. PLOS, like many other scholarly publishers, has a Publication Ethics team dedicated to addressing ethics and integrity concerns raised about PLOS content, many of which arise after publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS Publication Ethics receives a broad array of inquiries, ranging from correctable reporting errors to more serious issues, including data analysis, data integrity, or reporting concerns, study design flaws, authorship and data ownership disputes, and highly sensitive matters involving research ethics, publication ethics, and potential misconduct. Altogether, PLOS has been notified of post-publication ethics or integrity concerns for &lt;1% of our published research articles, and thus far we have issued 380 retractions (~0.13% of PLOS research articles). We are not alone: the Retraction Watch Database<sup>1</sup> includes over 17,000 retracted research articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="issuesnot-identified"><a href="#issuesnotidentified">Why are these issues not identified before publication</a></h2>



<p>All PLOS research articles are peer-reviewed, but peer review has its limitations. A manuscript is typically evaluated by 2-4 people during pre-publication peer review, whereas after publication it is available to a much broader audience, including collaborators, other researchers, those exploring ethics and integrity in the research literature, and even the press and general public. As open access publications, PLOS articles are freely available for all to read, and each reader views the work through their unique perspective. With many more eyes on the content post-publication, it is perhaps unsurprising that issues may come to light after having slipped unnoticed through peer review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, some issue types (e.g. data ownership concerns) cannot be identified from the article content alone or involve people who would not typically be involved in peer review. We do not expect these types of concern to be detectable pre-publication.</p>



<h2 id="editorial-actions"><a href="#editorialactions">Editorial actions are not indicators of misconduct</a></h2>



<p>While social media and news outlets often highlight egregious cases and/or those involving misconduct, much of what the PLOS Publication Ethics team sees may have arisen due to honest errors. Importantly, it is beyond the journal&rsquo;s or publisher&rsquo;s remit to adjudicate on intent or personal culpability. Regardless of who was responsible, regardless of whether issues arose due to honest errors or deliberate misconduct, and regardless of when issues are noticed, PLOS has a responsibility to take action as needed to ensure the integrity and reliability of our publications. We take this responsibility very seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="whatittakes"><a href="#whatittakes">What it takes to resolve publication ethics cases</a></h2>



<p>Each publication ethics case &ndash; even for seemingly straightforward issues &ndash; takes its own path and involves multiple contributors. This is very demanding work. It involves a bit of sleuthing, rigorous scientific assessment, and sensitive correspondence with researchers, institutions, and readers around the globe. It also requires resilience and tenacity &ndash; and time, as is discussed further in Q2, below. Our Publication Ethics editors abide by the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a> guidance and are very careful to provide due respect to all contributors, due process to every case, and due consideration to every editorial decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS often receives questions about why we have taken so long to resolve issues raised to us or noted on Pubpeer a few years back. Many cases we are working through currently are from our ethics case backlog (discussed in Q3, below) which developed before we had a dedicated Publication Ethics team. The time between an initial notification and case resolution also reflects how the case has been prioritized by PLOS and the time required for PLOS and external contributors to complete various steps in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, I expand on some of these points and other frequently asked questions..&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of our Publication Ethics team, I sincerely thank all who support PLOS in our efforts to address ethics and integrity issues, including authors, editors, reviewers, institutions, those who identify concerns and bring them to our attention, and our PLOS colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>If you have a concern about the integrity or reliability of PLOS content, please email the PLOS Publication Ethics team at </em><a href="mailto:pub-ethics@plos.org"><em>pub-ethics@plos.org</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>



<h2 id="howmany"><em><a href="How%20many%20cases%20does%20PLOS%20receive%20vs.%20resolve%20each%20year?%C2%A0">Q1: How many cases does PLOS receive vs. resolve each year?&nbsp;</a></em> </h2>



<p>In 2018-2021, our Publication Ethics team resolved &gt;800 publication ethics cases and received &gt;1100 new ones. Our team expanded in 2021 to address this disparity and create additional capacity for backlog case work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="Whydoes"><em><a href="Why%20does%20it%20take%20so%20long%20to%20resolve%20publication%20ethics%20cases?">Q2: Why does it take so long to resolve publication ethics cases?</a></em>&nbsp; </h2>



<p>The time between when we receive an issue and when we resolve the case reflects both where the case falls on our priority-ranked &lsquo;to-do&rsquo; list, and how much time the case actually requires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we begin working on a post-publication case, it typically takes us ~4-8 months to bring it to resolution, although this varies considerably. This process involves a number of contributors each of whom takes anywhere from one week to multiple months to do their part (see table, below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When thinking about the time required for this work, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that these aren&rsquo;t just cases &ndash; they&rsquo;re people. People whose work is being questioned, sometimes years after it was completed. People who may have retired or left academic research. People who are carving time out of their busy schedules to help PLOS on a volunteer basis. People who may be involved in investigating multiple concurrent integrity cases for an institution. People who are juggling a multitude of responsibilities &ndash; research, teaching, clinical practice, grant writing and review, not to mention family and other personal priorities. Over the last couple years, those involved in these cases have also been coping with the pandemic and the associated institutional closures, illnesses, and lockdown mandates. Although we work to keep cases moving along designated timelines, these personal considerations can impact and extend the process.</p>

<h2 id="ethics-backlog"><a href="Why%20does%20PLOS%20have%20an%20ethics%20case%20backlog,%20and%20what%20are%20we%20doing%20to%20address%20it?"><em>Q3: Why does PLOS have an ethics case backlog, and what are we doing to address it?</em> </a></h2>



<p>PLOS has always addressed concerns raised about our submissions and publications. For several years, these cases trickled in at a relatively low rate and were handled by the journals&rsquo; staff editors and Editorial Services teams, among their many other responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 2014-2016 our case numbers spiked: in addition to the steady stream of varied publication ethics concerns, PLOS received &gt;400 post-publication image integrity cases. Those responding to these inquiries were quickly overwhelmed: the journal&rsquo;s editors worked tirelessly, but could each handle only a couple cases at a time while juggling their other tasks. Hence, an ethics case backlog amassed quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At that time, we didn&rsquo;t know if this was a one-off collection of cases, or if we would continue to receive cases at this unexpectedly high pace. We diverted internal staff resources to help where possible, but in essence PLOS was not yet equipped to respond to publication ethics issues at this scale. We needed more resources. In response, PLOS gradually built up a dedicated Publication Ethics team. This started with a single dedicated <em>PLOS ONE</em> editor in 2017, and has grown to a team of five Senior Editors serving all PLOS journals as a Center of Excellence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2021 the PLOS Publication Ethics team began a multi-year project dedicated to addressing our ethics case backlog, some of which dates back to that 2014-16 surge. This is a large undertaking that we anticipate will require at least two years, but we are committed to ensuring that all issues which have been raised to us receive their due attention.</p>



<h2 id="articles-offline"><em><a href="Why%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20PLOS%20take%20articles%20offline%20or%20post%20interim%20notices%20while%20they%20are%20under%20investigation?">Q4: Why doesn&rsquo;t PLOS take articles offline or post interim notices while they are under investigation?</a> </em> </h2>



<p>We sincerely apologize for how long it is taking us to resolve our ethics case backlog and update the literature accordingly. We appreciate the importance of correcting the published record in a timely manner, and likewise we understand that it can negatively impact researchers and others to have problematic articles or unreliable results remain unmarked and unactioned in the published record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to requests we occasionally receive, we will not simply take an article offline while it is under investigation. Even for online-only publishers, the industry standard is to preserve the integrity and stability of the published record and to remove content only under rare circumstances.<sup>2</sup> (See also <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/corrections-expressions-of-concern-and-retractions#loc-removal-of-plos-content">PLOS policy</a> and <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a> guidance.) PLOS is highly committed to transparency in research communication, and one aspect of this is ensuring an accurate and stable record of an article&rsquo;s publication history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interim notices can benefit readers while journals and/or institutions complete their investigations, but it is important to bear in mind that a substantial fraction of issues raised to PLOS do not ultimately warrant any formal editorial action. For example, concerns may not be verified per our editorial assessments, or may reflect differences of opinion rather than bona fide errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; current standard is to complete our follow-up work on most publication ethics cases before issuing editorial notices (if needed), and publish interim Expressions of Concern only in select circumstances for articles under investigation. However, we are currently considering an expanded framework of interim notice usage wherein we would routinely notify readers of editorially verified issues sooner. Whatever our course, we will continue to assess issues carefully before taking any public editorial action, and will ensure that our actions align with PLOS policies and COPE guidance.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crater-ancient-asteroid-meteorite-impact-earth">An ancient impact on Earth led to a cascade of cratering</a></h4>

              
                <p>A bevy of craters formed by material blasted from the carving of another, larger crater — a process dubbed secondary cratering — have finally been spotted on Earth. Several groupings of craters in southeastern Wyoming, including dozens of pockmarks in all, <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article/doi/10.1130/B36196.1/611743/Secondary-cratering-on-Earth-The-Wyoming-impact">have the hallmarks of secondary cratering</a>, researchers report February 11 in <em>GSA Bulletin.</em></p>



<p>When an asteroid or another type of space rock smacks into a planet or moon, it blasts material from the surface and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/erosion-has-erased-most-earth-impact-craters-here-are-survivors">creates a crater</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/18</em>). Large blocks of that material can be thrown far from the initial crater and blast out their own holes when they land, explains Thomas Kenkmann, a planetary scientist at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg in Germany. Astronomers have long observed secondary cratering on our moon, Mars and other orbs in the solar system, but never on Earth.</p>



<p>When Kenkmann and his colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31655-4">first investigated a series of craters</a> near Douglas, Wyo., in 2018, they thought the pockmarks were formed by fragments of a large meteorite that had broken up in the atmosphere. But Kenkmann and his team later discovered similar groups of craters of the same age, somewhere around 280 million years old, throughout the region.</p>





<p>Altogether, the team found more than 30 impact craters that range between 10 and 70 meters in diameter at six different locales<em>. </em>Based on subtle but distinct differences in the alignment of elliptical craters in the groups, the researchers suggest that the impactors that blasted each set of craters struck the ground from slightly different directions.</p>



<p>The impactors that created these secondary craters probably ranged between 4 and 8 meters in diameter and struck the ground at speeds between 2,520 and 3,600 kilometers per hour, Kenkmann says. Extrapolating the paths of these impactors back to their presumed sources suggests the original crater from which they flew straddles the Wyoming–Nebraska border northeast of Cheyenne.</p>



<p>The team’s evidence “comes together very well to make a compelling story,” says Gareth Collins, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>The original crater was probably between 50 and 65 kilometers across and was created by an impactor 4 to 5.4 kilometers wide, Kenkmann and the team estimate. The crater is also probably buried under more than 2 kilometers of sediment that accumulated in the 280 million years since it formed. An equivalent amount of sediment eroded away to expose the secondary craters when the Rocky Mountains rose in the meantime.</p>



<p>“What a fortuitous discovery that these folks have made,” says Beau Bierhaus, a planetary scientist at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Littleton, Colo. He likens the short geological interval during which these craters could be discovered to the brief period between the time a fossil is first exposed to the elements and when it is eroded to dust.</p>



<p>Scouring measurements of gravitational and magnetic fields in the region for anomalies could help reveal the buried crater, the researchers note. The team may also look for heavily fractured rock and other evidence of the ancient crater in sediment cores that have been drilled during oil and gas exploration in the region, Kenkmann says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-stars-dead-white-dwarf-collision-rare-ash">A rare collision of dead stars can bring a new one to life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a phoenix, some stars may burst to life covered in “ash,” rising from the remains of stars that had previously passed on.</p>



<p>Two newfound fireballs that burn hundreds of times as bright as the sun and are covered in carbon and oxygen, ashy byproducts of helium fusion, belong to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/511/1/L66/6527770">a new class of stars</a>, researchers report in the March <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters</em>. Though these blazing orbs are not the first stellar bodies found covered in carbon and oxygen, an analysis of the light emitted by the stars suggests they are the first discovered to also have helium-burning cores.</p>



<p>“That [combination] has never been seen before,” says study coauthor Nicole Reindl, an astrophysicist from the University of Potsdam in Germany. “That tells you the star must have evolved differently.”</p>





<p>The stars may have formed <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slab134/6500207">from the merging of two white dwarfs</a>, the remnant hearts of stars that exhausted their fuel, another team proposes in a companion study. The story goes that one of the two was rich in helium, while the other contained lots of carbon and oxygen.These two white dwarfs had already been orbiting one another, but gradually drew together over time. Eventually the helium-rich white dwarf gobbled its partner, spewing carbon and oxygen all over its surface, just as a messy child might get food all over their face.</p>



<p>Such a merger would have produced a stellar body covered in carbon and oxygen with enough mass to reignite nuclear fusion in its core, causing it to burn hot and glow brilliantly, say Tiara Battich, an astrophysicist from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, and her colleagues.</p>



<p>To test this hypothesis, Battich and her colleagues simulated the evolution, death and eventual merging of two stars. The team found that aggregating a carbon-and-oxygen-rich white dwarf onto a more massive helium one could explain the surface compositions of the two stars observed by Reindl and her colleagues.</p>



<p>“But this should happen very rarely,” Battich says.</p>



<p>In most cases the opposite should occur — the carbon-oxygen white dwarf should cover itself with the helium one. That’s because carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are usually the more massive ones. For the rarer scenario to occur, two stars slightly more massive than the sun must have formed at just the right distance apart from each other. What’s more, they needed to have then exchanged material at just the right time before both running out of nuclear fuel in order to leave behind a helium white dwarf of greater mass than a carbon-and-oxygen counterpart.</p>



<p>The origins story Battich and her colleagues propose demands a very specific and unusual set of circumstances, says Simon Blouin, an astrophysicist from the University of Victoria in Canada, who was not involved with either study. “But in the end, it makes sense.” Stellar mergers are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">dynamic and complicated events</a> that can unfold in many ways, he says (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). “This is just another.”</p>

<p>I am a Canadian Registered Dietitian (RD) with interdisciplinary training in nutrition and dietetics, health administration, and nursing theory. Through my <a href="https://islandscholar.ca/people/shewko">research program</a>, I create new knowledge that empirically defines the characteristics of work settings that facilitate evidence-based, timely use of allied health services while also supporting allied health professional’s (AHPs) innovative behaviors, career satisfaction, and job satisfaction and enhancing retention of these professionals, both in specific specializations and within organizations. It is clear that the actions and leadership skills of middle managers in health care settings are key to optimal workforce outcomes. Key stakeholders for my research include employment policy-makers, health administrators, and front-line supervisors and managers of AHPs. Commonly included in the classification of allied health professions are physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and dietetics.</p>
<blockquote><p>The majority of Canadian RNs and AHPs retire well before the age of 65, and retaining them for even an average of 6 months longer could have significant impacts on the sustainability of the health workforce.</p></blockquote>
<p>To date, the results of my research have been most relevant to Sustainable Development Goals <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5">number 5</a>: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, and <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8">number 8</a>: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. In my doctoral research, I <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-on-aging-la-revue-canadienne-du-vieillissement/article/abs/conceptual-models-of-early-and-involuntary-retirement-among-canadian-registered-nurses-and-allied-health-professionals/DBB001B215A6ED62F27524977B5318A3">explored</a> retirement decision-making among Registered Nurses (RNs) and AHPs. The <a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-019-0381-5">results</a> of this study highlighted the importance of structural supports for caregivers, a key factor contributing to achieving gender equality (target 5.4). Also, having <a href="https://www.longwoods.com/content/26074/retirement-decision-making-among-registered-nurses-and-allied-health-professionals-a-descriptive">broad representation</a> from several female-dominated health professions in my analysis, these findings contribute to support for policy changes that enhance the quality of jobs (for all workers) in the health care sector (target 8.5). The majority of Canadian RNs and AHPs retire well before the age of 65, and retaining them for even an average of 6 months longer could have significant impacts on the sustainability of the health workforce.</p>

<p>Since then, I have focussed my attention on the RD workforce, which is overwhelmingly female. I have completed three studies, <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-06008-5">one</a> identifying reasons for variations in job turnover within clinical settings, a second (in press) exploring RDs’ capacity for and interest in innovation, and a third (submitted) exploring the experience and motivation of RDs working concurrently in health care and as independent sales consultants for network marketing companies. The results of these studies have highlighted how undervalued RDs feel and how few growth opportunities they encounter in their professional work. Such experiences in the health workforce are likely shared across the allied health professions as there are many similarities in the characteristics of employment for AHPs and many allied health professions are female-dominated. Were health administrators to take actions based on my research findings, such as by supporting and providing opportunities for personal growth and development in the workplace and/or by rewarding individual AHP successes, they would be contributing to women’s full and effective participation in the health workforce (target 5.5) and their full and productive employment (target 8.5). The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated existing shortages of health professionals, including AHPs, particularly in rural and underserved areas; taking action to support the retention of health professionals, such as by effectively addressing SDGs 5 and 8, enhances the sustainability of health services.</p>
<p>There are several challenges I have encountered in building my research program. First, because work in health human resources straddles “work” and “health” research, it can be considered too human resource-oriented for funders of health research and too health-oriented for funders of human resources research. I continue to gain skills in grant-writing and to seek out mentors to help me frame my work optimally for funding opportunities. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the capacity for research activities within health care settings. As a result, it has been difficult to pursue plans for on-site interventional research that may provide empirical evidence to support practices identified in survey and qualitative research as facilitating improved AHP job retention, innovativeness, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction. This summer, I look forward to conducting a study exploring the process and rationale supporting RD redeployment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.</p>

                Can you retract something that never existed in the first place? At least one journal thinks the answer to that conundrum is yes.&#160; That journal would be Medicine.

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>One of the best-known but also most contentious ideas in psychology has to be that there are &#8220;universal&#8221; expressions of at least some human emotions. According to this idea, which was pioneered by <a href="https://www.paulekman.com/resources/universal-facial-expressions/">Paul Ekman</a>, particular patterns of facial muscular movements are reliable indicators of anger, disgust, fear, surprise, happiness, sadness and contempt, no matter where you are in the world. In other words, these expressions are a fundamental part of being human.</p>



<p>The idea of universal emotional expressions has been challenged, however. Some psychologists argue that even within the US or UK, say, facial movements that we routinely associate with certain emotions — such as a smile with feeling happy — don’t reliably match in that way. Others think that facial &#8220;expressions&#8221; are better understood as social signals. According to this model, when someone smiles, it doesn’t <em>mean</em> that they’re happy but rather that they want to be sociable and cooperative, while a frown doesn’t mean &#8220;I’m angry&#8221; but rather &#8220;I want you to bend to my will&#8221;. Physical social signals, beyond facial movements, have been identified, too. And now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04370-w">new paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> enters this field, with the claim that a downwards head-tilt is a “possibly universal” signal of dominance.</p>



<span id="more-45446"></span>



<p>Zachary Witkower at the University of Toronto and colleagues studied members of a remote community in the forested Bosawas Biosphere Reserve in Mayangna, Nicaragua. Relatively few of the 119 adults (aged 18-75) were fluent in Spanish, most had never seen a US TV programme, their knowledge of global celebrities was paltry, and 94% had never used the internet. So, the team argues, they are unlikely to have learned particular ways of responding or behaving from Western culture.</p>



<p>Each participant was shown two pairs of images. The first pair showed just the eyebrow/eye/nose bridge regions of two computer-generated male heads. These heads, which had neutral facial expressions, were identical, except that one was upright and the other was tilted forwards 10 degrees. An experimenter said: &#8220;Please select the image in which the person is likely to be a leader because he is willing to use aggression and intimidation to get his way&#8221; and the participants made a choice. Then they were shown the same two heads, but in full this time, and were asked the same question.</p>

From <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04370-w">Witkower et al (2022</a>)</center></figcaption></figure>



<p>When American participants were given this task, they tended to choose the head-tilted image. This was true whether they saw the eye region or the full head. And Witkover and colleagues found the same thing for this remote population. When only the facial strip was shown, the head-tilted version was chosen as the likely aggressive leader 72% of the time. When full faces were shown, the head-tilted version was chosen 84% of the time. A forwards head tilt was clearly associated with dominance/aggression.</p>



<p>As the effect was stronger for full faces, it might be that the whole face gives more anger/dominance information than the eye region alone. However, as the researchers note, because the full-face pair always followed the eye-region pair, participants might just have become more confident in their perceptions of anger/dominance on the second viewing.</p>



<p>A big question is: what explains the finding?</p>



<p>The researchers argue that when the head is tilted down a little, this gives the illusion that the brow has been lowered. Numerous studies have linked a lowered, frowning brow with anger, dominance and threat. This new research “provides the first evidence to suggest that humans across highly diverse cultural contexts perceive dominance from a downwards head tilt alone,” the team writes. And because they think it’s due to the illusion that the brow has been lowered, signalling anger/threat, they argue that “this visual illusion might therefore be a universal feature of human cognition”.</p>



<p>Why <em>should</em> a lowered brow signal threat/anger? The team suggests that we evolved to automatically associate angles in our environment with threat and danger. According to this idea, sharp, angular things (like rocks) would generally have been dangerous — and the angular V-shape that forms when the brow is lowered might have come to signify threat, too.</p>



<p>But there are other potential explanations for their findings. Their theory could even be flipped on its head. Picture someone about to run at you, to attack. Their head will be tilted forwards, not straight upright. So a downward tilted head could itself be a signal of threat. And a frown may give the illusion that this is happening — rather than a downward head tilt giving the illusion of a scowl.</p>



<p>Claims of human &#8220;universals&#8221; are always subject to strong scrutiny. The team’s claims will be no different. It will take more research, especially on more non-WEIRD populations, to rule out other possibilities and firm up their ideas.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04370-w">Is a downwards head tilt a cross-cultural signal of dominance? Evidence for a universal visual illusion</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crocodile-ancestor-ate-dinosaur-fossil-stomach">Fossils show a crocodile ancestor dined on a young dinosaur</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, scientists have found indisputable evidence that an ancient crocodile ancestor chowed down on a dinosaur.</p>



<p>Preserved within a fossilized crocodyliform, a member of a newfound species dubbed<em> Confractosuchus sauroktonos,</em> are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2022.01.016">the partially digested remains of a juvenile bipedal ornithopod</a>, paleontologist Matt White of the University of New England in Australia and colleagues report February 10 in <em>Gondwana Research.</em></p>



<p>Crocodyliforms include modern species like crocodiles and alligators as well as their ancestors. Those ancestors lived alongside dinosaurs for millions of years, and previous evidence, such as bite marks on fossilized dinosaur bones, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-indicate-wow-what-croc">hinted that croc ancestors dined on dinosaurs</a> when the opportunity arose (<em>SN: 10/24/01</em>). But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ichthyosaur-died-eating-long-creature">fossils with actual preserved stomach contents</a> are extremely rare (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). In fact, <em>C. sauroktonos </em>is only the second extinct crocodyliform fossil with identifiable stomach contents — and the first to reveal a meal of dinosaur.</p>





<p><em>C. sauroktonos</em> was about 2.5 meters long — slightly smaller than an adult female American alligator — and lived between 104 million and 92.5 million years ago in what is now Queensland, Australia. Similarities between the creature’s skull features and those of living and extinct crocodyliforms suggest that it didn’t just eat dinos. <em>C. sauroktonos</em> probably cast a wide net when it came to seeking out prey.</p>



<p>As for the grisly contents of its gut — including a few ribs and bits of leg and arm bone — they represent the first ornithopod ever found in Queensland’s Winton rock formation. The herbivorous dino may also be a new species, although it’s difficult to tell from these few pieces, the team says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/21/when-were-in-a-good-mood-were-more-likely-to-engage-in-healthy-behaviours/">When we’re in a good mood, we’re more likely to engage in healthy behaviours</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>On some days, waking up and engaging in healthy behaviours is easy — you get up, hit the gym, drink enough water and spend time with friends. On others, even getting out of bed seems like too much effort.</p>



<p>Knowing <em>how</em> to encourage healthy behaviours is therefore pretty useful, and much research has been done on what makes them stick, whether that’s <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/01/22/your-perfect-new-excuse-for-ordering-unhealthy-food-and-drink-altruistic-indulgence/">avoiding indulgent friends</a> or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/03/people-will-pay-money-to-avoid-having-to-exert-self-control/">paying to remove temptation</a>. And a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-021-09924-z">new study</a> from a Kent State University team, published in <em>Motivation and Emotion</em>, finds that positive mood can also encourage healthy behaviour — at least in the short term.</p>



<span id="more-45438"></span>



<p>Over the course of ten days, participants responded to questionnaires administered by email five times a day at random times. First, they rated their current emotional state (e.g. scared, guilty, distressed, happy, or satisfied) using a seven point scale; these ratings were combined to produce overall positive and negative mood scores. Participants also reported whether they had engaged in four healthy behaviours: exercising, spending time with someone supportive, taking part in a hobby, and relaxation or meditation.</p>



<p>As the team anticipated, participants who generally felt more positive mood were likely to engage in healthy behaviours, while those who felt more negative mood were less likely to engage in these behaviours. And momentary changes in mood contributed to such behaviours <em>within</em> participants as well. When participants reported more positive mood at one questionnaire, they tended to report engaging in more healthy behaviours at the next one. (Changes in negative mood, however, had no effect).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the impact of a good mood didn’t seem to last. Over time, the impact of positive affect on health behaviour started to weaken — in fact, good mood only seemed to have an impact within a day, not across days.</p>



<p>Of course, engaging in healthy behaviours can also increase positive affect: quite obviously, spending time with someone supportive or relaxing in a way you enjoy is likely to make you feel good. But these results suggest a more complex two-way relationship.</p>



<p>Sleep may play a part here: the team suggests that our moods may be &#8220;reset&#8221; with sleep. Indeed, many of us will have experienced going to bed in a bad mood and feeling a lot better in the morning. Quality of sleep is also relevant: even the best mood can be knocked by a terrible night’s sleep. Exploring the impact of sleep on the longevity of moods and their relationship with healthy behaviours could provide some further insight.</p>



<p>The findings could be helpful in actively encouraging healthy behaviours — if someone finds it difficult to motivate themselves to engage in such activities, encouraging them to do so when they feel content could be a good start. It could also, potentially, reinforce the two-way relationship between positive affect and healthy behaviour — encouraging people to engage in healthy behaviours, boosting their mood and thus encouraging more. For those who struggle with low mood, the team suggests introducing lower-demand activities such as listening to music before working up to exercise or meditation.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-021-09924-z">Positive affect predicts engagement in healthy behaviors within a day, but not across days</a></p>

                Finding papers produced by paper mills has become a major headache for many of the world&#8217;s largest publishers over the past year, and they&#8217;re largely playing catch-up since sleuths began identifying them a few years ago.

<p>Read on to learn more about the published research, which factors were important when selecting&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a></strong>, and the overall experience.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Tell us a little about your research.</strong></p>



<p>In the past few years, my work has focused on TB/HIV. In general, I enjoy exploring various global health topics, with a focus on equity and neglected populations. I like delving into the intersection of social and environmental influences and public health.</p>



<p><strong>What are the important factors that you look for when selecting a journal for your research?</strong></p>



<p>When selecting a journal for my research, I look to see if the journal aims align with my interests. I also look to see if there is flexibility when it comes to submission guidelines, such as manuscript format and word count. Finally, I generally like open access journals for a wider reach of audience.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to publish with <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>?</strong></p>



<p>My manuscript could be considered more of a narrative review backed with multiple peer-reviewed journal articles and other respected sources of guidance documents. I had multiple colleagues recommend <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> when they reviewed my manuscript, which encouraged me to explore this new journal since both quantitative and qualitative work were considered. Additionally, I felt that <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> was the best avenue to publish, since our manuscript spanned a variety of diseases (i.e. TB, NTDs, HIV) and touches upon different aspects of global health, including burden of disease, development, politics, and funding.</p>



<p><strong>What was your experience of the<em> PLOS Global Public Health</em> publishing process?</strong></p>



<p>The publishing process was easy and smooth. I was on maternity leave and juggling life with a newborn (and a toddler!) and I was not at all stressed since <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> was communicative and transparent. The timeline was fairly quick and the online centralized submission system was easy to navigate.</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to other authors considering publishing with <em>PLO</em>S Global Public Health?</strong></p>



<p>My advice is to not shy away from qualitative work or work that is at the intersection of diseases or topics. So much of public health is siloed, including work published by journals. If we want to make true positive incremental change, it is to address the multiple aspects of a disease since everything is connected.</p>



<p><strong>Would you publish with PLOS again? Why?</strong></p>



<p>I would happily publish with PLOS again. The process was transparent and the turnaround time was quick. I like that the journal has a wide scope and even wider audience reach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/core-memory-weavers-navajo-apollo-raytheon-computer-nasa">Core memory weavers and Navajo women made the Apollo missions possible</a></h4>

              
                <p>The historic Apollo moon missions are often associated with high-visibility test flights, dazzling launches and spectacular feats of engineering. But intricate, challenging handiwork — comparable to weaving — was just as essential to putting men on the moon. Beyond Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and a handful of other names that we remember were hundreds of thousands of men and women who contributed to Apollo over a decade. Among them: the Navajo women who assembled state-of-the-art integrated circuits for the Apollo Guidance Computer and the women employees of Raytheon who wove the computer’s core memory.</p>



<p>In 1962, when President John F. Kennedy <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/fly-me-to-the-moon">declared</a> that putting Americans on the moon should be the top priority for NASA, computers were large mainframes; they occupied entire rooms. And so one of the most daunting yet crucial challenges was developing a highly stable, reliable and portable computer to control and navigate the spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA chose to use cutting-edge integrated circuits in the Apollo Guidance Computer. These commercial circuits had been introduced only recently. Also known as microchips, they were revolutionizing electronics and computing, contributing to the gradual miniaturization of computers from mainframes to today’s smartphones. NASA sourced the circuits from the original Silicon Valley start-up, Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild was also leading the way in the practice known as outsourcing; the company opened a factory in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, which by 1966 employed 5,000 people, compared with Fairchild’s 3,000 California employees.</p>



<p>At the same time, Fairchild sought low-cost labor within the United States. Lured by tax incentives and the promise of a labor force with almost no other employment options, Fairchild opened a plant in Shiprock, N.M., within the Navajo reservation, in 1965. The Fairchild factory operated until 1975 and employed more than 1,000 individuals at its peak, most of them Navajo women manufacturing integrated circuits.</p>



<p>It was challenging work. Electrical components had to be placed on tiny chips made of a semiconductor such as silicon and connected by wires in precise locations, creating complex and varying patterns of lines and geometric shapes.

<p>In a <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2017/01/102770254-05-01-acc.pdf">brochure commemorating the dedication of the Shiprock plant</a>, Fairchild directly compared the assembly of integrated circuits with what the company portrayed as the traditional, feminine, Indigenous craft of rug-weaving. The Shiprock brochure juxtaposed a photo of a microchip with one of a geometric-patterned rug, and another of a woman weaving such a rug. That portrayal, Nakamura argues, reinforced racial and gender stereotypes. The work was dismissed as “women’s work,” depriving the Navajo women of appropriate recognition and commensurate compensation. &nbsp;Journalists and Fairchild employees also “depict[ed] electronics manufacture as a high-tech version of blanket weaving performed by willing and skillful Indigenous women,” Nakamura notes, yet “the women who performed this labor did so for the same reason that women have performed factory labor for centuries — to survive.”</p>



<p>Far from the Shiprock desert, outside of Boston, women employees at Raytheon assembled the Apollo Guidance Computer’s core memory with a process that in this case directly mimicked weaving. Again, the moon missions demanded a stable and compact way of storing Apollo’s computing instructions. Core memory used metal wires threaded through tiny doughnut-shaped ferrite rings, or “cores,” to represent 1s and 0s. All of this core memory was <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/4/">woven by hand</a>, with women sitting on opposite sides of a panel passing a wire-threaded needle back and forth to create a particular pattern. (In some cases, a woman worked alone, passing the needle through the panel to herself.)</p>

<p>Apollo engineers referred to this process of building memory as the “LOL,” or “Little Old Ladies,” method. Yet this work was so mission critical that it was tested and inspected multiple times. Mary Lou Rogers, who worked on Apollo, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8148730.stm">recalled</a>, “[Each component] had to be looked at by three of four people before it was stamped off. We had a group of inspectors come in for the federal government to check our work all the time.”</p>



<p>The core memory was also known as rope memory, and those who supervised its development were “rope mothers.” We know a great deal about one rope mother — Margaret Hamilton. She has been recognized with the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/11/22/celebrating-presidential-medal-freedom-winners-science-and-tech-garwin-hopper-and">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, among other awards, and is now remembered as the woman who oversaw most of the Apollo software. But her efforts were unrecognized by many at the time. Hamilton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/13/margaret-hamilton-computer-scientist-interview-software-apollo-missions-1969-moon-landing-nasa-women">recalled</a>, “At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal. But then they began to realize how much they were relying on it…. Astronauts‘ lives were at stake. Our software needed to be ultrareliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the hardware.” Yet, little is known about the thousands of others who performed this mission-critical work of weaving integrated circuits and core memory.</p>

<p>At the time, Fairchild’s representation of the Navajo women’s work as a feminine craft differentiated it from the high-status and masculine work of engineering. As Nakamura has <a href="https://lnakamur.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/indigenous-circuits-nakamura-aq.pdf">written</a>, the work “came to be understood as affective labor, or a ‘labor of love.’” Similarly, the work performed at Raytheon was described by Eldon Hall, who led the Apollo Guidance Computer’s hardware design, as “<a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cpo/vol7/iss2/4/">tender loving care</a>.” Journalists and even a Raytheon manager presented this work as requiring no thinking and no skill.</p>



<p>Recently, the communications scholar Samantha Shorey, engineer Daniela Rosner, technologist Brock Craft and quilt artist Helen Remick firmly overturned the notion that weaving core memory was a “no-brainer” with their <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/dkrosner/files/CHI-2018-Core-Memory.pdf">Making Core Memory</a> project. In nine workshops, they invited participants to weave core memory “patches” using metal matrices, beads and conductive threads, showcasing the deep focus and meticulous attention to detail required. The patches were then assembled in an electronic quilt that played aloud accounts from 1960s Apollo engineers and Raytheon managers. The Making Core Memory collaboration challenged the dichotomy of masculine, high-status, well-paid science and engineering cognitive labor versus feminine, low-status, low-paid, manual labor.</p>



<p>A 1975 NASA report that summarized the Apollo missions spoke glowingly of the Apollo computing systems — but mentioned none of the Navajo or Raytheon women. “<a href="https://history.nasa.gov/apsr/Apollopt3-1.pdf">The performance of the computer was flawless</a>,” the report declared. “Perhaps the most significant accomplishment during Apollo pertaining to guidance, navigation, and control was the demonstration of the versatility and adaptability of the computer software.” </p>



<p>That computer, and that software, relied on the skilled, technical, embodied expertise and labor of thousands of women, including women of color. They were indubitably women of science, and their untold stories call us to reconsider <em>who</em> does science, and what counts as scientific expertise.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Social distancing has been a key part of the pandemic response: we all know that our chance of infection is reduced if we minimise the contact we have with others. Yet there are countless stories of people covertly meeting up with friends and family even at the height of lockdown.</p>



<p>Clearly many of those who disregarded the rules did so because of a desire for social interaction and support. But a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01052-4">new study</a> in <em>Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications</em> suggests there may be another reason too: we simply underestimate the risk of contracting Covid-19 from friends.</p>



<span id="more-45413"></span>



<p>Across a series of five studies, Tobias Schlager from the University of Lausanne and Ashley V Whillans from Harvard Business School found that people consistently feel that friends are less of a Covid risk than strangers.</p>



<p>In the first study, participants assessed the likelihood of catching Covid from a friend, family member, stranger, work colleague, or acquaintance, rating the risk of each “compared to any other person”. The team found that participants actually believed most of these people posed lower risk than the average person, but crucially they rated friends the lowest risk and strangers the highest.</p>



<p>If participants had been around strangers more than friends during the pandemic, it would make sense that they’d rate strangers as higher risk. So in the next study the team asked participants to imagine they had gone to the supermarket and met a friend, family member, cashier, stranger, and colleague. They rated the likelihood of contracting Covid from each of these people using the same scale as before, and also indicated how long they’d expect to talk to them.</p>



<p>Participants rated friends and family as posing significantly lower risk than the average person. They also rated the cashier as significantly higher risk than the average person, followed by the stranger. These results held even when the team controlled for the expected length of time interacting with each person, so it wasn&#8217;t simply that participants saw strangers as a higher risk due to spending more time around  them.</p>



<p>In another experiment, participants imagined they were out to dinner and were approached either by a friend they hadn’t seen in a while or a stranger, who invited the participant to join them. People were more likely to say they’d join a friend’s table than a stranger’s. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team&#8217;s analysis showed that this was partly because participants were more interested in having dinner with the friend, and also because they thought the friend more likely to follow social distancing rules. But there was another reason too: participants rated the stranger as a greater Covid threat (believing they were more likely to be infected, for example), and this belief also contributed to their decision.</p>



<p>Finally, the team also found some evidence that people may physically distance themselves more from strangers than friends. Participants positioned a figure on their screen to indicate how close they would stand next to someone else in a park; those who read they were meeting a friend placed the figures closer than those who read they were meeting a distant colleague. However, participants who were also reminded about the dangers associated with spending time in close proximity to others put a greater distance between themselves and the friend.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the work provides quite convincing evidence that people underestimate the risk posed by friends. And yet, the authors note, close contacts actually play a key role in spreading the disease. Counteracting the perception that our friends are less of a risk to us could therefore be an important part of pandemic communication strategies.</p>



<p>The results are consistent with other work finding that familiarity and trust is related to reduced perceptions of risk, the team notes. They are also reminiscent of the illusory superiority bias, in which we think of ourselves as “better than average” <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/23/most-of-us-think-were-more-environmentally-friendly-than-our-peers/">in various</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">ways</a>. Some work has found that we also believe that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">our friends or partners are superior to other peers</a> — so perhaps this is a similar effect, where we see our friends as “better” than average at not spreading disease.</p>



<p>There are some limitations. In particular, all of the studies are based on self-report data and imaginary scenarios. The authors note that in the middle of the pandemic it would not have been possible to conduct a real-world experiment; still, it would be interesting to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">use other methods such as virtual reality</a> to look at how people behave towards friends and strangers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pants-oldest-ancient-horseman-asia-culture-origin">The world’s oldest pants stitched together cultures from across Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>What little rain that falls on a gravelly desert located in western China’s Tarim Basin evaporates as it hits the blistering turf. Here, in this parched wasteland, lie the ancient remains of people who made one of the biggest fashion splashes of all time.</p>



<p>Herders and horse riders who buried their dead in the Tarim Basin’s Yanghai graveyard pioneered pants making between roughly 3,200 and 3,000 years ago. Their deft combination of weaving techniques and decorative patterns — displaying influences from societies across Eurasia — yielded a pair of stylish yet durable trousers now recognized as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-pants-worn-horse-riders-3000-years-ago">the oldest such garment known in the world</a> (<em>SN: 5/30/14</em>).</p>



<p>Now, an international team of archaeologists, fashion designers, geoscientists, chemists and conservators <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352226721000908">has untangled how those trousers were made</a> and painstakingly created a modern replica. The vintage slacks weave a tale not only of textile innovation but also of how cultural practices fanned out across Asia, the researchers report in the March <em>Archaeological Research in Asia</em>.</p>



<p>“A diversity of textile techniques and patterns of different local origins, traditions and times merged into something new in this garment,” says archaeologist and project director Mayke Wagner of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. “Eastern Central Asia was a laboratory where people, plants, animals, knowledge and experiences from different directions and sources came … and were transformed.”</p>





<h4>Fashion icon</h4>



<p>One man brought the pants to scientists’ attention without uttering a word. His naturally mummified body, as well as the preserved bodies of more than 500 others, was uncovered during excavations conducted by Chinese archaeologists since the early 1970s at the Yanghai cemetery.</p>



<p>He sported an outfit that consisted of the trousers, a poncho belted at the waist, one pair of braided bands to fasten the trouser legs below the knees, another pair to fasten soft leather boots at the ankles and a wool headband with four bronze disks and two seashells sewn on it.

<p>Researchers now call him Turfan Man because the Yanghai site lies about 43 kilometers southeast of the Chinese city of Turfan.</p>



<p>Of all of Turfan Man’s garments, his trousers stood out as truly special. Not only were they older by at least several centuries than any other examples of such gear, but the Yanghai pants also boasted a sophisticated, modern look. The pants feature two leg pieces that gradually widen at the top, connected by a crotch piece that widens and bunches in the middle to increase leg mobility.</p>



<p>Within a few hundred years, mobile groups across Eurasia began wearing pants like those at Yanghai, other archaeological finds have shown. Woven leg covers connected by a flexible crotch piece eased the strain of riding horses bareback over long distances. Not surprisingly, mounted armies debuted around that time.</p>



<p>Today, people everywhere don denim jeans and dress slacks that incorporate the design and production principles of the ancient Yanghai trousers.</p>



<p>In short, Turfan Man was the ultimate trendsetter.</p>



<h4>Fancy pants</h4>



<p>Despite being so fashion-forward, the ancient Yanghai horseman left researchers wondering how his remarkable pants had been made. No traces of cutting appeared on the fabric, so Wagner’s team suspected that the garment had been woven to fit its wearer.</p>



<p>Close examination of Turfan Man’s trousers revealed a combination of three weaving techniques, the scientists report in the new study. A re-created version of the find — fashioned by an expert weaver from the yarn of coarse-wooled sheep similar to those whose wool was used by ancient Yanghai weavers — confirmed that observation.</p>



<p>Much of the garment consists of twill weave, a major innovation in the history of textiles.</p>



<p>Twill changes the character of woven wool from firm to elastic, providing enough “give” to let a person move freely in a pair of tight-fitting pants. The fabric is created by using rods on a loom to weave a pattern of parallel, diagonal lines. Lengthwise warp threads are held in place so that a row of weft threads can be passed over and under them at regular intervals. The starting point of this weaving pattern shifts slightly to the right or left for each ensuing row so that a diagonal line forms.</p>

Tibbitts</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Variations in the number and color of weft threads in the twill weave on Turfan Man’s trousers were used to create pairs of brown stripes running up the off-white crotch piece, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Textile archaeologist Karina Grömer of the Natural History Museum Vienna says she recognized twill weave on Turfan Man’s trousers when she examined them around five years ago. Grömer had previously reported that pieces of woven fabric found in Austria’s Hallstatt salt mine, where such delicate textiles preserve well, displayed the oldest known twill weave. Radiocarbon dating places the Hallstatt textiles between around 3,500 and 3,200 years old — roughly 200 years before Turfan man sported his britches.</p>



<p>People in Europe and Central Asia may have independently invented twill weaving, says Grömer, who did not participate in the new study. But at the Yanghai site, weavers combined twill with other weaving techniques and innovative designs to create high-quality riding pants.</p>



<p>“This is not a beginner’s item,” Grömer says. “It’s like the Rolls-Royce of trousers.”</p>



<p>Consider the ancient trousers’ knee sections. A technique now known as tapestry weaving produced a thicker, more protective fabric at these joints, the researchers found. A third weaving method was used on the upper border of the pants to create a thick waistband.</p>



<p>Other features of the trousers involved an unusual twining method, in which two differently colored weft threads were twisted around each other by hand and laced through warp threads, creating a decorative, geometric pattern across the knees that resembles interlocking T’s leaning to the side. The same twining method produced zigzag stripes at the trousers’ ankles and calves.</p>



<p>Wagner’s team could find only a few historical examples of such twining, including borders on cloaks of the Maori people, an Indigenous group in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Yanghai artisans also showed their ingenuity in designing a formfitting crotch piece that was wider at its center than at its ends, Grömer says. Trousers dating to a few hundred years later than the Yanghai find, found in several parts of Asia, often consist of woven legs connected by square fabric crotch pieces that resulted in a less comfortable and flexible fit. In tests with a man riding a horse bareback while wearing a re-created version of Turfan Man’s entire outfit, the trousers fit snugly yet allowed the legs to clamp firmly around the horse.</p>



<p>Today’s denim jeans are made from one piece of twill material following some of the same design principles as those favored by Yanghai pants makers three millennia ago.</p>

<h4>Clothes connections</h4>



<p>Perhaps most striking, Turfan Man’s trousers tell a story of how ancient herding groups carried their cultural practices and knowledge across Asia, spreading seeds of innovation.</p>



<p>For instance, the interlocking T pattern decorating the ancient horseman’s pants at the knees appears on bronze vessels found in what’s now China from around the same time, roughly 3,300 years ago, Wagner’s team says. The nearly simultaneous adoption of this geometric form in Central and East Asia coincides with the arrival in those regions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia">herders from West Eurasian grasslands riding horses that they domesticated 4,200 years ago or more</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/21</em>).</p>



<p>Pottery found at those horse riders’ home sites in western Siberia and Kazakhstan displays interlocking T’s as well. Any deeper meaning this pattern held aside from its artistic appeal remains unknown. But West Eurasian horse breeders probably spread the interlocking T design across much of ancient Asia, Wagner and her colleagues suspect.</p>



<p>Similarly, a stepped pyramid pattern woven into the Yanghai pants appears on pottery from Central Asia’s Petrovka culture, which dates to between around 3,900 and 3,750 years ago. The same pattern resembles architectural designs that are more than 4,000 years old from western and southwestern Asian and Middle Eastern societies, including Mesopotamian stepped pyramids, the researchers say. Tapestry weaving such as that observed on Turfan Man’s trousers also originated in those societies.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that cultural influences from throughout Asia affected ancient people in the Tarim Basin, says anthropologist Michael Frachetti of Washington University in St. Louis. Yanghai people inhabited a region at a crossroads of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-nomadic-herders-beat-path-silk-road">seasonal migration routes followed by herding groups starting more than 4,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/17</em>). Those routes ran from the Altai Mountains in Central and East Asia to Southwest Asia where Iran is located today. Excavations at sites along those routes indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bronze-age-herders-spread-farming-around-asia">herders spread crops across much of Asia</a> too (<em>SN: 4/2/14</em>).</p>



<p>Cultural transitions in the Tarim Basin may have started even earlier. Ancient DNA suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">western Asian herders in oxen-pulled wagons moved through much of Europe and Asia around 5,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>).</p>



<p>By around 2,000 years ago, herders’ migration paths formed part of a trade and travel network running from China to Europe that became known as the Silk Road. Cultural mixing and mingling intensified as thousands of local routes throughout Eurasia formed a massive network.</p>



<p>Turfan Man’s multicultural riding pants show that even in the Silk Road’s early stages, migrating herders carried new ideas and practices to distant communities. “The Yanghai pants are an entry point for examining how the Silk Road transformed the world,” Frachetti says.</p>





<h4>Looming questions</h4>



<p>A more basic question concerns how exactly Yanghai clothes makers transformed yarn spun from sheep’s wool into Turfan Man’s trousers. Even after making a replica of those pants on a modern loom, Wagner’s team is unsure what an ancient Yanghai loom looked like. No remnants of those devices have been found.</p>



<p>The researchers suspect a loom constructed to be operated from a sitting position would have made it possible to create intricate, twined patterns. Experiments with different weaving devices are the next step in untangling how Turfan Man’s trousers were made, Wagner says.</p>



<p>It’s clear, though, that the makers of these ancient pants blended several complex techniques into a revolutionary piece of apparel, says archaeologist and linguist Elizabeth Barber of Occidental College in Los Angeles. Barber has studied the origins and development of cloth and clothing in West Asia.</p>



<p>“We truly know so little about how clever the ancient weavers were,” Barber says.</p>



<p>Turfan Man may not have had time to ponder his clothes makers’ prowess. With a pair of pants like that, he was ready to ride.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/17/new-arxiv-articles-are-now-automatically-assigned-dois/">New arXiv articles are now automatically assigned DOIs</a></h4>

              
                <p>New articles submitted to arXiv are now automatically assigned DOIs that align with their arXiv ID. This makes research articles more discoverable across search engines because associated metadata is made available to the community in a reusable format.</p>
<p>DOIs (digital object identifiers) are unique and unchanging, just like the original arXiv ID number already assigned to every arXiv article. However, because DOIs are used across many different platforms, they enable greater interoperability with other services.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1165 size-full" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2022/02/DOI-Screen-Shot-v2.png" alt="arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite is 10.48550" width="251" height="144" />“Sure, the arXiv papers have had a persistent identifier for years, the arXiv identifier, and that&#8217;s a very good thing not only for citability. But with the assignment of DOIs, arXiv now becomes even more visible as an important element of the publication ecosystem,” said Dr. Irina Sens, Deputy Director and Head of Library Operations at the Technische Informationsbibliothek in Germany, which organizes arXiv’s largest member consortium. “The DataCite metadata schema enables connections to other persistent identifiers, for example researchers’ ORCIDs and institutional RORs, and other content like associated research data – and offers easy tracking of research outputs through simple user interfaces. That’s a huge step forward.”</p>
<h4>DOIs align with arXiv IDs</h4>
<p>An author can determine their article’s DOI by using the DOI prefix https://doi.org/10.48550/ followed by the arXiv ID (replacing the colon with a period). For example, the arXiv ID <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01037">arXiv:2202.01037</a> will translate to the DOI link <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.01037</a></p>
<p>Adopting DOIs helps arXiv meet the ‘<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’</a> that intend to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital material.</p>
<p>DOI registration of arXiv articles began on January 1, 2022 with <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, and arXiv will soon begin registering DOIs for the entire corpus. The process is expected to be complete for all records by the end of 2022.</p>

<h3>FAQ: DOIs with DataCite</h3>
<p>Starting in January 2022, arXiv began registering DOIs and submitting associated article metadata to <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> on behalf of (and at no cost to) arXiv authors. The first articles to receive DOIs are those with 2201.NNNNN identifiers, with all new articles receiving DOIs going forward. Following the successful launch, we will begin minting “arXiv DOIs” for the approximately 2M articles in arXiv’s corpus published between 1991 and 2021. The article abstract (/abs) pages are also now updated to display the arXiv DOIs following the registrations.</p>
<p><b>Why add DOIs when there are arXiv identifiers? Are arXiv identifiers going away?</b></p>
<p>The arXiv identifier has existed for more than 30 years; we will continue supporting it and you may use it in your citations as an alternative to the arXiv DOI. We are issuing DOIs for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Making article metadata available in <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/doi.org?query=client.uid%3Aarxiv.content">DataCite&#8217;s centralized location </a>allows research outputs to be more discoverable and harvestable.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Some funding agencies require DOIs for the research they are supporting.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Will I still be able to provide an external DOI and/or journal reference with my article?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we will continue to support the existing journal reference and DOI metadata fields for linking to versions of an article outside arXiv, and we strongly encourage authors to provide them when they become available.</p>
<p><b>When will the arXiv DOI for my new article become available?</b></p>
<p>If you have submitted an article from January 2022 onwards, we expect new articles to receive a DOI within 24 hours of them being announced on arXiv.</p>
<p><b>When will the arXiv DOI for my older (2021 and earlier) article become available?</b></p>
<p>We do not have an exact timeline for backfilling DOIs for older articles, but we will start with articles from 2021 and go back in time. We will periodically provide updates as we complete batches of registrations.</p>
<p><b>Where will the arXiv DOI for my article link to?</b></p>
<p>The arXiv DOI will link to the arXiv abstract (/abs) using the canonical form of the arXiv identifier, so it will always point to the latest version of the article, e.g. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.NNNNN → https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.NNNNN</p>
<p><b>What is arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite?</b></p>
<p>10.48550</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-omicron-anime-convention-nyc-superspreader-event">An anime convention in November was not an omicron superspreader event</a></h4>

              
                <p>A large anime fan convention held in New York City last November was not an omicron superspreading event despite cases of the highly contagious variant linked to the gathering, researchers report in two studies in the Feb. 18 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Vaccination and masking requirements, social distancing and improved ventilation at the event venue probably reduced transmission, the researchers say. The event also benefitted from timing, as it occurred at the very beginning of the city’s omicron wave when community transmission was low.</p>

<p>In early December, the Minnesota public health department sounded the alarm about <a href="https://animenyc.com/">Anime NYC</a>, a convention celebrating Japanese comics and cartoons that drew attendees from across the United States and 30 other countries. The state agency had identified that Peter McGinn, a Minnesota resident, had attended the event while infected with omicron.</p>





<p>This was only the second omicron case identified in the United States — and media reports labeled the 53,000-person convention <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/07/health/cdc-omicron-study-anime-convention-bn/index.html">as a potential superspreader</a> event when several of McGinn’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/world/omicron-anime-convention-nyc.html">friends, who had also attended the convention, tested positive</a>.</p>



<p>But two parallel investigations into the convention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a4.htm?s_cid=mm7107a4_w">failed to find any omicron transmission outside of this group</a>. Contact tracers interviewed McGinn as well as 22 of the 29 friends in his convention group and their household contacts. Meanwhile, a second group of researchers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a3.htm?s_cid=mm7107a3_w">used data from convention organizers to search state and local health databases</a> for positive coronavirus tests among event attendees. The search turned up 4,560 results, 119 (or 2.6 percent) of which were positive.</p>



<p>Among those 119 attendees, only 16 cases were tied to McGinn and his friends. Five of the 16 cases were sequenced, and all were identified as omicron. Outside of that cluster, 15 other sequenced cases were identified as delta.</p>





<p>Because fewer than 1 in 5 positive test specimens tied to the convention were sequenced, additional positive results could have been omicron, besides the five identified ones. But the event did not spur widespread omicron transmission, the researchers found; the test positivity rate among attendees was similar to the rate in New York City as a whole in the week after the convention, about 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s nice to confirm that the event wasn’t a spreader event,” McGinn said in an e-mail. “It makes me more comfortable in the future going to these types of events as long as mask and vax requirements are in place.”</p>



<p>The researchers also found that attendees who tested positive for any version of the coronavirus were more likely to have socialized outside the convention itself. For instance, 18.8 percent of positive attendees had attended karaoke venues in the city, compared with 2.4 percent of attendees who tested negative.</p>

<p>Omicron has spread readily at <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3158545/norway-christmas-party-largest-omicron-superspreader-outside">holiday parties</a>, <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/doctor-who-caught-omicron-at-super-spreader-event-says-pandemic-isnt-just-due-to-the-unvaccinated">weddings</a> and even <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/2/21-2422_article">between rooms in a hotel used for coronavirus quarantines</a>. The researchers attribute the lack of spread at the anime convention to layers of safety measures, including a vaccination requirement (at least one dose) for attendees, required masks and improved ventilation. The Javits Center, where the event took place, has installed HEPA air filters across the building, <a href="https://www.javitscenter.com/reopening-together">among other safety measures</a>; at previous points in the pandemic, it was used as a COVID-19 hospital and mass vaccination site.</p>



<p>But the new reports include limited detail about the impact that these filters had on actual air quality at the venue, says Krystal Pollitt, an epidemiologist and environmental health expert at Yale University. Without specific airflow measurements, she says, “it’s hard to know how much difference” the filters made.</p>



<p>Additionally, Anime NYC had “a fortunate coincidence” in its timing, says Ayman El-Mohandes, an epidemiologist and dean of the public health school at the City University of New York. Omicron was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a5.htm?s_cid=mm7103a5_w">first identified in New York City wastewater samples</a> on November 21, the final day of the convention — placing this event at the very beginning of the city’s outbreak, when community transmission was low.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had this same event happened two weeks later, it would’ve been disastrous,” El-Mohandes says. Future large events should add additional layers of safety measures, he says, such as requiring that attendees be fully vaccinated — not just one dose — and test negative prior to the event.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lizard-tail-detach-fall-off-structure-micropillar-nanopore">How lizards keep detachable tails from falling off</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lizards are famous for losing their tails, but perhaps the bigger question should be: How do their tails stay on? The answer may lie in <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh1614?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D10961430194665737653988427142427029551%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1645113274&amp;_ga=2.77920528.527777432.1645022303-1147326194.1643224741">the appendage’s internal design</a>. A structure of prongs, micropillars and nanopores holds a lizard’s tail on tight enough to handle most jarring while remaining primed to drop the tail in case of emergency, researchers report in the Feb. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Self-amputation, or autotomy, of a limb is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">a common defense strategy</a> in the animal kingdom, including for many lizard species (<em>SN: 3/8/21</em>). But it’s a risky plan: A detachable limb brings with it increased risk of accidental loss from small bumps and snags. “It has to find the just right amount of attachment, so it doesn&#8217;t come off easily. But it should also come off whenever it&#8217;s needed,” says Yong-Ak Song, a bioengineer at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. “It’s a fine balance.”</p>



<p>A lizard’s tail consists of a series of segments that connect in a row like plugs into sockets. The tail can break off along any of these points, called fracture planes, depending on how much of the tail the lizard needs to sacrifice. Between each segment, the prongs — eight cone-shaped bundles of muscles arranged in a circle — fit neatly into corresponding sockets, consisting of relatively smooth walls. Each prong is in turn covered in a forest of protrusions, or micropillars, that resemble tiny mushrooms.</p>

<p>To uncover the function of this structure, Song and colleagues first amputated tails from three species of lizards with a gentle tug and then analyzed the broken appendages under a scanning electron microscope. Zooming in on the mushroom-like protuberances revealed that each one is pockmarked with holes, or nanopores.</p>

<p>The researchers also noticed slight imprints in the interior walls of the socket left behind by the prong’s micropillars, like fingers pressed lightly into clay. This came as a surprise: They expected that the micropillars would fully interlock within the socket, more like Velcro. Instead, the pockmarked micropillars weren’t providing any extra grip that would secure the tail to its owner.</p>



<p>Suspecting that the nanopore-speckled micropillars must play another role, the team built a replica lizard tail from polydimethylsiloxane, a rubbery, fleshlike material, to mimic the separation of tail from body. This allowed the researchers to examine the forces at work during a tail amputation. They found that the deep crevasses between micropillars, along with the smaller potholes on the micropillars’ surfaces, slow the spread of an initial fracture.</p>

<p>“If there&#8217;s a crack coming in and meets a pore, which is a void, then the crack is stopped, and then it loses energy to propagate,” Song says. In other words, the beginning of a fracture can be stopped in its tracks. Every indent and groove helps: The micropillars with nanopores enhanced adhesion 15 times more than smooth prongs without micropillars, and slightly more than micropillars without nanopores. The hierarchical structure of prong, pillar and pore achieves a balance that Song describes as a beautiful example of the Goldilocks principle: not too tight, not too loose.</p>



<p>This adaptation is important for lizards to optimize their survival. While autotomy helps keep a lizard from becoming lunch, it’s a costly defense mechanism that affects a lizard’s ability to run, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/measuring-leap-lizard">leap</a>, mate and escape future predators (<em>SN: 1/5/12</em>). So, it’s important that the lizard abandons its limb only when necessary.</p>



<p>This intricately designed system is a perfect example of how evolution can continually work on something to make it more effective, says Bill Bateman, a behavioral ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, who was not part of the research. “It just blows me away.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-lost-books-archaeology-statistics">A technique borrowed from ecology hints at hundreds of lost medieval legends</a></h4>

              
                <p>King Arthur’s lasting renown is one for the books. But a statistical spotlight now shines on medieval European literature’s round table of lost and forgotten stories.</p>



<p>An international team used a mathematical formula borrowed from ecology to estimate the extent to which medieval adventure and romance tales, and documents on which they were written, have been lost over the years. Only about 9 percent of these documents <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7655">may have survived till modern times</a>, the researchers found.</p>



<p>These findings indicate that simple statistical principles can be used to gauge losses of a range of past cultural items, such as specific types of stone tools or ancient coins, literature professor Mike Kestemont of the University of Antwerp in Belgium and his colleagues report in the Feb. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Their approach represents a simple but powerful tool for studying culture, says anthropologist Alex Bentley of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who did not participate in the study. “It’s like walking into an abandoned Amazon book warehouse decades later and estimating the total number of book titles based on the numbers of surviving single and double copies that you find.”</p>





<p>Much medieval European literature, which dates to between roughly the years 600 and 1450, has been lost, and many surviving manuscripts are fragmentary. Durable parchment documents were often recycled as small boxes or for other practical uses. That has left researchers unsure about whether surviving tales and documents are representative of what once existed.</p>



<p>Kestemont’s team turned to a formula developed by environmental statistician and study coauthor Anne Chao of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. Chao’s statistical technique accounts for species that go undetected by researchers in field surveys of biological diversity. More generally, her approach can be used to estimate the number of unobserved events of any type that accompany relatively frequent observed events of the same type.</p>



<p>So, for example, this formula might be used to estimate the number of undiscovered archaeological sites in an early state society where the biggest settlements have been easier to find than smaller ones.</p>

<p>In the new study, medieval literary stories from Europe were treated as species and surviving manuscript copies of those tales were treated as sightings of a species. Counts of literary works with either one copy or two copies — the equivalent of toting up species sighted either once or twice in a survey — enabled the researchers to estimate how many literary stories have been lost because none of the documents that preserved them have survived. This method also estimated how many documents originally existed for stories that have surviving manuscripts.</p>



<p>Kestemont’s group estimates that about 799 literary tales survive today out of what would have been an original total of around 1,170 stories, at least for the six languages that were studied. The 3,648 surviving written accounts of those tales come from an estimated original total of around 40,614 documents, the researchers say.</p>



<p>More than three-quarters of medieval literary stories in German, Irish and Icelandic have survived in at least one written document, the team suggests. That figure fell to about half for Dutch and French tales and around 38 percent for English works.</p>



<p>Handwritten versions of those medieval adventure and romance stories — often created by individuals in the general population who avidly consumed fictional literature — have fared poorly across the board. Survival rates of those documents range from an estimated 4.9 percent for English yarns to 19.2 percent for Irish tales, the researchers report.</p>



<p>Literary documents on the islands of Ireland and Iceland survived relatively well at least partly because there were enough written copies of different stories, the team says. That made it harder for disasters, such as library fires, to wipe out all copies of specific stories. In contrast, copies of many medieval French stories were rare and thus more susceptible to disappearing over time.</p>



<p>French-speaking Normans conquered England in 1066, which may have led to greater neglect and recycling of manuscripts written in English, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Chao’s method may help to unveil cultural diversity in past societies, Bentley says. For instance, approximately 7,000-year-old villages in part of Germany have yielded about 40 different pottery styles. An analysis of the number of styles found on one and two pots, respectively, could be used to estimate the total number of pottery styles that once circulated in that region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-einstein-foundation-berlin-award/">PLOS partners with Einstein Foundation Berlin on Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are delighted to announce a brand new partnership with the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS is a <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">longtime advocate for quality in research</a>. However, like the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation Berlin</a>, PLOS has always sought to ensure that the definition of quality is extended beyond more reductive measures &ndash; such as venue of publication and the Journal Impact Factor &ndash; to signals and behaviors that reflect <strong>rigor, reliability, robustness, and transparency</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are well known for developing policies (e.g. our <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Availability Policy</a>), adopting standards (e.g. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/credit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRediT</a>), rolling out new features (e.g. <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protocols</a>), and encouraging behaviors (e.g. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preprinting</a>) that support a more rigorous open research ecosystem. But it is always a worthwhile reminder that these activities are never openness for openness&rsquo; sake, but are ways to enhance the <strong>quality </strong>and <strong>reliability </strong>of research, and, consequently, <strong><a href="https://plos.org/event/trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust</a> </strong>in research.</p>



<p>By establishing a global award to honor individual researchers, as well as collaborations, institutions, and organizations, Einstein Foundation Berlin is making an important statement that rigor, reliability, and transparency are to be recognized and rewarded as they directly influence increased quality in research.</p>



<p>We are excited to contribute to global awareness of this award, and encourage all interested parties to nominate and/or apply in the relevant categories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/en/award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Einstein Foundation award website</a> contains all the details, including the criteria, categories, eligibility, and a list of the jury and prior winners. The deadline for applications and nominations is <strong>April 30th, 2022</strong> at <strong>10:00 pm UTC</strong>. Winners will be announced in December, 2022.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-creativity-art-computer-program">Artificial intelligence challenges what it means to be creative</a></h4>

              
                <p>When British artist Harold Cohen met his first computer in 1968, he wondered if the machine might help solve a mystery that had long puzzled him: How can we look at a drawing, a few little scribbles, and see a face? Five years later, he devised a robotic artist called <a href="http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html">AARON</a> to explore this idea. He equipped it with basic rules for painting and for how body parts are represented in portraiture — and then set it loose making art.</p>



<p>Not far behind was the composer <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/">David Cope</a>, who coined the phrase “musical intelligence” to describe his experiments with artificial intelligence–powered composition. Cope <a href="https://newatlas.com/creative-artificial-intelligence-computer-algorithmic-music/35764/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body">once told me</a> that as early as the 1960s, it seemed to him “perfectly logical to do creative things with algorithms” rather than to painstakingly draw by hand every word of a story, note of a musical composition or brush stroke of a painting. He initially tinkered with algorithms on paper, then in 1981 moved to computers to help solve a case of composer’s block.</p>

<p>Cohen and Cope were among a handful of eccentrics pushing computers to go against their nature as cold, calculating things. The still-nascent field of AI had its focus set squarely on solid concepts like reasoning and planning, or on tasks like playing chess and checkers or solving mathematical problems. Most AI researchers balked at the notion of creative machines.</p>



<p>Slowly, however, as Cohen and Cope cranked out a stream of academic papers and books about their work, a field emerged around them: computational creativity. It included the study and development of autonomous creative systems, interactive tools that support human creativity and mathematical approaches to modeling human creativity. In the late 1990s, computational creativity became a formalized area of study with a growing cohort of researchers and eventually its own <a href="https://jcc.computationalcreativity.net/">journal</a> and <a href="https://computationalcreativity.net">annual event</a>.</p>

<p>Soon enough — thanks to new techniques rooted in machine learning and artificial neural networks, in which connected computing nodes attempt to mirror the workings of the brain — creative AIs could absorb and internalize real-world data and identify patterns and rules that they could apply to their creations.</p>



<p>Computer scientist Simon Colton, then at Imperial College London and now at Queen Mary University of London and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent much of the 2000s building the <a href="http://www.thepaintingfool.com/">Painting Fool</a>. The computer program analyzed the text of news articles and other written works to determine the sentiment and extract keywords. It then combined that analysis with an automated search of the photography website Flickr to help it generate painterly collages in the mood of the original article. Later the Painting Fool learned to paint portraits in real time of people it met through an attached camera, again applying its “mood” to the style of the portrait (or in some cases refusing to paint anything because it was in a bad mood).</p>

<p>Similarly, in the early 2010s, computational creativity turned to gaming. AI researcher and game designer Michael Cook dedicated his Ph.D. thesis and early research associate work at Goldsmiths, University of London to creating <a href="https://gamesbyangelina.itch.io/">ANGELINA</a> — which made simple games based on news articles from <em>The Guardian</em>, combining current affairs text analysis with hard-coded design and programming techniques.</p>



<p>During this era, Colton says, AIs began to look like creative artists in their own right — incorporating elements of creativity such as intentionality, skill, appreciation and imagination. But what followed was a focus on mimicry, along with controversy over what it means to be creative.</p>



<p>New techniques that excelled at classifying data to high degrees of precision through repeated analysis helped AI master existing creative styles. AI could now create works like those of classical composers, famous painters, novelists and more.</p>



<p>One AI-authored painting modeled on thousands of portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx">sold</a> for $432,500 at auction. In another case, study participants struggled <a href="https://www.donyaquick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dissertation.pdf">to differentiate the musical phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach from those</a> created by <a href="https://www.donyaquick.com/kulitta/">a computer program called Kulitta</a> that had been trained on Bach’s compositions. Even IBM got in on the fun, tasking its Watson AI system with <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/how-ibm-chef-watson-works">analyzing 9,000 recipes</a> to devise its own cuisine ideas.</p>



<p>But many in the field, as well as onlookers, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-and-creativity/">wondered if these AIs really showed creativity</a>. Though sophisticated in their mimicry, these creative AIs seemed incapable of true innovation because they lacked the capacity to incorporate new influences from their environment. Colton and a colleague described them as <a href="http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc20/papers/164-iccc20.pdf">requiring “much human intervention, supervision, and highly technical knowledge”</a> in producing creative results. Overall, as composer and computer music researcher Palle Dahlstedt puts it, these AIs converged toward the mean, creating something typical of what is already out there, whereas creativity is supposed to diverge away from the typical.</p>





<p>In order to make the step to true creativity, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/abs/big-data-and-creativity/E604C40A897436521970E110F8E1FBBA">Dahlstedt suggested</a>, AI “would have to model the causes of the music, the conditions for its coming into being — not the results.”</p>



<p>True creativity is a quest for originality. It is a recombination of disparate ideas in new ways. It is unexpected solutions. It might be music or painting or dance, but also the flash of inspiration that helps lead to advances on the order of light bulbs and airplanes and the periodic table. In the view of many in the computational creativity field, it is not yet attainable by machines.</p>



<p>In just the past few years, creative AIs have expanded into style invention — into authorship that is individualized rather than imitative and that projects meaning and intentionality, even if none exists. For Colton, this element of intentionality — a focus on the process, more so than the final output — is key to achieving creativity. But <a href="https://www.interaliamag.org/articles/simon-colton/">he wonders</a> whether meaning and authenticity are also essential, as the same poem could lead to vastly different interpretations if the reader knows it was written by a man versus a woman versus a machine.</p>



<p>If an AI lacks the self-awareness to reflect on its actions and experiences, and to communicate its creative intent, then is it truly creative? Or is the creativity still with the author who fed it data and directed it to act?</p>



<p>Ultimately, moving from an attempt at thinking machines to an attempt at creative machines may transform our understanding of ourselves. Seventy years ago Alan Turing — sometimes described as the father of artificial intelligence — devised a test he called “the imitation game” to measure a machine’s intelligence against our own. “Turing’s greatest insight,” <a href="https://core.ac.uk/display/326027014">writes</a> philosopher of technology Joel Parthemore of the University of Skövde in Sweden, “lie in seeing digital computers as a mirror by which the human mind could consider itself in ways that previously were not possible.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p><em>We all know a chronic apologiser (maybe you are one).</em> So begins a fascinating <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211065286">new paper</a> that explores how we judge frequent vs rare apologisers — and how this affects the way that we react to their apologies.</p>



<p>An abundance of work has shown that an apology for bad behaviour makes a big difference to the recipient. “Indeed, some scholars even imbue apologies with transformative and miraculous healing qualities,” note Karina Schumann at the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. However, most research in this field has explored the impact of apologies in isolation. This takes no account of a person’s general tendency to apologise. But as we all know, some people apologise readily and frequently, while others don&#8217;t.</p>



<span id="more-45403"></span>



<p>To explore how people judge frequent and infrequent apologisers, the team focused on perceptions of &#8220;communion&#8221; and &#8220;agency&#8221;. Someone high in communion strives for harmony in relationships; they show warmth and a sense of morality, and a care for the interests of others. Agency is more about the individual. A high-agency person is in control of their life; they are seen as being more dominant, powerful, competent and autonomous.</p>



<p>In an initial online study, 406 adults read one of two stories about a fictional character’s typical week. Both stories featured 12 &#8220;apology situations&#8221;, which were set at work, in a restaurant, with a friend, and so on. In six of these situations, the character had done something that clearly warranted an apology; in the other six, while an apology wasn’t unreasonable, it wasn’t necessary (apologising after interrupting the boss’s workday to ask a question, for example).</p>



<p>In one version of the story, the character apologised in all 12 instances. In the other, they didn’t apologise at all. And the results were clear: the frequent apologiser was judged to be more communal but less agentic than the non-apologiser. Frequent apologising entailed a trade-off, then — but as communion is more important for judgements of what someone else is &#8220;like&#8221;, it could be worth giving up some perceived agency to get a communion boost.</p>



<p>In a second online study, 300 people who had been in a romantic relationship for at least six months reported on how frequently their partner apologised, and also how sincere and considered their partner’s apologies tended to be. Then they rated their partners for communion and agency. As in the first study, frequent apologisers were seen as being more communal. But this time, they were only rated as being lower in agency <em>if </em>their apologies were typically poor.</p>



<p>Why do frequent but good apologisers avoid taking a hit to their perceived agency? Although accepting a personal wrongdoing carries a cost, giving an excellent, thoughtful apology could also signal that you are skilled at interacting with others — and so competent and in control. Together, these two findings suggest that people should bear in mind both the frequency and quality of their apologies, the researchers note.</p>



<p>The second study also had another component: the participants were asked to imagine that their partner had ridiculed their personal beliefs about a sensitive topic behind their back to a group of friends. They then received one of three fictional responses from their partner. One was unapologetic (&#8220;It was no big deal&#8221;). Another contained a weak apology (&#8220;I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to&#8221;). In the third, the apology was thoughtful, extensive and expressed sincere regret. The team found that, as might be expected, the high-quality apologies were received best: they resulted in higher scores for feelings of being cared for and for relationship satisfaction. However, a weak apology from a partner who routinely gave strong apologies wasn’t received as badly as the same apology from a partner who was typically bad at apologising. So someone who is generally good at apologising may get the odd free pass.</p>



<p>One notable additional finding from the studies was that whether the apologiser was male or female made no difference to the communion and agency ratings that they received. “Recent media reports suggest that women should refrain from apologising frequently because it undermines their competence,” the team observes. However, this new work suggests that men and women are equally affected in this way. Still, as they also note, &#8220;typical women&#8221; are judged to be higher in communion and lower in agency than men. So a woman who apologises often might take more of an agency &#8220;hit&#8221; than a man who does the same. This could be more of an issue in the workplace, perhaps — and this clearly needs investigating. It would also be interesting to know how we judge people who apologise for all kinds of things that aren’t their fault — such as when someone else bumps into them in the street.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that few people either apologise all the time or never, as in the first study. And the fictional misdeed in the second study was pretty serious. So the team’s findings might not apply in most everyday scenarios. Still, they feel that the key takeaway message is this: “Apologizing frequently… seems to be beneficial on the whole, and the observed cost to agency appears to be avoidable if one consistently crafts high-quality apologies.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunlight-oil-spills-clean-up-ocean-solar-radiation-deepwater-horizon">Sunlight helps clean up oil spills in the ocean more than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sunlight may have helped remove as much as 17 percent of the oil slicking the surface of the Gulf of Mexico following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill. That means that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl7605">sunlight plays a bigger role</a> in cleaning up such spills than previously thought, researchers suggest February 16 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>When sunlight shines on spilled oil in the sea, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunshine-making-deepwater-horizon-oil-stick-around">can kick off a chain of chemical reactions</a>, transforming the oil into new compounds (<em>SN: 6/12/18</em>). Some of these reactions can increase how easily the oil dissolves in water, called photodissolution. But there has been little data on how much of the oil becomes water-soluble.</p>



<p>To assess this, environmental chemists Danielle Haas Freeman and Collin Ward, both of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, placed samples of the Macondo oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill on glass disks and irradiated them with light using LEDs that emit wavelengths found in sunlight. The duo then chemically analyzed the irradiated oil to see how much was transformed into dissolved organic carbon.</p>



<p>The most important factors in photodissolution, the researchers found, were the thickness of the slick and the wavelengths of light. Longer wavelengths (toward the red end of the spectrum) dissolved less oil, possibly because they are more easily scattered by water, than shorter wavelengths. How long the oil was exposed to light was not as important.</p>



<p>Though the team didn’t specifically test for seasonal or latitude differences, computer simulations based on the lab data suggested that those factors, as well as the oil’s chemical makeup, also matter.</p>



<p>The researchers estimate irradiation helped dissolve from 3 to 17 percent of surface oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, comparable to processes such as evaporation and stranding on coastlines. What impact the sunlight-produced compounds might have on marine ecosystems, however, isn’t yet known.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent BMC article “<a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01505-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Seek COVER: using a disease proxy to rapidly develop and validate a personalized risk calculator for COVID-19 outcomes in an international network</a>” introduces a novel approach to this challenge, the use of Influenza data. There was substantial existing data on outcomes from influenza at the beginning of the pandemic. With SARS-CoV-2 also being a respiratory pathogen, could there be insights from influenza cases that would prove useful for COVID-19?</p>
<p>The study by Williams and co-authors uses an eclectic combination of claims and clinical databases from multiple countries collected from 2006-2020. Over 7 million primarily outpatient influenza cases were assembled in a common dataset. It is recognized that the quality and consistency of these electronic data is very variable. Some of the databases used lacked any variables except age and sex whilst others did not consistently record outcomes.</p>
<p>The cases selected for initial model development, however, were a random selection of 150,000 cases drawn from 2,082,077 adult outpatients with a new influenza diagnosis and a follow up of 365 days. A smaller cohort of 44,507 patients treated from January 1 to April 27 of 2020 with a diagnostic code for COVID-19 were used for one of multiple external validations.</p>
<p>The modeling effort began as a data driven regression effort resulting in 31,917 potential predictors. Acknowledging the complexity of using a model with so many predictors the investigators had clinicians examine the distribution of variables for cases with and without the three outcomes they sought to predict. These were being hospitalized with pneumonia (COVER-H), being hospitalized with pneumonia and requiring intensive care services or dying (COVER-I) or death within 30 days after initial diagnosis regardless of the intensity of treatment (COVER-F). The reduced regression models still had hundreds of predictors. So, two simplified models were created. One had age and sex, whilst the other combined age and sex with seven common co-morbid conditions such as cancer or heart disease. The latter was converted into an easy-to-use calculator for the probability of outcomes.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this extraordinary compilation of cases and ambitious modeling efforts?  First the results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is much more dangerous than Influenza. When the COVER modeling efforts were validated, discrimination varied greatly across datasets and countries, and most models were not well calibrated. This was true with their COVID-19 database, and especially within the one dataset containing hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>An editorial by Peterson, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30577-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">COVID-19 is Not Influenza</a>”, discussed the comparison of nearly 90,000 confirmed COVID-19 patients to approximately 45,000 with influenza. They found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30527-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">dramatic differences</a> in outcomes with COVID-19 being substantially more lethal.  As the COVER authors acknowledge this means their models would need to be re-calibrated by country for the increased risk that COVID-19 presents over contracting influenza.</p>
<p>Second, the well acknowledged major vulnerabilities of age and existing comorbidities that are prominent in most COVID-19 models were also identified as important risk factors in COVER. In the well-received <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3731?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">QCOVID 1 model</a> based on the U.K.’s QResearch 10.5 million population registry, age and co-morbid conditions along with a measure of economic deprivation produced accurate risk stratification for the likelihood of catching COVID-19 and then having a severe outcome (hospital admission or death) in the initial two stages of the pandemic within that country.</p>
<p>Both models also illustrate that when a very large outpatient (COVER) or population-based registry (QCOVID 1) are used for modeling, the absolute risk of severe outcomes for an individual is low. The COVER models frequently produce probabilities of serious complications between 0.01%-1%. QCOVID 1 model risk levels for contracting COVID-19 and then having a severe outcome are higher, 0.1-2%. Unfortunately, as has been tragically demonstrated, when even these small risks occur in hundreds of millions of people, hospitalizations and deaths also number in the millions.</p>
<p>The developers of the COVER models emphasize that their overall goal was to illustrate a methods development process as opposed to a model for immediate clinical impact. At the beginning of the pandemic this was an appropriate effort. They should be commended for assembling a very large common dataset, for convening a worldwide collection of investigators, and creating a clinically plausible influenza model.</p>
<p>But a large well-maintained population data registry like QResearch and modeling conducted by an established New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) in the U.K. describe an alternative approach. We may be coming to the realization that replicating these two resources now in other countries could be the most appropriate response to this pandemic, and a path to being much better prepared for the next one.</p>

<p>Likewise, less wildly hypothetical but perhaps still far-reaching changes to society, such as expanding Social Security or providing universal parental leave, can’t be tested with conventional experiments that include control and experimental groups. As a result, many behavioral scientists today have instead turned to researching “nudges” — smaller interventions that operate within existing policies. Nudges can influence human behavior, research suggests, and can be readily tested using experiments before being applied.</p>



<p>But this recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00002-2">overreliance on nudges has stifled broader behavioral science research</a> and insights into how to create a better society, Gal and marketing expert Derek Rucker of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., contend January 12 in a commentary in <em>Nature Reviews Psychology</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Nudges exploded in popularity in 2008 when economist Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago and law professor Cass Sunstein of Harvard University published a book on the topic. That research <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/richard-thaler-nobel-economic-sciences">netted Thaler a Nobel Prize</a> in Economic Sciences and inspired governments worldwide to set up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudging-people-make-good-choices-can-backfire">nudge units</a> to modify or create public policies (<em>SN: 10/9/17</em>; <em>SN:</em><em> 3/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>Examples of nudges include offering small cash rewards to encourage people to get a new vaccine or sending text reminders about a looming deadline. For instance, researchers recently revamped a court summons form and sent text reminders to get more people to attend mandatory court appointments in New York City. The intervention <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nudge-behavior-easy-interventions-help-people-show-up-court">increased court attendance</a> by roughly 20 percent over previous years, the researchers estimate (<em>SN: 10/08/20</em>).</p>





<p>But such nudges ignore thornier societal problems, such as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abc2495">over-policing in low-income neighborhoods</a> where these summons are typically issued, lawyer and sociologist Issa Kohler-Hausmann of Yale University wrote in a perspective piece that accompanied the research.</p>



<p>“Changing the approach to penal and welfare policy in our country will require interventions that are much more radical than cost-neutral behavioral nudges that everyone can agree on,” Kohler-Hausmann wrote.</p>



<p>Policy makers love nudges, Gal argues. “They don’t have to change anything fundamental.”</p>

<p>As for behavioral scientists, Gal and Rucker attribute nudges’ popularity to the scientists’ desire to mimic the precision of researchers in other fields. Medical researchers, for instance, can test pharmaceutical drugs using randomized controlled trials. With that scientific gold standard, researchers compare outcomes among patients receiving the drugs versus a placebo. Nudge researchers can likewise generate a small change — the drug — and compare outcomes among those who experience the change with those who do not.</p>



<p>“We value experiments because they give us statistically precise estimates,” Gal says.</p>



<p>But nudges that work in the lab often fail in the real world, the authors note. In one analysis, lab studies of 74 nudges and roughly half a million participants increased the desired behavior by an average of 8.7 percentage points, researchers reported in a 2020 working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research. But similar real-world studies of 243 nudges affecting over 23 million people increased the desired behavior by an average of just <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27594/w27594.pdf">1.4 percentage points</a>.</p>



<p>Rather than chasing statistical precision, Gal would like to see behavioral scientists generate overarching theories that apply beyond a single narrow context. For instance, in the U.S. legal system, juries must reach a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant. But research into conformity suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/children-may-be-especially-vulnerable-peer-pressure-robots">people copy others</a> as a result of social pressure (<em>SN: </em><em>8/15/18</em>). Unlike nudges, that research can generate insights into how human behavior interfaces with existing practices, Gal says, and raise crucial questions. In this case, is the push for unanimity preventing jurors from raising valid concerns during deliberations? “Even one dissenter can really reshape the debate and stop this tendency toward conformity,” Gal says.</p>



<p>There’s room for both theoretical and applied behavioral scientists in the field, counters data scientist Kevin Wilson of the Policy Lab, a policy research institute at Brown University in Providence, R.I. “We need people who think about theory, who are really synthesizing these lessons and, as they put it, extrapolating insights. But we also need people who are going to … utilize these insights.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, nudges are hogging all the attention, Kohler-Hausmann says. Like policy makers, funding agencies and research journal editors seem to prefer the quantifiable results that nudges offer, she says, and that near singular focus has hindered transformational change. “The cost of a narrowly defined intervention is ruling out the study of more compound, complex interventions.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Stavros Anagnou will talk about a paper
&quot;Spurious Normativity Enhances Learning of Compliance and Enforcement Behavior
in Artificial Agents&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>How do societies learn and maintain social norms? Here we use multiagent
reinforcement learning to investigate the learning dynamics of enforcement and
compliance behaviors. Artificial agents populate a foraging environment and
need to learn to avoid a poisonous berry. Agents learn to avoid eating
poisonous berries better when doing so is taboo, meaning the behavior is
punished by other agents. The taboo helps overcome a credit assignment problem
in discovering delayed health effects. Critically, introducing an additional
taboo, which results in punishment for eating a harmless berry, further
improves overall returns. This &quot;silly rule&quot; counterintuitively has a positive
effect because it gives agents more practice in learning rule enforcement. By
probing what individual agents have learned, we demonstrate that normative
behavior relies on a sequence of learned skills. Learning rule compliance
builds upon prior learning of rule enforcement by other agents. Our results
highlight the benefit of employing a multiagent reinforcement learning
computational model focused on learning to implement complex actions.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Therapeutic interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy or dialectical behavioural therapy often focus on the development of skills, such as ways to identify and actively challenge particular patterns of thought, feeling or behaviour. Indeed, research into CBT has found that the development of such skills can lead to fewer and less distressing symptoms and a reduced risk of relapse.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.23302">new study</a> looks at what happens when these interventions are explicitly framed around our strengths or weaknesses. Writing in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>, the team from Ohio State University finds that focusing on skills that are particular strengths can help people recover from sad moods faster.</p>



<span id="more-45383"></span>



<p>Participants first answered questions about their cognitive behavioural skills and were told they would receive feedback on their strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<p>They were then told they had been assigned a useful skill to learn about and were encouraged to write notes on how it could be used in daily life. In one condition, participants read about cognitive reappraisal — identifying and reevaluating negative thoughts — while in the other they read about mindfulness — awareness and acceptance of one’s thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, some participants were told they had been assigned the skill as it was their strongest skill based on initial measures, while others were told it was their weakest.</p>



<p>After rating their mood, participants took part in a mood induction procedure, imagining someone they cared about dying and reflecting on how it made them feel, while listening to a piece of moving classical music. Immediately after this procedure, they were told use their assigned skill to regulate their emotions, while repeatedly indicating how they felt. Finally, they reported how useful they thought the skill would be.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering the subject matter, mood indeed dropped during the mood induction: 81% of participants felt worse immediately after the task. However, as participants utilised their skills their mood improved, with 25% returning to their initial mood. Importantly, participants who had read that their skill was a strength of theirs tended to show a more rapid mood recovery than those who had read it was a weakness, suggesting that this framing had an impact on the success of the skill.</p>



<p>Future research could explore why a focus on particular individual strengths leads to a faster recovery of mood — participants didn’t <em>expect </em>a focus on strengths to be any more effective than a focus on weakness, suggesting that the result wasn’t simply due to participants’ expectations. It’s also important to note that the effects were small. Further research would also need to include people with a diagnosis of anxiety or depression and look at effects over a longer period of time. Adding in a neutral condition, where skills are framed neither around strengths nor weakness, could also provide insight. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/02/15/arxiv-adds-new-logo-to-the-website/">arXiv adds new logo to the website</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are pleased to share the news that arXiv recently added its new logo to the website.</p>
<p>This new logo began its incremental rollout in 2021 in our communications documents, 30th anniversary materials, and other channels. That process continues in 2022 with the rollout of the new logo on the website. Though in one light it is a small change, it is also major a milestone for protecting arXiv&#8217;s identity and we are pretty excited.</p>
<h3>Why change the logo?</h3>
<p>arXiv’s long-time logo was found, through a legal review in 2020, to have no legal defensibility. In order to protect arXiv’s unique and incredible service we needed a legally defensible identity. Starting in 2020, and involving a diverse team of researchers and design experts, we completed a branding process culminating in a new logo.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-948 aligncenter" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png" alt="arXiv's logo" width="217" height="98" srcset="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-1024x461.png 1024w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-300x135.png 300w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1-768x346.png 768w, https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2021/02/arxiv-logo-1.png 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" /></p>
<p>arXiv&#8217;s new logo embodies our core identity, with the two arms of the arXiv chi intertwine into a united symbol of <b>arXiv as a place of connection</b> and a hub of the research ecosystem. Our mark, vetted and approved by Cornell University, achieves the <b>legibility, memorability, and legal defensibility</b> arXiv needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We are excited about the meaning and hard work behind the new logo, and to share it with the community on a platform as important as the arXiv website.</p>
<h3>What is next?</h3>
<p>arXiv has more design goals for the website, including making it fully accessible, increased usability for mobile, and improved efficiency for submitters and readers alike. We will continue to listen to our communities and learn what will make arXiv a more useful tool. We welcome and value your experience, and invite you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing">join the arXiv user testing group here</a> if you would like to take part in future surveys or rounds of feedback.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-water-publishes-first-papers/">PLOS Water publishes first papers</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>PLOS published the following press release on February 15, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that <em>PLOS Water</em> has published its initial cohort of papers. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to connect researchers across the hydrology, water resources, and water, sanitation and hygiene communities, amplifying a diverse set of voices to influence the global discourse around water. The journal has so far received more than 60 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a vitally important area of research. While the amount of water on earth is essentially fixed, demand for water continues to rise with population growth and increasing living standards,&rdquo; said Jenna Davis, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Water</em>. &ldquo;It has never been more important to connect scholars and practitioners working to close the gap in access to water and sanitation services with those focused on managing freshwater resources in a changing climate.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are confident that our broad scope will integrate water sciences and water practices, bringing together in one place research of the highest methodological and ethical standards, from all continents and global regions,&rdquo; said Pierre Horwitz, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Water</em>.</p>



<p>PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and <em>PLOS Water</em> now joins these journals with papers ready for publication. The journal is underpinned by PLOS&rsquo; new<a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/"> </a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a> designed to remove financial barriers for researchers and institutions across all geographies and funding backgrounds to participate in Open Access and Open Science at PLOS. PLOS is partnering with institutions in this modelto provide unlimited publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is based on each institution&rsquo;s historical research output in the field and is reflective of their regional economy according to their country&rsquo;s World Bank lending tier. PLOS&rsquo; existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our journal&rsquo;s Open Science policies will help establish preprinting and sharing of data and code in water research communities. Early, unrestricted access to vetted data and papers will empower researchers, local and Indigenous communities, water professionals, and organizations from across the globe to take evidence-based action to address some of the most pressing issues our planet faces,&rdquo; said Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS.</p>



<p>The current Editorial Board is comprised of more than 70 Academic Editors and 19 Section Editors representing more than 32 countries. Submissions have been received from researchers in Chile, Uganda, Switzerland, Australia, Eswatini, the US, and 10 other countries, marking the global reach of <em>PLOS Water</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780226798332">From Data to Quanta</a><br><em>Slobodan Perović</em><br><em>Univ. of Chicago, $45</em></p>



<p>Ever since Max Planck introduced the idea of the quantum to the world, physicists have argued about whether reality is more like sand or water.</p>



<p>Planck’s famous 1900 discovery that energy is grainy — at least when absorbed or emitted — moved him to label those smallest bits of energy grains “quanta.” But he believed that once emitted, as in light from a fire, those grains merged into smooth, continuous waves, just as water seems a smooth liquid to human perception. Einstein, on the other hand, insisted that light quanta traveled through space on their own, behaving like particles later called photons.</p>





<p>By the mid-1920s, both the wave and particle views of light had gained experimental support, with the additional paradox that electrons — supposedly particles — could sometimes disguise themselves as waves.</p>



<p>Into this arena of controversy stepped the famed Danish physicist Niels Bohr, the pioneer of exploring the architecture of the atom. Bohr announced that resolving the wave-particle paradox required a new view of reality, in which both notions shared a role in explaining experimental phenomena. In experiments designed to observe waves, waves you would find, whether electrons or light. In experiments designed to detect particles, you’d see particles. But in no experiment could you demonstrate both at once. Bohr called this viewpoint the principle of complementarity, and it successfully guided the pursuit of quantum mechanics during the following decades.</p>



<p>More recently, as philosopher Slobodan Perović recounts in <em>From Data to Quanta</em>, Bohr’s success has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beyond-weird-and-what-real-try-make-sense-quantum-weirdness">questioned by some physicists and philosophers</a> and even popular science writers (<em>SN: 1/19/19, p. 26</em>). Complementarity has been derided as an incoherent application of vague philosophy expressed in incomprehensible language. But as Perović’s investigations reveal, such criticisms are rarely rooted in any deep understanding of Bohr’s methods. Rather than Bohr’s philosophy contaminating his science, Perović argues, it is his opponents’ philosophical prejudices that have led to misstatements, misunderstandings and misrepresentations of Bohr’s physics. And Bohr can’t be understood by attempting to understand his philosophy, Perović asserts, because philosophy did not guide him — experiments did.</p>



<p>In fact, Bohr’s drive to understand the wave-particle paradox was fueled by a deep devotion to comprehending the experimental evidence in its totality. It was the same approach the younger Bohr took when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-atom-went-quantum">developing his model of the atom in 1913</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/13, p. 20</em>). Various experiments suggested properties of the atom that seemed irreconcilable. But Bohr forged those experimental clues into a “master hypothesis” that produced a thoroughly novel understanding of the atom and its structure.</p>





<p>Perović describes how Bohr’s process began with lower-level hypotheses stemming from features directly given by experiment. Spectral lines — different specific colors of light emitted by atoms — led to basic hypotheses that some vibratory process, of an atom itself or its constituents, produced electromagnetic radiation exhibiting precise patterns. Intermediate hypotheses about the structure of the atom did not explain such lines, though. And then Ernest Rutherford, on the basis of experiments in his lab, inferred that an atom was mostly empty space. It contained a dense, tiny central nucleus encompassing most of the mass, while lightweight electrons orbited at a distance. But that hypothesis didn’t mesh with the precise patterns of spectral lines. And such an atom would be unstable, persisting for less than a millisecond. From all these disparate experiment-based hypotheses, Bohr applied Planck’s quantum idea to construct a master hypothesis. He reconciled the spectral lines and Rutherford’s nuclear atom with a new atomic model, in which electrons maintained stability of the atom but jumped from one orbit to another, emitting specific patterns of spectral lines in the process.</p>



<p>As Perović demonstrates, Bohr followed a similar course in arriving at complementarity. While numerous experiments showed that light was a wave, by the early 1920s other experiments established that X-rays, highly energetic light, collided with electrons just as though both were particles (momentum and energy were conserved in the collisions just as the particle view required). Bohr’s master hypothesis, complementarity, seemed the only way forward.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Perović relates how Bohr has been misinterpreted, his views misleadingly conflated with those of others (like John von Neumann and Werner Heisenberg), and his philosophy incorrectly portrayed as antirealist — suggesting that only observations brought reality into existence. Bohr never said any such thing, and in fact cautioned against using language so loosely.</p>



<p>Perović’s account offers a thorough survey of other historical investigations into Bohr’s work and draws liberally from Bohr’s own writings. It’s a nuanced and insightful presentation of the interplay of experiment and theory in the scientific process. This book is not easy reading, though. It’s not the place to seek clear explanations of quantum physics and Bohr’s interpretation of it. Perović opts for scholarly thoroughness and careful reasoning with a propensity for long sentences. But then again, Bohr’s writings were no breeze, either. In fact, a major complaint against Bohr has been expressed by authors who say his writings are very difficult to understand. It’s unfortunate that so many seem to think that because they can’t understand Bohr, he must have been wrong. Perović’s book provides a useful antidote to that attitude. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/preterm-birth-chewing-gum-sugar-free-oral-health-malawi">Chewing sugar-free gum reduced preterm births in a large study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chewing a sugar-free gum daily reduced preterm births in a large study in Malawi. The oral intervention was inspired by past research linking poor oral health and preterm birth. The gum contains xylitol — a chemical that can boost oral health — in place of regular sugar.</p>



<p>Among women who chewed the xylitol gum, <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)02658-2/fulltext">549 out of 4,349 pregnancies, or 12.6 percent, were preterm</a>, researchers reported February 3 at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s Annual Pregnancy Meeting. That’s a 24 percent reduction compared with the group who didn’t receive the gum. Among those women, 878 out of 5,321 pregnancies, or 16.5 percent, of the babies were born before 37 weeks.</p>



<p>The oral health of gum users also improved. About 4,000 of the women had an initial dental exam and a later checkup. The women who chewed the gum had less periodontal disease, a condition in which the tissue surrounding the teeth becomes infected and inflamed, compared with those who didn’t get the chewing gum.</p>



<p>“The findings are very encouraging,” says Kim Boggess, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill who was not involved with the study. The researchers “are approaching a very complex problem in a low-resource area by trying to use a low-tech, easily applicable intervention.” It would take more research to see if this could work in other settings, she says.</p>





<p>For the new study, researchers enrolled around 10,000 women across eight health centers in the greater Lilongwe area of Malawi before they were pregnant or in early pregnancy. All of the women received tailored information on pregnancy, preventing preterm birth and improving oral health from community health workers. Roughly half of the women also received the gum.</p>



<p>The study was part of a decade-long project in the region surrounding Lilongwe, which has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062552/">a preterm birth rate estimated at 19.3 percent</a>, one of the highest globally. First, the research team talked with community members to learn what problems related to pregnancy the community was concerned about and wanted to solve.</p>



<p>In the Chichewa language spoken in Malawi, preterm birth is <em>kuchila masika asankwane</em>, which means “born too soon.” In focus groups conducted early in the project, “all participants knew of many women who had suffered ‘born too soon,’” says team member Kjersti Aagaard, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. Babies born prematurely can have complications that impair their lungs, neurodevelopment and more, with long-term health risks, and they are more likely to die in their first year of life than babies born to term.</p>



<p>Along with learning about <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-14-123">the community’s perceptions of preterm birth</a>, researchers also assessed <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0039-1695003#JR190038-21">the rate of cavities and gum disease</a> among pregnant and postpartum women, which was in the 70 percent range. And they asked the community if chewing xylitol gum was “something that would be palatable — both truly palatable as well as acceptable,” Aagaard says.</p>



<p>Studies finding a <a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177(14)62726-4/fulltext">link between periodontal disease and preterm birth</a> go back a couple of decades. The inflammatory disease has also been associated with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gum-disease-opens-body-host-infections">atherosclerosis and other ailments</a> (<em>SN: 4/6/16</em>). The diversity and size of the microbial community in the mouth is second only to the gut. With periodontal disease, there is a shift in the composition of that oral microbial community, giving way to bacteria that cause inflammation and damage gum tissue. From there, the bacteria may enter the bloodstream to reach other organs, perhaps including the placenta.</p>



<p>Chewing xylitol gum appears to be a check on that shift in the oral microbial community. Previous studies have shown that chewing <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00784-017-2075-5">xylitol gum leads to fewer cavities</a> and suggest it <a href="https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1902/jop.2014.130455">can reduce inflammation</a>. Aagaard and her colleagues are planning more research on what’s going on at the microbial level to understand how better oral health reduces preterm birth.</p>



<p>The team also wants to track the neurodevelopment of the children born early and those born on time in the study. “No matter how cost-effective an intervention may be, we still want to make sure you’re making a difference in somebody’s life,” Aagaard says, “and the ultimate outcome is how do those kiddos do.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/15/understanding-bad-character-research-into-the-dark-triad-digested/">Understanding bad character: Research into the Dark Triad, digested</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Twenty years ago, two Canadian psychologists published a paper that instantly captured the imagination of researchers — and reporters. Del Paulhus and Kevin Williams <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-11565-008">argued that a &#8220;Dark Triad&#8221; of &#8220;overlapping but distinct&#8221; toxic traits</a> — subclinical psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism — explained much of what we might otherwise call a &#8220;bad&#8221; character. Research into the Dark Triad shows no signs of slowing. But the concept is being challenged. And other psychologists are proposing different ways to get to grips with the darker side of human nature…</p>



<span id="more-45374"></span>



<p><strong>What exactly is the Dark Triad?</strong></p>



<p>Paulhus and Williams focused on people who fell within the normal range of functioning. So, not diagnosed clinical psychopaths in jail for murder, say, but the kind of person you might find yourself sharing an office with; or, worse, a home. The three Dark Triad traits cover a range of anti-social beliefs and behaviours:</p>



<p>Psychopathy is associated with low levels of empathy, and being high in impulsivity and thrill-seeking.</p>



<p>Machiavellianism was named, in 1970, after the philosophy of Niccolo Machiavelli; people who score highly on this scale are cynical and unprincipled manipulators of others.</p>



<p>Narcissists are entitled types who believe that they are superior beings, and should be treated that way.</p>



<p>Paulhus and Williams argued that each of the Dark Triad traits has its own psychological profile, but they share a common core of &#8220;callous-manipulation&#8221; — a disregard for the feelings and wellbeing of others, for personal gain. Dark Triad scales have now been used in literally hundreds of studies, with plenty of headline-grabbing findings.</p>



<p><strong>Dark traits = more attractive dates?</strong></p>



<p>This surprising conclusion from a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/per.2040">2016 speed-dating study</a> garnered global coverage. Both men and women who scored highly for narcissism <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/29/how-do-people-with-dark-triad-personality-traits-fare-at-speed-dating/">were rated as being more attractive prospects for both short- and long-term relationships</a>. Also, women&nbsp;— but not men — who scored higher for psychopathy received better ratings from their dates.</p>



<p>However, as the <em>Digest </em>also reported, participants’ ratings actually seemed to be influenced by other factors that were merely associated with dark traits: women who scored highly for psychopathy and narcissism were also considered to be more attractive, and male narcissists were more appealingly extraverted. Once the researchers controlled for the influence of attraction and extraversion, it didn’t matter how narcissistic a potential date was. </p>



<p>Researchers have also recently disputed suggestions that scoring highly on dark traits might bring some other benefits, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167217733080">such as hedge fund success</a>. In fact, unsurprisingly, most links between the Dark Triad and functioning in society have been distinctly less positive…</p>



<p><strong>Faking and ghosting</strong></p>



<p>Dark Triad traits have been linked to everything from faking in job interviews and exploitation of colleagues (a 2018 review in the <em>Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behaviour</em> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321115270_The_Dark_Triad_and_Workplace_Behavior">summed up research on workplace behaviour</a>) to criminal behaviour, and ghosting. A 2020 study of students in Spain, for example, found that two combinations of Dark Triad traits (being Machiavellian and narcissistic or Machiavellian and psychopathic) best predicted risky behaviours, such as getting into a fight or gambling. And a 2021 study of American adults also found that those who’d scored higher on a Dark Triad scale were <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/17/ghosting-is-more-acceptable-to-people-with-dark-triad-traits/">more likely to find it acceptable to ghost someone</a> — to end a relationship by abruptly ceasing communication.</p>



<p><strong>Challenges to the Triad</strong></p>



<p>Though hugely popular, the concept of the Dark Triad has been challenged. In 2019, Joshua Miller at the University of Georgia, US, and colleagues published <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721419838233">a review of work in the field</a> in <em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>. “Unfortunately, several limitations to this research are unrecognised or ignored,” they wrote. They argue that one of the biggest is an oversimplification of personality traits in the scales that are used. A study might identify someone as being &#8220;narcissistic&#8221;, say, simply on the basis of a high self-esteem score, when narcissism itself is more complicated (and &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; narcissism is linked to low self-esteem). Neither is there a single disorder of &#8220;psychopathy&#8221;, argue other researchers, but rather a spectrum of psychopathic disorders, influenced by various factors, including brain structure, early life experience and genes. This would imply that a single &#8220;psychopathy&#8221; label within the Dark Triad isn’t appropriate.</p>



<p>However, for others, the issue isn’t so much the rigour and quality of Dark Triad research, but whether a triad is enough….</p>



<p><strong>Should it be a &#8220;Dark Tetrad&#8221; — or more?</strong></p>



<p>Various other dark traits have been put forward as equals to those in the triad. Sadism — getting pleasure from inflicting physical or emotional pain on others — has perhaps the biggest backing.</p>



<p>The <em>Digest </em>has covered all kinds of research on sadism, including a 2021 study finding that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/12/people-behave-more-sadistically-when-theyre-bored/">boredom can drive even people who are low in trait sadism to punish others</a>, just for the minor thrill. Sadism proponents (from an academic perspective…) argue that <a href="https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1614-0001/a000179">it has a unique profile, while also being an expression of the &#8220;Dark Tetrad&#8221;.</a> Some psychologists meanwhile<a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/a0036039"> argue that &#8220;spite&#8221;</a> (hurting an opponent even when there is a cost to yourself) should also be considered alongside psychopathy and the rest. But yet others see our dark sides differently again…</p>



<p><strong>The &#8220;D factor&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>“Over the years, more and more allegedly distinct and increasingly narrow aversive traits have been introduced, resulting in a plethora of constructs lacking theoretical integration”. So argue three psychologists <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/rev0000111">who in 2018 published a popular paper in <em>Psychological Review</em> </a>arguing for a core general &#8220;<a href="https://www.darkfactor.org">D-factor</a>&#8221; (Dark factor) of personality. In this model, 9 related dark traits fall within D, which in essence is this: a motivation ruthlessly to put your own interests above other people’s, and to behave accordingly, even when it causes harm to others or even to yourself. This does sound rather like &#8220;callous-manipulation&#8221; plus spite. Anyway, the nine are: psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, sadism and spitefulness plus Moral disengagement (being able to behave unethically without feeling bad), Psychological entitlement (believing you deserve more and are better than others), Self-interest (a desire to boost your own social or financial status) and Egoism (being concerned with your own goals and achievements at the expense of others’). </p>



<p>So, 20 years on from the explosive emergence of the Dark Triad concept, where are we, in terms of really understanding &#8220;bad&#8221; character? The answer, it seems, is all over the place. Is the Dark &#8220;Triad&#8221; enough? Are Dark Triad scales useful for screening potential employees, say? Do we really need &#8220;psychological entitlement&#8221; plus narcissism, in a round-up of dark traits? All these questions, and many more, are still hotly debated. But one thing is for sure: scholarly and public fascination with the darker sides of human nature show no sign whatsoever of abating. So we can expect lots more &#8220;dark&#8221; research and stories to come.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Word puzzles are <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-wordle-craze-why-do-we-love-puzzles-and-are-they-good-for-our-brains-175227">all the rage</a> right now. But if you’ve already done today’s Wordle, here are some anagrams to keep you going until tomorrow:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Reality is only a matter of</em>&#8230;..   <strong><em>tvesrecipep</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Free will is a powerful</em>&#8230;.. <em> <strong>oinliusl</strong></em></p>



<p>If you managed to solve the anagrams at the end of these statements, you may have experienced a “Eureka” or “Aha!” moment, in which the solution suddenly seemed to appear, perhaps accompanied by a sense of happiness or relief. And if you did, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05923-3">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, you’d be more likely to believe that the statement itself is true.</p>



<span id="more-45359"></span>



<p>We’ve all experienced Aha! moments in our daily lives. They often seem to come out of nowhere after we’ve been stumped by a problem for a while, perhaps while we’re doing something else like having a shower. And generally, an Aha! moment is more likely to occur if we’ve arrived at the correct solution to a problem than if we’ve reached an incorrect one.</p>



<p>In fact, <em>because</em> they are normally associated with finding the right solution, when we experience Aha! moments we get a gut feeling that what we’ve come up with is correct or true. But a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/05/eureka-moments-have-a-dark-side-they-can-make-false-facts-seem-true/">2019 study</a> by Ruben Laukkonen at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and colleagues found that this intuitive response has a dark side: experiencing Aha! moments while reading false statements can make these statements seem true.</p>



<p>In their new paper, the same group explored whether Aha! moments can also influence how much people endorse particular worldviews. They asked participants to read 15 statements, like those above. For half of the participants, the final word of each statement was scrambled and they had to try and solve it within 15 seconds. The other half just read the statement in full, with no anagram (e.g. “Free will is a powerful illusion”, if you are still scratching your head about that one).</p>



<p>All participants then rated how true they thought the statement was on a 12-point scale. Those in the anagram condition also indicated whether or not they had experienced an Aha! moment while unscrambling the word.</p>



<p>Overall, participants in the anagram condition rated the statements as more true than those who saw the statements with no anagram. Furthermore, in trials where they successfully solved an anagram, they rated the statement as more true than on trials where they weren’t successful.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the crucial finding: participants in the anagram condition also rated the statement as more true if they had experienced an Aha! moment than if they had not, and this effect held even when the researchers looked only at trials where the participants had successfully solved the anagram. In other words, Aha! moments seemed to give a “ring of truth” to these worldview statements, above and beyond any effect that might have been caused by successfully solving the anagram. A replication study found exactly the same result.</p>



<p>In a second study, the team showed that the timing of the Aha! moment mattered. When participants completed an anagram in isolation (e.g. “oinliusl”), and then saw the full statement 10 seconds later, their truth ratings were not affected by whether or not they had experienced an Aha! moment. That is, Aha! moments only made worldview statements seem more true when they occurred at the same time as reading the statement.  </p>



<p>The research suggests that Aha! moments can influence fairly fundamental beliefs about the way the world works. “Because aha experiences tend to be a marker of good ideas, it makes sense that humans learn to draw on this feeling as a source of information about our beliefs,” the authors conclude. Unfortunately, this mental short-cut doesn’t always work as intended.</p>



<p>Of course, completing an anagram at the end of a statement is a fairly artificial scenario. But the authors do hint at how a similar process might play out in the real world, pointing to the example of conspiracy theories and specifically QAnon. Followers who have been told that there is a cabal of satanic pedophiles in the upper echelons of government might experience an Aha! moment upon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html">discovering a “secret code” in leaked emails that supposedly supports this theory</a>, making those outlandish claims seem more true. More work is clearly needed to understand how the &#8220;dark side&#8221; of Aha! moments can influence our real-life beliefs and behaviour — and what can be done to prevent any harmful effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-jupiter-orbit-sun-close-gravity-star-planet">How ‘hot Jupiters’ may get their weirdly tight orbits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Strange giant planets known as hot Jupiters, which orbit close to their suns, got kicked onto their peculiar paths by nearby planets and stars, a new study finds.</p>



<p>After analyzing the orbits of dozens of hot Jupiters, a team of astronomers found a way to catch giant planets in the process of getting uncomfortably close to their stars. The new analysis, submitted January 27 to arXiv.org, pins the blame for the weird worlds <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11768">on gravitational kicks from other massive objects orbiting the same star</a>, many of which destroyed themselves in the process.</p>



<p>“It’s a pretty dramatic way to create your hot Jupiters,” says Malena Rice, an astrophysicist at Yale University.</p>



<p>Hot Jupiters have long been mysterious. They orbit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scalding-hot-gas-giant-breaks-heat-records">very close to their stars</a>, whirling around in a few days or less, whereas all the giant planets in our solar system lie at vast distances from the sun (<em>SN: 6/5/17</em>). To <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recipes-solar-system-exoplanets-formation-rewrite">explain the odd planets</a>, astronomers have proposed three main ideas (<em>SN: 5/11/18</em>). Perhaps the hot Jupiters formed next to their stars and stayed put, or maybe they started off farther out and then slowly spiraled inward. In either case, the planets should have circular orbits aligned with their stars’ equators, because the worlds inherited their paths from material in the protoplanetary disks that gave them birth.</p>





<p>The new study, though, favors the third idea: Gravitational interactions with another giant planet or a companion star first hurl a Jupiter-sized planet onto a highly elliptical and inclined orbit that brings it close to its star. In some cases, the planet even revolves the wrong way around its star, opposite the way it spins.</p>



<p>In this scenario, every time the tossed planet sweeps past its sun, the star’s gravity robs the planet of orbital energy. This shrinks the orbit, gradually making it more circular and less inclined, until the planet becomes a hot Jupiter on a small, circular orbit, realigned to be in the same plane as the star’s equator.</p>



<p>Stars usually circularize a planet’s orbit before they realign it, and cool stars realign an orbit faster than warm stars do. So Rice and her colleagues looked for relationships between the shapes and tilts of the orbits of several dozen hot Jupiters that go around stars of different temperatures.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, the team found that the hot Jupiters around cool stars tend to be on well-aligned, circular orbits, whereas the hot Jupiters around warm stars are often on orbits that are elongated and off-kilter. Put another way, many of the orbits around warm stars haven’t yet had time to settle down into their final size and orientation. These orbits still bear the marks of having been shaped by gravitational run-ins with neighboring bodies in the system, the team concludes.</p>



<p>It’s a “simple, elegant argument,” says David Martin, an astrophysicist at Ohio State University in Columbus who was not involved with this study. “They’re presenting the evidence in a new way that helps strengthen” the idea that other massive objects in the same solar system produce hot Jupiters. He suspects this theory probably explains the majority of these planets.</p>



<p>But it means that innumerable giant worlds have suffered terrible fates. Some of the planets that hurled their brethren close to their stars ended up plunging into those same stars themselves, Rice says. And many other planets got ejected from their solar systems altogether, so today these wayward worlds wander the deep freeze of interstellar space, far from the light of any sun.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/freshwater-ice-melt-water-temperature-scallops-spikes">Freshwater ice can melt into scallops and spikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Water’s wacky density leads to strange effects that researchers are still uncovering.</p>



<p>Typically, liquids become denser the more they cool. But freshwater is densest at 4° Celsius. As it cools below that temperature, the water becomes less dense and rises. As a result, ice columns submerged in liquid water <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.044502">can melt into three different shapes</a>, depending on the water’s temperature, researchers report in the Jan. 28 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost everything” about the findings was surprising, says mathematician Leif Ristroph of New York University.</p>



<p>Ristroph and colleagues anchored ultrapure ice cylinders up to 30 centimeters long in place and submerged them in tanks of water at temperatures from 2° to 10° C.</p>





<p>The ice melted into smooth, downward-pointing spikes if placed in water lower than about 5° C. Simulations showed “a strange thing — that the cold liquid water near the ice is actually buoyant” due to being less dense than the rest of the water in the tank, Ristroph says. So that upward flow draws warmer water closer to the ice’s base, causing it to melt faster than the top. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The opposite occurred above about 7° C; the ice formed an upward-pointing spike. That’s because colder water near the ice is denser than the surrounding water and sinks, pulling in warmer water at the top of the ice and causing it to melt faster than the bottom, simulations showed. This matches “what your intuition would expect,” Ristroph says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between about 5° to 7° C, the ice melted into scalloped columns. “Basically, the water is confused,” Ristroph says, so it forms different layers, some of which tend to rise and others which tend to sink, depending on their density. Ultimately, the water organizes into “swirls or vortices of fluid that carve the weird ripples into the ice.”</p>



<p>More work is needed to understand the complex interplay of factors that may generate these and other shapes on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">ice melting in nature</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>)<em>.</em></p>

                <p>By serendipity, scientists have photographed Venus’ surface from space for the first time.</p>



<p>Though the planet’s rocky body is concealed beneath a thick veil of clouds, telescopes aboard NASA’s Parker Solar Probe managed to capture the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL096302">first visible-light images of the surface taken from space</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve never actually seen the surface through the clouds at these wavelengths before,” said Lori Glaze, Director of NASA&#8217;s Planetary Science Division, on February 10 during a live broadcast on Twitter.</p>



<p>Though the Parker Solar Probe was built to study the sun, it must make regular flybys of Venus. The planet’s gravity tugs on the probe, tightening its orbit and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">bringing it closer to the sun</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Those assists from Venus helped the spacecraft make headlines when it became the first probe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">to enter the sun’s atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>The Parker Solar Probe travels around the sun in a highly elliptical orbit, as illustrated in this video. To tighten its loops and bring it nearer to the blazing star, the probe slows itself down by flying near Venus, using the planet’s gravity as a brake.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was during two such flybys in July 2020 and February 2021 that the probe’s WISPR telescopes captured the new images. While WISPR found Venus’ dayside too bright to image, it was able to discern large-scale surface features, such as the vast highland region called Aphrodite Terra, through the clouds on the nightside.</p>





<p>Clouds tend to scatter and absorb light. But some wavelengths of light get through, depending on the clouds’ chemical makeup, says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Though scientists knew such spectral windows exist in Venus’ thick clouds of sulfuric acid, the researchers didn’t expect light visible to human eyes would break through so intensely. And while WISPR was designed to study the sun’s atmosphere, its construction also happens to allow it to detect this unanticipated window of light in Venus’ clouds. “It’s fortuitous that they happened to have an instrument that could see through the clouds,” Byrne says.</p>

<p>The photographs show a planet so hot that it glows, much like red-hot iron, said Brian Wood, an astrophysicist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and a coauthor of the paper, during the social media event.</p>



<p>“The pattern of bright and dark that you see is basically a temperature map,” he said — brighter regions are hotter and darker regions are cooler. This pattern correlates well with topographic maps previously produced from radar and infrared surveys. Highlands appear dark and lowlands appear bright, Wood said.</p>



<p>The images come as NASA prepares to launch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">two missions</a> to Venus (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). The new photographs, Wood said, “may help in the interpretation of the observations taken in the future from these new missions.”</p>

<p>Venus’ perpetually cloud-shrouded surface remains penetrable only by radio waves. A planetary radar group now reports results of an extended series of radar measurements of the topography of Venus that for the first time provides a view of surface height variations around the entire circumference of the planet.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p><br>Those observations were taken by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, which was the most powerful radar system for mapping rocky bodies in outer space until its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-astronomy-discoveries">sudden collapse</a> in December 2020 (<em>SN: 12/19/20&nbsp;&amp; 1/2/21, p.&nbsp;8</em>). The observatory also revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radar-image-venus-hints-tectonism/">ancient lava flows</a> on Venus and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/icy-clues-gleaned-mercurys-other-half">ice on Mercury</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/18/76, p.&nbsp;181</em>; <em>SN: 11/9/91, p.&nbsp;295</em>). Arecibo’s maps of Mars and the asteroid Bennu helped NASA plan the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-landing-message-puerto-rico">Viking</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">OSIRIS-REx missions</a>. Some other facilities have planetary radar systems, but they are not as powerful as Arecibo’s was. Astronomers are adding a radar transmitter to West&nbsp;Virginia’s Green Bank Telescope that is expected to rival or exceed Arecibo’s.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How similar do you think humans are to other animals? The answer might reveal more than you think: according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211063260">new research</a>, people who perceive themselves as being <em>more</em> similar to other animals are more likely to care about being creative, and to engage with the arts. Why? It’s all to do with how we manage death anxiety, argue Uri Lifshin at Reichman University, Israel, and colleagues, in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>.</p>



<span id="more-45348"></span>



<p>We all know that at some point, sooner or later, we are going to die. It’s not exactly an uplifting thought. According to Terror Management Theory, to assuage death anxiety, we created cultural belief systems that allow us to see ourselves as more than mortal animals. Belief in an afterlife and a strong identification with one’s national culture are two such systems. But there are also other ways to get a sense of immortality: by becoming famous, say, or via creative pursuits, which might leave a lasting mark.</p>



<p>To explore individual differences in feeling that people are more than mortal animals, the team used a four-item &#8220;perceived similarity of the self to animals&#8221; (PSSA) scale. (Participants had to rate &#8220;how similar you think you are to other animals&#8221;, for example.) And in an initial study on almost 900 American students, they found a correlation between higher PSSA scores and scores on other measures, including being less invested in national identity and feeling that &#8220;being creative&#8221; was important. Another study on a broader range of American adults found a link between higher PSSA scores and greater engagement with and enjoyment of the arts.</p>



<p>In a subsequent online experiment on 189 Jewish Israeli participants, one group was asked to reflect on their own death, while a control group was asked to think about experiences of physical pain instead. The researchers found that among those with relatively high PSSA scores, those who got the death reminder reported caring more about being creative (about &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221;, for example) than those in the control group. They interpret this as supporting the idea that people who think they are more similar to other animals are more motivated to use creativity as a way to manage their death anxiety. I have to note, though, that within the control group, people with low PSSA scores actually reported caring more about creativity than those with higher PSSA scores — contrary to the team’s expectations. And indeed, other results from some further studies were mixed, too. </p>



<p>The researchers maintain that data from their total of six studies support the idea that seeing ourselves as similar to other animals is directly linked with death anxiety and the pursuit of creativity. This link can’t be explained by other variables including religiosity, personality factors, belief in human evolution and political orientation.</p>



<p>However, statistical trends and marginally significant results do feature pretty heavily in their paper. And in one study, people with higher PSSA scores also scored higher on the personality trait of Openness. <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Kaufman-2013.pdf">More open people are more interested in the arts (among other things), more creative and less conventional</a> — so less likely to adopt a nationalistic or religious belief system. Are high PSSA scores just tapping into Openness, then?</p>



<p>The team thinks that people’s perceived similarity to animals is important in and of itself. “Our findings suggest that PSSA may be an important factor in understanding investment in creativity,” they write. But while it’s an interesting idea, it’s also one that certainly needs more work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-sickle-cell-disease-esrick-genetics">Gene therapies for sickle cell disease come with hope and challenges</a></h4>

              
                <p>Today, it’s clear that our genes not only cause many diseases, but also hold potential cures. But that wasn’t always the case. It wasn’t until 1949 that scientists first found the molecular culprit of a disease — its roots in the genetic code. The disease was the blood disorder known as sickle cell disease, an inherited disorder that causes severe and debilitating pain. Now, nearly 75 years later, researchers are developing gene therapies to cure it.</p>



<p>Sickle cell disease results from<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-1044"> a change in a key protein in hemoglobin</a>, which helps transport oxygen in red blood cells. Hemoglobin normally allows “red blood cells to be very floppy and pliable, and slip and slide through the blood vessels easily,” says pediatrician Erica Esrick. But a mutation in a single gene, the <em>HBB </em>gene, makes hemoglobin stack in long strings inside blood cells, giving them an inflexible, sickle shape. Instead of being “squishy,” the stiff red blood cells get stuck inside blood vessels, blocking blood flow.</p>



<p>Sickle cell affects millions of people around the world, particularly those whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In the United States, for instance, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html">approximately 100,000 people live with the disease</a>, most of them Black or Latino. People with sickle cell disease have a shortened life expectancy, living only into their late 40s on average, in large part due to strokes or organ damage from blocked blood vessels. Esrick, of Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and others are trying to fight the disease through gene therapy.</p>

<p>Gene therapies seek to manipulate the very information of life by replacing, inactivating or fixing missing or broken genes — and so curing patients. But the journey to today’s handful of approved gene therapies, including for diseases like severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, or SCID, certain blood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-t-cell-gene-therapy-top-science-stories-2017-yir">cancers</a> and spinal muscular atrophy, has been rocky. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-human-gene-therapy-test-begun">Early clinical trials</a> in the 1990s weren’t effective, and the 2000s brought unintended and sometimes deadly consequences, including a leukemia-like illness.</p>



<p>Despite gene therapy’s challenges, many researchers believe sickle cell is a good target because the molecular pathways are well understood and straightforward. What’s more, every copy of the gene doesn’t need to be mended to have an effect. (Individuals who inherit the mutated gene from only one parent, for example, don’t develop sickle cell disease.)</p>



<p>Esrick is co-leading a clinical trial testing a gene therapy that attempts to encourage the body to make more of a healthy type of hemoglobin produced by fetuses and young babies — but not adults — called fetal hemoglobin. DNA for making a short string of genetic material called a microRNA is delivered by a virus into cells from a patient’s bone marrow. The virus, called a vector, permanently inserts the DNA into the cell’s genetic blueprint. The microRNA then interferes with the production of a protein that prevents fetal hemoglobin from being made. Once that protein is blocked, fetal hemoglobin production turns back on. Like turning on a faucet, a steady stream of the healthy hemoglobin can flow into the bloodstream, making up for the faulty form.</p>



<p>Preliminary data released in January 2021 showed that the treatment helped <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2029392?url_ver=Z39.88-2003">six sickle cell patients make fetal hemoglobin</a>, Esrick and colleagues reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. During the follow-up period, ranging from several months to more than two years, the patients’ symptoms were reduced or eliminated. The team has expanded the trial to include more patients and further test the treatment.</p>

<p>Scientists are testing other ways to tackle sickle cell via gene therapy, too. A biotechnology company called bluebird bio is testing an approach that delivers a functional copy of the <em>HBB </em>gene to patients. Another team is preparing to begin a trial that will edit that gene directly using CRISPR/Cas9.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> staff writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/erin-garcia-de-jesus">Erin Garcia de Jesús</a> spoke with Esrick about the ongoing fetal hemoglobin clinical trial, including the hurdles and the hope. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What tools do we currently have to treat sickle cell?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: The only curative treatment is a bone marrow transplant. The bone marrow is like the factory for the blood cells. If you can get bone marrow from somebody who doesn’t have sickle cell disease, then you can grow your own healthy red blood cells that don’t sickle. But that is a major procedure, and it’s really only standard if you have what’s called a matched sibling [a brother or sister without sickle cell whose key white blood cell proteins match yours].</p>



<p>Less than 20 percent of people with sickle cell have a matched sibling available. If a matched sibling is available, then that’s a really good potential treatment option, but it is still a risky procedure. It comes along with some up-front risk of mortality and a lot of potential side effects, such as graft-versus-host disease and a higher risk of infection because of immunosuppressive drugs.</p>



<p>Then there are medications to treat sickle cell. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/drug-wards-sickle-cell-attacks">most well-established and long-lasting is called hydroxyurea</a>. It increases fetal hemoglobin. In many people, it increases the fetal hemoglobin by a lot; that&#8217;s why it works so well. It’s been available since the ’90s, and has been moving gradually to younger and younger ages.</p>



<p>Now it is a very clear recommendation that essentially every child with sickle cell should be on it. But not everyone has access to specialized hematology care, and it’s a medication that has to be taken daily. Some people have adverse effects and can’t take it. It also doesn’t work for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: How many people are in your team’s trial and what results have you seen so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Nine patients have been treated. We anticipate the 10th patient will be treated soon. The preliminary data from the first six patients was published about a year ago. Additional data from subsequent patients has been largely quite similar — except for one patient whose fetal hemoglobin response was unfortunately not as robust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What is the process like for the trial participants?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Patients have to get their cells collected [the cells live in the bone marrow and give rise to blood cells], which takes a three-day hospital admission and sometimes has to be repeated a few times. It&#8217;s through IV, basically. Then the cells get taken off to the lab.</p>



<p>When we get word from the lab, “OK, we have a good product” [meaning the virus got the DNA into enough cells], then the patient comes back and is admitted to the hospital for a month or so. It&#8217;s a long and arduous hospital admission because they need to receive chemotherapy.</p>



<p>The reason they need chemotherapy is because the bone marrow cells that haven&#8217;t been collected need to get nearly wiped out in order to give the advantage to the cells that are being given back [also through IV] to set up shop and produce.</p>



<p>Chemotherapy comes with a lot of the side effects and risks associated with gene therapy, including acute short-term risks like hearing loss and nausea. And it also comes with some of the long-term risks, including infertility and a risk of blood cancers.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Why choose gene therapy over a bone marrow transplant if both require chemotherapy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: With gene therapy, there&#8217;s no issue with immunosuppression, because it&#8217;s your own cells. People who get a transplant from another person have to be on immunosuppressive medications for a period of months after the transplant. There&#8217;s a risk of graft rejection because of the mismatch between the donor and the recipient.</p>



<p>The other risk in a bone marrow transplant from another person is graft-versus-host disease, where the graft and donated cells reject the recipient. That can cause severe disease. With gene therapy, that&#8217;s not a risk at all.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Last year, a clinical trial run by a company called bluebird bio announced that a trial participant developed leukemia. Cancer is obviously a huge concern and has thwarted previous gene therapy trials. What do we know so far about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: This was, of course, of major concern to the field. It was actually the second case of leukemia in that trial. The first one was published a couple of years ago as a case report.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s ever a case of leukemia or any preleukemia in a gene therapy trial, we always ask: Was it caused because the vector stuck a gene into a spot that was dangerous?</p>



<p>It does not look like that&#8217;s the case. In the first patient in the bluebird bio trial who developed leukemia, the leukemia cells didn&#8217;t even have the transferred gene in them. So, the thought was that was probably just an example of chemotherapy causing leukemia, which we know can happen in a small percent of people who receive chemotherapy.</p>



<p>But the second case, in February 2021, really raised a red flag. Why is that happening two times in a trial of only 40-something patients? It&#8217;s still not exactly clear. There are some studies that suggest that people with sickle cell disease may have an increased risk of leukemia. But the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] placed the bluebird bio trial on hold while some investigations were done. When it became pretty clear that it wasn&#8217;t directly related to the vector, the trial was allowed to reopen.</p>



<p>Our trial, which has many similarities to the bluebird bio trial, was not put on hold by the FDA but was put on hold by our funder, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute while they looked at the data. That hold was recently lifted.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Have there been any cases of leukemia in your team’s trial?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Fortunately, no.</p>



<p>But you know when anything like that happens in the field, it&#8217;s a big deal. I called all of the patients who we had treated in our trial to let them know. [The bluebird bio cases] happened in patients who had been treated three and five years prior. The longest-treated patient in our trial was almost three and a half years ago, and the most recently treated was about eight or nine months ago. I hope we see no concerning signs for any new development like that, but it&#8217;s too early to say.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What are some of the biggest challenges that sickle cell has had to overcome?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: For the longest time, there were no new therapies at all. These technologies took a long time because they are based on basic science discoveries that were being worked on. But also, the patient population with sickle cell is a population that has historically been underserved and without a lot of power.</p>



<p>In the United States, it’s primarily Black and Latino patients, and across the board those populations have suffered from health inequality. I think that if there were a disease that caused this degree of morbidity and mortality and pain in other parts of the population, it may have been speedier.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What gives you hope? What do you find exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: I find myself bending over backwards to make sure that I’m not coming across as, “We have a cure!” But that said, it is really exciting that this is a treatment that is theoretically possible for everyone without needing to find a [bone marrow] match. That’s a huge difference from classic bone marrow transplants.</p>



<p>The speed at which new [gene therapy] treatments are being developed is amazing. I think the horizon is very bright in terms of one or maybe many of these therapies being really effective and safe. I’ve talked to so many patients and families who have reached out interested in our trial or other trials. There’s such a huge unmet need. The fact that there are a lot of these new treatments that are being developed is an encouragement to these families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/02/11/public-peer-review-files/">Public peer review files</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peer-review is probably the most obscure part of the publication of scientific results. In this blog post, I would like to make the point that the best way to learn about it &#8211; except by being directly involved &#8211; is to read public peer review files. In addition, I will recommend some interesting or surprising peer review files, mostly for systems neuroscience, but also for some optics papers.</p>



<p><strong>Public peer review files should be the standard</strong></p>



<p>Peer review takes place before official &#8220;publication&#8221; in a peer-reviewed journal and is therefore usually not accessible to the reader. During the last years, this practice has changed, and more and more journals are now offering the peer review and rebuttal letters as supplementary files. This is done for example by the journal eLife, but also Nature Communications, sometimes for the SfN journals, and Nature. For some journals, like Nature, the authors can opt out of the peer review file publication (<a href="https://www.nature.com/documents/nr-transparent-peer-review.pdf">here is Nature&#8217;s policy</a>). But, honestly, if you are not willing to share the reviews publicly, what do you want to hide? I think it should become a mandatory standard to share the reviews, with only specific reasons justifying an opt-out. (Update 2022-02-14: a <a href="https://twitter.com/ElDuvelle/status/1492932211410153475">Twitter-discussion on this topic</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>What to learn from peer review files</strong></p>



<p>As a young researcher like a PhD student, it is rare to be involved in the review process, which, therefore, remains a black box. For me, it was fascinating to read my first peer review files on eLife maybe 5 years ago. It felt like the entire smooth surface of this paper started to crumble and give way to a more rich and more nuanced point of view. Looking back at this paper, this nuanced view was also somewhat included in the paper, but in such a smooth manner that it was difficult to extract without absolute expert knowledge.</p>



<p>Nowadays, I rarely read eLife papers until also the peer review section is online (which comes a couple days after the preliminary pdf). The reviewer comments provide an additional point of view that is very helpful in particular when I cannot fully judge the paper myself.</p>



<p>Additionally, reading such review files helps to write both better manuscripts, better rebuttal letters, and also better reviews. Also, gaining experience from these files prepares a bit for the sometimes very difficult experiences when receiving the reviews. Plus, reading those reviews makes the entire process a bit more transparent. When I wrote my first reviews for journals, I had seen only three or four reviews for my own co-author papers; but I had seen many more as public review files.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look into some examples that show what can happen during peer review. Paper links are in the title, links to the review files/sections thereafter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04268-7"><strong>Toroidal topology of grid cell acti</strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04268-7">vity</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-04268-7/MediaObjects/41586_2021_4268_MOESM4_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432776v1">preprint</a> of this paper by Gardner et al. from the Moser lab appeared, I put it on my reading list, but never actually read it fully because I did not feel on top of the vast literature about continuous attractor models, and I did not even know whether a &#8220;toroidal&#8221; geometry of the activity space would be a surprising result or not.</p>



<p>Checking the peer review files after publication at Nature provided exactly this entry point that I had been missing before. In retrospect, all the information needed is also in the paper, but the more direct and less formal language in the reviews took me by the hand and showed me directly what the paper is about. The summaries at the beginning of each review provide a very useful second perspective on the main messages of the paper.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04223-6">Deep physical neural networks</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-04223-6/MediaObjects/41586_2021_4223_MOESM2_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>A few weeks ago, I noticed an interesting article published at Nature on &#8220;deep physical neural networks&#8221;. I checked the author&#8217;s <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LoganGWright1/status/1488885395827871747">Twitter thread</a> on the paper and found the topic intriguing, but slightly beyond my area of expertise. The review file provided me exactly with the lacking context and critical external opinion that I needed to form a somewhat less vague opinion of the specific advance made by the paper. Really helpful!</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04404-x">Place cells respond to moving bars in immobile rats</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-022-04404-x/MediaObjects/41586_2022_4404_MOESM2_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>This review file contains an entire story by itself. In the first round of review, reviewer #1 was rather critical, while the other two reviewers were almost convinced already. The authors, in a 8-month revision period finally managed to very decently address most points brought up by the reviewers. They do this, as has become apparently common practice for rebuttal letters to high-impact journals, in a very long and detailed letter (the entire review file is 44 pages).</p>



<p>But after this round of reviews and rebuttals, suddenly, reviewer #3 changes his/her opinion entirely:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Unfortunately my evaluation of this paper has changed since the first submission due to comments from the other reviewers and because of literature I have discovered since then. This paper presents a set of reasonably well performed and analyzed experiments, but I no longer think the main results are novel or surprising. I therefore do not recommend publication in Nature and think this paper is better suited for a specialist journal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>This is just the beginning of a long comment on why the reviewer thinks the paper is not novel enough any more. This is of course a nightmare for the authors. In the end, the authors do their best to address these concerns of novelty. Reviewer #3 remains unconvinced. The editor decides to ignore these concerns and goes with the recommendation of the other reviewers to publish the manuscript. Check it out yourself to form your own opinion on this discussion!</p>

<p>A much wilder story is hidden in the peer review file of this optics paper from Tom Baden&#8217;s lab, which was finally published at Nature Communications. The first set of reviews at Nat Comm is still pretty normal, but then something goes wrong. Reviewer #4, who is &#8211; very obviously &#8211; highly competent but also a bit obsessed with details and annoyed by imprecision, has a few things to complain about, mostly about a few relatively small unsubstantiated claims and some minor errors that do not affect the main idea of the manuscript. However, the authors do not agree with this opinion, and a long and slowly escalating discussion between an annoyed reviewer and frustrated authors evolves. Check it out yourself. If you don&#8217;t get stomach pain while reading, you have my full admiration. At some point, reviewer #4 writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;In the last round of review, I wrote detailed comments, color-rebuttal, in a 16-page PDF, with the hope that they would be of help to the authors to make the manuscript better. The response I received on this round, surprisingly, is only 5 pages, and the authors reluctantly chose, on purpose or randomly, 5 comments to address, and ignored all other comments I curated. PLEASE RE-WRITE your response by addressing all comments I gave last time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Upon &#8220;editorial guidance&#8221;, the authors refrain from doing so. It all ends with mutual passive aggression (&#8220;No further comment&#8221; from both sides) &#8211; and acceptance for publication as an article.</p>



<p>Read it yourself to see how crazy and tiring peer review can be, and consider yourself how this situation could have been avoided by the authors or the reviewers. However, in the end, this review file is also a contribution to the scientific discussion (e.g., about proper PSF measurements) and therefore valuable by itself. It is a painful document, but also useful and full of insights.</p>

<p>Three-photon microscopy is a relatively new field still, and when these two papers came out in Nature Communications and eLife, respectively, I was very happy to be provided with the additional context and details in the peer review files. I found especially the discussion in the Nat Comm paper (paper 1) about potential concerns for three-photon imaging very interesting. </p>

<p>A few years ago, I had covered a preprint by Francioni et al. from the Rochefort lab <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/07/10/post-publication-review-somato-dendritic-coupling-of-l5-neurons-in-v1/">on my blog</a>. This study was later published on eLife, and since I liked the work of this paper already, I was very curious about the comments of the reviewers, their concerns, and the author&#8217;s replies. It is nice to get additional insights into such interesting studies!</p>

<p>The review file of this beautiful methods paper from the Burgalossi lab tells an interesting story. Apparently, the authors had included an additional experimental sub-study based on cfos in the paper, but the reviewers were not convinced by the results. They therefore suggested &#8211; very surprising to me! &#8211;  the acceptance of the paper for publication, but only after deletion of this subsection. I would not have guessed that such a unexpected and helpful consensus can be reached during the review process. This was probably helped by the fact that at eLife, it is common practice that editors and reviewers discuss their reviews with one another.</p>

<p>Purely theoretical (neuroscience) papers are often challenging because it is difficult to fully judge the novelty, even whenthe concepts and ideas and equations are transparent. This paper by Wu and Zenke is conceptually close to what I have studied experimentally during my PhD (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30786-4">paper link</a> in case you&#8217;re interested), so I was happy that this paper got published at eLife, with the review publicly available. A very useful secondary perspective!</p>

<p>This is &#8211; so far &#8211; the only paper with public review file where I have been involved as an author. I wrote some sections of the rebuttal letter, actually without knowing that the reviews and rebuttals would be openly available afterwards. Unfortunately, the journal (eNeuro) messed up the formatting in such a horrible way that the review file becomes almost unreadable (which is a pity, because our rebuttal letter was very nicely written). This mess-up shows that there is still some progress to make, also in terms of infrastructure.</p>



<p>In general, I hope that public review files will become more common in the future, to the extent that non-public review files will be a thing of the past entirely. Public reviews make the editorial process more transparent, they open up the discussion behind the paper, lower the barriers for junior researchers with less peer review experience, and do not have, to my understanding, any major negative side-effects.</p>
