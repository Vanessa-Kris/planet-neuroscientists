                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-loss-big-deal-astronomy-video">Why losing Arecibo is a big deal for astronomy</a></h4>

<p>Edgard Rivera-Valentín first visited the Arecibo Observatory as a little kid.</p>



<p>“I definitely remember this feeling of just being awestruck,” Rivera-Valentín says. “Looking at this gigantic telescope … getting to hear about all this neat work that was being done … it definitely leaves an impression.” Important science was happening right in the backyard of Rivera-Valentín’s hometown of Arecibo, Puerto Rico — and someday, Rivera-Valentín wanted to be a part of it.</p>



<p>As an adult, Rivera-Valentín returned to the observatory to work as a planetary scientist, using Arecibo to map the shapes and motions of potentially dangerous near-Earth asteroids. Now at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Rivera-Valentín continues to use Arecibo data to study planetary surfaces. So the recent news that the Arecibo Observatory would shut down was “heartbreaking.”</p>



<p>In August and November, two cables supporting a 900-metric-ton platform of scientific instruments above Arecibo’s dish unexpectedly broke. After assessing the damage, the National Science Foundation, which funds Arecibo, announced that the telescope <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-observatory-icon-puerto-rico-science-demolished">could not be safely repaired and would be torn down</a> (<em>SN: 11/19/20</em>). But before the telescope could be dismantled, the entire instrument platform crashed down into the dish on December 1.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>After suffering damage in recent months, the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope in Puerto Rico collapsed on December 1. Cables that suspended a platform of scientific instruments above the dish snapped, causing the platform to fall into the dish.</figure>



<p>For Puerto Rico, losing Arecibo is like New York losing the Empire State Building, or San Francisco losing the Golden Gate Bridge, Rivera-Valentín says — but with the added tragedy that Arecibo was not just a cultural and historic icon, but a prolific research facility.</p>





<p>“The loss of Arecibo is a big loss for the community,” says Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va. “The life cycle of Arecibo was really quite remarkable, and it did some amazing science.”</p>



<p>The observatory’s radar maps of the moon and Mars, for example, helped NASA pick landing sites for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/young-craters-best-landing-moon">Apollo</a> (<em>SN: 5/1/65</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-landing-message-puerto-rico">Viking</a> missions (<em>SN: 7/17/76</em>). And observations of the asteroid Bennu helped NASA plan its OSIRIS-REx mission to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">snag a sample</a> from the space rock (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>). Arecibo views of Saturn’s moon Titan have revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/news-splash-strong-evidence-lakes-titan">hydrocarbon lakes on its surface</a> (<em>SN: 10/1/03</em>).</p>



<p>Beyond the solar system, Arecibo has observed mysterious flashes of radio waves from deep space, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fast-radio-burst-steady-beat">fast radio bursts</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>), and the distribution of galaxies in the universe. Arecibo has also been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astronomy-158">used for decades</a> in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (<em>SN: 11/7/92</em>), and it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hello-said-earth-anybody-there">beamed the first radio message to aliens</a> into space in 1974 (<em>SN: 11/23/74</em>).</p>



<p>In the wake of Arecibo’s collapse, the radio astronomy community is “going to have to look at what was going on at Arecibo and figure out how to replace as best we can some of those capabilities with other instruments,” Beasley says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Arecibo Observatory before collapse" class="wp-image-3094099" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/120320_mt_arecibo_loss_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094099">In its 57-year lifetime, the huge radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (shown) made important discoveries in planetary science and astronomy.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094099">University of Central Florida</span></figure>



<p>But many of Arecibo’s capabilities can’t be easily replaced.</p>



<p>“Arecibo was unique in several ways,” says Donald Campbell, an astronomer at Cornell University and a former director of the observatory. For starters, Arecibo was enormous. At 305 meters across — covering some 20 acres — Arecibo was the world’s largest radio dish <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/largest-radio-radar-telescope-unveiled">from the time it was built in 1963</a> (<em>SN: 11/23/63</em>) until 2016, when China completed its Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST. With such a huge dish to collect radio waves, Arecibo could see very faint objects and phenomena.</p>



<p>That incredible sensitivity made Arecibo particularly good at detecting hard-to-spot objects such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-glimpses-pulsar-surface-hint-complex-magnetism">rapidly spinning neutron stars</a> called pulsars (<em>SN: 1/3/20</em>). As a pulsar rotates, it sweeps a beam of radio waves around in space like a lighthouse, which appears to Earth as a radio beacon flickering on and off.</p>



<p>“Arecibo was the king” of spotting the fickle light of pulsars, Beasley says. “There’s not going to be a simple solution to regenerating that level of collecting area.” The next biggest radio dish in the United States is the 100-meter-wide Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Smaller telescopes may require several hours of observing a target to collect enough radio waves for analysis, whereas Arecibo took only minutes.</p>



<p>Besides its mammoth size, Arecibo could also transmit radio waves. “Most radio astronomy telescopes do not have transmitters,” Campbell says. “They’re just receiving radio waves from space.” Radar transmitters allowed Arecibo to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-national-facility">bounce radio waves off of gases in the atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/70</em>), or the surfaces of asteroids and planets. The reflected signals that came back contained information about the target such as size, shape and motion.</p>





<p>“The high-powered transmitters allowed what was the original primary purpose of the telescope — the study of the Earth’s ionosphere,” Campbell says. The U.S. military, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-home-arecibo">funded the construction of Arecibo</a>, wanted to better understand Earth’s atmosphere to help develop missile defenses (<em>SN: 2/10/68</em>). But Arecibo’s radar transmitters “were also used to study solar system bodies — the planets, the moons, including our own moon,” Campbell says. “More recently, the emphasis has been on studying near-Earth asteroids” that could be on a collision course with Earth.</p>



<p>Other big radio dishes, such as China’s FAST or the Green Bank Telescope, are not outfitted with radar transmitters. NASA’s Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in the Mojave Desert has a 70-meter dish with radar capabilities. But Goldstone “is used both as a military installation and also as part of the Deep Space Network that talks to spacecraft, so it doesn’t have a lot of time,” Rivera-Valentín says. “And it’s not as sensitive as Arecibo,” so it can’t see as many asteroids.</p>



<p>Even at the time of its demise, the Arecibo Observatory still had “a bright scientific future,” says Joan Schmelz, an astronomer at the Universities Space Research Association in Mountain View, Calif., and a former deputy director of the observatory. “It wasn’t just resting on its laurels.” For instance, Arecibo was a key facility for the ongoing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-collisions-evade-detection">NANOGrav project</a>, which uses observations of pulsars to search for ripples in spacetime kicked up by supermassive black holes (<em>SN: 9/24/15</em>).</p>



<p>Arecibo’s observing days may be over, but that doesn’t mean data from the telescope won’t make any more contributions to science, Schmelz says. Some of radio astronomy’s most exciting discoveries have emerged from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">reanalysis of old telescope data</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/14</em>). “People will be continuing to analyze Arecibo data for some time,” she says, “and we’ll hopefully be seeing new scientific results as those data get analyzed and published.”</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>An interview technique known as “Asymmetric Information Management” provides a pretty effective way to spot liars</strong>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/spotting-liars-is-hard-but-our-new-method-is-effective-and-ethical-151035">writes researcher Cody Porter</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. The method basically involves explaining to the interviewee that it will be easier to figure out if they are lying or telling the truth if they provide longer, more detailed statements, Porter explains. Liars will tend to withhold information to try and hide their lie, while truth-tellers will provide detailed information as requested.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier this year, a </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/28/why-do-video-game-players-invert-the-controls"><strong><em>Guardian</em> article</strong></a><strong> explored why some video game players choose to invert their controls, so that pressing “up” makes their character look downwards. </strong>Now, inspired by the heated debate that followed, psychologists Jennifer Corbett and Jaap Munneke have decided to study the phenomenon in more detail, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/02/scientists-studying-why-gamers-invert-their-controls">Keith Stuart reports</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We often think that experiencing set-backs and failures will make eventual success seem even sweeter — but that may not always be true, </strong><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-failure-make-victory-seem-sweeter/">writes researcher Hallgeir Sjåstad</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. People who were told they performed poorly on a “practice” cognitive test predicted that they would feel <em>less</em> happiness or pride if they scored highly on the real test, compared to those who were told they performed well at practice. However, all participants showed equally high happiness when they <em>actually</em> received a top score.</p>

<p><strong>Amino acids in a meteorite</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/amino-acids-meteorite">Science News</a></em>, December 5, 1970</p>



<p>[Researchers] present evidence for the presence of amino acids of possible extraterrestrial origin in a meteorite that fell near Murchison, Victoria, Australia, Sept. 28, 1969.… If over the course of time their finding becomes accepted … it would demonstrate that amino acids, the basic building blocks of proteins, can be and have been formed outside the Earth.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists confirmed in 1971 that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/origin-space">the Murchison meteorite contained amino acids</a>, primarily glycine, and that those organic compounds likely came from outer space (<em>SN: 3/20/71, p. 195</em>). In the decades since, amino acids and other chemical precursors to life have been uncovered in other fallen space rocks. Recent discoveries include compounds called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorites-contain-chemicals-linked-life">nucleobases</a> and sugars that are key components of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/did-space-rocks-deliver-sugar">DNA</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ribose-sugar-needed-life-has-been-detected-meteorites">RNA</a>. The amino acid glycine even has been spotted in outer space in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comet-67p-carries-two-ingredients-life-glycine-phosphorus">atmosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</a>. Such findings bolster the idea that life could exist elsewhere in the universe.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stones-mastodon-bones-debate-america-first-settlers">Two stones fuel debate over when America’s first settlers arrived</a></h4>

<p>Scientific debate about the most controversial archaeological site in the Americas has entered rocky new territory.</p>



<p>In 2017, scientists reported that around 130,000 years ago, an unidentified <em>Homo </em>species used stone tools to break apart a mastodon’s bones near what is now San Diego. If true, that would mean that humans or one of our close evolutionary relatives <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-settlers-reached-americas-130000-years-ago-study-claims">reached the Americas</a> at least 100,000 years earlier than previously thought, dramatically reshaping scientists’ understanding of when the region was settled (<em>SN: 4/26/17</em>).</p>



<p>Critics have questioned whether the unearthed stones were actually used as tools. And other researchers suggested that supposed tool marks on the bones could have been created as the bones were carried by fast-moving streams or caused by construction activity that partially exposed the California site before its excavation in 1992 and 1993.</p>



<p>But new analyses bolster the controversial claim, says a team that includes some of the researchers involved in the initial finding. Chemical residue of bones <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X20304478">appears on two stones</a> previously found among mastodon remains at the Cerutti Mastodon site, the scientists report in the December<em> Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>. The two Cerutti rocks also show signs of having delivered or received hard blows where bone residue accumulated, the team says. The larger stone may have served as a platform on which the bones were smashed open with the smaller stone, possibly to remove marrow for eating or to obtain bone chunks suitable for shaping into tools.</p>





<p>“Many repeated blows are likely to have created the concentrations of broken [mastodon] bones” found at the site, says Richard Fullagar, a geoarcheaologist at the University of Wollongong in Australia who was also part of the original research. Hominids — perhaps Neandertals, Denisovans, <em>Homo erectus</em> or <em>Homo sapiens</em> — battered the large creature’s remains on one or possibly several visits to the site, Fullagar contends.</p>



<p>In the new study, Fullagar, Wollongong geoarchaeologist Luc Bordes and colleagues used microscopes to determine that the chemical and molecular structure of residue on the two stones matched that of bones in general. That residue must have been acquired by pounding apart mammoth bones that were found scattered around the stones, the team argues. Since microscopic remnants of bone appeared only where stones showed signs of wear and hard impacts, it’s unlikely that the stones accumulated the residue by accidentally coming in contact with mastodon bones after being covered by sediment, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Parts of broken Cerutti mammoth bones are also covered with hardened crusts that formed thousands of years ago or more. The survival of those crusts, the researchers contend, contradicts the argument that Cerutti stones and bones may have been damaged by construction activity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="mastodon bones" class="wp-image-3094007" height="440" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/113020_bb_stones_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094007">A new study may add to evidence that the controversial proposal that stones and mastodon bones previously excavated in California, including those shown here, represent the earliest known evidence of human activity in the Americas.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094007">Larry Agenbroad</span></figure>



<p>But the new findings haven’t settled the dispute. Repeated truck traffic over the area during construction could have jostled recently buried stones against older, fossilized mastodon bones, creating damage that has been confused for ancient, intentional tool use, says archaeologist Gary Haynes of the University of Nevada, Reno. For instance, one previously unearthed mastodon limb bone was shattered into several hundred pieces, consistent with the effects of heavy trucks frequently rumbling overhead, Haynes says.</p>



<p>The newly analyzed bone residue also does not include collagen. This component of bone typically degrades during fossilization, but traces from fresh bone can stick around. Stones presumably used a long time ago to break fresh mastodon bones should have picked up residue containing at least some collagen. So that lack raises the possibility that, rather than ancient stones being used to break fresh mastodon bones, truck traffic thrust buried stones against fossilized mastodon bones containing little or no surviving collagen, Haynes says.</p>



<p>An unpublished 2015 study, also coauthored by Fullagar, found collagen residues on three Cerutti stones, including the newly proposed hammering stone. That investigation used a special dye to identify collagen traces. Further research is needed to determine whether the techniques used in the new study can’t detect ancient collagen residues or if collagen-retaining areas of the two Cerutti stones just weren’t sampled.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-light-based-quantum-computer-jiuzhang-supremacy">The new light-based quantum computer Jiuzhang has achieved quantum supremacy</a></h4>

<p>A new type of quantum computer has proven that it can reign supreme, too.</p>



<p>A photonic quantum computer, which harnesses particles of light, or photons, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe8770">performed a calculation that’s impossible for a conventional computer</a>, researchers in China report online December 3 in <em>Science</em>. That milestone, known as quantum supremacy, has been met only once before, in 2019 by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google’s quantum computer</a> (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Google’s computer, however, is based on superconducting materials, not photons.</p>



<p>“This is the first independent confirmation of Google’s claim that you really can achieve quantum supremacy,” says theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin. “That’s exciting.”</p>



<p>Named Jiuzhang after an ancient Chinese mathematical text, the new quantum computer can perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take more than half a billion years on the world’s fastest non-quantum, or classical, computer.</p>





<p>“My first impression was, ‘wow,’” says quantum physicist Fabio Sciarrino of Sapienza University of Rome.</p>



<p>Google’s device, called Sycamore, is based on tiny quantum bits made of superconducting materials, which conduct energy without resistance. In contrast, Jiuzhang consists of a complex array of optical devices that shuttle photons around. Those devices include light sources, hundreds of beam splitters, dozens of mirrors and 100 photon detectors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="quantum computer Jiuzhang" class="wp-image-3094072" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/120320_ec_quantum_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094072">The quantum computer Jiuzhang manipulates light via a complex arrangement of optical devices (shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094072">Hansen Zhong</span></figure>



<p>Employing a process called boson sampling, Jiuzhang generates a distribution of numbers that is exceedingly difficult for a classical computer to replicate. Here’s how it works: Photons are first sent into a network of channels. There, each photon encounters a series of beam splitters, each of which sends the photon down two paths simultaneously, in what’s called a quantum superposition. Paths also merge together, and the repeated splitting and merging causes the photons to interfere with one another according to quantum rules.</p>



<p>Finally, the number of photons in each of the network’s output channels is measured at the end. When repeated many times, this process produces a distribution of numbers based on how many photons were found in each output.</p>



<p>If operated with large numbers of photons and many channels, the quantum computer will produce a distribution of numbers that is too complex for a classical computer to calculate. In the new experiment, up to 76 photons traversed a network of 100 channels. For one of the world’s most powerful classical computers, the Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight, predicting the results that the quantum computer would get for anything beyond about 40 photons was intractable.</p>



<p>While Google was the first to break the quantum supremacy barrier, the milestone is “not a single-shot achievement,” says study coauthor and quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. “It’s a continuous competition between constantly improved quantum hardware and constantly improved classical simulation.” After Google’s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google’s computer completed, at least theoretically.</p>





<p>And achieving quantum supremacy doesn’t necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet very useful, because the calculations are esoteric ones designed to be difficult for classical computers.</p>



<p>The result does boost the profile of photonic quantum computers, which haven’t always received as much attention as other technologies, says quantum physicist Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, a Toronto-based company focused on building photonic quantum computers.  “Historically, photonics has been the dark horse.”</p>



<p>One limitation of Jiuzhang, Weedbrook notes, is that it can perform only a single type of task, namely, boson sampling. In contrast, Google’s quantum computer could be programmed to execute a variety of algorithms. But other types of photonic quantum computers, including Xanadu’s, are programmable.</p>



<p>Demonstrating quantum supremacy with a different type of device reveals how rapidly quantum computing is progressing, Sciarrino says. “The fact that now the two different platforms are able to achieve this regime … shows that the whole field is advancing in a very mature way.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-humans-sea-voyage-japan-ryukyu-island-migration">Ancient humans may have deliberately voyaged to Japan’s Ryukyu Islands</a></h4>

<p>Long ago, ancient mariners successfully navigated a perilous ocean journey to arrive at Japan’s Ryukyu Islands, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Archaeological sites on six of these isles — part of a 1,200-kilometer-long chain — indicate that migrations to the islands occurred 35,000 to 30,000 years ago, both from the south via Taiwan and from the north via the Japanese island of Kyushu.</p>



<p>But whether ancient humans navigated there on purpose or drifted there by accident on the Kuroshio ocean current, one of the world’s largest and strongest currents, is unclear. The answer to that question could shed light on the proficiency of these Stone Age humans as mariners and their mental capabilities overall.</p>



<p>Now, satellite-tracked buoys that simulated wayward rafts suggest that there’s little chance that the seafarers reached the isles by accident.</p>





<p>Researchers analyzed 138 buoys that were released near or passed by Taiwan and the Philippine island Luzon from 1989 to 2017, deployed as part of the <a href="https://gdp.ucsd.edu/ldl/global-drifter-program/">Global Drifter Program</a> to map surface ocean currents worldwide. In findings published online December 3 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, the team found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76831-7">only four of the buoys came within 20 kilometers</a> of any of the Ryukyu Islands, and these did so only as a result of typhoons and other adverse weather.</p>



<p>It is unlikely that ancient mariners would have set out on an ocean voyage with a major storm on the horizon, say paleoanthropologist Yousuke Kaifu of the University of Tokyo and colleagues. As a result, the new findings indicate that the Kuroshio current would have forced drifters away from rather than toward the Ryukyu Islands, suggesting that anyone who made the crossing did so intentionally instead of accidentally, Kaifu says.</p>



<p>Geologic records suggest that currents in the region have remained stable for at least the past 100,000 years. So it’s reasonable to conclude that these buoys mimic how well ancient watercraft set adrift in the same area might have fared, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“From a navigation perspective, crossing to the Ryukyus was so challenging that accidental-drift models are unlikely to provide an effective explanation,” agrees archaeologist Thomas Leppard of Florida State University in Tallahassee, who was not involved in the research. This new work “is, of course, not conclusive, but it is suggestive.”</p>



<p>Stone tools and butchered remains of a rhinoceros suggest archaic human lineages such as <em>Homo erectus</em> may have similarly crossed seas at least <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0072-8">709,000 years ago</a>. And artifacts found in Australia suggest modern humans may have begun voyaging across the ocean <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-first-settled-australia-early-65000-years-ago">at least 65,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/19/17</em>). But it remains hotly debated whether humans’ ocean journeys during the Paleolithic, which lasted from roughly 2.6 million years ago to about 11,700 years ago, were generally made accidentally or intentionally.</p>



<p>Other data do suggest that ancient humans could have deliberately made the voyage to the Ryukyu Islands. In 2019, a team of adventurers succeeded in paddling more than 200 kilometers from Taiwan to Yonaguni in the archipelago using <a href="https://www.kahaku.go.jp/research/activities/special/koukai/en/">a dugout canoe</a> that Kaifu and his colleagues made using stone axes modeled off Japanese Paleolithic artifacts.</p>



<p>Although the people of the Paleolithic are often perceived as primitive and conservative in their goals, “I feel something very different from the evidence of human presence on these remote islands,” Kaifu says.</p>

<img alt="friendly doctor talking to patient . CT Scan in hospital" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/CT-Scan-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the era of protocol-driven care, straightforward guidelines are often desired but can result in oversimplification of the decision. That has been the case for use of iin individuals with kidney disease. Instead of weighing the risk of contrast administration on a case-by-case basis, there seems to be a default to a recommendation against the use of contrast. This has resulted in patients with kidney disease not getting the necessary studies leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recognizing contrast nephropathy and those characteristics that contribute to risk are important to an informed decision on the use of contrast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recognizing contrast nephropathy and those characteristics that contribute to risk are important to an informed decision on the use of contrast. The variable definitions for diagnosis and the previous use of high osmolar agents resulted in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2017.03.003">high incidence of acute kidney injury</a>. Keep in mind, this diagnosis was often based on the labs and clinical scenario without confirmatory kidney biopsy findings. Biopsies may show features of acute tubular necrosis, but there is no distinguishing feature to implicate iodinated contrast exposure.</p>
<p>Review of larger administrative databases cannot reproduce the higher rates of acute kidney injury. In a larger series, using propensity scores comparing 116,694 who received contrast for CT scans with 40,446 who did not receive contrast. There was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015154044">no increase in absolute risk of kidney injury</a>. Another review of an administrative inpatient database of 5.9 million individuals with comorbidities by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2016010021">Wilheml-Leen <em>et al.</em></a> demonstrated the risk of acute kidney injury was nearly the same regardless of the use of IV contrast.</p>
<p>The use of iso-osmolar/low molecular weight agents has resulted in lower rates of contrast-induced kidney injury. Identification of factors such as underlying CKD stage 4 or 5, use of higher osmolar agents, intra-arterial administration of the contrast, concomitant hemodynamic instability, use of a large volume of contrast, and pre-existing volume depletion would help practitioners better predict the risk of contrast use. The risk for an individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> receiving iodinated contrast for a CT scan of the chest to evaluate a pulmonary nodule is not the same as the individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> who presents with acute myocardial infarction and hemodynamic instability needing an emergent cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p>Our recommendations for contrast use in these two cases should not be the same. Contrast-induced nephrotoxic injury can occur but the risk is not the same for all situations. Our approach should be a more thoughtful review of the individual clinical situation and an assessment of whether the benefit of the information gained from the study outweighs the risk. Additionally, there should be a dialogue with patients about the decision-making process rather than simplified guidelines.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>A huge variety of factors are related to memory, from mood to personality to what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/30/amsterdam-coffee-shop-study-explores-the-effects-of-cannabis-on-eye-witness-memory/">substances have been consumed</a>. One recent study, for example, found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/20/memory-complaints-are-more-common-among-older-adults-with-particular-personality-traits/">older adults with higher openness to experience also experienced fewer cognitive complaints</a> each day; other work has found a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629149/">relationship between self-reported memory and traits</a> including neuroticism and extraversion.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620953883">study published in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>, Emily F. Hittner from Northwestern University and team have looked at the relationship between memory and positive affect — the experience of pleasant emotional states like enthusiasm, pride or joy. And they found less memory decline over time in those participants with higher levels of positive affect.</p>



<span id="more-40944"></span>



<p>The team analysed data from 991 participants who had taken part in a longitudinal study of households in the United States. At the first time point, when participants were an average of 55 years old, they had reported  their levels of positive affect using two scales, which asked how often during the last month they had felt enthusiastic, active, peaceful, satisfied and so on. They also completed measures of depression and negative affect, as well as personality trait scales.</p>



<p>Participants also took part in a memory assessment. In this test, they were read a list of 15 unrelated words and then had to recall as many as they could immediately (immediate recall) and, in a test they were not warned about, after fifteen minutes (delayed recall). Then, nine years later, participants completed this memory test again.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, people who reported more positive affect at the first time point showed less memory decline over these nine years. Particular facets of positive affect were also associated with less memory decline — greater enthusiasm, cheerfulness, pride, and feelings of calm and peace were all related to slower memory decline, while greater attentiveness or satisfaction were not. Importantly, all the analyses took into account other factors like participants’ <em>negative</em> affect, personality traits and age, suggesting that these weren’t responsible for the results.</p>



<p>Why positive affect is related to a slower rate of memory decline, however, was less clear. The team suggests a number of pathways that could link the two: if you have a positive outlook on life, for example, you might be more inclined to engage in adaptive health behaviours or to foster beneficial social relationships. Positive affect in and of itself may not be the crucial factor, in other words, instead acting as the source of behaviours that improve or protect health.</p>



<p>Memory loss can be devastating, particularly in older adults — forgetting to take vital medication, for example, has serious consequences, and the emotional and social ramifications of forgetting the names or faces of acquaintances can also be severe. Memory decline can also predict the onset of dementia. Developing ways to predict (and prevent) memory loss is an important task. Screening for positive affect as a way of predicting potential memory decline, as the team suggests, could therefore have implications for cognitive as well as mental health, helping improve wellbeing across the board.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-last-mile-logistics-pfizer-moderna">The ‘last mile’ for COVID-19 vaccines could be the biggest challenge yet</a></h4>

<p>A race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine began almost the minute the coronavirus’s genetic makeup was revealed in January.</p>



<p>Already, two companies have announced that their vaccines appear safe and about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results">95 percent</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results">effective</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/20, SN: 11/16/20</em>). Government regulators in the United Kingdom granted permission December 2 for emergency use of a vaccine made by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German biotech partner BioNTech. The first doses could be delivered within days of the announcement. Emergency use authorization and even full approval of the vaccines is probably not far off in the United States and other countries.</p>



<p>But another race is just beginning. Ultimately, the vaccines won’t truly be successful until enough people have gotten them to stop the spread of the virus and prevent severe disease and death. And that will pose a logistical challenge unlike any other.</p>



<p>In normal times, potential vaccines have only a 10 percent chance of making it from Phase II clinical trials — which test safety, dosing and sometimes give hints about effectiveness — to approval within 10 years, researchers reported November 24 in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. On average, it <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-5350">takes successful vaccines over four years</a> to go from Phase II trials to full regulatory approval.</p>

<p>Even if the COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer or by the biotechnology company Moderna are distributed in late December under emergency use provisions — less than a year after clinical trials began — they may not gain full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for months, or even years. Even so, such lickety-split action to get out a vaccine against a previously unknown illness is unparalleled.</p>



<p>But though the race to make a COVID-19 vaccine is moving at a world-record pace, it is far from over, says Robin Townley in Washington, D.C., who heads special-projects logistics for A.P. Moller-Maersk, a company that handles supply chain logistics and transportation services for companies around the world.</p>



<p>“The vaccine race now is not a race out of the lab. It’s a race to the patient,” he says. And the most successful vaccines, Townley says, will be those made by the companies that pay the most attention to the last mile of the race.</p>



<p>That last mile — the vaccine’s journey from, say, centralized distribution centers to clinics and finally to patients — isn’t a measure of distance. It’s a pothole-strewn maze of regulations and supply chains that companies must navigate to get their vaccine distributed, eventually to almost every person on the planet.</p>



<p>The magnitude and intensity of the task ahead is unprecedented, Townley says. “It is the largest product launch in the history of humankind.”</p>



<h4>Managing the last mile</h4>



<p>The sheer scale of vaccinating the world is daunting. With most COVID-19 vaccines in development requiring two doses for full effect, there will be a need for roughly 15 billion doses globally.</p>



<p>Management of the vaccine rollout is a key variable — <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02054">at least as important as vaccine efficacy</a> — in the equation determining how well a vaccine will quell the pandemic, researchers reported November 19 in <em>Health Affairs</em>. Researchers considered different scenarios, figuring in vaccine effectiveness, the pace at which people could be vaccinated (depending both on delivery systems and public willingness) and how quickly the virus spreads.</p>



<p>Even a vaccine that is only 50 percent effective in preventing disease could quell the pandemic if it were distributed quickly enough, says study coauthor Jason Schwartz, a vaccination policy researcher at the Yale School of Public Health. “Implementation matters.”</p>



<p>Creating the vaccines is a remarkable scientific achievement, Schwartz says, but the technical and logistical challenges of getting the vaccines where they need to go is going to be every bit as challenging as the scientific issues.</p>



<p>For example, while many of the vaccines in the works will require refrigeration, Pfizer’s vaccine — the first fully tested vaccine to get permission for emergency use — must be kept especially cold, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna">frozen at –70° Celsius</a>. That vaccine requires ultracold freezers or dry ice for refilling specialized delivery containers (<em>SN: 11/20/20</em>). Moderna’s vaccine also needs to be frozen, but is stable at regular freezer temperatures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Pfizer freezer farm in Kalamazoo, Mich." class="wp-image-3094032" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/120220_ti_cold-transport-vaccine_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094032">Vaccines will be transported from Pfizer’s “freezer farm” (shown) in Kalamazoo, Mich., to various sites in the United States. In Europe, similar facilities in Belgium and Germany will handle distribution, and the Belgian site will serve as a backup for the Michigan site.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094032">Pfizer</span></figure>



<p>To get a sense of the task ahead, imagine “putting two iPhones in the hands of every single human on the planet, and make sure those iPhones are cold when they get there,” Townley says.</p>



<p>Refrigerated and freezer trucks, planes and trains that can transport such chilly goods aren’t in huge supply. Cold transportation is also necessary to move bacon, avocados and many other foods and medicines, such as insulin, Townley says. “Normal systems are not built to take on this large of a challenge in this short of a time frame,” he adds.</p>



<p>As a result, trade-offs will need to be made. Either distributors won’t be able to ship some other temperature-controlled cargoes, or they will need to add more cold-shipping capacity, which is expensive.</p>



<p>Much of the need for cold shipping is seasonal, such as avocado season in South Africa and Mexico. ”If the vaccine season hits South Africa at the same time as avocado season [and] there’s not a whole lot of capacity for carrying avocados,” Townley says, “what does that do to South Africa’s economy?”</p>



<p>It will be hard enough for many places within the United States to manage Pfizer’s super-cold vaccine, says Mei Mei Hu, cofounder and cochief executive of Covaxx, a company based in Hauppauge, N.Y., that is working on its own COVID-19 vaccine. And “if it’s difficult in the U.S., it’s going to be virtually impossible in most emerging markets,” such as Central and South America and many places in Africa, she says.</p>



<p>Even regular freezers, such as those needed to store Moderna’s vaccine, may be a challenge in some areas. “There’s lots of places where you can’t get a cold Coke,” Hu says.</p>



<h4>Keeping it cold</h4>



<p>Pfizer has devised special shipping containers, nicknamed pizza boxes for the food delivery containers that they resemble, that can be recharged with dry ice to keep the company’s vaccine cold in transit and for short-term storage. The U.S. government has told states that it will send one dry ice recharge with each shipment of the vaccine, says Kurt Seetoo, the immunization program manager for the Maryland Department of Health in Baltimore.</p>



<p>But that recharge won’t last long, so providers will need to find local sources of dry ice, which may be difficult in rural areas. Maryland is working with local contractors to ensure there will be a ready supply of dry ice when it is needed, Seetoo says.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Pfizer has assured health officials in the United States that its vaccine can be held for up to 15 days in its pizza boxes with dry ice recharges every five days and then spend another five days in the refrigerator before going bad, Seetoo says. That gives officials about 20 days to distribute the vaccine once they receive it.</p>



<p>Still, dry ice sublimates, or turns directly into carbon dioxide gas. The fumes can build up and suffocate people if there’s not enough ventilation, which could make transporting and storing vaccines cooled with dry ice a problem. </p>



<p>One solution is to use devices developed for transporting cells between laboratories or for moving temperature-sensitive medicines, such as those used in cancer or gene therapies, to clinics, says Dusty Tenney, chief executive of Stirling Ultracold, a company that makes portable freezers that go as low as –80° C.</p>



<p>Stirling’s portable freezers — which look like high-tech versions of beach coolers — are being deployed to get COVID-19 vaccines from “freezer farms,” where the vaccines are stored after they come off production lines, to clinics and other distribution sites.</p>



<p>Such freezers are just one link in a “cold chain” needed to keep the vaccines fresh and effective. But the chain is fragile. The World Health Organization estimates that about <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/call-to-action_ipac-iscl.pdf">2.8 million doses of vaccines were lost in five countries in 2011</a> because the cold chain was broken. That includes losses in countries such as Nigeria, where 41 percent of refrigerators were nonfunctional, and Ethiopia, which had about 30 percent of its cold-chain equipment go kaput. Losing millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines could be disastrous for getting a handle on the pandemic.</p>



<h4>Dosing dilemma</h4>



<p>In the United States, another hurdle is that each state isn’t sure how much vaccine it will get from the federal government, Seetoo says. That makes it hard to determine how many doses the state will get for health care workers and people in long-term care homes who will be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-who-should-get-vaccines-first">first in line</a> to get the vaccine (<em>SN:12/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>And the two-dose requirement for most COVID-19 vaccines adds to the supply problems, says Christine Turley, a pediatrician and Vice Chair of Research for Atrium Health Levine Children’s Hospital in Charlotte, N.C. Unless doctors, pharmacies and other providers are sure they’ll have a steady supply of vaccine, they will need to save half of a shipment to give people booster shots three weeks to a month after the first shot.</p>



<p>“If I vaccinate people and can’t provide a second dose, that’s not meeting a moral and ethical obligation,” Turley says.</p>



<p>Keeping track of who got vaccinated, which vaccine they got — both doses need to come from the same company — and when people are due for a second dose is another potentially daunting logistical challenge. Databases used to manage patient data or to order and ship medical supplies aren’t well integrated among vaccine providers and local, state and federal government agencies, which could lead to confusion, says Pouria Sanae, chief executive of ixlayer, a company that provides logistics services for COVID-19 testing and vaccination centers. Existing databases may need to be beefed up and given new ways of managing information, he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="worker loading vials of COVID-19 vaccine into containers" class="wp-image-3094033" height="456" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/120220_ti_cold-transport-vaccine_inline2.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094033">A worker loads vials of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine into specialized containers, nicknamed pizza boxes, which are charged with dry ice to keep the vaccines at –70° Celsius for transport and short-term storage.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094033">Pfizer</span></figure>



<p>And it’s not just digital infrastructure that will be important. Physical spaces will be needed to administer the vaccines and their multiple doses to many, many people as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>



<p>For comparison, Sanae points out that the demand for widespread COVID-19 testing initially took many people by surprise. “If we went back to January and I told you we’d be collecting testing samples in a parking lot, you’d probably laugh at me,” he says. But that’s what it may take to get vaccines distributed as widely as tests are. He envisions every school, government and community testing center converted to vaccination clinics, along with doctors’ offices, pharmacies, hospitals and other clinics.</p>



<h4>Logistical nightmare</h4>



<p>Finally, it’s not just the vaccines themselves that need to be rolled out smoothly. Suppliers of the glass vials that hold the vaccines have to make sure they have enough surgical-grade sand to make the vials. Nurses giving vaccine shots need alcohol wipes, syringes, needles, masks and gloves, some of which are in short supply in places. Managing all of those logistics is a sticky proposition, especially on the scale needed to immunize the world against COVID-19.</p>



<p>“The logistics just keep going,” Turley says. From Borneo to Paris to Charlotte, N.C., how best to distribute vaccines is a problem people are facing everywhere, she says. “The only consolation is that everybody is grappling with this, and that’s really no consolation to any of us.”</p>



<p>Even if everything goes smoothly and distribution happens as swiftly as the vaccines’ initial development, all could be for naught if people don’t take other measures, such as universal mask wearing and social distancing, that can help slow the spread of the virus.</p>



<p>Schwartz, the vaccination policy researcher at the Yale, and his colleagues took virus spread into account when making their calculations. If things keep going as they have in the past few weeks, with more than 150,000 new coronavirus cases and about 1,500 deaths — about one every minute — reported daily in the United States, vaccine distribution would need to move lightning fast to prevent millions more deaths. “If we’re at that [high level of transmission], even a highly effective vaccine will struggle to make a dent in the trajectory of the pandemic,” Schwartz says.</p>

Researchers in China have received an expression of concern for a recent paper on COVID-19 pneumonia after editors were alerted to suspicious similarities between the tables in the article and those in a 2018 study by members of the same group. In case you missed that: The pandemic started long after 2018.

<p>The United Kingdom became the first country to approve a fully tested COVID-19 vaccine for its citizens on December 2 when it OK’d Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-russia-vaccine-testing">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-oxford-cansino-pfizer-immune-response">China</a> have allowed emergency use of vaccines made in those countries, but did so before safety and effectiveness trials were completed (<em>SN: 8/11/20; SN: 7/21/20</em>). The United Arab Emirates also granted early emergency use authorization for two Chinese-made vaccines.</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine regulators will review Pfizer’s application for emergency use authorization on December 10. Many experts expect the vaccine, developed with Germany-based BioNTech, will get FDA’s nod because its effectiveness is well above the 50 percent threshold the agency previously said would be required for authorization. In November, Pfizer announced that its vaccine was about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results">95 percent effective</a> at preventing illness in a large clinical trial in the United States (<em>SN: 11/18/20</em>). </p>

<p>Pfizer and BioNTech began a “rolling review” process in the United Kingdom in October, giving health regulators there time to review data as they became available. Scientists and clinicians <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-gives-approval-for-first-uk-covid-19-vaccine">considered data</a> from laboratory studies, animal studies and safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials in people when making the decision, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said in a news release.</p>



<p>Pfizer has contracted with the United Kingdom to provide <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-achieve-first-authorization-world">40 million doses</a> of vaccine to be delivered in 2020 and 2021. Since the vaccine requires two doses, that’s enough to immunize 20 million people. The first doses will arrive within days from the company’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, the company said in a news release. </p>



<p>The vaccine uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, to deliver instructions to human cells for building one of the coronavirus’s proteins. Once cells begin making the protein, the immune system builds antibodies and other defenses that stop future invasions of the virus from making people ill. The vaccine must be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna">stored at –70° Celsius</a> to remain effective, so requires special shipping and storage conditions that could make its roll-out more challenging than for traditional vaccines, which need only refrigeration (<em>SN: 11/20/20</em>).</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper "Cliques and cavities in human connectome".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges
captures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted
as humans order relations, concepts naturally expressed in the language of
algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study mesoscale network
structures that arise from the arrangement of densely connected substructures
called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We detect cliques
(all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average structural
connectomes of 8 healthy adults scanned in triplicate and discover the presence
of more large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring
minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform
rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different
dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging
patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those
observed in null model networks, and - importantly - link regions of early and
late evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in
controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that
techniques from algebraic topology offer a novel perspective on structural
connectomics, highlighting loop-like paths as crucial features in the human
brain’s structural architecture.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-time-capsule-pandemic-moments-future-researchers">A COVID-19 time capsule captures pandemic moments for future researchers</a></h4>

<p>Imagine if, at the height of the 1918 flu pandemic, researchers studying how society was changing had captured the moment in a time capsule. What information might social scientists today have gleaned from such an effort? How might that repository inform the global response to the current pandemic? Theoretically such an artifact could be buried somewhere, but for now, researchers are out of luck.</p>



<p>When the next pandemic invariably strikes, though, social scientists might find themselves better situated. The nonprofit Social Science Research Council, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., has assembled <a href="https://covid19research.ssrc.org/time-capsule/">a collection of images</a> that aims to freeze in time the myriad ways the COVID-19 crisis is transforming societies worldwide. And unlike time capsules of yesteryear, this version will live entirely online. The capsule currently includes an eclectic mix of photographs, charts and even a drawing appearing to depict infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci as a saint.</p>



<p>Alondra Nelson, president of the council, says she and colleagues knew by spring that the pandemic was going to trigger massive societal change. Council staff came up with numerous <a href="https://covid19research.ssrc.org/">initiatives to help scientists</a> discuss and study those changes, including grants for COVID-19 research. With support from outside sponsors, council staffers also set up an essay forum in which scientists evaluated the pandemic from varying vantage points — from its effect on democracy to what society might look like in the aftertimes. The group also began a crowdsourced “syllabus” covering scholarly and creative writings addressing all things pandemic.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img alt="image of Tony Fauci" class="wp-image-3093961" height="866" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_reviews_inline.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093961">Among the images included in a COVID-19 time capsule curated by social scientists is this drawing of Anthony Fauci.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093961">Daniel Stetson</span></figure></div>



<p>But Nelson also wanted to capture the flood of images emerging from such a massive global upheaval. That led to the idea of a visual time capsule. Starting in the spring, the council began asking prominent researchers to select any image that spoke to their understanding of the crisis and then explain the choice in an interview.</p>



<p>Some researchers honed in on how the pandemic illuminated the United States’ racial and socioeconomic disparities, while others went more obscure or even darkly humorous, including, for example, a graphic asking viewers if they want to pay by Visa, Mastercard or toilet paper. So far, the time capsule consists of 21 images and corresponding interviews.</p>





<p>What’s most striking when viewing the images in aggregate is that, in the midst of a pandemic that has taken more than 1.3 million lives as of mid-November, few images speak directly to death or dying. More common are depictions of everyday life, such as a screenshot of a virtual classroom. There are also individuals, mostly people of color, still going about their jobs in person: A Black worker cleans a chair in a U.S. Senate chamber. A Black bike messenger passes a boarded-up Louis Vuitton store to make a delivery.</p>



<p>This catalog is both academic and personal. Economic sociologist Brooke Harrington of Dartmouth College selected an image of a Danish mother and son waiting to enter a school building in April. Harrington says the photo is a reminder that had she stayed in Denmark, where she worked for nearly a decade, that could have been her standing in line with her own son. Instead, her boy is attending school from home, and Harrington, like so many working parents, especially mothers, is simultaneously juggling work and family. “If you’re asking me in my capacity as an individual trying to stay alive and do my job in 2020, this is what is at the forefront of my mind,” she told <em>Science News</em>.</p>



<p>The problem of shuttered day care and schools in the United States and elsewhere is ongoing. But other images in the collection remind present-day viewers of moments that may have already been forgotten amid a frenetic news cycle. Consider the image of the <em>Diamond Princess</em> cruise ship berthed in Yokohama, Japan. After hundreds of passengers fell ill with the coronavirus in February, nobody on the ship was allowed to disembark for weeks. Remember when the passengers’ plight was the news <em>du jour</em>? I didn’t.</p>



<p>Which perhaps illustrates the point of preserving these moments in perpetuity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geminid-meteor-shower-december-asteroid-phaethon">December’s stunning Geminid meteor shower is born from a humble asteroid</a></h4>

<p>On Sunday night, December 13, countless meteors will shoot across the sky as space particles burn up in our atmosphere and meet a fiery end. Most meteor showers occur when Earth slams into debris left behind by a comet.</p>



<p>But not this meteor shower, which is likely to be the most spectacular of the year. Known as the Geminid shower, it strikes every December and arises not from a flamboyant comet but from an ordinary asteroid — the first, but not the last, linked to a meteor shower.</p>



<p>Although both comets and asteroids are small objects orbiting the sun, icy comets sprout beautiful tails when their ice vaporizes in the heat of the sun. In contrast, asteroids have earned the name “vermin of the skies” for streaking through and ruining photographs of celestial vistas by reflecting the sun’s light.</p>



<p>So how can a mere asteroid outdo all of the glamorous comets and spawn a meteor shower that surpasses its rivals? “It remains a mystery,” says David Jewitt, an astronomer at UCLA. It’s akin to an ugly duckling’s offspring usurping the beautiful swan’s to win first place in a beauty contest.</p>





<p>Astronomers still don’t know the secret to the asteroid’s success in creating a shower that at its peak normally produces more meteors per hour than any other shower of the year. Three years ago, however, the asteroid swung extra close to Earth and gave scientists their best chance to study the humble space rock. They now look forward to the launch of a spacecraft that will image the asteroid’s surface.</p>





<h4>Cosmic connections</h4>



<p>Astronomers first linked a meteor shower to a comet in 1866. They connected the well-known Perseid meteors, visible to most of the world every August, with a comet named Swift-Tuttle that had passed Earth four years earlier. Astronomers later matched most major meteor showers with one comet or another.</p>



<p>When a comet’s ice vaporizes in sunlight, dust grains also fly off the comet. These dust particles, called meteoroids, sprinkle along the comet’s orbit like a dandelion gone to seed. If Earth plows into this long dust stream, we see a fiery shower as the particles hit our atmosphere. The typical meteoroid is no larger than a grain of sand, but it travels so fast that it energizes electrons both in its own atoms as it disintegrates and in atmospheric atoms and molecules. As these electrons lose energy, they emit the streak of light — the meteor — that looks as though a star has fallen from the sky.</p>



<p>Still, as comet after comet was linked to different meteor showers, the Geminids remained apart; no one knew their source.</p>



<p>The Geminid meteors stood out in other ways, too. Unlike the Perseid meteors, which people have been observing for nearly 2,000 years, the Geminids are relatively new. First reports of their existence came from England and the United States in 1862. The shower in those days was weak, producing at most only one or two dozen meteors an hour. During the 20th century, however, the shower strengthened. Nowadays, at the shower’s peak, a single observer under a dark sky can see more than 100 meteors an hour. That’s better than most Perseid performances.</p>



<p>On top of that, the Geminid meteoroid stream, the ribbon of dust that traces the asteroid’s orbit around the sun, is newer than many other streams. Over time, streams spread out, but this one is so narrow it must have formed less than 2,000 years ago and maybe only a few hundred years ago. And based on how little the meteoroids slow down when they hit the air, astronomers deduced that Geminid meteoroids are fairly dense, about three times as dense as water and twice as dense as the Perseid meteoroids.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Meteor-maker </h3>



<p>The asteroid Phaethon, which produces the annual Geminid meteor shower, orbits the sun on a highly elliptical path that takes the small body from well inside the orbit of Mercury to beyond the orbit of Mars. </p>

</div>



<p>In 1983, astronomers finally found the Geminids’ parent. Jewitt, then a graduate student at Caltech, remembers walking home one January evening when he happened to see a rocket lift off from a military base. “I assumed it was an ICBM or something that the Air Force was launching to test,” he says. Instead, it was a heat-seeking spacecraft named the Infrared Astronomical Satellite.</p>



<p>In October of that year, the satellite discovered a small asteroid. To Harvard astronomer Fred Whipple, best known for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/comets-mudballs-solar-system">his “dirty snowball” model of comets</a> (<em>SN: 3/14/92, p. 170</em>), that small object stood out. It followed the same path around the sun as the particles in the Geminid meteoroid stream. Half a century earlier, Whipple himself had determined the orbit of the meteoroids by photographing the paths of the meteors against the sky. The newfound asteroid, Whipple declared, must be their long-sought source. The find also explained why the meteoroids were so dense: They come from a space rock rather than an icy comet.</p>



<p>The asteroid revolves around the sun every 1.43 years and comes very close to the sun, cutting well inside the orbit of Mercury, the innermost planet. Astronomers therefore christened the asteroid Phaethon, a son of Helios the sun god in Greek mythology. At its farthest, Phaethon ventures beyond the orbit of Mars and reaches the asteroid belt, home of the largest space rocks, between the paths of Mars and Jupiter.</p>



<p>For a quarter century after Phaethon’s discovery, though, no one saw it shedding any dust particles or pebbles that could account for the many meteors that make up December’s show. Because of the sun’s glare, astronomers couldn’t observe Phaethon when it was closest to the sun. Observing during a close pass might be especially interesting because calculations indicated that the intense sunlight caused Phaethon’s surface temperature to soar to roughly 1,000 kelvins (1,340° Fahrenheit), hotter than any planet in the solar system. The torrid temperature might cause the asteroid to shoot particles into space.</p>



<p>A lucky break came about because Jewitt married an astrophysicist who studies the sun. “Really, the key was talking to my wife about this,” he says. Jing Li, also at UCLA, and Jewitt realized that a solar spacecraft might be able to pick up details about the asteroid when it’s nearest the sun and thus offer clues to why the space rock is such a fertile meteor-maker.</p>



<p>Sure enough, in 2009 and again in 2012, images taken by a NASA solar spacecraft named STEREO A caught Phaethon brightening when near the sun, which suggested the asteroid was throwing off dust particles. Then, in 2013, Jewitt and Li noticed a short dust tail in that data. The tail lasted only two days. “It’s really, really faint in basically the world’s crappiest data,” Jewitt says. The bright background sky makes the tail hard to see.</p>



<p>The researchers attribute Phaethon’s dust production to the extreme heat, which breaks rocks on the asteroid’s surface and sends particles aloft. Phaethon has so little gravity that those particles can escape into space. Additional dust may result from desiccation, Jewitt says: In the presence of such heat, hydrated minerals on the asteroid may dry out and crack, the way empty lake beds do on Earth, releasing more particles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Geminid meteor seen from Mojave Desert" class="wp-image-3093815" height="700" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_geminids_feat_opt1_1440.jpg" width="1440" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093815">As seen from California’s Mojave Desert in 2009, a Geminid meteor streaks past Orion’s Belt. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093815">Walter Pacholka, Astropics/Science Source</span></figure>



<p>Phaethon’s fast spin causes further stress. The asteroid makes a full turn every three hours and 36 minutes. Such rapid rotation is typical of small asteroids, and it means the surface freezes and then fries over a short period of time. The spin also creates a centrifugal force that might help lift particles into space.</p>



<p>Yet these findings don’t solve the mystery of how a modest asteroid produces such a stunning meteor shower, Jewitt says. For one thing, as he and colleagues noted in 2013 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/771/2/L36">particles in Phaethon’s temporary tail are much too small</a>.</p>



<p>Most of the Geminid meteors we see come from particles roughly a millimeter across. But the particles in the tail are even tinier, spanning only about one one-thousandth of a millimeter. Jewitt and Li deduced the small size because sunlight exerts radiation pressure, which is weak, that pushes the tail straight back away from the sun; if the particles were larger, they would resist the weak pressure and the tail would be curved.</p>



<p>Plus, Phaethon’s close passages to the sun don’t eject nearly enough particles to populate the Geminid stream. This suggests that some catastrophe hit the asteroid in the recent past and made so many meteoroids that they continue to delight meteor observers today.</p>



<p>In 2014, astronomer Richard Arendt of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County reported the first direct sighting of the Geminid meteoroid stream itself. He had reanalyzed old data from a spacecraft whose chief mission had nothing to do with the solar system: the Cosmic Background Explorer, which NASA had launched a quarter century earlier to study the Big Bang’s afterglow and probe the universe’s birth.</p>



<p>“They didn’t really have the tools to look at the data in the right way back then,” Arendt says. With modern computers, he made movies of the data and glimpsed glowing strands of dust threading the solar system that emit infrared light as the sun heats them. He used this approach to view the never-before-seen dust trail along the orbit of Halley’s comet, as well as Phaethon’s dust trail: the Geminid meteoroid stream, which looked like a narrow filament along Phaethon’s orbit. Arendt published his work in the<em> Astronomical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>More recently, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-spotted-geminid-meteor-shower-source">also detected the stream</a> (<em>SN: 1/18/20, p. 6</em>). “This is the first time it’s been seen in visible light,” says Karl Battams, an astrophysicist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Sunlight hits the dust, reflecting the light to the probe. The observations put the stream’s mass at roughly 1 percent that of Phaethon itself. This is much more material than the asteroid produces when closest to the sun, which Battams says again favors the idea that the bulk of the Geminid meteoroid stream owes its existence to some past catastrophe.</p>



<h4>Phaethon visits Earth</h4>



<p>In December 2017, the asteroid helped astronomers by flying only 10 million kilometers from Earth, the closest the rock will come until 2093. “This was a great opportunity to look at Phaethon,” says Patrick Taylor, an astronomer then at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.</p>



<p>Hurricane Maria had devastated the island and damaged the radio telescope just three months earlier, yet the observations succeeded. “That was the result of a tremendous amount of effort by the observatory staff, the community and the local government,” Taylor says. The telescope was repaired, and commercial power was restored to the observatory by clearing roads and replacing downed poles and cables to the site. “Everyone was aware how important this observation was going to be,” he says.</p>



<p>Over a period of five days, his team bounced radar signals off the asteroid, watching different features come into view as the rock rotated. As published in 2019 in <em>Planetary and Space Science</em>, the observations indicate that Phaethon’s equatorial diameter is about 6.25 kilometers, which means the asteroid is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-gas-bursts-probably-didnt-kill-off-the-dinosaurs">a bit more than half the size of the one that hit Earth</a> and did in the dinosaurs (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 7</em>). The images show <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063318304136?via%3Dihub">what may be craters</a>, one more than a kilometer across, on Phaethon’s surface. There’s also a possible boulder 300 meters wide.</p>



<p>The radar images suggest Phaethon isn’t perfectly round. Instead, it may resemble a spinning top, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroids-bennu-ryugu-strange-diamond-shapes">Bennu and Ryugu</a>, two even smaller asteroids that spacecraft have recently visited. Both of those asteroids have equatorial diameters larger than their polar diameters. More than a thousand Bennus could fit inside Phaethon, but the two asteroids have similar shapes, Taylor notes. He thinks Phaethon may owe its shape to its rapid spin.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Speedy spinner</h3>



<p>Radar images from December 2017 show some details on Phaethon as it rotates. A Japanese mission named DESTINY+, scheduled to launch in 2024, should yield a much better view.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Radar images of Phaethon" class="wp-image-3093819" height="469" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_geminids_inline-2_1030.jpg" width="1030" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3093819">Arecibo/NSF, NASA</span></figure>
</div>



<p>Jewitt also tried to take advantage of Phaethon’s close visit. “It was a bit of a letdown,” he says, laughing. “We saw absolutely nothing at all.” Neither the Hubble Space Telescope nor the Very Large Telescope in Chile discerned any dust or rocks coming off the asteroid.</p>



<p>But the future should hold much better views. In 2024, Japan will launch the DESTINY+ spacecraft, which will fly past Phaethon several years later. Japan has already sent spacecraft to two other small asteroids, and the new mission promises sharp images that should reveal Phaethon’s shape, structure, geologic features and dust trail. The spacecraft may even see the asteroid emit particles in real time, as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-bennu-surprises-spits-plumes-dust-space">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission did for Bennu</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/19, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>The DESTINY+ spacecraft will search for signs of a recent catastrophe that could have excavated enough material to create the Geminid meteoroid stream. The most obvious possibility — an impact with another asteroid — is also the least likely, Jewitt says, because Phaethon is a small target and the impact would have had to occur less than 2,000 years ago. Nevertheless, if such an impact did happen, it surely carved a fresh scar, which a spacecraft might pick up.</p>



<p>Perhaps some other catastrophe made the meteoroids. Maybe the asteroid was once a larger object that broke apart, because sunlight stressed it or it spun too fast. In fact, one or two other asteroids, smaller than Phaethon, follow similar paths around the sun and could be remnants of a super-Phaethon. After DESTINY+ zips by Phaethon, it may visit one of these other asteroids to investigate.</p>



<p>There’s another question the spacecraft might address: The Geminids come from Phaethon, all right, but where did Phaethon come from? It wasn’t born where it is, because it crosses the paths of four planets. Within just a few tens of millions of years, it will either crash into one of them or else their gravity will hurl the rock into the sun or far away from it.</p>



<p>Some astronomers have proposed that Phaethon is really a chunk kicked off of the large asteroid Pallas, a resident of the asteroid belt. “Could Phaethon be a piece of Pallas? Yes,” Jewitt says. “Is it likely to be a piece of Pallas? I’m not really sure about that.” The two asteroids resemble each other in composition, but there are also differences. Those distinctions may merely mean that strong sunlight has altered Phaethon’s surface. Or they may indicate the two asteroids have nothing to do with each other.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, this month’s show should be especially good because moonlight won’t interfere. Any astronomers watching may make a wish on the falling stars for greater insight into how those meteors and their unlikely parent came to be.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>See the meteors</h3>



<p>In recent years, the peak numbers of December’s Geminid meteors often surpass those of the Perseids in August. The Perseids are better known because they occur during summer. But the cold-weather Geminids offer most observers a great show — minus the mosquitoes.</p>



<p>Celestial conditions in 2020 will be ideal. The moon will be new around the shower’s peak, ensuring dark skies for those away from city lights.</p>



<p>The shower should crest on the night of Sunday, December 13. The Geminids owe their name to Gemini, because every meteor radiates from that constellation. To see the show, though, you don’t need to know where Gemini is nor do you need a telescope.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="People watching the Geminids" class="wp-image-3093820" height="427" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_geminids_inline-3_1030-800x427.jpg" width="800" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093820">Skywatchers around the world marvel at the annual Geminids, as shown here in 2014 from Mount Balang in Sichuan, China. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093820">Jeff Dai</span></figure>



<p>Instead, bundle up, head outside and look up, because meteors can streak through any part of the sky. The best place to look is probably wherever your sky is darkest and unobstructed by trees and artificial light. Give your eyes at least 20 minutes to get used to the dark.</p>



<p>If you are in North America, the show should start by 10 p.m. local time but will likely reach its peak after midnight. At maximum, you may see more than 100 meteors an hour. Most are white or yellow; all are slow and graceful, because the meteoroids orbit the sun in the same direction as Earth does. They hit the air at only 35 kilometers per second — versus 71 km/s for the Leonids, which occur in November and whose meteoroids orbit the sun backward, opposite the direction of Earth’s motion. </p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Covid-19 has changed our working lives, perhaps for good. Home-working is now common, and many of us have been doing it for months. With changing rules and guidelines, some of us have even gone from home-working to socially distanced office-working, to working back at home again. So what do we know about how these changes are affecting our mental health — and what can we do to make our new working lives better?</p>



<span id="more-40935"></span>



<p><strong>How are we feeling?</strong></p>



<p>In January 2019 (pre-Covid-19), 35% of <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/work/trends/goodwork/covid-impact">UK employees surveyed for the CIPD</a> (a professional human resources body) reported that work had a positive impact on their mental health, while 27% said that work had a negative impact. By summer 2020, those figures had shifted to 34% and 26% respectively. On these measures, at least, Covid-19 had no obvious impact. </p>



<p>In this second survey, employees did report high levels of anxiety about contracting the virus at work — but despite this, half of those who were working remotely were looking forward to returning to their workplace. Almost half of all of the people surveyed also reported that social connections at work had worsened. Clearly, although the impact of work itself on our mental health hadn’t changed, altered work circumstances were — and are — causing difficulties, which are being further explored…</p>



<p><strong>How bad is home-working?</strong></p>



<p>“It can be argued that the crisis has led to the most significant, intensive social experiment of digital, home-based working that has ever occurred.”</p>



<p>This statement is from the website of the ongoing <a href="https://www.workingathome.org.uk/project-overview/">Working@home project</a>, led by Abigail Marks at Stirling University, which seeks to understand the impact of this “experiment”. As the team points out, some commentators have suggested that home-based work is emancipatory, and improves work flexibility. However, the team also notes, “this new world order, where the home becomes a multi-occupational, multi-person workplace… not only challenges boundaries but also conceptions of the domestic space.” So how is it making us feel?</p>



<p>Overall, not great, according to their initial survey of home workers. One in three reported sharing their home working space, 37% reported that home conflicts have increased, and almost one in four said that they were doing poorly or very poorly in terms of general health. The most commonly cited trigger for household conflict was “interrupting or being noisy while you work”.</p>



<p><strong>Keys to coping at home</strong></p>



<p>Yanmengqian Zhou at Penn State University and colleagues studied symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as coping strategies among American adults during the first few months of the pandemic. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/17/6315">Their study</a>, published in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>, revealed that levels of “social strain” — someone else making demands, giving criticism or just getting on your nerves — was the most consistent predictor of these symptoms of poor mental health. Anyone who’s working at home with their partner is certainly more likely to experience this kind of strain, especially if you have to share the same room. </p>



<p>But the team did also identify helpful strategies for working in the time of Covid-19. They recommend keeping a consistent schedule, reminding yourself that things will get better, finding activities to distract yourself and taking care of others who need help. None of these strategies will stop you irritating each other, but they might at least ease the strain a little.</p>



<p>Based on their own research, Kristen Shockley and Malissa Clark at the University of Georgia also <a href="https://www.siop.org/Research-Publications/Items-of-Interest/ArtMID/19366/ArticleID/3454/Work-Family-Balance-Struggles-in-the-Time-of-COVID-19">recommend some kind of work-life/home-life boundary activity </a>to replace the lost commute. Just a walk near your home at the start and end of the work day can make it easier to switch between roles, they say.</p>



<p><strong>Overcoming “presence privilege”</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266131/">a recent issue of Occupational Health Science</a>, ten experts were invited to comment on work-related issues associated with Covid-19. Larissa K. Barber at San Diego State University argues that as remote working is now common, it’s time to get rid of the “physical presence privilege”.</p>



<p>Traditionally, Barber writes, “in-person meetings are preferred over web-conferencing, driving in over logging in”. Being physically present in the workplace is also conflated with work attention and productivity, she adds. Now that remote working is common, Barber thinks it’s high time that organisations shift their thinking and also devote energy and resources to making this style of working better for employees.</p>



<p>One way to do this is to respect technological boundaries in the same way that we traditionally respect physical boundaries. “Barging into a coworker’s office, family dinner or even bedroom for an immediate work response is antisocial. Yet we tolerate and encourage similar behaviours in electronic communications,” Barber notes (something that anyone who’s ever had a demanding email from their boss outside work hours will appreciate). Clearly, this is not a new problem — but perhaps with a mass shift to remote working, organisations will now feel obliged to set clear technological ground rules, for the benefit of us all.</p>



<p><strong>Regaining control</strong></p>



<p>The pandemic, and the lockdowns associated with it, have profoundly challenged our autonomy — our sense of being in control of our actions and also seeing an alignment between our behaviour and our personal values and goals (an aspect of autonomy often called “authenticity”). Autonomy is widely considered to be important for wellbeing. Unsurprisingly, then, there have been a number of studies exploring how Covid-19 has affected it, and how we’ve felt as a result.</p>



<p>One recent paper, published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, found that while there were spikes in feelings of powerlessness and inauthenticity in the early days of the pandemic, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/10/the-process-of-psychological-recovery-begins-while-a-stressful-event-is-still-going-on-according-to-study-of-early-stages-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">these increases actually started to subside quite rapidly</a>. The team concludes that because a sense of autonomy is so important to us, the participants were making changes in their lives to restore it, even in the face of ongoing stress and restrictions. All kinds of strategies, such as deciding to spend what used to be work commute time on a hobby or exercise, or even just revelling in the sudden ability to wear whatever they wanted for work (below the belt, at least, during Zoom meetings) could have helped.</p>



<p>Other researchers, including Adam Butler at the University of Iowa, in that recent special issue of Occupational Health Science, point to studies finding that higher perceptions of control are associated with reduced stress among nurses. All of this suggests that whatever employers can do to enhance employee autonomy at “work”  — and home working brings its own challenges, of course — should be good for their mental health.</p>

<p>Health care workers and long-term care facility residents should be at the head of the line when the first doses of vaccines against COVID-19 are available in the United States, an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on December 1.</p>



<p>The news comes as two vaccine candidates, from<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results"> Pfizer</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/20</em>) and<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moderna-vaccine-covid19-coronavirus-early-results"> Moderna</a> (<em>SN: 11/16/20</em>), are set to be considered for emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 10 and 17, respectively. If one or both vaccines get the go-ahead from FDA and the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, people with first priority could begin to be vaccinated before the end of the year. </p>



<p>“This is a particularly difficult time in the United States,” said ACIP member Beth Bell of the University of Washington in Seattle, who noted during the meeting that the country is averaging one COVID-19 death per minute. “So we are acting none too soon.”</p>

<p>As of December 1, more than 13.6 million people in the United States have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and nearly 270,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University’s <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">COVID-19 tracker</a>.</p>



<p>This is the first guidance that ACIP has issued on the allocation of the initial, limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines. There will still need to be guidance for people next in line, such as other essential workers, older adults and people with preexisting conditions. It will be up to state health departments to implement the guidance.</p>



<p>ACIP has been meeting throughout the year to prepare for the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, with the understanding that there wouldn’t be enough of the shots for everyone right away. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each require two doses taken several weeks apart. There will be about 40 million doses available by the end of the year, meaning around 20 million people could be vaccinated. </p>



<p>The United States has an estimated 21 million health care workers and around 3 million adults living in long-term care facilities. The initial supply is short of what’s needed for the first group, so the committee is expected to offer more guidance for this tier. </p>



<p>In addition, there are 87 million other essential workers, including educators and police, 53 million people ages 65 and older and more than 100 million people with high-risk medical conditions, according to ACIP. </p>



<p>Everybody will ultimately benefit from the vaccine, but at the beginning, when the shots are scarce, it’s a question of “who will benefit the most,” says bioethicist Nancy Kass of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics and Bloomberg School of Public Health. And who benefits most can be further divided between those at greatest risk of becoming infected, such as health care workers and grocery and meat-packing employees, and those at highest risk of becoming seriously ill if they become infected, including older adults and people with preexisting conditions.</p>

</aside>



<p>Another consideration is fairness. That means being transparent about what the criteria are “so that when people see others going in line ahead of them, they know why,” says Kass, who was not involved in the deliberations. Making sure the vaccine reaches everyone in a prioritized group is also crucial to ensuring equity. “If COVID vaccine allocations are done appropriately, there will be people from so many different demographic backgrounds who ought to be in tier one that it will be equal opportunity with regard to income and race,” she says.</p>



<p>ACIP laid out the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e3.htm?s_cid=mm6947e3_w"> ethical principles</a> influencing their deliberations on how to allocate initial supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine on November 27 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>: Maximize benefits and minimize harms, promote justice, mitigate health inequities and promote transparency.</p>



<p>Health care providers have been considered a top priority throughout ACIP’s discussions and in guidance provided by other groups, including the <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25917/framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-covid-19-vaccine">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine</a>. There have been at least 243,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers and 858 deaths as of November 30, according to the CDC. </p>



<p>The committee pointed out that women constitute 75 percent of the health care workforce, and of those, 330,000 could be pregnant or recently postpartum when the vaccine becomes available. ACIP will review the Phase III data from the vaccine trials as well as the FDA’s assessment of the vaccines and the conditions of any emergency use authorization before providing guidance for these women.</p>



<p>Long-term care facilities, which provide care to frail and older adults who can’t live independently, have been hit especially hard during the pandemic. Approximately 730,000 <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/longtermcare">residents and staff of long-term care facilities have had COVID-19</a> and more than 100,000 have died as of November 26, according to the COVID Tracking Project.</p>

<p>“We’ve been talking since the Apollo era about going back and collecting more samples from a different region,” says planetary scientist Jessica Barnes of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who works with lunar samples from the American and Soviet Union missions of the 1960s and 1970s. “It’s finally happening.”</p>



<p>Chang’e-5, the latest in a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-about-visit-uncharted-territory-moon">series of missions named for the Chinese moon goddess</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/18</em>), took off from the China National Space Administration’s launch site in the South China Sea on November 23 and landed in volcanic flatlands on the northwest region of the moon’s nearside.</p>





<p>The lander, equipped with a scoop and a drill, will collect about two kilograms of soil and small rocks, possibly from as deep as two meters below the moon’s surface, says planetary scientist Long Xiao of China University of Geosciences in Wuhan.</p>



<p>The spacecraft has to work fast. With no internal heating mechanism, it has no defenses against the extremely cold lunar night, which can reach –170° Celsius. The entire mission has to fit within one lunar day, about 14 Earth days.</p>



<p>After the lander collects the sample, a small rocket will bring the lander and the sample back to the orbiter perhaps as early as December 3, although the Chinese space agency has not released the official schedule.</p>



<p>Once in orbit, the moon material will be packaged into a return capsule and sent back to Earth. The capsule is expected to land in the Inner Mongolia region by December 17.</p>



<p>The last time new lunar samples were sent back to Earth was 1976, with the end of the Soviet Union’s Luna program. Between those missions and NASA’s Apollo missions, scientists on Earth have about 380 kilograms of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">moon material to study</a> (<em>SN: 7/15/19</em>). “Perhaps for a long time people thought, been there, done that, when it comes to the moon,” Barnes says.</p>



<p>Two kilograms of new stuff might not sound like much next to what’s already in hand. But Chang’e-5 is returning samples from an entirely unexplored region. The landing site is in the Mons Rümker region in the northwest region of the nearside of the moon. Like the Apollo and Luna landing sites, Rümker is flat. “The engineering consideration is first, to be safe,” Xiao says.</p>

<p>Chang’e-5’s lander touched down in the Mons Rümker region in the northwest of the nearside of the moon, a spot (outlined in red) that no previous sample return mission has visited. The rocks there are thought to be billions of years younger than the samples from the Apollo (blue) and Luna (yellow) missions of the 1960s and ‘70s.</p>

<p>All the Apollo and Luna missions visited ancient volcanic plains, where the rocks are between 3 billion and 4 billion years old. Rümker’s volcanic rocks are much younger, around 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion years old. In the ‘60s, scientists didn’t think the moon was still volcanically active that late. More recent studies from lunar orbit and from telescopes have suggested a more complicated volcanic past.</p>



<p>“With these new samples, we potentially add another pinpoint in our geologic history of the moon,” says Barnes. “We’ll get an idea of, what was the volcanic history like on the moon a billion years ago? That’s something we don’t have access to in the returned samples we already have.”</p>



<p>The Rümker region is also rich in potassium, rare-Earth elements and phosphorous, often called KREEP elements. Those elements were some of the last to crystalize out of the magma ocean that covered the young moon and can help reveal details of how that process happened. It’s an “exotic flavor” of material, says Barnes. “It’s a really different area, geochemically, to the rest of the moon.”</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges for the mission will be drilling that material. The drill can’t change direction once it’s deployed, so it has to attempt to drill through anything directly below it. If the drill hits a large rock, it could fail. So the Chang’e-5 team is hoping for fine, loose soil, Long says.</p>



<p>Once the sample is back on Earth, it will be stored and cataloged at a curation center in Beijing. Then it will be distributed for scientists to do research.</p>



<p>“You can’t breathe easy on these types of missions until the samples are back and are safe in the curation place where they’re going to be held,” Barnes says.</p>



<p>The Chinese space agency plans to share samples with international scientists. A 2011 congressional rule makes it difficult for U.S. scientists to collaborate directly with China, so it’s unclear who will get to work with the rocks. But the discoveries that the new samples will enable go beyond international borders.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t matter who’s doing it,” says Barnes. “The whole world should be behind this mission and this endeavor. It’s a piece of history.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you’re preparing to receive a flu vaccine — or even a COVID-19 vaccine — this winter, you’ll be interested in the results of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-88213-001">new study</a> that investigates whether it’s better to smile or grimace your way through the pain of an injection.</p>



<p>The idea that manipulating our facial expressions can affect our emotions has a long and storied history. There are many advocates of this “facial feedback hypothesis”, and many critics, too. Indeed, one of the classic findings in the field — that<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-25514-001"> people find cartoons funnier if they hold a pen between their teeth</a>, inducing a smile — recently <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616674458">failed to replicate</a>. This mixed research background was well known to Sarah D. Pressman and Amanda M. Acevedo at the University of California, Irvine, who led the new work, published in <em>Emotion</em>.</p>



<span id="more-40930"></span>



<p>The team randomised 231 student participants to hold either a neutral expression, a regular smile (which involves the cheek muscles), a Duchenne smile (which also recruits muscles by the eyes, resulting in creasing around the eyes) or a grimace (which recruits both these sets of muscles, plus those which allow us to wrinkle our brows).</p>



<p>To induce these expressions, the participants (who thought they were taking part in an investigation of multi-tasking) were given chopsticks to hold in one of four positions between their teeth, and asked to imitate an example photo. Each participant then held their assigned facial position while they received an injection of saline solution into the upper arm, designed to mimic a flu jab. Their heart rates and skin conductance were measured throughout, as objective markers of their stress levels, and they also reported on levels of pain (anticipated and then actual) and other emotions, such as being jittery or relaxed.</p>



<p>The researchers found some interesting differences between the groups. The Duchenne smiling and grimacing groups gave lower pain ratings than the neutral group while waiting for the injection, during the injection, and immediately after it. The regular smiling group fell somewhere in between. Notably, the Duchenne group reported 40% less pain during the needle insertion than the neutral controls, and the grimace group reported 39% less pain. These were clinically meaningful results, the team stresses, equivalent to pain being “very much improved”. In addition, the Duchenne group had the lowest heart rates during the study, while the grimacing group reported feeling the lowest levels of stress.</p>



<p>Smiling and grimacing recruit some of the same key facial muscles, and both are seen in people undergoing negative experiences, including pain. The facial feedback hypothesis would hold that both these facial configurations act to regulate feelings of pain and stress. In the case of Duchenne smiling, it might be that we associate this expression with feeling positive emotions, and this reduces perceived pain. With grimacing, it’s possible, the team suggests, that intense activation of muscles around the eye and forehead has a more direct effect on pain and/or levels of physiological arousal, and stress, perhaps via stimulation of the trigeminal nerve in the face. But the nature of this mechanism, if it exists, is certainly not clear.</p>



<p>In relation to their grimacing findings, the team writes: “To our knowledge, this is the first experimental test showing that this natural response to pain is helpful in improving the subjective pain experience.” However, they also add: “Whether we grimace during pain because it is similar to smiling or whether we smile during stress because it is like a grimace warrants further investigation and replication.”</p>



<p>This is a controversial field of research. And there’s plenty more that needs to be done to understand the effects reported in this study. However, the pain-reducing effects of either Duchenne smiling or grimacing are dramatic, and as the team also notes: “With 10% of the [global] population estimated to be needle-phobic and 16 billion injections occurring every year, the benefits of this simple method could be far-reaching.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-spotted-colliding-neutron-stars-magnetar">Astronomers spotted colliding neutron stars that may have formed a magnetar</a></h4>

<p>A surprisingly bright cosmic blast might have marked the birth of a magnetar. If so, it would be the first time that astronomers have witnessed the formation of this kind of rapidly spinning, extremely magnetized stellar corpse.</p>



<p>That <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200808593F/abstract">dazzling flash of light</a> was made when two neutron stars collided and merged into one massive object, astronomers report in an upcoming issue of the<em> Astrophysical Journal</em>. Though the especially bright light could mean that a magnetar was produced, other explanations are possible, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Wen-fai Fong of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and colleagues first spotted the site of the neutron star crash as a burst of gamma-ray light detected with NASA’s orbiting Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory on May 22. Follow-up observations in X-ray, visible and infrared wavelengths of light showed that the gamma rays were accompanied by a characteristic glow called a kilonova.</p>



<p>Kilonovas are thought to form after two neutron stars, the ultradense cores of dead stars, collide and merge. The merger sprays neutron-rich material “not seen anywhere else in the universe” around the collision site, Fong says. That material <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strontium-heavy-element-neutron-star-merger">quickly produces unstable heavy elements</a>, and those elements soon decay, heating the neutron cloud and making it glow in optical and infrared light (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>A new study finds that two neutron stars collided and merged, producing an especially bright flash of light and possibly creating a kind of rapidly spinning, extremely magnetized stellar corpse called a magnetar (shown in this animation). </figure>



<p>Astronomers think that kilonovas form every time a pair of neutron stars merge. But mergers produce other, brighter light as well, which can swamp the kilonova signal. As a result, astronomers have seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-gravitational-waves">only one definitive kilonova before</a>, in August 2017, though there are other potential candidates (<em>SN: 10/16/17</em>).</p>





<p>The glow that Fong’s team saw, however, put the 2017 kilonova to shame. “It’s potentially the most luminous kilonova that we’ve ever seen,” she says. “It basically breaks our understanding of the luminosities and brightnesses that kilonovae are supposed to have.”</p>



<p>The biggest difference in brightness was in infrared light, measured by the Hubble Space Telescope about 3 and 16 days after the gamma-ray burst. That light was 10 times as bright as infrared light seen in previous neutron star mergers.</p>



<p>“That was the real eye-opening moment, and that’s when we scrambled to find an explanation,” Fong says. “We had to come up with an extra source [of energy] that was boosting that kilonova.”</p>



<p>Her favorite explanation is that the crash produced a magnetar, which is a type of neutron star. Normally, when neutron stars merge, the mega-neutron star that they produce is too heavy to survive. Almost immediately, the star succumbs to intense gravitational forces and produces a black hole.</p>



<p>But if the supermassive neutron star is spinning rapidly and is highly magnetically charged (in other words, is a magnetar), it could save itself from collapsing. Both the support of its own rotation and dumping energy, and thus some mass, into the surrounding neutron-rich cloud could keep the star from turning into a black hole, the researchers suggest. That extra energy in turn would make the cloud give off more light — the extra infrared glow that Hubble spotted.</p>





<p>But there are other possible explanations for the extra bright light, Fong says. If the colliding neutron stars produced a black hole, that black hole could have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-neutron-stars-light-speed-space">launched a jet of charged plasma</a> moving at nearly the speed of light (<em>SN: 2/22/19</em>). The details of how the jet interacts with the neutron-rich material surrounding the collision site could also explain the extra kilonova glow, she says.</p>



<p>If a magnetar was produced, “that could tell us something about the stability of neutron stars and how massive they can get,” Fong says. “We don’t know the maximum mass of neutron stars, but we do know that in most cases they would collapse into a black hole [after a merger]. If a neutron star did survive, it tells us about under what conditions a neutron star can exist.”</p>



<p>Finding a baby magnetar would be exciting, says astrophysicist Om Sharan Salafia of Italy’s National Institute for Astrophysics in Merate, who was not involved in the new research. “A newborn highly magnetized, highly rotating neutron star that forms from the merger of two neutron stars has never been observed before,” he says.</p>



<p>But he agrees that it’s too soon to rule out other explanations. What’s more, recent computer simulations suggest that it might be difficult to see a newborn magnetar even if it formed, he says. “I wouldn’t say this is settled.”</p>



<p>Observing how the object’s light behaves over the next four months to six years, Fong and her colleagues have calculated, will prove whether or not a magnetar was born.</p>



<p>Fong herself plans to keep following up on the mysterious object with existing and future observatories for a long time. “I’ll be tracking this till I’m old and grey, probably,” she says. “I’ll train my students to do it, and their students.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-prevention-women-prep-truvada-pill-shot">Long-lasting shots work better than daily pills to prevent HIV in at-risk women</a></h4>

<p>Worldwide, nearly half of new HIV infections among adults in 2019 occurred in women. Yet a long list of obstacles has kept many women from taking advantage of medicine that can prevent an HIV infection.</p>



<p>Recent, promising news about a different HIV prevention regimen could help. A long-acting injection of an HIV drug given once every eight weeks was safe and more effective in preventing infection in women than a daily pill of two HIV drugs, a large clinical trial found.</p>



<p>“This is incredibly exciting,” says infectious disease physician Bisola Ojikutu of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the trial. If the injection is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, she says, women will have the option of a discretely administered HIV prevention drug that doesn’t require daily attention.</p>



<p>Although women make up a minority of those newly diagnosed with HIV in the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6946a1.htm?s_cid=mm6946a1_w">their HIV-related death rate</a>, 5.4 per 1,000 people with diagnoses, was higher than that of males (4.5 per 1,000) or transgender women (4.3 per 1,000) in 2017, researchers report November 20 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>





<p>Women face many barriers when it comes to protecting themselves against an HIV infection. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-aids-undetectable-virus-means-untransmittable-disease">woman’s HIV risk</a> is tied not only to measures within her control, but also to the amount of HIV transmission in her community, whether she has reliable health care and whether she lives in poverty or experiences intimate partner violence (<em>SN: 11/15/19</em>). But studies have found that women at high risk due to societal factors tend to underestimate their individual risk.</p>



<p>Most cisgender women acquire HIV during heterosexual contact; women have twice the risk that men do of contracting HIV during vaginal sex with an infected partner. Condoms are a helpful HIV prevention tool but their use is not fully under a woman’s control. Medicine to prevent an infection in an HIV-negative person at risk, called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, was approved in the United States in 2012. Taken consistently, the daily pill form of PrEP can lower the risk of getting HIV during vaginal sex by up to 90 percent, and as much as 99 during anal sex.</p>



<p>Even if a woman knows she’s at heightened risk for HIV, she may not know about PrEP. Awareness and use of the PrEP pill, called Truvada, in the United States remains low among women; they were only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6286244/">6 percent of the more than 100,000 U.S. users</a> in 2017, according to a 2018 <em>Annals of Epidemiology</em> study of a national prescription database. And for women taking the PrEP pill, sticking to the daily routine can be challenging, due to side effects from the medication or because of stigma, studies have found.</p>



<p>“Most of my female patients living with HIV have told nobody,” says Ojikutu. That stigma can extend to the PrEP pill. Taking a daily medicine to prevent HIV can appear to others as if the person is getting treatment for HIV.</p>



<p>Fears that family and friends would assume they were HIV-positive or that a partner would accuse them of infidelity were among those <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708581/">raised about PrEP by women</a> in the Washington D.C. area, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of AIDS Clinical Research</em> in 2017. Adolescent girls and young women in Zimbabwe and South Africa were also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jia2.25463">worried about being thought HIV-positive</a> or being called promiscuous if they took PrEP, according to a March 2020 study in the <em>Journal of the International AIDS Society</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="A nurse prepares prepares to test a woman for HIV" class="wp-image-3093949" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/112320_ac_hiv-prep_inline1-677x450.jpg" width="677" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093949">A woman in Mozambique gets tested for HIV in 2014.

<p>Having a more discreet way to take PrEP — such as an infrequent injection — could be appealing for many women. “It’s private,” says infectious disease physician Mina Hosseinipour of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. “This just allows [women] a lot of autonomy.”</p>



<p>In the Phase III trial, which began in 2017, Hosseinipour and her colleagues enrolled more than 3,000 HIV-negative, sexually active cisgender women ages 18 to 45 in east and southern Africa. In this region, women accounted for 61 percent of new HIV infections among those 15 and older in 2019, with young women making up 73 percent of new infections among 15- to 24-year-olds, according to UNAIDS. These women are not always able “to advocate for themselves and their prevention needs,” because of their societal position and vulnerability, says Hosseinipour, who has lived and worked in Malawi, in southeastern Africa, since 2001.</p>



<p>The trial participants were randomly assigned to receive an injection of the HIV drug cabotegravir once every eight weeks and a daily placebo pill or a placebo injection on the same schedule and a daily PrEP pill.</p>



<p>Of the 38 women who became infected with HIV, four were getting the cabotegravir injection and 34 were taking the PrEP pills, the National Institutes of Health announced on November 9. That’s an <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-finds-long-acting-injectable-drug-prevents-hiv-acquisition-cisgender-women">HIV incidence rate of 0.21 percent in the injection group</a> and 1.79 percent in the pill group. These interim results were so good — the injection reduced infections by 89 percent compared with the pill — that the safety board monitoring the trial recommended participants be told which medicine they are getting, so that women have the option to switch to the injection. The investigators will continue to follow trial participants to assess long-term safety.</p>



<p>The promising results follow those reported for a trial of cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men; the <a href="https://www.hptn.org/news-and-events/press-releases/hptn-083-study-demonstrates-superiority-cabotegravir-prevention-hiv">injections reduced infections</a> by 66 percent compared with daily PrEP pills in that trial, researchers reported in July 2020 at the International AIDS Conference.</p>



<p>Having a new PrEP option doesn’t change the fact that more outreach on HIV prevention directed at women needs to happen, through public health campaigns and community engagement, says Ojikutu.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/runaway-stars-mysterious-ultraviolet-glow-around-galaxies">Runaway stars may create the mysterious ultraviolet glow around some galaxies</a></h4>

<p>Hot blue stars kicked out of their cradles may explain a mysterious ultraviolet glow that surrounds the disks of many spiral galaxies.</p>



<p>A new computer simulation demonstrates that these runaway stars can populate the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-found-edge-milky-way-size">vast expanses beyond a galaxy’s visible disk</a> (<em>SN: 3/23/20</em>). These distant regions have gas that is too warm and tenuous to make new stars, yet young stars nevertheless exist there.</p>



<p>“It’s a big problem for classical star formation theory,” says Eric Andersson, an astrophysicist at Lund Observatory in Sweden.</p>



<p>The mystery of the far-flung young stars has persisted for some time. In 2003, NASA launched the Galaxy Evolution Explorer space telescope, which surprised astronomers by discovering <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/images-edge">diffuse far-ultraviolet light in the hinterlands</a> of nearby spiral and irregular galaxies (<em>SN: 2/15/05</em>). Unlike ordinary ultraviolet radiation, far-ultraviolet light has such a short wavelength that most of it doesn’t penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>





<p>Stars that emit profuse amounts of this energetic radiation are hot, blue and usually much more massive than the sun. These stars don’t live long, so they must have formed recently. But the gas on the galactic outskirts isn’t cold and dense enough to collapse and create new stars.</p>



<p>Andersson and his colleagues propose a solution to the paradox: Many of these far-out far-ultraviolet-emitting stars weren’t born where they are now. Instead, they arose closer to the galaxy’s center and ran away from their homes.</p>



<p>The researchers conducted a computer simulation to model the motion of massive stars in a spiral galaxy. Some of the runaway stars in the simulation <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11965">dart across thousands of light-years of space</a> to take up residence beyond the visible edge of the galaxy’s disk, thereby explaining the far-ultraviolet light there, the researchers report online at arXiv.org on October 22.</p>



<p>The Milky Way has many of these runaway stars. A star can become a runaway when other massive stars fling it away through their gravity. Or, if the star orbits close to a massive star that explodes, the surviving star races away at the same speed it had been dashing around its companion. Most runaway stars are hot and blue, radiating just the type of far-ultraviolet light seen beyond the visible edges of galactic disks.</p>



<p>Mark Krumholz, an astronomer at the Australian National University in Canberra, calls the idea “a plausible explanation.” He also offers a way to test it: by exploiting the properties of different types of massive stars.</p>



<p>The rarest and most massive blue stars are so hot they ionize hydrogen gas, causing it to emit red light as electrons settle back into position around protons. But these very massive stars don’t live long, so any that reside on a galaxy’s outskirts must have been born there. After all, the stars didn’t have time to travel from elsewhere in the galaxy during their brief lives.</p>



<p>In contrast, less massive blue stars live longer and therefore could have reached the galactic periphery from elsewhere during their lifetimes. If the ratio of far-ultraviolet light to red light from ionized gas is much greater beyond the galaxy’s visible edge than in its disk, Krumholz says, that would suggest much of the far-ultraviolet glow in the exurbs does indeed come from runaway stars.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-ticks-bite-human-blood-disease-climate-change">Dog ticks may get more of a taste for human blood as the climate changes</a></h4>

<p>Climate change could turn some dog ticks into suckers for humans instead of canines.</p>



<p>At temperatures around 38° Celsius (100° Fahrenheit), some brown dog ticks were more attracted to people than to dogs, experiments show. The ticks can carry the pathogen that causes deadly Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The finding suggests that <a href="https://astmhpressroom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/fir-tropmed20-brown-dog-tick-and-temperature-release.pdf">a warmer climate could lead to greater spread of the disease</a> from ticks to humans, researchers reported November 16 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.</p>



<p>“We can expect more frequent and larger disease outbreaks of Rocky Mountain spotted fever when hot weather occurs, and when we get hot weather more often,” says Laura Backus, a researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever can die if they don’t receive antibiotic treatment within five days. Around 5 to 10 percent of people infected succumb to the disease.</p>



<p>Previous research in Europe had suggested that ticks are more aggressive toward people in hot weather. To find out whether brown dog ticks’ preference of host depends on temperature, Backus and her colleagues captured babies and adults of two genetically distinct groups, or lineages, of the species <em>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</em>. One lineage hailed from a hot region in Arizona, and was considered a tropical tick. The other lineage, from Oklahoma, tolerates colder weather and is considered temperate.</p>





<p>The scientists compared the ticks’ behavior at a room temperature of 23° C (74° F) and at a sweltering 38° C. In 10 separate trials at each temperature, the scientists placed around 20 ticks from both lineages and age groups into the center of a plastic tube and gave them the option of moving toward a either a human or a dog.</p>



<p>Normally, the tick prefers dogs to humans. But at the higher temperature, the adult tropical ticks showed a preference for the human. More than twice as many of the ticks moved toward the human at the hotter temperature compared with at room temperature. The temperature shift did not have a significant effect on the temperate ticks or the nymphs of either lineage.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="scientist with dog in lab experiment" class="wp-image-3093839" height="649" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/111820_ap_tick_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093839">To test whether temperature affects whether brown dog ticks are more attracted to humans than dogs, researchers set up an experiment in which they placed a dog in one large wooden box (shown) and a person in another. They then connected the boxes with a clear plastic tube and watched to see whether ticks placed in the tube crawled toward the person or the dog.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093839">Don Preisler/UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine</span></figure></div>



<p>It is unclear why the adult tropical ticks switched their preference at high temperature. It may have something to do with the way they sense their hosts. “It is possible that their chemical receptors on their bodies are activated differently at high temperatures, but it’s still unclear,” Backus adds. </p>



<p>In the last two decades, the United States has seen a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cases-lyme-and-other-tickborne-diseases-rising">steady rise in tick-borne diseases</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/18</em>). In 2000, there were 495 cases of spotted fever rickettsiosis, a category that includes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Now, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/media/rmsf.html">4,000 to 6,000 tickborne spotted fevers</a> are reported in the United States each year.</p>



<p>Different kinds of ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. But the brown dog tick is responsible for the spread in the southwestern United States.</p>



<p>“The finding is very exciting, as it demonstrates the behavioral difference between the two lineages,” says Kathleen Walker, an entomologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not associated with the study. More tropical ticks, she adds, are moving to the north as temperatures rise due to global warming.</p>



<p>Backus says that her team would like to study brown dog ticks from more regions in the future, a step toward having a bigger dataset to look for patterns. “And if they prefer humans at high temperatures, as this study finds, then that helps in understanding why we are seeing more Rocky Mountain spotted fever outbreaks,” she says.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/october-10-2020"><img alt="October 10, 2020 cover" class="wp-image-3092261" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/101020_sn10_cover_hi-144x186.jpg" width="144" /></a></figure></div>



<h4>Venusian recollection</h4>



<p><em>Phosphine gas detected in the clouds of Venus could be a sign of life or some strange unknown chemistry, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">Possible sign of life is found on Venus</a>” (</em>SN: 10/10/20 &amp; 10/24/20, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>The story brought back memories for reader <strong>Bruce Hapke</strong>, a professor of planetary science at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>



<p>“In 1975, my colleague Robert M. Nelson and I published the first high-quality, broadband spectrum of the clouds of Venus … which we obtained using the 106-inch telescope at McDonald Observatory in Texas,” <strong>Hapke </strong>wrote. “This spectrum turned out to be identical to that of a form of elemental sulfur, and we suggested that tiny particles of sulfur in the clouds are responsible for their yellowish color. The sulfur comes from volcanic eruptions.”</p>





<p>By then, “Russia had launched several unmanned spacecraft that had successfully landed on the surface of Venus. In the paper, we pointed out that these spacecraft had not been sterilized and probably were badly contaminated with microscopic, single-cell forms of life, which the landers would then shed as they parachuted down through the clouds,” <strong>Hapke </strong>wrote. “We also pointed out that many types of microbes are extremely hardy and can readily survive the vacuum of space by going dormant until they are in a hospitable environment. Many can live in sulfuric acid. On Earth they are found in acid drainage from coal mines. Many are anaerobic and do not require oxygen. Instead they generate energy for their metabolism by chemically changing … sulfur that they ingest. E­ssentially, they survive by eating sulfur,” he wrote. “If life does exist in the Venus clouds, it is highly likely to consist of immigrants from Earth.”</p>



<p>Other research groups have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-phosphine-possible-sign-life-doubts-how-science-works">questioning the phosphine detection</a> (<em>SN: 11/21/20, p. 16</em>). “Based on reanalyses of the data, one of those groups suggests the phosphine signal actually was sulfur dioxide. That would mean there’s no reason to get excited about possible life signs — at least not yet,” <strong>Grossman</strong> says. The theory that microbes can travel from planet to planet, either by hitching a ride on spacecraft or by some other means, is gaining traction among some scientists. Recent evidence suggests <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bacteria-band-together-survival-years-astrobiology">some Earth microbes are hardy enough to make such journeys</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/20, p. 10</em>).</p>





<h4>Cosmic connections</h4>



<p><em>Magnetized corpses of stars could be a source of fast radio bursts and high-energy neutrinos,<strong> Lisa Grossman </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-magnetars-how-fast-radio-bursts-launch">Magnetars could solve dual mystery</a>” (</em>SN: 10/10/20 &amp; 10/24/20, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>James Ash </strong>wondered how neutrinos interact with another mysterious phenomenon: high-energy cosmic rays.</p>



<p>Neutrinos are nearly massless s­ubatomic particles with no electric charge. That means they rarely interact with normal matter, including cosmic rays — a type of charged particle with mass, <strong>Grossman</strong> says. But the two are connected, produced in tandem by energetic celestial objects. Similar to how magnetars might produce both fast radio bursts and high-energy neutrinos, evidence suggests <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">bright galaxies called blazars eject both high-energy cosmic rays and high-energy neutrinos</a> (<em>SN: 8/4/18, p. 6</em>).</p>



<h4>Editor’s note</h4>



<p>On October 29, <em>Scientific Reports</em> retracted the study described in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parazen-deep-sea-fish-mouthbrooding">M­outhbrooder lives in the deep</a>” (<em>SN: 4/11/20, p. 12</em>) at the researchers’ request. Eggs found in the mouth of a deep-sea fish species, <em>Parazen pacificus</em>, belonged to a species of crab — not the fish, a reanalysis of the eggs confirmed. Though <em>P. pacificus</em> appears to possess traits that suggest it could house fertilized eggs and perhaps hatchlings in the mouth, “the original data is not sufficient to confirm that this species is a mouthbrooder,” ichthyologist Randy Singer of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and colleagues wrote in the retraction.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amid-winters-darkness-flashes-brilliance">Amid winter’s darkness, flashes of brilliance</a></h4>

<p>The sudden flash of a shooting star is a delight, and its luster isn’t dimmed by the knowledge that meteor showers are merely the visible manifestation of space dust.</p>



<p>If there’s a clear sky on Sunday, December 13, odds are good for spotting the spectacular meteor shower known as the Geminids. In this issue, astronomer and writer Ken Croswell explains the many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/geminid-meteor-shower-december-asteroid-phaethon">mysteries surrounding the Geminids’ flamboyant display</a>, including that they have the rare distinction of being a meteor shower spawned by a lowly asteroid, rather than a stylish comet.</p>



<p>Scientists have known for over 100 years that comets can spark meteor showers, but it wasn’t until 1983 that researchers had the technology needed to connect the Geminids to a small asteroid, dubbed Phaethon because it swings so close to the sun. Decades later, scientists are still trying to figure out just how Phaethon provides such a dazzling show.</p>



<p>While you’re in the backyard looking for meteors, it’s the ideal time to also scan the skies for Betelgeuse, the massive red star in the constellation Orion. (You can catch a glimpse of it on the right side of our cover image.) Wintertime means Orion has returned to the evening sky in the Northern Hemisphere, and it comforts me to see Betelgeuse glowing on Orion’s shoulder. But last year, that star was at the center of an international commotion. Betelgeuse suddenly dimmed — did this mean the aging star was about to explode in a supernova? Stargazers, professionals and amateurs alike, rushed to the telescopes.</p>





<p>Betelgeuse is still with us, having returned to its former brightness earlier this year. But astronomers remain at odds over the cause of its sudden swoon. Some think that the star was obscured by its own dust, while others dis the dust hypothesis. As <em>Science News</em> astronomy writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/lisa-grossman">Lisa Grossman</a> reports, shutdowns of major telescopes as a safety measure during the pandemic have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened">stymied efforts to solve the mystery of the dimming star</a>. That’s frustrating for researchers, in part because the answer could help shed light on the origins of life in the universe.</p>



<p>Ready for one more celestial riddle? Flip to Page 10, where we update you on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steve-light-sky-glow-atmosphere-different-typical-aurora">the latest from STEVE</a>. The unusual sky glow’s mauve arc looks a bit like an aurora, but isn’t. Ditto for STEVE’s bright green “picket fence,” researchers now say. “It’s really weird, and nobody really knows what’s going on just yet,” Boston University engineer Joshua Semeter told <em>Science News</em> staff writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/maria-temming">Maria Temming</a>.</p>



<p>These celestial conundrums remind us just how strange and wonderful the cosmos remains, despite humankind’s best efforts to figure it all out. More delightful mysteries, please. And back on Earth, we’re hard at work wrapping up our year-end special issue. It’s not hard to guess what we picked as the biggest science story of 2020.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened">Betelgeuse went dark, but didn’t go supernova. What happened?</a></h4>

<p>Astrophysicist Miguel Montargès has a clear memory of the moment the stars became real places to him. He was 7 or 8 years old, looking up from the garden of his parents’ apartment in the south of France. A huge, red star winked in the night. The young space fan connected the star to a map he had studied in an astronomy magazine and realized he knew its name: Betelgeuse.</p>



<p>Something shifted for him. That star was no longer an anonymous speck floating in a vast uncharted sea. It was a destination, with a name.</p>



<p>“I thought, wow, for the first time … I can name a star,” he says. The realization was life-changing.</p>



<p>Since then, Montargès, now at the Paris Observatory, has written his Ph.D. thesis and about a dozen papers about Betelgeuse. He considers the star an old friend, observing it many times a year, for work and for fun. He says good-bye every May when the star slips behind the sun from the perspective of Earth, and says hello again in August when the star comes back.</p>





<p>So in late 2019, when the bright star suddenly dimmed for no apparent reason, Montargès was a little alarmed. Some people speculated that Betelgeuse was about to explode in a brilliant supernova that would outshine the full moon. Astronomers know the star is old and its days are numbered, but Montargès wasn’t ready to see it go.</p>



<p>“It’s my favorite star,” he says. “I don’t want it to die.”</p>



<p>Other researchers, though, were eager to watch Betelgeuse explode in real time. Supernovas mark the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-star-death-giant-lasers-explosive-mysterious-physics">violent deaths of stars</a> that are at least eight times as massive as the sun (<em>SN: 11/7/20, p. 20</em>). But astronomers still don’t know what would signal that one is about to blow. The outbursts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-nearby-star-goes-supernova-scientists-will-be-ready">sprinkle interstellar space with elements</a> that ultimately form the bulk of planets and people — carbon, oxygen, iron (<em>SN: 2/18/17, p. 24</em>). So the question of how supernovas occur is a question of our own origins.</p>

<h3>A bit dim</h3>



<p>The SPHERE instrument in Chile took images of Betelgeuse in January (top) and December (bottom) 2019. The December image shows a dark splotch, a dimming, over Betelgeuse’s southern hemisphere.</p>

</div>



<p>But the explosions are rare — astronomers estimate that one occurs in our galaxy just a few times a century. The last one spotted nearby, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/30-year-anniversary-supernova-1987a">SN 1987A</a>, was more than 33 years ago in a neighboring galaxy (<em>SN: 2/18/17, p. 20</em>). Betelgeuse is just one of the many aging, massive stars — called red supergiants — that could go supernova at any moment. But as one of the closest and brightest, Betelgeuse is the one that space enthusiasts know best.</p>



<p>So when the star started acting strangely at the end of last year, Montargès and a small band of Betelgeuse diehards aimed every telescope they could at the dimming giant. Over the following months, the star returned to its usual brightness, and the excitement over an imminent supernova faded. But the flurry of data collected in the rush to figure out what was happening might help answer a different long-standing question: How do massive, old stars send their planet-building star stuff into the cosmos even before they explode?</p>



<h4>Orion’s shoulder</h4>



<p>If you’ve looked up at the stars during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, you’ve probably seen Betelgeuse, whether you realized it or not. The star is the second brightest in the constellation Orion, marking the hunter’s left shoulder from our perspective.</p>



<p>And it’s huge. Estimates for Betelgeuse’s vital statistics vary, but if it sat at the center of our solar system, the star would fill much of the space between the sun and Jupiter. At about 15 to 20 times as massive as the sun, somewhere between 750 and 1,000 times its diameter and just about 550 light-years from Earth, Betelgeuse is typically between the sixth- and seventh-brightest star in the sky.</p>



<p>Betelgeuse’s brightness varies, even under normal circumstances. Its outer layers are a bubbling cauldron of hot gas and plasma. As hot material rises to the surface, the star brightens; as material falls toward the core, the star dims. That convection cycle puts Betelgeuse on a semiregular dimmer switch that fluctuates roughly every 400 days or so. The star’s brightness also varies about every six years, though astronomers don’t know why.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Big deal</h3>



<p>Betelgeuse is the left shoulder of the Orion constellation (left). The star’s first portrait, made with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1996, took some doing. Hubble’s operators worried that the bright star would fry the telescope’s detectors. So astrophysicist Andrea Dupree had to use every filter Hubble had — “like wearing four sets of sunglasses,” she says. “There was nothing. Black. No light got through.” Only by taking off the sunglasses could she finally see the massive star, with a diameter that rivals the width of Jupiter’s orbit.</p>

<p>What they do know is that Betelgeuse is running out of time. It’s less than 10 million years old, a youngster compared with the roughly 4.6-billion–year-old sun. But because Betelgeuse is so massive and burns through its fuel so quickly, it’s already in the final life stage of a red supergiant. Someday in the not too distant future, the star won’t be able to support its own weight — it will collapse in on itself and rebound in a supernova.</p>



<p>“We know one day it’s going to die and explode,” says Emily Levesque, an astrophysicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. But no one knows when. “In astronomical terms, ‘one day’ means sometime in the next 200,000 years.”</p>



<p>In October 2019, Betelgeuse started dimming, which wasn’t too strange in and of itself. The change fit within the normal 400ish-day cycle, says astronomer Edward Guinan of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, who has been tracking Betelgeuse’s cycles of brightness since the 1980s.</p>



<p>But by Christmas, Betelgeuse was the dimmest it had been in the 100-plus years that astronomers have measured it. And the dimming continued all the way through February.</p>



<p>Guinan was one of the first to sound the alarm. On <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13341">December 7</a>, and again on <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13365">December 23</a>, he and colleagues posted a bulletin on The Astronomer’s Telegram website announcing the star’s “fainting” and encouraging fellow astronomers to take a look.</p>



<p>There was no reason to think that the dimming was a harbinger of a supernova. “I never said it was going to be one,” Guinan says. But because these explosions are so rare, astronomers don’t know what the signals of an imminent supernova are. Dimming could be one of them.</p>



<p>That report of odd behavior was all astronomers and amateur space enthusiasts needed to hear. Online, the story caught fire.</p>



<p>“On Twitter, it was hysterical,” says Andrea Dupree, an astrophysicist at the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian’s Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. She recalls seeing one tweet suggesting that the explosion was going to happen that night, with the hashtag #HIDE. “Where am I going to hide? Under my desk?” (When Betelgeuse finally explodes, it probably won’t hurt life on Earth — it’s a safe distance away.)</p>

<p>After millions of years, stars that are between eight and 30 times the sun’s mass evolve into yellow supergiants, spend a few thousand years as such, then become red supergiants like Betelgeuse. Ultimately these stars explode violently as supernovas. The images above are not to scale.<br /></p>

<p>Most astronomers didn’t really believe that Betelgeuse’s end was nigh, even as they rushed to schedule telescope time. But some got caught up in the excitement.</p>



<p>“I don’t expect it to blow,” Guinan recalls thinking. “But I don’t want to blink.” He signed up for phone alerts from telescopes that detect invisible particles called neutrinos and ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. A detection of either one might be an early sign of a supernova. He found himself outside at 1 a.m. in January after a report of gravitational waves from the direction of Orion. “It was cloudy, but I thought I might see a brightening,” he says. “I’ve gotten crazy about it.”</p>



<p>Others were believers too, until their data cast doubt on the notion.</p>



<p>“I thought it might,” says astrophysicist Thavisha Dharmawardena of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “We knew there were other explanations, and we might have to look into it. But we know Betelgeuse is an old star, close to the end of its life. It was exciting.”</p>



<h4>Two camps</h4>



<p>Once the star started <a href="http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13512">returning to its usual brightness</a> in mid-February, talk of an imminent supernova faded. A paper published in the Oct. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal </em>boosted confidence in Betelgeuse’s longevity, suggesting that the star is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abb8db">just at the beginning of its old age</a> and has at least 100,000 years to go before it explodes. But what was it up to, if it was not on the verge of exploding?</p>



<p>As results from telescopes all over the world and in space flooded in, most astronomers have fallen into two camps. One says Betelgeuse’s dimming was caused by a cloud of dust coughed out by the star itself, blocking its glow. The other camp isn’t sure what the explanation is, but says “no” to the dust speculation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="an illustration showing Betelgeuse sneezing out a burst of gas and dust" class="wp-image-3093884" height="474" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_lg_betelgeuse_inline4_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093884">One explanation for why Betelgeuse went dark in 2019 is that the star sneezed out a burst of gas and dust (illustrated, left), which condensed into a dark cloud. That cloud blocked the star’s face from the perspective of Earth (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093884">NASA, ESA, E. Wheatley/STScI</span></figure>



<p>If the dust theory proves true, it could have profound implications for the origins of complex chemistry, planets and even life in the universe. Red supergiants are surrounded by diffuse clouds of gas and dust that are full of elements that are forged only in stars — and those clouds form before the star explodes. Even before they die, supergiants seem to bequeath material to the next generation of stars.</p>



<p>“The carbon, oxygen in our body, it’s coming from there — from the supernova and from the clouds around dying stars,” Montargès says. But it’s not clear how those elements escape the stars in the first place. “We have no idea,” he says.</p>



<p>Montargès hoped studying Betelgeuse’s dimming would let scientists see that process in action.</p>



<p>In December 2019, he and colleagues took an image of Betelgeuse in visible light with the SPHERE instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. That image showed that, yes, <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2003/">Betelgeuse was much dimmer</a> than it had been 11 months earlier — but only the star’s bottom half. Perhaps an asymmetrical dust cloud was to blame.</p>



<p>Observations from February 15, 2020, seem to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dust-supernova-explosion">support that idea</a> (<em>SN: 4/11/20, p. 6</em>). Levesque and Philip Massey of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., compared the February observations with similar ones from 2004. The star’s temperature hadn’t dropped as much as would be expected if the dimming was from something intrinsic to the star, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab7935">like its convection cycles</a>, the pair reported in the March 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>That left dust as a reasonable explanation. “We know Betelgeuse sheds mass and produces dust around itself,” Levesque says. “Dust could have come toward us, cooled and temporarily blocked the light.”</p>



<h4>Dark cloud</h4>



<p>A strong vote for dust came from Dupree, who was watching Betelgeuse with the Hubble Space Telescope. Like Guinan, she has a decades-long relationship with Betelgeuse. In 1996, she and colleague Ronald Gilliland looked at Betelgeuse with Hubble to make the <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1996/04/394-Image.html">first real image of any star other than the sun</a>. Most stars are too far and too faint to show up as anything but a point. Betelgeuse is one of the few stars whose surface can be seen as a two-dimensional disk — a real place.</p>



<p>By the end of 2019, Dupree was observing Betelgeuse with Hubble several times a year. She had assembled an international team of researchers she calls the MOB, for Months of Betelgeuse, to observe the star frequently in a variety of wavelengths of light.</p>

<p>In late 2019, Betelgeuse started dimming (V curve, right) more than its normal up and down (V curve, left). The blue and green dots are brightness measurements from ground-based observatories.</p>



<h6>Betelgeuse brightness measurements, 2019-2020</h6>



<div class="image-desktop"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="a graph showing the brightness of Betelgeuse from 2019-2020" class="wp-image-3093921" height="625" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_lg_betelgeuse_inline5-desktop_680_rev.png" width="680" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3093921">A.K.

</div>



<p>The goal was the same as Montargès’: to answer fundamental questions about how Betelgeuse, and perhaps other red supergiants, lose material. The MOB had baseline observations from before the dimming and already had Hubble time scheduled to track the star’s brightness cycles.</p>



<p>Those observations showed that in January and March 2019, Betelgeuse looked “perfectly normal,” Dupree says. But from September through November, just before the dimming event, the star gave out more ultraviolet light — up to four or five times its usual UV brightness — over its southern hemisphere.</p>



<p>The temperature and electron density in that region went up, too. And material seemed to be moving outward, away from the star and toward Earth.</p>



<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aba516">Dupree and colleagues’ theory</a> of what happened, reported in the Aug. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>, is that one of the giant bubbles of hot plasma always churning in the star’s outer layers rose to the edge of the star’s atmosphere and escaped, sending huge amounts of material flowing into interstellar space. That could be one way that red supergiants shed material before exploding.</p>



<p>Once it had fled the star, that hot stuff cooled, condensed into dust and floated in front of Betelgeuse for several months. As the dust cleared, Betelgeuse appeared brighter again.</p>



<p>“It seems to us that what we saw with the ultraviolet is kind of the smoking gun,” Dupree says. “This material moved on out, condensed and formed this dark, dark dust cloud.”</p>



<p>Paul Hertz, director of NASA’s astrophysics division, shared the Hubble results in a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/virtual-townhall-2020">NASA online town hall</a> meeting on September 10 as if it were the final answer. “Mystery solved,” he said. “Not gonna supernova anytime soon.”</p>



<h4>Cycles and spots</h4>



<p>Maybe not — but that doesn’t mean dust explains the dimming.</p>



<p>In the July 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, Dharmawardena and colleagues <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab9ca6">published observations</a> of Betelgeuse that ran counter to the dust explanation. Her team used the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii in January, February and March to look at Betelgeuse in submillimeter wavelengths of light. “If we think it’s a dust cloud, the submillimeter is the perfect wavelength to look at,” she says.</p>



<p>Dust should have made Betelgeuse look brighter in those wavelengths, as floating grains absorbed and reemitted starlight. But it didn’t. If anything, the star dimmed slightly. “Our first thought was that we’d done something wrong — everyone in the community expected it to be dust,” she says. But “the fact that it didn’t increase or stay constant in the submillimeter was pretty much a dead giveaway that it’s not dust.”</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13884.pdf">Infrared observations with the airborne SOFIA telescope</a> should have found the glowing signature of dust too, if it existed. “It never showed up,” Guinan says. “I don’t think it’s dust.”</p>



<p>Instead, Guinan thinks the dimming may have been part of Betelgeuse’s natural convection cycle. The star’s outer atmosphere constantly pulsates and “breathes” in and out as enormous bubbles of hot plasma rise to the surface and sink down again. “It’s driven by the internal core of the star,” he says. “You have hot blobs rising up, they cool, they get more dense, they fall back.”</p>



<p>Multiple cycles syncing up could explain why the 2019 dimming was so extreme. Guinan and colleagues analyzed about 180 years of observations of Betelgeuse, dating back to astronomer John Herschel’s 1839 discovery that the star’s brightness varies. Guinan’s group found that, in addition to the roughly six-year and 400-day cycles, Betelgeuse might have a third, smaller cycle of about 187 days. It looks like all three cycles might have hit their brightness nadirs at the same time in late 2019, Guinan says.</p>



<p>Or maybe the darkness in the southern hemisphere that Montargès’ team saw with SPHERE was an enormous star spot, Dharmawardena offers. In the sun’s case, those dark splotches, called sunspots, mark the sites of magnetic activity on the surface. Betelgeuse is one of a handful of stars on which star spots have been directly seen.</p>



<p>But to cause Betelgeuse’s dimming, a star spot would have to be enormous. Typical star spots cover about 20 to 30 percent of a star’s surface, Dharmawardena says. This one would need to cover at least half, maybe up to 70 percent.</p>



<p>“That’s rare,” Dharmawardena admits. “But so is this kind of dimming.”</p>



<h4>Pandemic disruptions</h4>



<p>Analyses are still coming in. But just as Betelgeuse was returning to its normal brightness, the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>



<p>“We were hoping to have a lot more data,” Dharmawardena says.</p>



<p>A few observations came in right under the wire. The SOFIA observations were made on one of the last flights before the pandemic grounded the plane that carries the telescope. And Montargès took another look with SPHERE just days before its observatory shut down in mid-March.</p>



<div class="image-desktop"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="an image of Betelgeuse from STEREO" class="wp-image-3093888" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/120520_lg_betelgeuse_inline6-desktop_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3093888">In mid-July 2020, astronomers announced that STEREO, a sun-watching spacecraft, had seen signs that the star Betelgeuse was beginning to dim yet again. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3093888">HI/Stereo/NASA</span></figure>

</div>



<p>But one of Montargès’ most hoped-for results may never come. Eager to solve the dust versus not-dust mystery, his plan was to combine two kinds of observations: making a 2-D picture of the whole star’s disk, like Dupree did with Hubble in the ’90s, but in longer wavelengths such as infrared or submillimeter, like Dharmawardena’s images from early 2020. That way, you could differentiate the dust from the star, he reasoned.</p>



<p>Only one observatory can do both at once: the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, in Chile. Montargès had planned to ask to observe Betelgeuse with ALMA in June and July, when the winter skies in the Southern Hemisphere are most free of turbulence. But ALMA closed in March and was still closed in September.</p>



<p>“When I realized ALMA will not get the time in June, I thought … we are never going to solve it,” he says. “We may never be completely certain, because of COVID.”</p>



<h4>Any other star</h4>



<p>Montargès and his colleagues have submitted their analysis of the SPHERE pictures from March for publication. Though he’s not yet willing to share the results, he thinks they could pull the two camps together.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if Betelgeuse did cough out a cloud of dust last year, it could teach us about the origins of life in the universe, Montargès says. If the dust camp is even partially right, Betelgeuse’s dimming may have been the first time humans have watched the seeds of life being launched into the cosmos.</p>



<p>In the meantime, he’s relieved to see his favorite star shining bright again. “I must admit that since [last] December, since this whole stuff started, every time I see it, I am like, phew, it’s still there,” he says.</p>



<p>People keep asking him if he would like ​Betelgeuse to go supernova so he can study it. “I would like another star to go supernova,” he says. “Antares, I don’t care about it; it can explode anytime. But not Betelgeuse.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/639355027/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to call for the police Crisis Intervention Team</a></h4>

<p><em>Chapter 7 of </em><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/family-guide-to-mental-illness-and-the-law-9780190622220?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Family Guide to Mental Illness and the Law</a></em><em> is titled “When Police Are Called to Help” and deals with two types of circumstances: those involving people with mental illness as victims of crime and those in which families seek help from police during a mental health crisis. This blog post contains one small excerpt from that chapter.</em><em> </em></p><p>When you call 911 for assistance with someone whose mental health symptoms are out of control:</p><h2>1. Ask for the Crisis Intervention Team</h2><p>Specifically ask for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officers with mental health training. Tell the dispatcher that the person you are calling about has a diagnosed mental illness and is experiencing a mental health crisis and explain what that illness is.</p><h2>2. Help prepare the police officers for the scene</h2><p>Then after setting that foundation help prepare the officers for the scene by giving the 911 operator all of the details about the current behavior.</p><ul><li>Does this person have a weapon?</li><li>Is the person athletic or trained in martial arts?</li><li>Give facts about their size.</li><li> At this moment, is the person delusional, depressed, hallucinating, manic, spastic, or agitated?</li><li>Provide very quick context for any statements that the person is making.</li></ul><h2>3. Flag down the police officers upon arrival</h2><p>To help make the police encounter as safe as possible for everyone present, you or someone else should go outside to flag down the police and tell them where the building entrances are and where the event is happening inside the building.</p><h2>4. Give the on-scene police officers an update</h2><p>Even though you told everything to the dispatcher, give a quick descriptive update to the on-scene police as soon as you can. For example:</p><ul><li>“My bipolar thirty-year-old son, Steve, threw me down the stairs. I don’t know if he took his medicine. He is shaking all over and won’t talk to any of us.”</li><li>“My twenty-five-year-old sister, Kay, is delusional. She is pulling everything off of the shelves and throwing it on the floor. I ran next door. Nobody else is in the house with her.”</li><li>“My husband, Ted, is depressed. He locked himself in the upstairs bathroom and is crying about an old business failure. He keeps saying angry things about Bob, but Bob is long gone. There is no reason to worry about Bob.”</li></ul><h2>5. Stay out of the way</h2><p>Once the officers begin to work the scene, stay out of the way! Do not talk unless an officer asks you a question or calls on you to say something but stay close enough that the officers can communicate with you if they need to. The CIT officers know how to interact with people suffering from specific mental disturbances; they do not need you to translate for them. All police officers are trained to stabilize situations, so even if there is not a CIT officer present you should not interfere once you’ve oriented the officers to the situation.</p><p> </p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/ZXqE31D8TEk">Davey Heuser</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/how-to-call-for-the-police-crisis-intervention-team/">How to call for the police Crisis Intervention Team</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/639355027/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/639355027/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-jeremiah-barker-papers-medicine-as-practiced-200-years-ago/" rel="nofollow">The Jeremiah Barker Papers: medicine as practiced 200 years ago</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-case-for-investing-in-wind-energy/" rel="nofollow">The case for investing in wind energy</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>While puberty is not the easiest time of most people’s lives, the onset of early puberty is a notable public health issue which can lead to a higher risk of developing mental, emotional, and physical health conditions, such as depression, eating disorders, substance use, risky sexual activities, early sexual debut, and underage pregnancy.</p>
<p>A study by Aghaee <em>et al.</em> explored the impact of household intactness (defined as the child living with both parents until at least the age of 6, with this being checked during approximately a dozen healthcare visits between the ages of 0 and 6) on pubertal trajectories, focusing on filling the knowledge gap with regards to racial/ethnic minorities, as the majority of previous studies have been conducted using predominantly White cohorts. Their study included 26,044 girls born at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical facility between 2003 and 2010.</p>
<p>This study found that early life exposure to household non-intactness was associated with early pubertal timing in the girls included in this study, and that this association may vary between race/ethnicity, strongest among Black girls. While it goes without saying that the conditions of the family home cannot be modified by healthcare professionals, this knowledge can help facilitate conversations with the caregivers of young girls, who can work with providers to pinpoint areas of home life that can be improved through social and family services, hopefully avoiding the risk of early puberty.</p>

<p>In the US, immigrants who lack citizenship face significant barriers to accessing health care. From undocumented immigrants who are less likely to have medical insurance, to those with temporary status who are ineligible for federally-funded public insurance, and even lawful permanent residents (such as green card holders), immigrants face barriers compared to individuals with citizenship.</p>
<p>In recent years, state policy makers have increasingly enacted restrictive immigrant policies, referred to as criminalization policies based on their punitive treatment of noncitizens though surveillance and policing, linking immigration to the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>A study by Young <em>et al.</em> noted that these criminalization policies reinforced the marginalization of non-citizens, also producing health inequity between the states in the US. Advancing policies that de-criminalize or buffer immigrants from federal enforcement is critical to promote immigrants’ access to care and well-being.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect of clinical research is the informed consent of participants, a process which is rendered even more complex when a trial involves patients nearing the end of life where the research promises them little clinical benefit.</p>
<p>A study by Murphy <em>et al.</em> aimed at gaining greater understanding of how these patients make decisions regarding clinical trial participation. They interviewed non-curative cancer patients in the UK who had previously been invited to participate in a clinical trial, as well as some of the healthcare professionals involved in their care, oncologists and clinical research nurses.</p>
<p>Both the patients and healthcare professionals indicated that “nothing to lose” was a core aspect of the decision making process, from the part of a patient as a search for a life-line, and for the healthcare professionals as a way to maintain hope for the patients. Generally, the patients and healthcare professionals were found to have similar perspectives. Informed consent is critical to ensure patients are fully informed of the trial requirements and potential outcomes, a task which is both more difficult and more important considering the vulnerability of this particular population.</p>

<p>The transcriptome remains a vastly under explored space despite its significance as a foundation for biology. The current challenges in annotating eukaryotic transcriptomes are biological complexity, RNA preparation, limitations of sequencing technologies and sequence analysis. Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can provide additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to differentiate from sequencing noise.</p>
<p>Kuo <em>et al.</em> have developed the Transcriptome Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software, aiming to leverage the power of long read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current processing pipelines. TAMA uses long read transcript data and high-quality reference genome assemblies to produce accurate and informative transcript models, improving transcript model prediction accuracy and increase transcriptome discovery with transparent and traceable steps.</p>
<p>TAMA, along with other commonly used tools, were used to analyse publicly available sequencing data (the Universal Human Reference RNA UHRR Sequel II Iso-Seq data), noted to have high read depth and long read accuracy. The use of parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. The authors found long read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read RNA sequencing data.</p>

<p>In the UK, the number of overweight and obese men is higher than the number of women, however, men are less likely to participate in weight management programmes. In fact, little is known as to how to best recruit men to weight management programmes.</p>
<p>McDonald <em>et. al</em> sought input from both patients and the public in their pre-trial decisions in order to try and successfully recruit male participants for a men-only weight management intervention. Various aspects of the recruitment process were discussed, from recruitment materials, to the study’s catchy name: “Game of Stones”, chosen by popular vote.</p>
<p>The authors of this study concluded that no single strategy appealed to all men, but their mixed methods approach highlighted factors which contributed to successful recruitment, among them the importance of language and adopting a sensitive approach to recruit the men. Recruitment strategy decisions should be evidence based and involve input from target group members, and further work is required to examine how these strategies could be implemented and sustained in practice.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We tend to think of empathy as a wholly positive thing, a trait that’s not only favourable to possess but that we should actively foster. Books and courses promise to reveal secret wells of empathy and ways to channel them; some people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/24/superpower-empaths-paid-read-mind-empathy">even charge</a> for “empathy readings”, a service that seems to sit somewhere between a psychic reading and a therapy session.</p>



<p>It would be easy to assume, therefore, that people who express empathy are generally well-liked. But a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69773-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology </em>finds that our feelings towards “empathisers” depends on <em>who</em> they are empathising with. While empathisers were considered warmer overall, participants judged people who expressed empathy for those with troubling political views more harshly — suggesting that we don’t always interpret empathy as a pure moral virtue.</p>



<span id="more-40920"></span>



<p>In the first study, 464 participants were shown a scenario in which Ann (the “target”) and Beth (the “responder”) were meeting for the first time. In one condition, Ann worked for a children’s hospital; in the other, she worked for a white supremacist group.</p>



<p>Participants then read a conversation between the pair, with Ann telling Beth about a stressful experience at work planning an event for a large group of people. Those in the “empathic response” condition heard that Beth empathised with Ann, while other participants read that Beth gave a non-committal response. Finally, participants indicated how much they liked, respected, trusted and would like to be friends with Beth as well as how caring, kind and understanding they felt she was.</p>



<p>As expected, participants respected and liked Beth more, and considered her more warm, when she answered empathetically in the scenario where Ann worked at a hospital. When Ann worked for a white supremacist group, however, participants did not like Beth more or less depending on her response — though they did perceive her as slightly warmer when she was empathetic. These results were replicated in a second study in which Ann was presented as pro- or anti-vaccination. And in a third, participants liked Beth <em>less</em> when she empathised with a positive experience recounted by white supremacist Ann.      </p>



<p>In the next study, participants saw the same information from the first studies, including the same empathetic response from Beth. But this time, the non-empathetic response was actively condemning: participants heard that Beth told Ann that it “sounds to me like you’re getting what you deserve”. And participants liked and respected Beth more when she gave this negative response to white supremacist Ann (though she was still considered warmer when responding empathetically). This was also the case in a follow-up study replacing Ann and Beth with male figures, suggesting that the effect is not gendered.</p>



<p>“Empathy towards white supremacists isn’t favourably looked upon” isn’t hugely shocking news. But the study does shed some light on the way we think about empathy in general. As noted, empathy is often depicted as an uncomplicated moral good — something we should unconditionally strive for. But the results suggest a more complex situation, where empathy is morally relative rather than absolute. This is also evident in assessments of warmth, another seemingly straightforward trait — even when participants didn’t like or respect Beth, they still considered her warm.</p>



<p>Further research could look at how this impacts behaviour — that is, are we less likely to be friends with or act positively towards someone who has empathised with a group or person we dislike? And how does this affect processes like voting or endorsing particular political candidates?</p>



<p>Though we tend to think of empathy as something that exists between two people or groups, we rarely think about the third party observers witnessing it. But as the study shows, understanding the broader social context of empathy may help us better understand its true effects.</p>



<p>– <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69773-001">Evaluations of empathizers depend on the target of empathy.</a></p>

<p>We were warned this might happen.</p>



<p>While millions stayed home last spring, looking to summer for respite from the virus, experts worried that an even larger fall surge was around the corner.</p>



<p>We’ve rounded that corner. As cases and hospitalizations reach record levels across Europe and the United States, leaders are being forced to make hard decisions about what to shut down and when. In the United States, President-elect Joe Biden has made clear that he won’t call for a national lockdown, but more targeted shutdowns at the state or local level are on the table. And in fact, many regions are already rolling out more targeted approaches, focusing on crowded spaces like restaurants, bars, or schools.</p>



<p>European countries began rolling out new restrictions in October, and in the United States many governors and city officials are beginning to partially clamp down. <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/coronavirus-update">Public schools in New York City were closed</a> on November 19; Minnesota has <a href="https://mn.gov/covid19/">shuttered bars and restaurants</a> for a month starting November 20; California officials enacted <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/11/19/state-issues-limited-stay-at-home-order-to-slow-spread-of-covid-19/">curfews</a> between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in certain counties through December 21. </p>

<p>Whether these fine-tuned restrictions will work remains to be seen. But scientists have been studying what worked and what didn’t in the early months of the pandemic, revealing some promising approaches. New research suggests that focusing on closing or reducing capacity at transmission hot spots while keeping less risky parts of the economy open can curb exponential rises in cases, while minimizing harm to the economy. </p>



<p>“We don’t need to fully shelter in place to slow transmission,” says Lauren Ancel Meyers, a mathematical biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. But these sharper approaches work only if governments set clear guidelines and people follow them, she says. Even the smartest interventions will be overwhelmed if enacted too late amidst rampant transmission within a community.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at what may work, and what doesn’t.</p>



<h4>Don’ts: What didn’t work</h4>



<p>In hindsight, some of the measures enacted in the earliest days of the pandemic did little to quell it. Temperature checks and deep cleaning of public surfaces emerged as two largely ineffective measures in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0">a global analysis</a> published November 16 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>.</p>



<p>Early on, “no one had a clue as to how to stop the spread of the virus,” says Peter Klimek, a data scientist at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria. Instead, countries threw the kitchen sink at the virus, enacting many measures simultaneously.</p>



<p>Klimek and his colleagues used statistical techniques to try to disentangle which measures worked and which didn’t. In 56 different countries, including the United States, they assessed how more than 6,000 different interventions affected infection rates in the weeks after enactment. What they found comports with what we’ve since learned about the virus and how it spreads.</p>



<p>Temperature checks, at border crossing or airports, aren’t especially effective because people are often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear">contagious well before symptom onset</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/20</em>). Deep cleaning public places such as subway cars seemed prudent early on, but evidence suggests that touching shared surfaces isn’t a big driver of transmission events, Klimek says. Instead, the coronavirus spreads <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission">most easily through the air</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>)</p>



<h4>Do: Target transmission hot spots</h4>



<p>Given the ease of airborne spread, interventions that targeted transmission hot spots — crowded indoor spaces — worked best, especially cancelling small gatherings of up to 50 people. “Basically this includes the closure of bars, restaurants, cafes, having people work from home if possible, and bans on family celebrations like weddings, funerals,” Klimek says.</p>



<p>Limits on large gatherings, stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions proved effective too, along with increasing access to personal protective equipment and educating the public about risk management. </p>



<p>These measures were more effective when enacted sooner, the researchers found. For instance, responding to a rise in cases quickly by cancelling small gatherings and restricting some travel, but keeping schools open, slowed the spread as much as if all three measures were enacted two weeks later when cases were much higher, Klimek says.</p>



<p>“Countries that are facing difficult situations right now likely waited too long,” Klimek says. “It’s better to act sooner and act more decisively.”</p>



<p>Part of the hesitancy to act early stems from a fear of the economic consequences of shutdowns. But scientists are trying to chart paths that minimize those economic costs while still controlling the virus.  </p>

<h3>Flattening the curve   </h3>



<p>The changing weekly average of daily new confirmed cases in select countries since March shows that restrictions that some European countries enacted in October and November were followed by a decline in new cases, while cases continue to spike in the United States.

<p>“If we can identify economic sectors that contribute most to transmission and least to gross domestic product, then those our prime candidates to close down,” says Katharina Hauck, a health economist at Imperial College London. “You get the biggest impact on transmission and the least damage to GDP.”</p>



<p>To identify those sectors, Hauck and her colleagues simulated the effects of more targeted restrictions on disease spread and the economy in the United Kingdom, drawing on both economics and epidemiology. Using detailed survey data on people’s levels of contact, and thus transmission, at different sorts of businesses and residences, the researchers projected the effects of restricting different sectors. </p>



<p>A widespread shutdown that maintains only essential services across 63 economic sectors, but leaves schools and universities open, would <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-11-16-COVID19-Report-35.pdf">keep COVID-19 hospitalizations within capacity</a>, according to the report released November 16. Such a blunt shutdown would cost the United Kingdom 229 billion pounds (about $306 billion U.S. dollars) in lost GDP over the next six months, compared with hypothetically leaving the economy open but allowing hospitals to be overwhelmed.</p>



<p>A fully open scenario would send 68,000 people to the hospital at the height of the surge, compared with the United Kingdom’s peak of around 18,000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in April, the researchers say. But letting the virus burn through a population unabated could have unforeseen and drastic economic consequences, in addition to leading to many more deaths.</p>



<p>Alternatively, more targeted restrictions focused on high contact sectors like restaurants, retail shops, and entertainment venues could keep hospitals functional while allowing schools and universities to remain mostly open, along with manufacturing centers, construction, financial services and agriculture. Such a scenario cost the United Kingdom only 26 billion pounds (about $35 billion) in lost GDP, compared with keeping everything open.</p>

<p>“Our study shows how we might fine-tune closures of the economy and save both lives and livelihoods,” Hauck says. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november">England</a> and much of Europe are in the midst of a more fine-tuned approach this fall, with restaurants and cafes closed in many countries but schools remaining largely open. There are preliminary signs these measures are turning the tide. Daily case counts in France, for instance, have fallen nearly 70 percent, from a weekly rolling average of over 54,868 on November 8 to 16,722 on November 25.</p>



<h4>Do: Reduce crowding</h4>



<p>Could similarly targeted restrictions work in the United States? </p>



<p>Simply <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2923-3">limiting capacity at key transmission hot spots</a>, such as restaurants, may be enough to curtail exponential spread in some cities, according to an analysis published November 10 in <em>Nature</em>. “Closing the economy does not have to be all or nothing, doesn’t have to be total lockdown and full reopening,” says Jure Leskovec, a computer scientist at Stanford University.</p>



<p>Leskovec and his colleagues turned to cell phone mobility data from some 98 million Americans across 10 large metro areas, including Chicago, New York City, Atlanta and Washington D.C. This database allowed the researchers to “visualize” these people as particles, whose location is updated each hour as they move from their homes to places like restaurants, grocery stores and gyms. The researchers excluded schools and workplaces from their analysis.</p>



<p>From this starting point, they built a statistical model, tweaking variables that control how easily a virus can jump from particle to particle (in effect, person to person) in different situations until the model closely matched the actual case counts in these 10 cities from March to May, even as these cities enacted social distancing measures. </p>



<p>“From an epidemiological standpoint the model is quite simple, but it shows the power of mobility in spreading the virus,” Leskovec says. That simplicity also allowed the researchers to simulate different reopening strategies, seeing how restricting mobility at different locations influenced the spread of disease. </p>



<p>Overall, most predicted infections occurred at a small number of places. In Chicago, for instance, their analyses found that 85 percent of infections occurred at just 10 percent of places outside the home, including restaurants and fitness centers. But 80 percent of those infections could be prevented by capping the maximum occupancy at any given time to 20 percent of normal. Leskovec says that these businesses still retain 60 percent of overall visitors, by their estimation, but the visits were more spread out so fewer people clustered together at any given time. “For the price of 40 percent of visitors, we’re preventing 80 percent of infections,” he says.</p>



<p>Limiting occupancy is especially important in lower-income neighborhoods, the researchers found. Residents of these neighborhoods <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-control-increasing-cases">socially distance less due to work-related demands</a> (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>), and Leskovec’s analysis predicted higher infection rates at particular spots. “A single trip to the grocery store is twice as dangerous for a low-income person than a high-income person” in eight of the 10 metro areas, Leskovec says. “Low-income families go to stores that are more densely packed than richer families, and they stay longer,” Leskovec says.</p>



<p>Limiting capacity at these often crowded locations, or creating other ways of distributing food in these neighborhoods, might start to ameliorate COVID-19’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">stark racial and ethnic health disparities</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). </p>

<h4>Do: Act early</h4>



<p>While targeted shutdowns can work, these more precise tools are only effective if enacted before community spread takes off. “You have to tap on the brakes at the first indication that things are taking an alarming turn,” says Meyers, the mathematical biologist. “If intensive care units start reaching capacity, then it’s time to slam on the brakes,” with longer, more restrictive measures.</p>



<p>In the United States, many regions may have already passed the optimal moment to start tapping the brakes with less restrictive measures, Meyers says. “The key pressure points for reducing transmission, like restrictions on indoor dining, are also some of the hardest things to get enacted.” But for every day that social distancing measures are delayed, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/20-1932_article">cities need on average two and a half more days of restrictions to contain an outbreak</a>, Meyers and colleagues report in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> in September. </p>



<p>“Waiting a week to act not only means that things probably look worse in terms of hospitalizations, but it also might mean that we have to lock down for two and a half extra weeks longer,” Meyers says. “So even though we’re trying to avoid that sort of economic cost up front, it may come back to bite us.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Criminals are often characterised in the popular press as <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nb7eAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">“animals” or “cold-blooded”</a>. Such adjectives effectively dehumanise them, and there’s no end of research finding that if we deny fully human emotional and thinking capacities to other people, we are less likely to treat them in a humane way. But how long does prisoner dehumanisation last? Is it a life sentence? Or, wondered the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220911496">new paper</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, does it depend on how long a prisoner has left to serve?</p>



<span id="more-40913"></span>



<p>Jason C. Deska at Ryerson University in Canada and his colleagues ran a series of seven studies to investigate this. In each, participants viewed a series of 20 mugshots of White men imprisoned in Florida. Though the mugshots were of real prisoners, the team manipulated the accompanying information, so that each man’s sentence was stated as being around 1,460 days (four years), and they had either served around one month or had only about one month left in prison.</p>



<p>The first two studies, on 148 students and then 155 adults recruited online, revealed that the participants ascribed greater mental sophistication to the prisoners who were about to be released than to those who had only just started their sentences. These prisoners were credited with having greater emotional and cognitive faculties as well as greater agency — an ability to act according to their own individual intentions. They were, in other words, subject to less dehumanisation.</p>



<p>In the next five studies, the researchers further explored what they called the “time-to-serve effect”. They investigated the potential role of the participants’ beliefs about the four primary functions of incarceration, as identified by laypeople as well as experts in criminal justice. These are: rehabilitation, retribution, deterrence (from committing another crime) and incapacitation (removing criminals from society, to prevent them from harming anyone else). In each study, fresh batches of online participants viewed the same 20 mugshots, along with sentencing information. But as well as completing the Mind Attribution Scale, which measured any dehumanisation, participants also rated the extent to which they felt that the prisoner had either been rehabilitated, punished, deterred or incapacitated. (Each study included just one of these mini-scales.)</p>



<p>Soon-to-be-released prisoners were seen as being more rehabilitated, more adequately punished, and more likely to have been deterred from committing future crimes. These perceptions in turn led people to view the prisoners approaching the end of their sentence as more “human”. The researchers stress that they are not arguing that prison is an effective deterrent, or that punishment causes prisoners to gain mental sophistication — rather, that beliefs about how well the functions of prison have been met seem to affect levels of dehumanisation of prisoners.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants completed all three of these scales, rather than just one. This time, only beliefs relating to levels of rehabilitation and deterrence — and not retribution — emerged as being important for driving the “time to serve” effect.</p>



<p>As the team notes, deterrence and retribution both involve the infliction of pain on the individual, but only deterrence seeks to <em>change</em> that person. Effective rehabilitation and deterrence both entail changes in the prisoner’s mental state, and, it seems, either less dehumanisation by others, or a restoration of ascriptions of typical human capacities.</p>



<p>“Prisoners are a chronically dehumanized social group,” the team notes. Given work finding that dehumanisation of prisoners “both impedes successful rehabilitation and facilitates inhumane treatment”, it’s clearly important to understand the circumstances and beliefs that can affect these kinds of views.</p>



<p>“Although our data cannot speak to how effective incarceration is for actual rehabilitation and deterrence, they do suggest that emphasising these functions of incarceration may be especially important for interventions designed at integrating ex-convicts back into society,” the team concludes. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/29/researchers-assume-white-americans-are-more-representative-of-humankind-than-other-groups-according-to-analysis-of-psychology-paper-titles/">Well, they do if that society comprises mostly White Americans</a>, and if the prisoners are all White males, as was the case here. As the researchers themselves note, “Future work would do well to examine how diverse participants in non-WEIRD cultures dehumanize prisoners across the course of their prison term.” Different cultural attitudes, and also the nature of a prisoner’s crime (in these studies, the crimes were deliberately not identified) could clearly affect prisoner dehumanisation, too. But these are interesting first steps to a deeper understanding of which beliefs lead us to dehumanise prisoners, and how they might be modified.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about a paper "Complex Dynamics in Simplified Neuronal Models: Reproducing Golgi Cell Electroresponsiveness".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Brain neurons exhibit complex electroresponsive properties – including intrinsic
subthreshold oscillations and pacemaking, resonance and phase-reset – which are
thought to play a critical role in controlling neural network dynamics. Although
these properties emerge from detailed representations of molecular-level
mechanisms in “realistic” models, they cannot usually be generated by simplified
neuronal models (although these may show spike-frequency adaptation and
bursting). We report here that this whole set of properties can be generated by
the extended generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (E-GLIF) neuron model. E-GLIF
derives from the GLIF model family and is therefore mono-compartmental, keeps
the limited computational load typical of a linear low-dimensional system,
admits analytical solutions and can be tuned through gradient-descent
algorithms. Importantly, E-GLIF is designed to maintain a correspondence between
model parameters and neuronal membrane mechanisms through a minimum set of
equations. In order to test its potential, E-GLIF was used to model a specific
neuron showing rich and complex electroresponsiveness, the cerebellar Golgi
cell, and was validated against experimental electrophysiological data recorded
from Golgi cells in acute cerebellar slices. During simulations, E-GLIF was
activated by stimulus patterns, including current steps and synaptic inputs,
identical to those used for the experiments. The results demonstrate that E-GLIF
can reproduce the whole set of complex neuronal dynamics typical of these
neurons – including intensity-frequency curves, spike-frequency adaptation,
post-inhibitory rebound bursting, spontaneous subthreshold oscillations,
resonance, and phase-reset – providing a new effective tool to investigate brain
dynamics in large-scale simulations.</p>

"I have never been more encouraged and thankful to Free and Open Source communities. Three months ago I posted a request for help with OCR’ing and processing 19th Century Newspapers and we got soooo many offers to help.  Thank you, that was heart warming and concretely helpful– already based on these suggestions we are changing over our OCR and PDF software completely to FOSS, making big improvements, and building partnerships with FOSS developers in companies, universities, and as individuals that will propel the Internet Archive to have much better digitized texts.  I am so grateful, thank you.   So encouraging.

I posted a plea for help on the Internet Archive blog: Can You Help us Make the 19th Century Searchable? and we got many social media offers and over 50 comments the post– maybe a record response rate.   

We are already changing over our OCR to Tesseract/OCRopus and leveraging many PDF libraries to create compressed, accessible, and archival PDFs...."

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approved-first-drug-treat-rapid-aging-disease-progeria">The FDA has approved the first drug to treat the rapid-aging disease progeria</a></h4>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a treatment that could give children with a rare genetic illness that causes premature aging more time to live.</p>



<p>Children with the disease, known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, or progeria for short, often die of heart failure, heart attack or stroke as teenagers. Most children with the disorder die before they reach age 15. The newly approved drug, called Zokinvy, is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome-and-some-progeroid-laminopathies">the first and only approved treatment for progeria</a> and certain related syndromes, the FDA announced November 20.</p>



<p>In clinical trials of 62 children receiving the drug, Zokinvy increased life span by about 3 months on average during the first three years of treatment, compared with another 81 kids who did not take the drug from a separate study that collected their health data. Following children who continued to receive Zokinvy for up to 11 years showed that, on average, kids’ life spans were lengthened by about 2.5 years.</p>



<p>“This is not a cure,” cautions Monica Kleinman, a pediatric critical care doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital who was involved with the clinical trials. “We’ve hopefully extended the life span that [the children] have by slowing the pace of the disease,” but, she says, the drug doesn’t give kids a normal length of life.</p>





<p>An estimated 350 to 400 kids across the world have progeria. For these children, a single mutation in their genetic code <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rare-disease-sets-moms-research-agenda">upends their health</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/13</em>). That mutation interferes with the gene responsible for making the protein lamin A, which helps hold cells’ nuclei together. Children with progeria end up with higher amounts of a defective protein called progerin, which is similar to lamin A but with an extra piece attached. This protein gets stuck in cells’ membranes and can’t be recycled for fresh proteins, causing the cells to prematurely age and making blood vessels and connective tissue stiffer, Kleinman says.   </p>



<p>Everyone makes some progerin, and the body makes more as it gets older, Kleinman explains, but “children with progeria make a huge amount.” Children typically appear normal at birth, but start to show signs of the illness in their first two years of life. Over their lives, these kids experience loss of hair and body fat, joint stiffness, cardiovascular disease and other symptoms of accelerated aging.</p>



<p>Zokinvy, made by the company Eiger BioPharmaceuticals of Palo Alto, Calif., blocks some of that progerin production, lowering the amount that accumulates in kids’ cells. But the oral drug, taken as capsules, doesn’t fully block production, she says, and the amount that patients can receive is limited by the drug’s side effects, which include vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue.</p>



<p>The drug is a “testament to the power of basic research,” says Tom Misteli, a cell biologist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md, who was not involved with work on the drug. Zokinvy builds on decades of research on many aspects of the lamin A protein, including the “seemingly esoteric chemical modification” that forms progerin, he says.</p>



<p>“Nobody studying this protein or the modification could have expected it to become a drug target,” Misteli adds. But once the disease-causing gene was identified, researchers zeroed in on the class of drugs that includes Zokinvy as potential treatments.</p>



<p>With the new drug approval, the focus is now to test additional drugs or therapeutics in combination with Zokinvy, Misteli says. That could help lengthen the lives of children with progeria even further. Researchers are also investigating gene therapy approaches, with the goal of fixing the mutation that causes the debilitating illness. </p>

The OAPEN Foundation is delighted to announce that Niels Stern has been appointed as Director of OAPEN Foundation. Niels will take over from Eelco Ferwerda on the 1st of January, as Eelco will retire at the end of this year. Niels will also join Pierre Mounier as a member of the Executive Board of DOAB Foundation. And at the same time, Ronald Snijder will be appointed as Deputy Director of OAPEN.

 

The appointment comes at an exciting time for OAPEN, ten years after the launch of OAPEN Foundation and a few months after the launch of our newest resource, the OAPEN OA Books Toolkit. At the same time, we are migrating DOAB to an open source platform as part of the ongoing OPERAS-P project. And last but not least, OAPEN and DOAB were jointly deemed essential open science services by SCOSS, the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services, and are seeking support from the open science community in the current SCOSS funding cycle.

On behalf of the Board of the OAPEN Foundation, chairman Bas Savenije said: “In the past 10 years Eelco Ferwerda has successfully transformed OAPEN from a project to an organisation which is recognised internationally as an important player in open access book publishing. Important steps towards a sustainable organisation have been made and we are confident that Niels Stern is the right person to continue Eelco’s work and to shape the future development of OAPEN. The Board thanks Eelco for his accomplishments and we wish him the very best.”

“I feel very privileged to continue the great work that Eelco Ferwerda and his team have delivered for a decade now,” said Niels Stern. “OAPEN and DOAB are key services for scholarly open access book publishing. The number of books and their usage on the new platform is increasing rapidly, and both OAPEN and DOAB are deeply engaged in many exciting projects and networks, e.g. the OPERAS network. The momentum for OA books is rising. Being part of the SCOSS campaign adds to this momentum for OAPEN and DOAB. I look very much forward to contributing to the further development of OAPEN and DOAB to the benefit of the community for scholarly book publishing.”

Eelco Ferwerda said: “I have been very fortunate to have had a role in the development of OAPEN and DOAB and it has been a joy to work with so many people from all over the world with a passion for open access. I am thrilled that Niels is taking over and can’t imagine anyone better suited to lead OAPEN and DOAB in the years ahead. Although I am now retiring, I do hope to remain involved in OAPEN and DOAB in new ways, and do new things in the area of OA books.”

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>You scrape off the panels on a lottery scratch card… and you’re a winner! Brain imaging would show a burst of activity in a region called the nucleus accumbens, in the ventral striatum, a region known to code the impact of reward-related stimuli, such as getting money. But how the brain handles so-called vicarious joy — the type you might feel if you scraped winning panels from a relative’s scratch card, or even a stranger’s — is not well understood. Now a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-020-00839-9">new study</a>, published in <em>Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioural Neuroscience</em>, shows that while there are similarities, there are also some important differences. Notably, the participants’ brains responded differently when they won money for their mother versus their father.</p>



<span id="more-40903"></span>



<p>Philip Bradner at Erasmus University in the Netherlands led the study of 30 mostly undergraduate students, with an average age of 22. They all had a mother and a father as their parents, and none had a history of mental health issues. (In fact, they were deliberately chosen to be similar, to make for a more homogenous sample.)</p>



<p>While in an fMRI scanner, the participants played a simple game in which they, or one other person, could win money. In each trial, this other “player” was identified as either their mother, father, or simply as a “stranger”. All the participants had to do was click a button to choose which of two animated curtains to open. This revealed a small win for themselves and/or the other person. (And any money won for themselves or their mother or father was passed on.) After this, the participants rated how emotionally close they felt to their mother, father and to strangers, in general. They also reported on how much they liked winning for themselves, or for each parent or a stranger.</p>



<p>As expected from earlier research, when a participant won money for themselves, Bradner and his colleagues saw increased activity in the nucleus accumbens. But they also discovered greater activation in the nucleus accumbens when the participants won money for their mother or father, compared to when they won money for a stranger. The participants also reported “liking” winning for both parents more than for a stranger. This suggests that the nucleus accumbens is involved in feeling both direct, personal joy and also vicarious joy.</p>



<p>However, the participants’ brain responses also showed some differences depending on whether the other player was identified as their father or mother. When they won money for their father (but not their mother), other regions of the brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus, became more active.</p>



<p>These regions seem, then, to be important for processing vicarious joy for fathers. They are also known to be important for representing “self” vs “other” — for distinguishing between what we are experiencing directly, versus what someone else is experiencing, for example. It’s possible, then, that winning for fathers triggers stronger self/other comparisons than winning for mothers, the team writes. For these young people, at least, it seems that their mother was more integrated with their “self” representation.</p>



<p>This theory was supported by the additional finding that when participants won money for themselves and their father won nothing, there was less activation in the nucleus accumbens compared with when they won money and their mother didn’t. If winning against a father triggers greater self/other comparisons, then participants may process this win as a gain only for themselves, and as a relative “loss” for their father — but when the mother is the other player, winning might be a more straightforward, unmitigated joy.</p>



<p>The study does have various limitations. For one, because the participants were deliberately chosen to be similar, it’s not clear whether the results would hold for other groups of people, such as those with same-sex parents or from single parent households. It would also be interesting to explores effects in children of less well-adjusted families, who may feel less close to their parents, and may not experience vicarious joy in the same way. But the finding of differences in how the participants’ brains responded to rewards for fathers versus mothers is certainly interesting. If it isn’t driven by differences in emotional closeness, which it doesn’t seem to be, what, exactly, does drive it? Only further research will tell. As the team concludes, “An intriguing question for future research concerns the divergence in neural processing between mothers and fathers.”</p>

<p>Steven Miller is a math professor at <a href="https://www.williams.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Williams College</a> who specializes in number theory and theoretical probability theory. A few days ago he published a “<a href="https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/Miller_DeclarationAndAnalyisPA_GOP_BallotRequestData_2020_Final.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">declaration</a>” in which he performs an “analysis” of phone bank data of registered Republicans in Pennsylvania. The data was provided to him by Matt Braynyard, who led  Trump’s data team during the 2016. Miller frames his “analysis” as an attempt to “estimate the number of fraudulent ballots in Pennsylvania”, and his analysis of the data leads him to conclude that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“almost surely…the number of ballots requested by someone other than the registered Republican is between 37,001 and 58,914, and almost surely the number of ballots requested by registered Republicans and returned but not counted is in the range from 38,910 to 56,483.”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>A review of Miller’s “analysis” leads me to conclude that his estimates are fundamentally flawed and that the data as presented provide no evidence of voter fraud.</strong></p>



<p>This conclusion is easy to arrive at. The declaration claims (without a reference) that there were 165,412 mail-in ballots requested by registered Republicans in PA, but that “had not arrived to be counted” as of November 16th, 2020. The data Miller analyzed was based on an attempt to call some of these registered Republicans by phone to assess what happened to their ballots. The number of phone calls made, according to the declaration, is 23,184 = 17,000 + 3,500 + 2,684. The number 17,000 consists of phone calls that did not provide information either because an answering machine picked up instead of a person, or a person picked up and summarily hung up. 3,500 numbers were characterized as “bad numbers / language barrier”, and 2,684 individuals answered the phone. Curiously, Miller writes that “Almost 20,000 people were called”, when <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm#Writingapaper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">in fact</a> 23,184 &gt; 20,000.  </p>



<p>In any case, clearly many of the phone numbers dialed were simply wrong numbers, as evident by the number of “bad” calls: 3,500. It’s easy to imagine how this can happen:  confusion because some individuals share a name, phone numbers have changed, people move, the phone call bank makes an error when dialing etc. Let <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> be the fraction of phone numbers out of the 23,184 that were “bad”, i.e. incorrect. We can estimate <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> by noting that we have some information about it: we know that the 3,500 “bad numbers” were bad (by definition). Additionally, it is reported in the declaration that 556 people literally said that they did not request a ballot, and there is no reason not to take them at their word. We don’t know what fraction of the 17,000 individuals called and did not pick up or hung up were wrong numbers, but we do know that the fraction out of the total must equal the fraction out of the 17,000 + those we know for sure were bad numbers, i.e.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="23184 \cdot b = 17,000 \cdot b + 556 + 3500" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=23184+%5Ccdot+b+%3D+17%2C000+%5Ccdot+b+%2B+556+%2B+3500&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="23184 \cdot b = 17,000 \cdot b + 556 + 3500" />. </p>



<p>Solving for <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> we find that <img alt="b \approx \frac{2}{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b \approx \frac{2}{3}" />. I’m surprised the number is so <em>low</em>. One would expect that individuals who requested ballots, but then didn’t send them in, would be enriched for people who have recently moved or are in the process of moving, or have other issues making it difficult to reach them or impossible to reach them at all. </p>



<p>The fraction of bad calls derived translates to about 1,700 bad numbers out of the 2,684 people that were reached. This easily explains not only the 556 individuals who said they did not request a ballot, but also the 463 individuals who said that they mailed back their ballots. In the case of the latter there is no irregularity; the number of bad calls suggests that all those individuals were reached in error and their ballots were legitimately counted so they weren’t part of the 165,412. It also explains the 544 individuals who said they voted in person.</p>



<p>That’s it. The data don’t point to any fraud or irregularity, just a poorly design poll with poor response rates and lots of erroneous information due to bad phone numbers. There is nothing to explain. Miller, on the other hand, has some things to explain.</p>



<p>First, I note that his declaration begins with a signed page asserting various facts about Steven Miller and the analysis he performed. Notably absent from the page, or anywhere else in the document, is a disclosure of funding source for the work and of conflicts of interest. On his <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm#Writingapaper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">work webpage</a>, Miller specifically states that one should <strong>always acknowledge funding support</strong>.</p>



<p>Second, if Miller <em>really</em> wanted to understand the reason why some ballots were requested for mail-in, but had not yet arrived to be counted, he would also obtain data from Democrats. That would provide a control on various aspects of the analysis, and help to establish whether irregularities, if they were to be detected, were of a partisan nature. Why did Miller not include an analysis of such data?</p>



<p>Third, one might wonder why Steven Miller chose to publish this “declaration”. Surely a professor who has taught probability and statistics for 15 years (as Miller claims he has) must understand that his own “analysis” is fundamentally flawed, right? Then again, I’ve previously found that excellent pure mathematicians are prone to falling into a data analysis trap, i.e. a situation where their lack of experience analyzing real-world datasets leads them to believe naïve analysis that is deeply flawed. To better understand whether this might be the case with Miller, I examined his publication record, which he has shared publicly via <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5B8RWrkAAAAJ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5B8RWrkAAAAJ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Scholar, to see whether he has worked with data. The first thing I noticed </a>was that he has published more than 700 articles (!) and has an h-index of 47 for a total of 8,634 citations… an incredible record for any professor, and especially for a mathematician. A Google search for his name displays this impressive number of citations: </p>

<p>As it turns out, his impressive publication record  is a mirage. When I took a closer look and found that many of the papers he lists on his Google Scholar page are not his, but rather articles published by other authors with the name S Miller. <strong>“His” most cited article was published in 1955, a year that transpired well before he was born.</strong> Miller’s own most cited paper is a short unpublished tutorial on least squares (I was curious and reviewed it as well only to find some inaccuracies but hey, I don’t work for this guy).</p>



<p>I will note that in creating his Google Scholar page, Miller did not just enter his name and email address (required). He went to the effort of customizing the page, including the addition of keywords and a link to his homepage, and in doing so followed his own <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">general advice </a>to curate one’s CV (strangely, he also dispenses advice on job interviews, including about shaving- I guess only women interview for jobs?). But I digress: the question is, why is his Google Scholar page display massively inflated publication statistics based on papers that are not his? <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/11/18/how-many-doubly-manlocked-scientists-are-there/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">I’ve seen this before</a>, and in one case where I had hard evidence that it was done deliberately to mislead I reported it as fraud.  Regardless of Miller’s motivations, by looking at his actual publications I confirmed what I suspected, namely that he has hardly any experience analyzing real world data. I’m willing to chalk up his embarrassing “declaration” to statistics illiteracy and naïveté.</p>



<p>In summary, Steven Miller’s declaration provides no evidence whatsoever of voter fraud in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Type the word “hacker” into any stock photo search engine and you’ll be greeted with <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search/hacker?image_type=photo">pages</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/images/search/hacker/">pages</a> of images of someone sitting in the dark, typing threateningly at their laptop, and more often than not wearing a balaclava or Guy Fawkes mask. That <em>Matrix</em>-inspired 1990s aesthetic of green code on black is still prevalent — and still implies that hackers have inherently nefarious ends.</p>



<p>More recently, however, the idea of hacking as a prosocial activity has gained more attention. Earlier this year, one group of hackers made headlines for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54591761">donating</a> $10,000 in Bitcoin to two charities, the result of what they say was the extortion of millions of dollars from multinational companies.</p>



<p>While the charities declined the donations, social media responses were more mixed, with some praising the hackers. And in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430220937777">new study</a>, Maria S. Heering and colleagues from the University of Kent argue that our view of hacking <em>is</em> somewhat malleable: when people were treated unfairly and the institutions responsible did nothing to redress their grievances, they felt more positive about hackers who targeted the source of their anger.</p>



<span id="more-40879"></span>



<p>In the first study, 259 participants were asked to imagine themselves taking an exam which was crucial to their future career prospects. The questions in the exam, they were told, were vague and unrelated to the content they’d been taught — and when looking at the transcript after the exam, they found they had been marked unfairly. Participants were then asked to imagine taking their grievance to the university with several classmates.</p>



<p>Following this introductory scenario, participants were split into two groups and given different information about how responsive the university was (these kinds of beliefs about the responsiveness of an institution are known as “external efficacy”). Half of the participants read that the university system was unresponsive to their requests (low external efficacy); the others read that the university <em>was</em> willing to address their complaints (high external efficacy).</p>



<p>Participants then completed measures related to their anger against the system (e.g. “I am furious about the way in which the exam office handled my complaint”) before reading that the university had been targeted by hackers, who left the message “learn to do your job” on the institution’s homepage.</p>



<p>Finally, participants indicated how much they agreed with statements related to the hackers’ legitimacy, whether or not the hackers deserve respect and admiration, and how positive or negative they felt the hackers’ actions were for both the university and democracy more generally.</p>



<p>As expected, participants who read that the university had been unresponsive to their unfair treatment felt more anger towards the system; in turn, this anger led to stronger feelings that hackers’ actions were legitimate.</p>



<p>A second study replicated the first, only this time participants were told that a researcher had rejected the work they had submitted on an academic survey platform. In the low external efficacy condition, the site did not help participants who felt their work had been unfairly rejected, and in the high external efficacy condition participants received support and were told a new system would be put in place to query rejected work. All participants again read that hackers had targeted the platform and left the same “learn to do your job” message.</p>



<p>As in the first study, participants felt more anger against the platform in the low external efficacy condition — and again, this anger positively predicted how legitimate they perceived the hacking to be.</p>



<p>On a small scale, it may seem obvious that if someone attacks a system or institution you feel has wronged you, you’re likely to be supportive of them. But the results also prompt interesting questions about wider society. The team notes that the key factor determining legitimisation of hackers is an unmet demand for fairer social arrangements — an issue that comes to the fore time and time again on both big and small scales. During lockdown, for example, much attention has been paid to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/american-billionaires-got-434-billion-richer-during-the-pandemic.html">increase in wealth</a> of a few very rich individuals whilst others around the world struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>In cases of wider societal unfairness, therefore, our views of those who disrupt that uneven power imbalance may become more and positive. In an age where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/29/why-we-stopped-trusting-elites-the-new-populism">trust appears to have been eroded</a> precisely because people feel their demands are not being met, it’s worth exploring these issues in more detail.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Video games get blamed for a lot. There are long-standing debates about whether violence in video games leads to real-world aggression, or whether video game “addiction” is something we should worry about. And some people have broader fears that more time spent on screens negatively affects our mental health and wellbeing.</p>



<p>However, an <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/">increasing</a> <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/video-game-addiction-facts-statistics">number</a> of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/">studies</a> have failed to find much evidence to back up these kinds of concerns. But the field suffers from some pretty big limitations. In particular, studies often rely on people reporting their own time spent consuming media — and we’re notoriously unreliable at making those sorts of estimates.</p>



<p>Enter a new study from Niklas Johannes and colleagues at the Oxford Internet Institute, published as a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/qrjza/">preprint on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a><em> </em>earlier this week. The researchers find that more time spent playing video games actually relates to <em>greater</em> wellbeing (though there are plenty of caveats to that finding — more on those later). But the most interesting part of the study is really its methodology: rather than relying on people reporting their own video game use, the researchers established a rare collaboration with games companies in order to get precise data.</p>



<span id="more-40867"></span>



<p>Two companies, Electronic Arts and Nintendo, provided the team with data from players of <em>Plants vs Zombies:</em> <em>Battle for Neighborville </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>respectively. The companies sent out surveys to hundreds of thousands of adult players; these included a wellbeing measure, in which participants rated how often they’d experienced six positive and six negative feelings in the past two weeks. Crucially, the companies also provided data on the number and length of the players’ gaming sessions during those two weeks. </p>



<p>Only a fraction of people responded, ultimately leaving the team with data from 471 <em>Plants vs Zombies</em> players and 2,756 <em>Animal Crossing </em>players. And they found that, overall, the more time people spent playing over that two week period, the greater their wellbeing tended to be. It’s worth noting that although significant, this effect was small: even a large increase in time spent playing was related to a very modest increase in wellbeing. Importantly, the data also showed that people weren’t great at estimating how long they had spent playing over the two week period — their estimates were off by about two hours, highlighting the problems of relying just on self-report data.</p>



<p>The results, then, cast further doubt on the idea that spending more time playing video games is detrimental to our mental health. In fact, the study suggests that there is some kind of link between playing video games for longer and <em>greater</em> wellbeing. This is clearly noteworthy, as so much of the discussion around video games (and screen time generally) just assumes that limiting the time spent playing is a good thing, without acknowledging that it could potentially have detrimental effects.</p>



<p>But, inevitably, over the past few days we’ve seen a lot of headlines proclaiming that video games are “good for wellbeing” or “benefit mental health”. That may well be true. But it’s not really possible to make those kinds of claims from the study’s correlational data. Perhaps people who are happier play video games for longer. Or maybe it’s something else entirely that both leads people to play video games for longer and boosts wellbeing (having the luxury of free time, for example). And even if there <em>is</em> a causal link, it’s not clear that it would be a meaningful one, given that the size of the effect was so small.</p>



<p>There are other limitations too. The data comes from the small group of people who chose to complete the survey, all of whom were over 18. So the study can’t necessarily say much about potential effects among the broader population, particularly young people. And it remains to be seen whether time spent playing other kinds of games relates to similar changes in wellbeing.</p>



<p>It’s important to point out that the authors do go to lengths to explain these limitations in the paper. But it feels like the nuances have been brushed over in much of the media coverage.</p>



<p>Still, none of this should detract from the most interesting and exciting part of the study: the fact that the researchers have collaborated with industry and obtained real data on people’s playing habits. The lack of access to data from media companies has long been a major obstacle to this kind of work, as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">Amy Orben told us earlier this year</a>. Perhaps this study will pave the way for further collaboration. Indeed, the researchers call on companies to share data from other games and audiences, and across longer time-scales. Hopefully this kind of data will help to answer some of the intriguing questions that the study poses.   </p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Shavika Rastogi will talk about her master thesis entitled "Prediction of Electrode Position inside rat brain using Neuromorphic Hardware".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Neural probes with large number of close packed recording sites each comprising
of 32 electrodes are being developed for large scale neuronal recordings from
multiple brain areas simultaneously to understand complex brain activity in vivo.
By precisely mapping the position of each site inside rat brain, they help us to
characterize neural activity on the basis of cortical depth from where it is
obtained. Their application lies in neurosurgery, where it is important to locate
the target of surgical interest inside the brain in real time. In this work, we
have first compared various methods from literature to analyze extracellular
activity recorded using CMOS neural probes from different cortical depths and
from different locations along same lateral axis of rat brain to find a criterion
on the basis of which recordings can be classified. After finding out the most
promising criterion, we have tried to implement it on neuromorphic hardware
SpiNNaker. We tested single neuron and spiking excitatory-inhibitory network
for implementation and found that excitatory-inhibitory network is more robust to
noise present in signal and its output can be improved by introducing lateral
inhibition. Our results show that SpiNNaker can be used for rough indication of
cortical depth.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/democracy-5278455_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Against a backdrop of the vote to leave the European Union, hostility towards migrants, and the growth in right-wing nationalist movements, racial discrimination is sadly on the rise in the UK. There is evidence that experiencing racial discrimination can negatively impact health. However, the majority of studies to date have been carried out in the US. The makeup of ethnic minority groups in the UK differs to that in the US, with those of South Asian backgrounds forming the largest minority group. Therefore, it is important to understand the extent to which racial discrimination impacts health in the UK-context.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09792-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our study</a> looked at over 4800 people who took part in the UK Household Longitudinal Study over a period of two years. One in five participants from an ethnic minority group reported racial discrimination (which included feeling unsafe, avoiding certain places, being insulted and being physically attacked). We found that these individuals were more likely to develop poorer mental and physical health after these experiences. Specifically, we found that perceived racial discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress and poorer mental functioning two-years later. Moreover, people who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up, regardless of their health at the time of the discriminatory experience.</p>
<p>The study builds upon previous research which has mostly measured racial discrimination and health at the same time, meaning that establishing the direction of the relationship is difficult. Here we show that the experience of racial discrimination precedes the development of poorer health. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984732/">One previous study</a> linked racial discrimination with a deterioration in mental health in a UK sample. Our findings build upon this evidence and show that the negative effects of racial discrimination extend to physical health also.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors</p></blockquote>
<p>But how can experiencing racial discrimination lead to serious health outcomes? At the individual level, our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors (e.g. excessive alcohol intake) that can lead to poor health. Feeling discriminated against might also mean that people avoid engaging with health or well-being services perceived to be discriminatory. At the broader structural level, racial discrimination might negatively impact health through inequalities in healthcare and the unfair distribution of social determinants of health such as education, employment, and housing.</p>
<p>The issue of racial discrimination is one that has garnered increasing attention, particularly this year in the wake of the Black Lives Matters protests. The results of our study are concerning suggesting an enduring impact of experiences of racism on mental and physical health. They highlight the need to tackle racial discrimination – not only as a human rights issue, but as an issue that may also have a lasting legacy on health. We need to educate, raise awareness, and promote activism to bring about legislative and social change required to eliminate racial discrimination both in the UK and worldwide. We also need to target the structural macro-level forces that shape the position of ethnic minorities in society. More research is needed to understand the pathways linking racial discrimination and health in order to develop interventions and policy that can be used to tackle socio-political processes that promote racial discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recently published</a> pilot study on the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol) in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, concluded that the treatment “seems able to reduce the severity of disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required go show a definitive answer”. In a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638v1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">follow-up</a> paper, Jungreis and <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-manolis-kellis/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kellis</a> re-examine this so-called “Córdoba study” and argue that the authors of the study have undersold their results. Based on a reanalysis of the data in a manner they describe as “rigorous” and using “well established statistical techniques”, they urge the medical community to “consider testing the vitamin D levels of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and taking remedial action for those who are deficient.” Their recommendation is based on two claims: in an examination of unevenness in the distribution of one of the comorbidities between cases and controls, they conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”, and they present a “mathematical theorem” to make the case that the effect size in the Córdoba study is significant to the extent that “they can be confident that if assignment to the treatment group had no effect, we would not have observed these results simply due to chance.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the “mathematical analysis” of Jungreis and Kellis is deeply flawed, and their “theorem” is vacuous. Their analysis cannot be used to conclude that the Córdoba study shows that calcifediol significantly reduces ICU admission of hospitalized COVID- 19 patients. Moreover, the Córdoba study is fundamentally flawed, and therefore there is nothing to learn from it.</p>



<p><strong>The Córdoba study</strong></p>



<p>The Córdoba study, described by the authors as a pilot, was ostensibly a randomized controlled trial, designed to determine the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study consisted of 76 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms, with 50 of the patients treated with calcifediol, and 26 not receiving treatment. Patients were administered “standard care”, which according to the authors consisted of “a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and for patients with pneumonia and NEWS score 5, a broad spectrum antibiotic”. Crucially, admission to the ICU was determined by a “Selection Committee” consisting of intensivists, pulmonologists, internists, and members of an ethics committee. The Selection Committee based ICU admission decisions on the evaluation of several criteria, including presence of comorbidities, and the level of dependence of patients according to their needs and clinical criteria.</p>



<p>The result of the Córdoba trial was that only 1/50 of the treated patients was admitted to the ICU, whereas 13/26 of the untreated patients were admitted (p-value = 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> by Fisher’s exact test). This is a minuscule p-value but it is meaningless. Since there is no record of the Selection Committee deliberations, it impossible to know whether the ICU admission of the 13 untreated patients was due to their previous high blood pressure comorbidity. Perhaps the 11 treated patients with the comorbidity were not admitted to the ICU because they were older, and the Selection Committee considered their previous higher blood pressure to be more “normal” (14/50 treatment patients were over the age of 60, versus only 5/26 of the untreated patients).</p>

<p>Figure 1: Table 2 from [1] showing the comorbidities of patients. It is reproduced by virtue of [1] being published open access under the CC-BY license.</p>



<p>The fact that admission to the ICU could be decided in part based on the presence of co-morbidities, and that there was a significant imbalance in one of the comorbidities, immediately renders the study results meaningless. There are several other problems with it that potentially confound the results: the study did not examine the Vitamin D levels of the treated patients, nor was the untreated group administered a placebo. Most importantly, the study numbers were tiny, with only 76 patients examined. Small studies are notoriously problematic, and are known to produce large effect sizes [9]. Furthermore, sloppiness in the study does not lead to confidence in the results. The authors state that the “rigorous protocol” for determining patient admission to the ICU is available as Supplementary Material, but there is no Supplementary Material distributed with the paper. There is also an embarrassing typo: Fisher’s exact test is referred to twice as “Fischer’s test”. To err once in describing this classical statistical test may be regarded as misfortune; to do it twice looks like carelessness.</p>



<p><strong>A pointless statistics exercise</strong></p>



<p>The Córdoba study has not received much attention, which is not surprising considering that by the authors’ own admission it was a pilot that at best only motivates a properly matched and powered randomized controlled trial. Indeed, the authors mention that such a trial (the COVIDIOL trial), with data being collected from 15 hospitals in Spain, is underway. Nevertheless, Jungreis and Kellis [3], apparently mesmerized by the 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> p-value for ICU admission upon treatment, felt the need to “rescue” the study with what amounts to faux statistical gravitas. They argue for immediate consideration of testing Vitamin D levels of hospitalized patients, so that “deficient” patients can be administered some form of Vitamin D “to the extent it can be done safely”. Their message has been noticed; only a few days after [3] appeared the authors’ tweet to promote it has been retweeted more than 50 times [8].</p>



<p>Jungreis and Kellis claim that the p-value for the effect of calcifediol on patients is so significant, that in and of itself it merits belief that administration of calcifediol does, in fact, prevent admission of patients to ICUs. To make their case, Jungreis and Kellis begin by acknowledging that imbalance between the treated and untreated groups in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity may be a problem, but claim that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization.” Their argument is as follows: they note that while the p-value for the imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.0023, it should be adjusted for the fact that there are 15 distinct comorbidities, and that just by chance, when computing so many p-values, one might be small. First, an examination of Table 2 in [1] (Figure 1) shows that there were only 14 comorbidities assessed, as none of the patients had previous chronic kidney disease. Thus, the number 15 is incorrect. Second, Jungreis and Kellis argue that a Bonferroni correction should be applied, and that this correction should be based on 30 tests (=15 × 2). The reason for the factor of 2 is that they claim that when testing for imbalance, one should test for imbalance in both directions. By applying the Bonferroni correction to the p-values, they derive a “corrected” p-value for previous high blood pressure being imbalanced between groups of 0.069. They are wrong on several counts in deriving this number. To illustrate the problems we work through the calculation step-by-step:</p>



<p>The question we want to answer is as follows: given that there are multiple comorbidities, is there is a significant imbalance in <em>at least</em> one comorbidity. There are several ways to test for this, with the simplest being Šidák’s correction [10] given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%5Cquad+%3D+%5Cquad+1-%281-m%29%5En%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n," /></p>



<p>where <em>m</em> is the minimum p-value among the comorbidities, and <em>n</em> is the number of tests. Plugging in <em>m = 0.0023</em> (the smallest p-value in Table 2 of [1]) and <em>n = 14</em> (the number of comorbidities) one gets 0.032 (note that the Bonferroni correction used by Jungreis And Kellis is the Taylor approximation to the Šidák correction when <em>m</em> is small). The Šidák correction is based on an assumption that the tests are independent. However, that is certainly not the case in the Córdoba study. For example, having at least one prognostic factor is one of the comorbidities tabulated. In other words, the p-value obtained is conservative. The calculation above uses n = 14, but Jungreis and Kellis reason that the number of tests is 30 = 15 × 2, to take into account an imbalance in either the treated or untreated direction. Here they are assuming two things: that two-sided tests for each comorbidity will produce double the p-value of a one-sided test, and that two sided tests are the “correct” tests to perform. They are wrong on both counts. First, the two-sided Fisher exact test does not, in general produce a p-value that is double the 1-sided test. The study result is a good example: 1/49 treated patients admitted to the ICU vs. 13/26 untreated patients produces a p-value of 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> for both the 1-sided and 2-sided tests. Jungreis and Kellis do not seem to know this can happen, nor understand why; they go to great lengths to explain the importance of conducting a 1-sided test for the study result. Second, there is a strong case to be made that a 1-sided test is the correct test to perform for the comorbidities. The concern is not whether there was an imbalance of any sort, but whether the imbalance would skew results by virtue of the study including too many untreated individuals with comorbidities. In any case, if one were to give Jungreis and Kellis the benefit of the doubt, and perform a two sided test, the corrected p-value for the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.06 and not 0.069.</p>



<p>The most serious mistake that Jungreis and Kellis make, however, is in claiming that one can accept the null hypothesis of a hypothesis test when the p-value is greater than 0.05. The p-value they obtain is 0.069 which, even if it is taken at face value, is not grounds for claiming, as Jungreis and Kellis do, that “this is not significant evidence that the assignment was not random” and reason to conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”. That is not how p-values work. A p-value less than 0.05 allows one to reject the null hypothesis (assuming 0.05 is the threshold chosen), but a p-value above the chosen threshold is not grounds for accepting the null. Moreover, the corrected p-value is 0.032 which is certainly grounds for rejecting the null hypothesis that the randomization was random.</p>



<p>Correction of the incorrect Jungreis and Kellis statistics may be a productive exercise in introductory undergraduate statistics for some, but it is pointless insofar as assessing the Córdoba study. While the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is problematic because patients with the comorbidity may be more likely to get sick and require ICU admission, the study was so flawed that the exact p-value for the imbalance is a moot point. Given that the presence of comorbidities, not just their effect on patients, was a factor in determining which patients were admitted to the ICU, the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity renders the result of the study meaningless <em>ex facie</em>.</p>



<p><strong>A definition is not a theorem is not proof of efficacy</strong></p>



<p>In an effort to fend off criticism that the comorbidities of patients were improperly balanced in the study, Jungreis and Kellis go further and present a “theorem” they claim shows that there was a minuscule chance that an uneven distribution of comorbidities could render the study results not significant. The “theorem” is stated twice in their paper, and I’ve copied both theorem statements verbatim from their paper:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> <em>In a randomized study, let p be the p-value of the study results, and let q be the probability that the randomization assigns patients to the control group in such a way that the values of P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient) are sufficiently unevenly distributed between the treatment and control groups that the result of the study would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level after p controlling for the prognostic risk factors. Then <img alt="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" />.</em></p>



<p>According to Jungreis and Kellis, <em>P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient)</em> is the following: “There can be any number of prognostic risk factors, but if we knew what all of them were, and their effect sizes, and the interactions among them, we could combine their effects into a single number for each patient, which is the probability, based on all known and yet-to-be discovered risk factors at the time of hospital admission, that the patient will require ICU care if not given the calcifediol treatment. Call this (unknown) probability <em>P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient)</em>.”</p>



<p>The theorem is restated in the Methods section of Jungreis and Kellis paper as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> <em>In a randomized controlled study, let p be the p-value of the study outcome, and let q be the probability that the randomization distributes all prognostic risk factors combined sufficiently unevenly between the treatment and control groups that when controlling for these prognostic risk p factors the outcome would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level. Then <img alt="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" />.</em></p>



<p>While it is difficult to decipher the language the “theorem” is written in, let alone its meaning (note Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are supposedly the same theorem), I was able to glean something about its content from reading the “proof”. The mathematical content of whatever the theorem is supposed to mean, is the definition of conditional probability, namely that if A and B are events with <img alt="P(B) &gt; 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%29+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(B) &gt; 0" />, then</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="P(A|B) \quad := \quad \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cquad+%3A%3D+%5Cquad+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A+%5Ccap+B%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(A|B) \quad := \quad \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}" />.</p>



<p>To be fair to Jungreis and Kellis, the “theorem” includes the observation that </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A+%5Ccap+B%29+%5Cleq+P%28A%29+%5Cquad+%5CRightarrow+%5Cquad+P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}." /></p>



<p>This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a “theorem”; it is literally the definition of conditional probability followed by an elementary inequality. The most generous interpretation of what Jungreis and Kellis were trying to do with this “theorem”, is that they were showing that the p-value for the study is so small, that it is small even after being multiplied by 20. There are less generous interpretations.</p>



<p><strong>Does Vitamin D intake reduce ICU admission?</strong></p>



<p>There has been a lot of interest in Vitamin D and its effects on human health over the past decade [2], and much speculation about its relevance for COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. One interesting result on disease susceptibility was published recently: in a study of 489 patients, it was found that the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status [7]. However, definitive results on Vitamin D and its relationship to COVID- 19 will have to await larger trials. One such trial, a large randomized clinical trial with 2,700 individuals sponsored by Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is currently underway [4]. While this study might shed some light on Vitamin D and COVID-19, it is prudent to keep in mind that the outcome is not certain. Vitamin D levels are confounded with many socioeconomic factors, making the identification of causal links difficult. In the meantime, it has been suggested that it makes sense for individuals to maintain reference nutrient intakes of Vitamin D [6]. Such a public health recommendation is not controversial.</p>



<p>As for Vitamin D administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients reducing ICU admission, the best one can say about the Córdoba study is that nothing can be learned from it. Unfortunately, the poor study design, small sample size, availability of only summary statistics for the comorbidities, and imbalanced comorbidities among treated and untreated patients render the data useless. While it may be true that calcifediol administration to hospital patients reduces subsequent ICU admission, it may also not be true. Thus, the follow-up by Jungreis and Kellis is pointless at best. At worst, it is irresponsible propaganda, advocating for potentially dangerous treatment on the basis of shoddy arguments masked as “rigorous and well established statistical techniques”. It is surprising to see Jungreis and Kellis argue that it may be unethical to conduct a placebo randomized controlled trial, which is one of the most powerful tools in the development of safe and effective medical treatments. They write “the ethics of giving a placebo rather than treatment to a vitamin D deficient patient with this potentially fatal disease would need to be evaluated.” The evidence for such a policy is currently non-existent. On the other hand, there are plenty of known risks associated with excess Vitamin D [5].</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The controversial idea that there are universals in the ways we use music received a boost in 2018, with the finding that people from 60 different countries <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/01/musical-universals-people-can-identify-lullabies-and-dance-songs-from-other-cultures/">were pretty good at judging</a> whether a totally unfamiliar piece of music from another culture was intended to soothe a baby or to be danced to. Now, new research involving some of the same team has revealed that foreign lullabies that babies have never heard before work to relax them. </p>



<span id="more-40859"></span>



<p>Constance M. Bainbridge and Mila Bertolo from Harvard University led the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00963-z">new study</a>, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, on 144 babies with an average age of 7 months. After being fitted with sensors to monitor their heart rate and level of sweating, each baby sat in a high chair or recliner or on its parent’s lap while watching animated characters lip-synching to 14-second bursts of songs. These songs came from the Natural History of Song Discography, a collection of songs from around the world, and eight were used as lullabies in the societies in which they were selected. The rest were intended to express love, heal the sick or be danced to. All of the songs were sung by solo vocalists, without background music.</p>



<p>As well as looking at the heart rate and skin sweating data, the team used video of the babies’ faces to monitor their pupil size. If these measures decreased, this would indicate that the baby was relaxing.</p>



<p>Based on some of these measures, at least, the team found that babies did indeed seem more relaxed during the lullabies than the other songs. “While heart rates dropped almost immediately following the onset of singing, regardless of song type, this drop was more pronounced during the lullabies,” the team writes. Whether the baby was 2 or 14 months old, the effect was the same, suggesting that it couldn’t simply be the result of exposure to music with age. The team also found that the babies’ pupils were smaller during the lullabies than the other songs.</p>



<p>The sweating results were less clear cut, however. These levels increased over the course of the experiment, perhaps because the babies were becoming more bored and fussy, the researchers suggest. But while a baby listened to a lullaby, this increase was temporarily slowed.</p>



<p>What might explain these effects? The lullabies and the other songs certainly differed acoustically. The lullabies tended to be slower, and to have smaller pitch ranges and a less steady beat. As the researchers note, the earlier work on adults listening to unfamiliar songs found that the more a song was characterised by these specific features, the more confident a listener was that it was intended to be a lullaby. The team then compared these earlier adult ratings with their new results. And they found that the more that the adults had judged a song to be directed towards infants, the bigger the reduction in heart rate while the baby listened to it. “This result confirms that the acoustic effects of the songs drove the relaxation effects on them,” the team writes.</p>



<p>As they stress, the babies and their parents “were unfamiliar with the songs they heard, unfamiliar with the languages they were sung in and unfamiliar with the musical styles of the societies that originally produced the songs.” All the babies in the present study were American, but the researchers suspect that babies from other cultures would react in the same way. (In fact, they are now “eager to find out whether they do so”.)</p>



<p>The new work does open up some fascinating questions, such as: which of the acoustic features of lullabies are most important for the relaxation effect? And: do babies like lullabies more than other songs (or just find them more relaxing)? Also: what impact might lullabies have on a baby’s ongoing health? Numerous studies have found that music can help adults with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782778/">chronic pain</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500733/">depression</a>, for example. “Music may also play an everyday role in improving health in infants,” the researchers write, “a role it has taken on across cultures and across human history.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There’s no getting around the fact that climate change is an existential crisis of the highest order — but how best to communicate that threat is unclear. Too much pessimism and people become paralysed with anxiety, pushing thoughts about the crisis away altogether. Too much optimism, on the other hand, can lead to complacency — if things are going to be okay, why would we feel the need to engage with what’s going on?</p>



<p>It’s this tension that Brandi S. Morris and colleagues from Aarhus University explore in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00574-z">new study</a>, published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. </em>They suggest that climate change appeals with pessimistic endings could trigger higher engagement with the issue than those that end on an optimistic note.</p>



<span id="more-40853"></span>



<p>In the first study, 200 participants were presented with a transcript of a video about bees and climate change that had either an optimistic or pessimistic ending: in the optimistic condition, participants read that younger beekeepers were learning about and taking action on climate change, while in the pessimistic condition they read that bees were dying “at an alarming rate”. After this, they answered questions about their emotional response (e.g. how emotionally intense it had been to read the article), their beliefs in climate change (how much of a risk they feel it poses to human health), and their political ideology.</p>



<p>Participants in the pessimistic condition felt that climate change was more of a risk than those in the optimistic condition, and also reported higher emotional arousal. There was a direct link between the two: the team found that reading the pessimistic ending triggered greater emotional arousal, which in turn led to greater risk perception. A second study in which participants actually viewed the videos as well as reading the transcripts found a very similar pattern of results.</p>



<p>In both of these studies, people’s politics and worldview also played a part. Conservative participants reported lower levels of risk perception when their emotional arousal was low, as did people with a greater belief in individualism or hierarchy (as compared to collectivism or egalitarianism). But this also meant that emotional arousal triggered more of an increase in risk perception for these groups (compared to more liberal participants, whose risk perception was already high). </p>



<p>In the third and final study, 1,115 participants again saw optimistic and pessimistic materials. This time a third “fatalistic” condition was added, in which participants were told that a reduction in the bee population would mean the “world would crumble” in a mere four years (“No matter what we do about climate change, it’s too late to turn things around”).</p>



<p>After viewing this material, participants filled in the same risk perception and emotional arousal measures, and stated how much they agreed with the statement “I believe my actions have an influence on climate change”.</p>



<p>Participants in both the pessimistic and fatalistic conditions reported higher emotional arousal. And the higher the level of arousal, the more likely a participant was to believe they can make an impact. Political ideology and worldview had similar effects as in the previous studies: belief in ability to change things was particularly low at lower levels of emotional arousal in moderates and conservatives, but increased considerably as a result of increased emotional arousal.</p>



<p>These results suggest that pessimistic messages about climate change may actually boost people’s beliefs that it is a problem and that they can do something to combat it. However, they also imply that those who are creating these kinds of interventions need to think carefully about who they’re aiming to reach and how they intend to do it: if different groups respond differently to positive or negative messaging, then a selection of carefully targeted messages might be more successful than something broader and designed to appeal to everyone.</p>



<p>But ultimately, it’s important not to forget those parties who are <em>really</em> responsible for acting on climate change: governments and corporations. While individuals can of course make a difference, it’s the big polluters who really have to change — according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions"><em>Guardian </em>investigation</a>, just twenty fossil fuel companies are linked to a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. Figures like this make individual actions like turning off lights or recycling water bottles pale somewhat in comparison.</p>



<p>Designing successful interventions for climate action is key, and studies like this are an important part of making sure they work. But those designing them would do well to think about the limits of individual behaviour change — and who should really end up feeling responsible.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/11/16/can-science-be-musical/">Can science be musical?</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/DNA-music-notes-edited-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I recently wrote <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03760-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">an article</a> for BMC describing the use of sound to describe the function of the coronavirus genome. It was a perplexing article to write since I was toing and froing about science and art. I was writing a science article which had an art component to it. Was I creating a technical auditory display or was I creating something that was musical? I think I was actually doing both. I have since realised that I was adding an ‘A for Art’ into Science Technology Engineering and Maths to make STE(A)M. I made something that is both functional and creative. I thought if it didn’t sound good then people would not use it as a science tool.</p>
<p>Amongst other things I have been making audio by copying the way a biological cell makes proteins</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12158" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Temple, M.D. Real-time audio and visual display of the Coronavirus genome.

BMC Bioinformatics 21, 431 (2020)</div></figure>
<p>I also created an animated display which is synchronised to the audio. The animation scrolls the genomic sequence across the page as if it was interacting with proteins inside a human cell. I did this because I want the user to see the sequence pass by as you hear the audio. Our eyes are attracted to things that move and we naturally listen for patterns in what we hear. I thought the combination of the two would be greater than either in isolation. The music is never going to replace a well-designed (but silent) <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">genome browser</a> but an audio track that is synchronised to a visual browser may help interpret the complex genomic sequences.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM">https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM</a></p>
<p><strong>What is the music trying to say?</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion let’s assume that I have used the coronavirus genome to make instrumental music, since this is often what is assumed. So, the question now is, what is the music trying to say? If it were composed by a human it might say something about the human condition in response to the virus. But the music was composed by a computer algorithm from the genomic sequence and therefore it tells us something about the function of the genome. It tells us something about how the genome is used to make proteins (translation) and how it makes new copies of itself (transcription).</p>
<p><strong>Imagine you are inside a human cell.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the music, you need to imagine that you are inside a human cell, you are a machine (such as a ribosome complex) moving along the viral genomic RNA sequence and converting it into a protein sequence, like a train running down a track. The music of translation begins at a slow tempo whilst we listen to an untranslated region. As we run into a gene sequence, another instrument starts to play the sound of a new protein being made and the music picks tempo up. Occasionally the music pauses in silence as we pass a cleavage point in a coronavirus protein. Almost randomly, syncopated high pitched notes sound out as we pass important regions called stop codons. Conversely, the effect of a start codon may be heard for many minutes after the text sequence has scrolled off the screen. The sound of these and other genomic attributes gives a narrative to the music.</p>
<p>If we are to use colors, shapes and font styles to tell us something about the sequence, then why not use music to tell us this is a new way? The fact that music has a beginning, middle and end is important since this makes us think about the order of features in the genome and this is important to understand their function.</p>
<p><strong>Is the sound musical in its own right? </strong></p>
<p>For days after I submitted the manuscript for review I had the <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905">‘so c</a><a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905">alled music’</a> of the coronavirus genome in my head. I was wondering if other people would also consider it musical. Music can be inspiring, it should be creative and it can stir human emotion. In contrast, the sound of the coronavirus genome is minimal, repetitive and systematic. To make genomic data more musical I thought I should add some musicians into the mix. Literally!</p>
<p>A musician friend of mine (Mike Anderson) and I went into the music studio. We played the sound of the coronavirus genome very loudly over a big sound system. We set up drums and a loud guitar amp and we played along with the sequence. I made a simple recording of this and called it Coronacode music.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0">https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0</a></p>
<p>After producing Coronacode music it made me think more about generative music (from a computer) versus musical improvisation. When we played along to the code it restricted what we were able to play and this constraint was a source of creativity. It snapped us out of our usual musical patterns and made us play something new. The repeating nucleotides A, U, G and C combine with the repeating drum pattern of kick, snare, tom, kick! Long guitar tones soften the incessant pulse of the coronavirus.</p>
<p><strong>Growing up in public.</strong></p>
<p>This approach is new to me. I think the use of sound to convey patterns in scientific data (sonification) has not yet come of age. Anecdotally I would say there is still skepticism within the scientific community regarding the value of sound. However, since computer browsers are now more capable to process data into audio and visuals I think we will see more instances of its application. If the audio and visual displays are tightly coupled and work together in harmony, then I think it will not only sound good but it will be more informative.</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>A recent study finds political differences in how much stock people put in expert evidence versus personal experience. </strong>Liberals tend to see evidence from experts as more legitimate, while conservatives place more equal value on both, <a href="https://theconversation.com/conservatives-value-personal-stories-more-than-liberals-do-when-evaluating-scientific-evidence-149132">write the researchers Randy Stein, Alexander Swan and Michelle Sarraf</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.  This was true even though the scenarios in the study were completely apolitical, the team adds, suggesting that the findings pick up on fundamental differences in worldview between the two camps.</p>

<p><strong>Spitefulness can be antisocial and nasty — but does it also have benefits? </strong>At <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/08/is-it-ever-good-to-be-spiteful">Jamie Waters looks at</a> a new book on the “upside” of spite by Simon McCarthy-Jones.</p>

<p><strong>More this week on the effectiveness — or lack thereof — of unconscious bias training</strong>. Companies spend billions on such training every year, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unconscious-bias-diversity-fix">writes Allyssia Alleyne</a> at <em>Wired</em>, yet there’s little evidence that it works to change people’s behaviour. And worse, it can allow organisations to appear to be doing something to improve diversity and inclusion, while avoiding putting in the time and resources to achieve real change.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/638687634/0/oupblogpsychology/">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></h4>

<div><div><div><div><p><em>In the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/">first part</a> of </em>Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves <em>author Michael Bakan’s interview with his Chapter 7 musician co-author Graeme Gibson (who is on the spectrum) and Graeme’s parents, the renowned science fiction novelist William (Bill) Gibson and autism researcher Dr Deborah Gibson</em><em>,</em><strong> </strong><em>things left off with Bill telling Michael about how being Graeme’s dad had influenced his creation of “unnervingly human” AI (Artificial Intelligence) characters in his novels. Next in the conversation, Michael invited Bill to talk about the very significant influence of music generally—and specific musicians in particular—on his creative process as a writer. We pick up the conversation from that point.  </em></p><p><strong>Michael (M):</strong> That’s really interesting [to learn how being Graeme’s father inspired your “humanization” of AI characters in your books], Bill, and leads me to another question, specifically having to do with how music has influenced you as a writer.</p><p><strong>Bill (B):</strong> Well, I’m not at all musical, and neither is Deb, but we have both in our lives been very, very intensely moved by music. I’m just kind of a folk and pop guy (Deb’s tastes are broader; she has a library of operas), but yes, music has influenced me greatly as a writer. When I was starting to write, around age twelve or thirteen, I loved science fiction and read a great whack of it. But then, you know, puberty arrived, and I thought it was like a childhood thing and put it on the side. But when I began to think about writing again, I was dismayed by how uncool, to my mind, the science fiction that was being produced in the late ‘70s, early ‘80s, was. I thought it had become like Nashville country: formulaic, nothing there that I would be interested in. And what I wanted science fiction to be, as I thought, was more like Dylan going electric.</p><p>So I was more consciously inspired by Steely Dan’s lyrics than I was by any of the science fiction that I could see being written when I first started to write. Then I found there were other people around trying for the same effect, other writers whose science fiction <em>looked </em>more like Steely Dan’s lyrics than the rest of the science fiction that was written… And when I started going to London on publishing-related business, the best science fiction store in town was right across the street from the studios where David Bowie recorded his first three or four albums. And the people in the stores—they would have loved David Bowie anyways—but they particularly loved him because he’d always been one of their very best customers, since before he started recording. And they could see that he was taking what he was buying from them, taking it home, fully digesting it, and bringing it back into the recording studio. So that’s an art of sound thing in its own way. I love it that I know that story and that I know it’s true.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> So do you feel that there’s some similar kind of process, specifically relative to music, that went on in your own writing?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> No, it was more like an ambition that there could be an analogy, and I knew that some of the most progressive science fiction being written when I was fourteen years old was being written by people who were already being inspired by the roots of the music of what we think of as the ‘60s. But their influence had faded away by the time I came back in my mid-twenties after getting a BA in English literature, and I was looking at contemporary science fiction and going, “Oh, man. This is not happening for me.” So my ambition was to, you know, make that analogy happen again… I remember listening to Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska” and imagining what it would be like if it were a science fiction novel.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>B: </strong>That was what I would do. I would listen to a piece of music and it would really move me and be unlike anything quite like what I’d heard before. And I’d think, “Yeah, but what would that be like if it were a piece of science fiction? What would that look like as a piece of science fiction?” And that would be a starting point for something.</p><div><figure><img height="270" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1aF5qKfJg.jpg" width="300" />Bill with Graeme reading. Photo by Dr Deborah Gibson, used with permission.</figure></div><p><strong>M:</strong> Fascinating! Over to you, Deborah. What essential lessons has being Graeme’s mom taught you, and how have those lessons impacted your life?</p><p><strong>D:</strong> So one of the things I learned, I guess <em>had</em> to learn, was that we had to create our own experience and ways to get Graeme his best life, and ways for us to get through it without going completely berserk <em>[laughter]. </em>It was hard because there wasn’t the level of support that there is now, and we were, like, very impoverished really—well, not really—but we were very low income earners at the time. So it was difficult, but I managed, and I realized that I had to get another persona in order to find out what I wanted to know about Graeme, because every test that he had, everything that I pushed for, they would just give me the “mom” version.</p><p>And I knew there was another version that went amongst the professionals, that would use medical vocabulary and such. I needed to learn it, and I did learn it (that knowledge base eventually became the foundation for my PhD dissertation research, in fact, which was a case study on Graeme’s language acquisition) and I was able, therefore, to push quite far into getting information about Graeme that made me then feel like I had the information to take to, say, the school board or medical world, and to ask for things that were not there.</p><p>You know, Graeme was the first child with autism that that was integrated into the Vancouver School Board, to not be in a segregated class. And so I think just having a child who was “different” pushed me in a way that I was unwillingly pushed, but that nonetheless was an important maturation. I had a very cute baby, and one that was enchantingly different from others I knew. And it was delightful! Graeme’s babyhood was not all difficulties. He was so funny, and unique—very strong in what he liked and what he didn’t like. And what he liked were dots on the wall. He liked to find these microscopic dots and do this thing with sound, and touching them very slowly, and then screaming. He would play with things for hours and hours, but he hated primary colors, and all the toys were in primary colors. It was just really interesting, and often comical, and, I don’t know, there were wonderful things about being Graeme’s mother, wonderful things that I definitely wouldn’t have experienced if he had been a more “typical” child.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Let’s bring it all back full circle to Graeme. Graeme, what are three lessons you would like readers to take away from this interview, especially relative to your experiences as a member of your family?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> First, I’ll always say that you have to keep in mind that all people on the spectrum are different from each other. People on the spectrum have different needs. You have to find a way to accommodate their needs, to meet them on their own terms. You have to know who they are individually. So that in itself is more the challenge, but once that’s established, in my family we’ve gone much beyond that, so it’s pretty continuous in the way that information flows from me to Mom and Dad by email or in person. I’ve gotten very good at asking for what I need, and at articulating what I want, and what I don’t want.</p><p>The second thing I’ll talk about, which is actually related, is the constant communication. That’s what keeps us together in my family, even though we don’t spend very much time actually together anymore, except when we travel, like the trip to England last year.</p><p>Third would probably be mutual support, like how my parents have found me teachers and other people who have helped me to develop my skills, like my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, and when I was young, my music therapist Johanne Brodeur. That does count in the overall picture.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Those are great. Thanks, Graeme. Deborah? Bill? Anything to add along related lines?</p><p><strong>D:</strong> I think I have to keep being reminded that I have to respect Graeme’s boundaries about what is really hard for him. Because there are lots of things that I think would be maybe fun to do, and Graeme finds them difficult in ways that I haven’t expected. Or I’ll suggest something that’s spontaneous, and that doesn’t work for Graeme. He likes to plan ahead. So I have to keep being reminded, even though it’s been 43 years, that there are big differences between what I think is easy and what Graeme finds easy. In lots of ways it can be, in my opinion, something small that Graeme sticks on, but for him it’s huge, so that’s something that I’ve had to adjust to.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, that’s so important. Bill?</p><p>B. I’ll just amplify what Deb said, that respecting who Graeme is has been really, really essential, and like an ongoing project for sure. It’s not something one perfectly masters.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, like having this interview happen today, and getting Graeme’s cooperation, was something we really had to work on together. You sitting here for all this time—almost an hour and a half—mainly listening to us talk? I thank you for that, Graeme.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Mm-hmm…</p><p><strong>M:</strong> And I thank all of you. This has been really enlightening, and inspiring!</p><p> </p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/slItfWbhijc">Syd Wachs</a>. </em></p></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638687634/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638687634/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1aF5qKfJg.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/bruce-lee-and-the-invention-of-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">Bruce Lee and the invention of martial arts</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/so-you-think-you-know-shakespeare-quiz/" rel="nofollow">So you think you know Shakespeare?

<p> </p>
<p>No one wants to find errors in their work, but there’s something even worse: errors that pass through undetected, causing headaches later.</p>
<p>arXiv relies on TeXLive 2020 as a compilation system to ensure precise formatting of the submissions from our authors. During the submission process, authors upload their TeX files to the arXiv system, which then compiles them into a PDF. Now, compilation errors will be highlighted during the submission process, helping authors save time and submit their work smoothly.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_796" style="width: 583px;"><img alt="Image of TeX error highlighting" class="wp-image-796 size-full" height="243" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Highlighting-Key.png" width="583" />TeX errors detected by the arXiv submission system are now color-coded</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Different types of compilation errors might arise during the submission process. Some errors are so severe that the submission system will not compile the source files into a PDF until they are resolved. For example, if the TeX source references a file that the author forgot to include, processing will fail. Other errors are less obvious at first glance. For example, an error might interfere with formatting, making the content less understandable, or, if references are missing, a question mark will appear instead of numbers corresponding to the bibliography.</p>
<p>During the compilation process, AutoTeX log files are produced automatically and errors are noted within. In the past, many users found the large block of text challenging to read and interpret quickly.</p>
<p>Now, errors are highlighted with different colors within the AutoTeX logs during the submission process. Authors can quickly scan a summary of errors, understand their severity, and follow links to relevant arXiv help pages. Additionally, if the source did compile, the number of pages produced is also noted, so authors can confirm that the paper length matches their expectation.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_801" style="width: 1024px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error.png"><img alt="image of critical tex error summary" class="wp-image-801 size-large" height="311" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error-1024x311.png" width="1024" /></a>This example shows the summary of critical errors, attempted compilation runs, and a link to the relevant arXiv help page.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>By scrolling down the AutoTeX log, authors will find specific errors highlighted in various colors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_802" style="width: 818px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png"><img alt="TeX Error highlighting example" class="wp-image-802 size-full" height="693" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png" width="818" /></a>In this example, an error log shows where the specific errors occurred.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>arXiv aims to serve both readers and authors by ensuring that research can be shared quickly and easily. This AutoTeX log highlighting feature was specifically requested by arXiv authors and will likely improve their experience. Readers will also benefit because, with fewer technical errors, articles will be easier to read.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a> </p>



<p>You’re walking through a dark, dingy house. Floorboards creak and you think you hear something moving in the shadows. Suddenly, an engine revs and a blood-splattered man wearing a pig’s head lunges towards you with a chainsaw. You scream and run away. Terrifying, perhaps — but it also sounds kind of fun, right?</p>



<p>We generally think of fear as a negative emotion — something that signals danger and which is unpleasant to experience. Yet so many of us seek out situations that make us scared: haunted fairground rides, scary video games, and horror movies and novels. And now researchers have looked at exactly how the experience of fear is related to our enjoyment of this kind of “recreational horror”. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620972116">Writing in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>, the team finds that there’s a sweet spot when it comes to creating a scary but enjoyable experience: if you end up feeling too little fear — or too much — then it’s not quite as fun.</p>



<span id="more-40836"></span>



<p>Marc Malmdorf Anderson from Aarhus University and colleagues studied visitors to “<a href="https://dystopia.dk/haunted-house/">Dystopia Haunted House</a>”, a Danish live-action horror attraction, in which people walk through the rooms of a house and are confronted with actors playing spooky characters.</p>



<p>Before entering the haunted house, participants were fitted with heart rate monitors so that the researchers could look at their physiological response throughout the experience.  Once they had emerged at the other end, participants rated how scared they had been and how enjoyable they had found the haunted house overall. They also rated their fear and enjoyment for three specific locations in the house in which they had encountered a “jump scare” (zombies suddenly jumping out from a staircase, for example, or the aforementioned pig man chasing them with a chainsaw).</p>



<p>Overall, participants reported that the haunted house was both scary and enjoyable. And when the team looked at the link between fear and enjoyment across those three jump scare moments, they found a significant relationship. This took an inverse U shape:  the more scared people reported feeling, the greater their enjoyment — up to a point. When their fear exceeded this point (which was around 6 or so on a scale that went from 0 to 9) then their enjoyment tended to decrease again.</p>



<p>This suggests that for a scary experience to be at its most enjoyable, it needs to hit a “sweet spot” so that it is not too tame — but also not exceedingly scary. This makes sense when you think of recreational horror as a form of play, the authors write. We already know that other aspects of play rely on the conditions being “just right”: for example, in order to stimulate people’s curiosity, a challenge shouldn’t be so easy as to make it boring, but also not so hard or confusing that it is impossible.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that small-scale fluctuations in participants’ heart rate were related to feelings of enjoyment in a similar way (“small-scale” here refers to fluctuations that occurred across periods of just a few seconds, rather than longer-term changes in heart rate across the entire experience).  People whose heart rate fluctuated more moment-to-moment tended to report more enjoyment — but again, only up to a point. When these fluctuations became too great, then enjoyment began to decrease again. These results suggest that people also hit a sweet spot of physiological arousal when they’re enjoying a scary experience. </p>



<p>There are lots more questions to explore — in particular, it would be interesting to know exactly <em>why</em> enjoyment decreases when an experience becomes too scary. Do people simply become overwhelmed? Do they stop recognising that they are in a safe, artificial environment? Or could the physical signs of intense fear be souring the experience?  </p>



<p>As the authors point out, it would also be interesting to know whether there’s a similar relationship between fear and enjoyment for other media like video games or movies. Still, the “naturalistic” aspect of their research is pretty cool, and is a nice example of work extending beyond the artificial environment of the lab. Not many other studies on fear can boast that they terrified participants with an actual chainsaw-wielding pig man.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Audrey Hepburn’s face and Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. Darcy Bussell dancing the role of Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and <em>The Starry Night</em> by Vincent van Gogh. All of these things, and more, are widely regarded as looking beautiful. Do we have, then, a “beauty centre” in the brain that responds to something that we find visually beautiful, no matter what it is? For almost two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have been exploring this question, without reaching a consensus. Now a new meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies on almost 1,000 people concludes that no, our brains don’t have one “beauty centre” — but two.</p>



<span id="more-40829"></span>



<p>Hu Chuan-Peng at Tsinghua University, China, led <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-020-00827-z">the study</a>, published in <em>Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioural Neuroscience</em>. The team identified 49 studies that involved whole brain analyses of young and middle-aged people (aged 18 – 50), none of whom were art experts. Some of these studies focused on responses to human faces, while others looked at reactions to art, including paintings, sculpture, visual textures, dance videos and architectural space. In all cases, fMRI was used to image the brains of the participants, who also made aesthetic judgements, or at least rated how much they liked or disliked a given stimulus.</p>



<p>Using a technique called “activation likelihood estimation” (ALE) meta-analysis, the team searched for any crossover between the studies in patterns of brain activity while participants viewed stimuli that they judged to be beautiful.</p>



<p>This analysis revealed that beautiful faces triggered greater activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and adjacent pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and also the left ventral striatum, compared with faces rated as being not beautiful. However, this wasn’t the case for art. Beautiful visual art was associated with more activity not in these regions but in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC).</p>



<p>What might explain those different response patterns? The ventral striatum is already known to be a key part of the brain’s reward pathway, so the team thinks that the structure responds to the rewarding value of a beautiful face. This signal, along with other information, is then integrated into the vmPFC, to generate the positive feeling associated with perceiving facial beauty.</p>



<p>Beautiful faces, then, seem to be more like “primary rewards”, similar to food and sexual contact — rewards that benefit our (or our genes’) survival and which are inherently pleasurable. Viewing beautiful art is, though, more like getting money: a “secondary reward”, or something that we have learned to find pleasurable. As such, it’s handled differently in the brain — it’s perceived as being beautiful due to high-level, top-down processing in the aMPFC. (Earlier work has found an involvement for the aMPFC in secondary rewards, the team notes.)</p>



<p>It’s perhaps worth noting that what this new study can’t do — and was not designed to do — is contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The team’s meta-analysis revealed similarities in how people across the studies process “beautiful” vs “not beautiful” faces and visual art, but what was beautiful, or not, was judged by each individual. Neither, of course, can the study shed light on how we process non-visual beauty — such as “beautiful” music, for example. Further research will be necessary to reveal how this fits in; perhaps we have yet more “beauty centres”.</p>



<p>Still, debate about the nature of beauty goes back millennia. Plato wrote of a “common and abstract beauty” that is independent of the various forms of beautiful things, an idea that is still entertained today. This new study suggests that this is not the way our brains see things: we don’t perceive an “essence” of beauty in all manner of objects, but rather respond to at least two distinct types.</p>

<h2>Background</h2><p class="">In the 16th century, an eminent French<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon"> barber surgeon</a> named Ambroise Pare noted—with amazement—that some of his patients who had undergone limb amputation complained months later that they still felt sensations (including pain) coming from their missing limb. Pare’s observation is thought to be the first recorded description of <em>phantom limb</em>, a condition in which sensations continue to occur in a part of the body that has been lost (due to accident or injury) or surgically removed. Despite the name, phantom limb doesn’t only occur in limbs, and has also been recorded after the loss or removal of other parts of the body—like breasts, genitals, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15101965/" target="_blank">and even teeth</a>.</p><p class="">Although Pare wrote about phantom limb in the 1500s, the term <em>phantom limb</em> wouldn’t first be used until the Civil War—more than three centuries later. At that time, the renowned physician Silas Weir Mitchell was an army surgeon stationed at the South Street Hospital in Philadelphia. So many amputees were treated at South Street Hospital (especially after the Battle of Gettysburg) that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5325361/" target="_blank">soldiers called it “Stump Hospital.”</a> Mitchell noted that most of the amputees he treated there continued to experience sensations from their missing limbs. He described these lingering sensations as “sensory ghosts” or “phantoms,” which led to the use of the term <em>phantom limb</em> to describe the condition.</p><p class="">Today, phantom sensations are recognized as a common experience in those who have lost a limb. It’s thought that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053811/" target="_blank">almost all amputees have phantom sensations</a>, and the majority of them also suffer from some degree of phantom pain. In one study of 5000 American veterans, for example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6709380/" target="_blank">78% of them reported experiencing phantom pain in their amputated limbs</a>. </p><p class="">The presentation of phantom sensations can vary from patient to patient. In most cases, the sensations begin almost immediately after the surgery or injury that led to the loss of the limb (after consciousness has returned and any anesthetic has worn off). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/" target="_blank">But in about a quarter of patients</a>, the sensations may not appear for several days or weeks. Sometimes the phantom sensations fade away after a few days or weeks, but in other cases they persist for years—or even decades.</p><p class="">In many patients, the phantom limb takes on a habitual posture (e.g., arm slightly bent). But that posture may change spontaneously, and some patients complain that their phantom limb ends up in awkward positions that generate discomfort and pain. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/" target="_blank">One anecdotal report describes a patient</a> who lost a limb after a grenade exploded in it. He complained that his phantom hand was perpetually held in a painful, tightly-clenched fist.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What causes phantom limb?</h2><p class="">Phantom limb is still not very well understood. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain it, but it’s likely that the underlying mechanism differs slightly from case to case. In this article, I’ll discuss a few of the most common explanations for phantom limb. In an individual patient, it’s very possible more than one of the following mechanisms is at play—or that other explanations altogether are involved.</p><h3>Changes to the central nervous system</h3>

<p class="">The prevailing explanation for phantom limb sensations is an idea known as <em>cortical reorganization</em> or <em>cortical remapping</em>. To explain this hypothesis, let’s consider the case of an individual who loses their arm in an accident. Before the accident, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> that carried sensations from the arm communicated with neurons in a region known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">somatosensory cortex</a>, which receives information about touch, pain, temperature, and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/proprioception" target="_blank">proprioception</a> (i.e., the position of the body in space) from all over the body. Specifically, neurons carrying information from the arm interact with neurons in a part of the somatosensory cortex devoted to processing information about arm sensations. </p><p class="">After the accident, however, those somatosensory neurons are deprived of their normal source of neuronal input. Consequently, they begin to respond to signaling from other nearby neurons. This can cause sensations felt in other parts of the body (e.g., the face) to lead to the stimulation of neurons in the somatosensory cortex that are devoted to the (now missing) arm. The activation of these “arm” somatosensory neurons causes the brain to perceive sensations in the arm, even though it is no longer there. The extent to which this type of maladaptive cortical reorganization <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777055/" target="_blank">occurs is correlated with the severity of phantom limb pain</a>. </p><p class="">It should be noted that reorganization in non-cortical areas, like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> (a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical" target="_blank">subcortical</a> structure involved in processing nearly all incoming sensory information) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9450753/" target="_blank">also seems to play a role</a> in some phantom sensations.</p><h3>Body representation</h3><p class="">Another popular explanation for phantom limb centers around the idea that the brain typically relies on an internal representation of the body for generating an awareness of where our body is in space—and thus for maintaining posture, making movements, etc. This internal representation of the body is likely created by networks of neurons that integrate information of various types in the brain (e.g., tactile, visual—even emotional). </p><p class="">According to some researchers, the internal representation of the body can be the root of phantom limb sensations and pain. This might occur when, after a limb is lost, the body representation remains intact. In other words, the representation of the body generated in the patient’s brain still includes the intact limb, creating an expectation or sense that the limb is still present. This might lead to abnormal sensations, discomfort, or pain when incoming sensory information conflicts with the neural body representation (e.g., the eyes see that no leg is present, but the brain still expects a leg to be there). </p><h3>Peripheral nervous system</h3><p class="">In the early days of phantom limb research, the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/peripheral-nervous-system" target="_blank">peripheral nervous system</a> was thought to be the sole cause of phantom limb pain. Today, explanations typically involve the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/central-nervous-system" target="_blank">central nervous system</a> as well, but the peripheral nervous system is still believed to be an important factor. </p><p class="">After the loss of a limb, the damaged <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/axon" target="_blank">axons</a> that once supplied the limb don’t simply stay idle. Instead, they often attempt to repair themselves by growing new extensions (a process called <em>sprouting</em>). After loss of a limb, however, these new extensions essentially have nowhere to go. They form a mass of neural tissue at the site of amputation called a <em>neuroma</em>.</p><p class="">The axons that make up the neuroma do not remain dormant. Instead, they can generate <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/action-potential" target="_blank">action potentials</a> in an erratic manner. This aberrant signaling is thought to be a potential mechanism underlying some of the spontaneous pain phantom limb patients can experience. The abnormal neural activity might be exacerbated by pathological signaling coming from the area where the axons from the missing limb enter the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>Treatments for phantom limb pain</h2><p class="">There are a number of pharmacological treatments for phantom limb pain. They include many of the same pain-relieving drugs used to treat other types of neuropathic pain, such as anticonvulsant and opioid drugs.

<p class="">One unique approach to treating phantom limb pain is called <em>mirror therapy</em>. In this technique, a mirror is situated between the missing and intact limb so it reflects the patient’s intact limb. This creates the illusion (from the patient’s perspective) that they have two intact limbs. They can move their intact limb and observe the illusory limb moving in the same manner. It is thought that this imagery may help to reduce some of the discomfort caused by the lack of visual feedback from a missing limb that the brain has maintained an internal representation of. </p><p class="">Although <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18032777/" target="_blank">studies support the effectiveness of mirror therapy</a>, the mechanisms underlying why the approach works are not fully understood. Some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327313/" target="_blank">research, however, suggests mirror therapy may </a>help to reverse the post-amputation cortical reorganization mentioned above. The effectiveness of mirror therapy has increased interest in similar approaches, like using virtual reality to create a representation of a limb. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Collins KL, Russell HG, Schumacher PJ, Robinson-Freeman KE, O'Conor EC, Gibney KD, Yambem O, Dykes RW, Waters RS, Tsao JW.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It’s become somewhat of a truism that you shouldn’t believe everything you see on social media. Where someone’s life looks perfect, we’re often reminded, there are probably a handful of problems silently situated away from the camera. Nobody’s life is as shiny, flawless, or enviable as it might appear in their carefully curated feed.</p>



<p>But presenting ourselves more authentically on social media — ditching those things we want to believe are true about ourselves in favour of those that are — could be good for our wellbeing, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18539-w">new paper</a> in <em>Nature Communications</em> by Erica R. Bailey from Columbia University and colleagues.</p>



<span id="more-40820"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team looked at the data of 10,560 Facebook users who had completed both personality and life satisfaction assessments through the myPersonality app (the data was originally collected between 2007 and 2012 and made available for approved researchers to study, though the app has since been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/facebook-bans-first-app-since-cambridge-analytica-mypersonality-and-suspends-hundreds-more">banned by Facebook</a> for improper data protection). These assessments were then compared to predictions of personality from Facebook likes and from status updates, to give a measure of how “authentically” the users presented themselves on the platform.</p>



<p>There was a positive correlation between life satisfaction and authenticity — but no indication, however, of the direction of causality. In other words, it wasn’t clear whether authenticity led to greater wellbeing or vice-versa.</p>



<p>To further examine the direction of cause-and-effect, the team asked 90 participants to spend two weeks posting on social media in a particular manner. For one week, they were asked to post in an authentic way, and for the other in a self-idealised way — i.e. posting in the way they would <em>like</em> to be seen rather than the way they really are. At the end of each week, participants recorded their subjective wellbeing, life satisfaction, mood, and positive and negative affect.</p>



<p>After the week of authentically posting, participants reported significantly higher levels of wellbeing, mood, and positive affect. There was also a marginally significant impact on negative affect, though overall life satisfaction was not affected. This suggests that authentic posting might actually lead to higher levels of wellbeing than self-idealised posting.</p>



<p>But <em>why</em> people behave the way they do on social media should be considered in further research. People may have different motivations for self-idealising online, which could affect how they feel while doing so. If you’re not self-aware and feel you’re simply sharing things that really do authentically reflect who you are, does that have the same impact on wellbeing as actively deviating from your real self-view? It’s also unclear whether posting authentically is actually any better than not posting at all.</p>



<p>But for those of us who do post online, it might be a good reminder to resist the pressure to present a perfect life online. Seeing online friends or influencers as normal people, rather than unattainably idealistic, can be deeply reassuring — there’s a reason there’s been a rise, for example, in “skin-positive influencers”, who share pictures of acne and scars. And this study suggests that such authenticity doesn’t just benefit others — there’s a chance it might make you feel better, too.</p>

It combines tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering towards the understanding of human biology and disease and the improvement of human health.</p>
<p>We spoke with one of <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>‘s Editorial Board Members (EBMs), Professor Seeram Ramakrishna from the National University of Singapore, about his perspective on the journal.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When and how did you become an EBM for <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> was launched in 2018, and published its first article in January 2019. I was invited to submit a review article to <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> by the Editor, Dr. Lingling Tian. I was impressed with the professionalism and quality of the peer review process, and hence got interested in <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>. Upon invitation and foresight discussions with Lingling, I gladly accepted to join the editorial board of <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> in July 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>As <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Compared with other journals in the field, especially well-known ones, what makes <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering </em>different?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> considers quality articles on all aspects of biomedical engineering.  Specific topics include biomaterials, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, medical technologies, robotics and rehabilitation engineering, Biomechanics, biosensors and bioelectronics, and Biomedical Imaging. As <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.</p>
<p>In addition, BMC is a pioneer of open access publishing. This year makes the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of BMC! As part of the BMC Series journals, <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> is a fully open access journal. Published articles are free to read and share.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How’s the paper quality of the journal and what’s your opinion on the <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">review policy</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> has a professional in-house editorial team, with support from a strong and international <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">editorial board</a>. It offers a rigorous, efficient and fair peer review service. Since its launch, <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> has been receiving good quality submissions from around the world. <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>‘s editorial policy requires that the reported studies must be scientifically valid; for research articles, this includes a scientifically-sound research question, the use of suitable methods and analysis, and following community-agreed standards relevant to the research field.  <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> achieved a good measure of success with 42 <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">articles published</a> and consistently improves its standards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you please share what suggestions you have for the journal’s future development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We aim to grow <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> into a renowned biomedical engineering journal with global impact in the next few years. This is a very promising biomedical engineering journal, on which I aspire to publish my own work.</p>
<p>In addition, I would encourage the Editors to provide more support to the authors in the research community, in particular to the junior ones who are at their early stage of research. They might be not very experienced with writing and publishing their research in scientific journal. The editors could support them by giving presentations or seminars on topics.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What suggestions do you have for young researchers and author who would like to submit their paper to open access journal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Open access is a good way to share and disseminate knowledge, which gives readers free and instant access, enabling faster discovery of the latest research. Young researchers are encouraged to submit their work to open access journal if their funding allows.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/638548362/0/oupblogpsychology/">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a></h4>

<div><div><div><div><p><em>Earlier this year, </em>Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves <em>author Michael B. Bakan sat down for a Zoom conversation with his Chapter 7 co-author, the Vancouver-based multi-instrumentalist and music instrument collector Graeme Gibson, and with Graeme’s parents, autism researcher Dr. Deborah Gibson and bestselling science fiction author William (Bill) Gibson. Their four-way conversation covered a range of topics, from how raising a child on the spectrum shaped Bill’s writing of iconic novels like </em>Neuromancer, <em>to how Deborah’s advocacy on Graeme’s behalf helped to spearhead the movement toward inclusive public education in Vancouver, to how Graeme’s abiding fascination with musical instruments—combined with his prodigious research and memory—enabled him to identify virtually every instrument in the expansive world instrument collection of London’s Horniman Museum. Here is part one of the interview; <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">read part two here</a>. </em></p><p><strong>Michael (M):</strong> Hello, Graeme, Deborah, and Bill! Thank you so much for doing this interview. I’ve really been looking forward to it.</p><p>Graeme, a question for you for starters: You have a collection of, what, more than 400 musical instruments? And these instruments are from all over the world, and you can actually <em>play</em> most of them, some very well, which is really impressive. How did your interest in musical instruments start?</p><p><strong>Bill (B):</strong> Wasn’t there a little electric keyboard you used to play when you were really little?</p><p><strong>Graeme (G):</strong> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There was, and that’s also what propelled me to be able to learn where the notes are laid out on the keyboard.</p><p><strong>Deborah (D):</strong> Actually, it wasn’t electric—Michael, I think I sent you a picture of Graeme playing it when he was a toddler—it was this tuneless<em> </em>little wooden toy piano that we got him for his second Christmas (he was one year old), and he was so mesmerized by it. From the time he was a baby, Graeme was just so interested in sound, and he showed a real affinity for instruments of all kinds. He liked Santa’s jingle bells more than any other present. He was just drawn to music and sound, and when we had records he would <em>insist</em> on Bill playing them over and over again. At that point he was signing rather than speaking, and he would make a very insistent gesture, spinning his finger around in circles like a record spinning on a turntable, to say to Bill, ‘Play it again, play it again!’</p><div><figure><img height="239" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg" width="300" />Graeme with toy piano. Photo by Dr Deborah Gibson, used with permission.</figure></div><p><strong>G:</strong> Then later, when I was a teenager, I did have an electronic keyboard—a Casio SK1, and I would play that for many hours every day.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> And then, all of a sudden, you asked for a balalaika!</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yeah, yeah. In terms of instruments from other world cultures, my first major acquisition was a Russian balalaika.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> What I remember is that Graeme walked up to me one day and said, “I want a balalaika.” <em>[Graeme laughs]</em> And I only barely knew what a balalaika was: it’s triangular, it’s a Russian, like… something. How on earth do you think you ever decided to get a balalaika?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> I might have heard it somewhere, maybe the radio or something. I sort of had an idea of what it was and the way that it was played. It’s just the way my ears pick it up. I wish I could explain that, but unfortunately, I can’t translate that software here, so… And later, especially after I started studying with my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, who owns thousands of instruments from around the world, he introduced me to many other instruments as well—especially stringed instruments, which are my specialty—and my collection grew and grew. Now I have an <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~museumofworldmusic.com/">online instrument museum</a> where people can visit my collection.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Right, and I seem to recall that you enjoy visiting “live” musical instrument museums as well, right, Graeme?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yes! Like last year, when Mom and Dad and I went to London.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> There was a wonderful museum of ethnic musical instruments.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yeah! The Horniman Museum in, uh… I forget where exactly it is, but, uh…</p><p><strong>D:</strong> It wasn’t close.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> No, it was far, but well worth it.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> And Graeme knew the name of every single instrument without even looking at the label.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> He was the most incredible museum guide, and he would describe the slight discrepancies between that version of the instrument and then the one that came from twenty miles further south. It was a real eye opener for me on how much Graeme knows about music, about instruments, about all things music-related.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, his knowledge—of instruments, the Indian <em>raga </em>system, you name it—is immense. When I assign our chapter in the <em>Music and Autism</em> book to my students, I’ll say to them, ‘Check out how much this guy knows. You’re Ph.D. ethnomusicology students; you should know as much as he does!’ <em>[laughter]</em></p><p><strong>D:</strong> And we have to thank Randy [Raine-Reusch] for that. He’s just been an extraordinary teacher for Graeme.<em> </em>And as far back as when he was a baby, it wasn’t just music and instruments that interested Graeme. It was sounds of <em>all</em> kinds. When the fridge went on and off…</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Usually around 9 p.m. or so. <em>[Deborah and Bill laugh]</em> Yeah, yeah. There would always be that time, sometime in the evening, when it was very routine. You’d hear the click, and then you’d hear the fridge cycles. <em>[Deborah laughs]</em></p><p><strong>D:</strong> I gotta say, I never, ever paid attention to our fridge before in that way. <em>[laughter] </em></p><div><figure><img height="200" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1borx4S-A.jpg" width="300" />Graeme with some of his instruments.

At the same time that you were being a stay-at-home dad to Graeme, in the late 1970s/early 1980s, you were also working on your first novel, <em>Neuromancer</em>, which would of course bring you considerable fame—not to mention revolutionize the literature of science fiction, inspire the iconic <em>Matrix </em>film series, and (along with some of your earlier short stories) even change the English language with your coining of the term “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oed.com/view/Entry/240849">cyberspace</a>” and such. I have to think that being a first-time dad—and a dad to Graeme in particular—would have influenced your writing during that time. True?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> I think that being Graeme’s dad made me think more actively about consciousness and perception than I would have otherwise, that is, had I not had that experience, because I had the example of Graeme totally perceiving everything, but perceiving it often in a slightly other way. And I think, particularly for someone that writes the sort of fiction I write, that’s a hugely useful example to have every day, as opposed to, you know, watching everyone else doing what everyone else is doing with the information they’re receiving, although that’s essential too.</p><p>Also, on a practical level, as it became more evident that Graeme wasn’t “just any baby,” it sort of upped the ante on what I was doing. And I also was in a situation where if I was going to be doing anything other than co-parenting Graeme, the perfect thing to do would be trying to become a writer, because you do it from home, literally any time of day, you know, whenever Graeme was asleep, for instance, which is when I did a lot of my writing. So, in some ways it was sort of a natural fit. Yeah, I can’t think of anything else I could have done. And I was lucky, because I was able to make a living at being a freelance writer of fiction, even though, looking back on it, there’s almost no one else I ever knew who tried to do that who was able to do it; they all wound up having day jobs. And I have yet to have one, I’m happy to say.</p><p>And there’s one other thing I’ve wondered about, too, that seems relevant to your question. Something that’s been consistent through my work are characters who are AIs, they’re Artificial Intelligences, but are unnervingly human in their presentation, and seemingly in their consciousness. As far as I know they’re much more totally human than we have any right to expect Artificial Intelligences in the future to be, at least so far. So, something that happens, I know from watching reader feedback, is that readers become invested in the AI’s humanity, but then are occasionally henceforth startled by moments of cognitive dissonance where they realize that it’s human but it’s not quite standardly human. And that’s the result of me, if it were music <em>playing</em> it a certain way, to get that effect of deliberately going slightly off key to remind the reader that the character’s not “standard issue” human. And, you know, that may be something subsequent to being Graeme’s dad.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">Read part two of the interview here.</a></p><p> </p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/cW3nDFVpi10">Karim Manjra</a></em></p></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638548362/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638548362/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/bruce-lee-and-the-invention-of-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">Bruce Lee and the invention of martial arts</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/so-you-think-you-know-shakespeare-quiz/" rel="nofollow">So you think you know Shakespeare?

<p>Starting today, authors now have a new license option for their submitted works, the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>. This is the <strong>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs</strong> license, which stipulates that others can share the work only with proper attribution and no commercial or derivative works can be made from it.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_781" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="image of creative commons logo" class="wp-image-781 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/createive-commons-logo-150x150.png" width="150" />Creative Commons helps overcome legal obstacles to knowledge sharing</figure>
<p>When an author submits work to arXiv, they choose from a selection of licenses that prescribe how others can –or cannot– use their article. This is critical because, as a repository for scholarly material, arXiv keeps a permanent record of every article and version posted. arXiv needs permission from the copyright holder to host and distribute the work. Permission is granted through a license, chosen by the person who submits the work, and the submitter must certify that they have the right to grant that license.</p>
<p>Authors often ask arXiv for advice on choosing the appropriate license. In general, arXiv values openness and encourages choosing a liberal license for reuse of articles. However, each situation is unique, and arXiv cannot make any specific recommendations. Authors need to consider that journals have different policies regarding preprints, embargo periods, and post-publication distribution. Funding and government agencies might require specific licenses. The license chosen during arXiv submission is irrevocable and cannot be changed, but different versions of the same work can have different licenses.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_778" style="width: 1341px;"><img alt="screenshot of license options" class="wp-image-778 size-full" height="227" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/List-of-available-licenses-with-arrow.png" width="1341" />Available licenses are listed in the submission system. The purple arrow points to the new option, CC BY-NC-ND.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license was added to arXiv’s selections because many authors submit works that have already been accepted to journals, which each have their own unique policies regarding copyright and article reuse. With this option, authors can comply with the policies of some journals, while also extending permissions to arXiv and others to openly share their work.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is the submitter’s responsibility to choose the appropriate license for their content, obtain permission from their coauthors, and certify that they have the right to grant that specific license.</p>
<p>In addition to seeing the new option, authors may notice that the order of the licenses listed in the submission system has changed. The licenses, with the exception of CC Zero, are now ordered from most liberal re-use at the top (CC-BY) to most limited re-use (arXiv.org perpetual non-exclusive). For the top five options, the original copyright holder retains ownership after posting on arXiv. The exception, CC Zero, is rarely used and allows creators to waive their right to enforce copyright and put their works into the worldwide public domain.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There’s likely to be a diverse set of factors driving any given person’s interest in politics. It could be that their parents had a political affiliation they’ve subsequently inherited; they may have had a personal experience that changed how they see the world; politics could provide a social life or community connections; they might consider political action a civic duty; or they might just be passionate about a particular issue.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220919212">recent paper</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, there may be another motivation, too — namely narcissism. The paper finds that particular kinds of narcissism are related to taking part in political activities, suggesting that deeply rooted individual factors may play a large part in our willingness to engage in politics.</p>



<span id="more-40811"></span>



<p>Zoltán Fazekas from Copenhagen Business School and Peter K. Hatemi from The Pennsylvania State University explored the link between narcissism and political participation through three surveys: one in Denmark, with 2,450 participants, and two in the US, with 500 and 2,280 participants respectively. In each study, participation in politics was measured through an eight-item questionnaire, which gave an overall measure of participation based on how often people took part in various activities like signing a petition, boycotting or buying products for political reasons, participating in protests, attending political meetings, contacting politicians, donating money, contacting the media, and taking part in political forums and discussion groups.</p>



<p>Narcissism was measured using the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, with participants asked to choose between two opposing statements (e.g., “I insist upon getting the respect that is due me” vs. “I usually get the respect that I deserve”). From these questions an overall score is generated, as well as scores for different facets of narcissisms.</p>



<p>As anticipated, there were significant and positive correlations between narcissism and political participation across all three studies, with more narcissistic people participating in politics more than the less narcissistic. The size of this effect was similar to that of other important predictors of political participation like level of education.</p>



<p>There was no relationship between narcissism and voting in general elections, however, though this might be related to high turnout — in the 2011 general election in Denmark, turnout was an impressively high 88%. Voting in US <em>midterm</em> elections, which tend to have lower turnout, was linked to narcissism.</p>



<p>There were also some interesting links between participation and particular facets of narcissism. Higher levels of authority-seeking, perceived leadership ability, and feelings of superiority were consistently associated with taking part in political activities. This makes sense: if you believe yourself to have the qualities of a leader then taking part in political activity could be one way of exercising that sense of moral superiority.</p>



<p>On the other hand, aspects of narcissism like entitlement, exploitativeness, and self-sufficiency were <em>negatively </em>related to participation: people displaying these traits were less likely to engage with politics. This paints a fairly gloomy picture of political participation, with politics guided by “those who both want more but give less”, as the team puts it.</p>



<p>However, the direction of causality in the relationship between narcissism and political participation is unclear. It would be interesting to look at it from another angle: what impact does political participation have on narcissism? In other words, does frequent engagement with politics change people’s personalities? If you’re surrounded by people who share your political convictions, it’s not too much of a leap to believe that you might end up feeling morally superior to others. Those with latent narcissistic traits may also find them coming to the fore when engaging with politics.</p>



<p>Either way, it’s interesting to consider some of the more individual motivations for political participation. For many, political affiliations or stances are deeply personal: they can say something quite profound about who somebody is. The team also suggests that there may be a specific link between narcissism and participation in <em>populist</em> political activities: looking more deeply into individual factors may help us understand why such policies are so popular and why others, perhaps more collectivist or altruistic in nature, fail to gain support.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper "Bacterial colony counting with Convolutional Neural Networks in Digital Microbiology Imaging".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Counting bacterial colonies on microbiological culture plates is a
time-consuming, error-prone, nevertheless essential quantitative task in Clinica
Microbiology Laboratories. With this work we explore the possibility to find
effective solutions to the above issue by designing and testing two different
machine learning approaches. The first one is based on the extraction of a
complete set of handcrafted morphometric and radiometric features used within a
Support Vector Machines solution. The second one is based on the design and
configuration of a Convolutional Neural Networks deep learning architecture. To
validate, in a real and challenging clinical scenario, the proposed bacterial
load estimation techniques, we built and publicly released a fully labeled large
and representative database of both single and aggregated bacterial colonies
extracted from routine clinical laboratory culture plates. Dataset enhancement
approaches have also been experimentally tested for performance optimization.
The adopted deep learning approach outperformed the handcrafted feature based
one, and also a conventional reference technique, by a large margin, becoming a
preferable solution for the addressed Digital Microbiology Imaging quantification
task, especially in the emerging context of Full Laboratory Automation systems.</p>

<p>The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the foremost funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to release the first output of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Reports (DDIRR) Award, which CTF and <em>PLOS ONE</em> <a href="https://www.ctf.org/news/ctf-plos-one-funder-publisher-partnership">first announced in 2017</a>. The Registered Reports model, first piloted by CTF and PLOS ONE, ensures that all valid research – both successes and failures in the lab and clinics – are made public.</p>



<p>The publication, titled <em>Evaluating modified diets and dietary supplement therapies for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and improving muscle function in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), </em>by Dr. Aaron Schindeler, PhD, associate professor at the University of Sydney, reports <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237097">findings</a> on L-Carnitine as an effective dietary supplement for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and potentially addresses muscle weakness and fatigue often observed in NF1 patients. The result of the study led to the opening of a <a href="https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=ACTRN12618002021257">clinical trial</a> for NF1 patients.</p>



<p>The Funder-Publisher Partnership around the DDIRR program allows researchers to preregister their study, obtain an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>, and obtain funding from the Children’s Tumor Foundation to conduct their proposed experiments. Both CTF and <em>PLOS ONE</em> maintain a separate and independent review process to align proposed research with both the funder mission as well as to safeguard soundness, accuracy, and scientific rigor. Through this model, before any experiments start, researchers have the opportunity to address reviewer remarks and submit revisions of their protocol until it is ready for publication.</p>



<p>The innovation of this new funding model creates multiple benefits for all participants. Researchers are able to make adjustments to their protocols before they start any lab experiment, funders are ensured that the quality of the proposed research is high quality, and the publisher secures a manuscript that has robust reproducibility in line with the mission and ethos of the journal. In addition, the published manuscript links to the original registered protocol deposited on the Open Science Framework <a href="https://osf.io/rr/">portal</a> for full transparency and traceability.</p>



<p>“We are very proud to see the first manuscript of this new award program out, the transparency and the quantity of the protocol adds to the soundness of the research, independent from the nature of the outcome,” said Salvatore La Rosa, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Positive or negative results are equally valuable when a robust protocol is applied, and this model allows for either to emerge.”</p>



<p>“I am delighted that our partnership with the Children’s Tumor Foundation has resulted in the first publication of a preregistered study,” adds Joerg Heber, PLOS Editorial Director and Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE. “This scheme ensures the robustness of the research conducted and is a win for openness and transparency in research.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>We are today seeing growing dissatisfaction with the pay-to-publish model for open access. As this requires authors (or their funders or institutions) to pay an article-processing charge every time they publish a paper it is felt to be discriminatory, especially for non-funded researchers and those based in the Global South  (see, for instance, </span><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2019/03/06/plan-s-and-the-global-south-what-do-countries-in-the-global-south-stand-to-gain-from-signing-up-to-europes-open-access-strategy/"><span>here</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-africa-pan-african-2020-10-is-africa-prepared-for-the-business-of-open-access/"><span>here</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/s7cx4"><span>here</span></a><span>).</span></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_Ry8G6q1gk/X6JBOVYhjuI/AAAAAAAAsAQ/Ht88mBjFrk0AEzqs99imhboqUk5mGr3NQCNcBGAsYHQ/s320/Sarah%2B32.JPEG" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="320" data-original-width="240" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g_Ry8G6q1gk/X6JBOVYhjuI/AAAAAAAAsAQ/Ht88mBjFrk0AEzqs99imhboqUk5mGr3NQCNcBGAsYHQ/w150-h200/Sarah%2B32.JPEG" width="150" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">PLOS' Sara Rouhi</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As a result, various alternative approaches are emerging intended to move away from APCs, including crowdfunding and membership schemes. Here institutions are asked to commit to paying an annual fee to a publisher, with the aim of pooling sufficient funds to cover the costs of making all the papers in a journal open access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>One of the more successful implementations of this model is the Open Library of Humanities (</span><a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/"><span>OLH</span></a><span>), which has operated what it calls its </span><a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/the-olh-model/"><span>Library Partnership Subsidies</span></a><span> scheme since 2015.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Clearly, if the costs of the annual fee are to be viewed as reasonable by those asked to take part a sufficient number of institutions need to sign up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The inherent weakness of the model is that a small group of community-minded institutions could end up paying all a publisher’s costs and everyone else would be able to “free ride”. In effect, those who join a membership scheme could end up shouldering the costs for everyone to have free access.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>A key question is how many universities are willing to join an OA membership scheme. OLH co-founder Martin Eve has </span><a href="https://eve.gd/2020/10/22/backlist-to-the-future-a-new-business-model-for-university-presses-and-open-access-books/"><span>estimated</span></a><span> that there are only around 300 libraries who will do so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Nevertheless, we should not doubt that there is a real wish to move beyond APCs and many have come to believe that membership schemes are the best way of doing this. To be successful, however, they will need to broaden the pool of those willing to take part.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Annual Flat Fee</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>With this aim in mind, in October the Public Library of Science (PLOS) launched what it calls its Community Action Publishing (</span><a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/"><span>CAP</span></a><span>) initiative for its two selective journals <i>PLOS Biology</i> and <i>PLOS Medicine</i>. The hope is that the journals can be gradually moved away from having to charge APCs and that the publishing costs can be shared as widely as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Specifically, PLOS is inviting universities to pay an annual flat fee that will give their faculty unlimited publishing opportunities in the journals (there are separate “communities” for each journal) without the need to pay an APC each time. However, authors of institutions who do not join the scheme will be charged a non-member fee (NMF) that will increase in price over time, as below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s437/NMF.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="162" data-original-width="437" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/NMF.png" /></a></div><p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The rising cost of the NMF is intended to encourage universities who have not joined to do so in order to avoid their faculty having to pay to publish.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>PLOS hopes that the annual fees will be low enough to attract a sufficient number of institutions but that the pooled funds will eventually be adequate to meet all the costs of publishing the journals. In the interim, the NMF means that there will be two separate revenue streams coming in and the free riding issue will be avoided.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The hope is that the NMF can be discontinued when the pilot period ends (it lasts from 2021 until 2023). However, says PLOS Director of Strategic Partnerships Sara Rouhi, that will be dependent on all the large institutions that PLOS is targeting joining the scheme. “If we don’t have a stable membership by then, we might have to offset lack of participation with more NMFs”, she told me. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Tiers</b></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The annual fee institutions will be asked to pay will be calculated by looking at their faculty’s publishing activity between 2014 and Q3 2019. Based on that they will then be assigned to a fee tier, as below.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s412/Tiers.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="289" data-original-width="412" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Tiers.png" /></a></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To help broaden the pool, the annual fee will be calculated on the publishing activity not just of the institution’s corresponding authors, but of their contributing authors too. The aim is to ensure that “the cost of publishing is distributed more equitably among representative institutions.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In other words, PLOS will calculate how often during the historical publishing activity period an institution was associated with both corresponding and contributing authors and then assign a weighting to each type of author. Specifically, contributing-author articles will be weighted at half that of corresponding authors.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As the PLOS FAQ </span><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/"><span>explains</span></a><span>: “Publishing activity is counted by determining the number of times an institution was associated with a corresponding author <i>and</i> the number of times an institution was associated with contributing authors. Papers where the institution is affiliated with the corresponding authors are weighted as 1 article and papers where the institution is affiliated with the contributing author are weighted as ½ article. (Multiple contributing authors from the same institutions are counted only once).”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Universities whose faculty have never published in the journals can also opt to pay the tier’s lowest fee in order to “insure” themselves against the possibility that one or more of their faculty might publish in the journal within the time period of the scheme (Jan 1</span><sup>st</sup><span> 2021 –</span><span>  </span><span>Dec 31</span><sup>st</sup><span>2023).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In addition, says PLOS, Research4Life countries are automatically members of each community so researchers in those countries will never be subject to fees. And authors unable to pay non-member fees can apply for waivers as per the standard fee-waiver mechanisms offered by PLOS.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To signal its own commitment to the community PLOS has set targets for each journal and will cap its margin at 10%. Revenue exceeding the community targets will go back to members at renewal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Time will tell how successful the scheme will be in broadening the pool beyond the 300 libraries who normally join OA membership schemes. Certainly, the challenge will be that much greater given that it is being launched at a time when many libraries are signing expensive <a href="https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/#:~:text=Transformative%20agreements%20are%20those%20contracts%20negotiated%20between%20institutions,fair%20price%20for%20their%20open%20access%20publishing%20services.">transformative agreements</a> with legacy publishers and universities are facing the financial impact of the pandemic. Some have also <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ce-strategy/the-brief-issue-28">suggested</a> that, as selective journals, </span><i>PLOS Biology</i><span> and </span><i>PLOS Medicine</i><span> do not publish a sufficient number of papers to make it worthwhile for many institutions to participate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>My initial thought was that PLOS will be targeting three separate types of institution (corresponding-author institutions, contributing-author institutions, and “insurance” institutions). Sara Rouhi suggests that this is not the way to view it.

So rather than think of different types of “institutions,” it’s easier to think of different publishing activity “types” – publishing as a lead author, publishing as a contributing author, or publishing with affiliations in both designations.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Given the selectivity and niche of these journals, some research-intensive universities publish little to not-at-all, and smaller institutions publish more frequently as lead authors. Simplifying the participation criterion to </span><b><i>just</i></b><span>publishing activity elides the traditional distinction of “research intensive” vs. “teaching” institutions etc.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>I don’t want to add further confusion by grouping institutions as you’ve indicated.

There’s some nuance worth flagging, however. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The TL;DR is that Martin’s statement is true if you assume institutions that are participating for largely altruistic reasons – because it’s the “right thing to do.” The PLOS CAP model couldn’t be predicated on that as a buying motivation. So it helps to go back to “collective action” basics. Credit to Dr. Kamran Naim for elucidating this at the Basel Sustainable Publishing Forum last week.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>For collective action schemes to work there are generally two levers you can pull: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span>1.<span>       </span></span><span>Encourage “pro-collective” behaviour by leveraging group affinity and social incentives</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 37.5pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 37.5pt;"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">       </p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>2.<span>       </span></span><span>Appeal to economic self-interest (aka “private benefit”)</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>From my perspective, </span><a href="https://scoap3.org/"><span>SCOAP 3</span></a><span> and OLH lean heavily on the first lever. Participating in them is the “right” thing to do so libraries support them.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The challenge with only pulling on this lever is sustainability over time. SCOAP3 relies heavily on CERN’s ongoing support and has the challenge of large beneficiaries like Russia, Brazil and India not participating while benefitting from the open content.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>OLH memberships are very small financial commitments that maintain OLH but make growth of the program difficult. Martin talked about this on a webinar we did for UKSG earlier in the year.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>A collective model that focuses primarily on the second lever is <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7961882/6701287299563734785">Subscribe2Open</a>.</span><span> The primary benefit is getting the community to agree to make content open in exchange for a discount. If all members do not opt-in, the content stays behind a paywall. The combination of a private benefit (the discount) with the public good (making the content open) is a strong motivator for participation and a big part of why the model is so successful.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>PLOS Community Action Publishing attempts to pull both levers. The pro-collective/group affinity/social incentives relates to the moral imperative – especially in a time of pandemic – to make biomedical research open to read and open to publish. </span><a href="https://library.duke.edu/about/directory/staff/jeff.kosokoff"><span>Jeff Kosokoff’s</span></a><span> comment that “Open Access <i>is</i> social justice,” speaks to this. Indeed, we have many commitments based on this mission-aligned priority for libraries. However what has interested partners from mere interest to actual commitment is the equitable fee structure (and relative affordability given the current budget crisis).</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>That said, without including appeals to economic self-interest, the PLOS CAP model would suffer from the same sustainability issues as other collectives. Hence our implementation of a secondary, “back up” revenue stream – non-member fees (NMFs) for authors from non-CAP members.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>These NFMs are not meant to penalize authors but rather to encourage libraries to join rather than expose their authors to fees. For many institutions, the NMFs per article will be higher than the annual fee the library would pay to join one or both collectives.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b><span style="font-size: large;">Benefits</span></b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The NMFs help offset slow uptake of institutions who are not able to find the funds to support a model like this immediately. Thanks to those fees coming in, libraries can take more time to join and we can offer flexibility for institutions that need to leave the collective.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>There are several benefits to this:</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Enlarging the pool of institutions that would participate in this collective gives us the flexibility to create a much finer tuned fee structure with a long tail of low dollar fee tiers to accommodate institutions that do not publish frequently in either journal.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Those low fee tiers allow institutions strapped for funds and/or infrequent publishing institutions to participate because they support the moral imperative of equity and inclusivity that the model promotes. It simply doesn’t cost them that much to “do the right thing.”</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Research intensive institutions then derive benefit from the “research light” institutions participating since they offset some of the cost burden.

<p>This week on Journal Club session Samuel Sutton will talk about the paper "Navigation Along Windborne Plumes of Pheromone and Resource-Linked Odors".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many insects locate resources such as a mate, a host, or food by flying upwind along the odor plumes that these resources emit to their source. A windborne plume has a turbulent structure comprised of odor filaments interspersed with clean air. As it propagates downwind, the plume becomes more dispersed and dilute, but filaments with concentrations above the threshold required to elicit a behavioral response from receiving organisms can persist for long distances. Flying insects orient along plumes by steering upwind, triggered by the optomotor reaction. Sequential measurements of differences in odor concentration are unreliable indicators of distance to or direction of the odor source. Plume intermittency and the plume's fine-scale structure can play a role in setting an insect's upwind course. The prowess of insects in navigating to odor sources has spawned bioinspired virtual models and even odor-seeking robots, although some of these approaches use mechanisms that are unnecessarily complex and probably exceed an insect's processing capabilities.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/Blog-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In contemporary society, <a href="https://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/whoqol-qualityoflife/en/">quality of life (QoL)</a> is a term used by economists, politicians, and people working across a range of other sectors and fields.  It is a concept used to measure the well-being of a population and societies, with various dimensions that can include material living situation and the environment, as well as subjective perceptions of an individual’s level of contentment with their life.</p>
<p>To healthcare professionals, quality of life has a more specific meaning, and is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/index.htm">Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</a>. HRQoL is an individual’s perception of how they view their general health status which includes physical wellness, emotional well-being, and social functioning. HRQoL is now frequently used in the clinical setting to monitor the quality of healthcare services given to patients, as patients are increasingly recognised as the centre of the healthcare system in today’s era.</p>
<p>A patient’s self-reported HRQoL has been shown to provide a good measure of their overall health status; reflecting their disease burden, mental well-being and social wellness that they experience. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that for patients with various health conditions, their self-report of HRQoL provides a good measure of their future health outcomes. What is less clear however, is whether HRQoL could also be used in the general community population, rather than just patients, to predict an individual’s future health; and thus, to help identify those individuals who are at risk of poorer health outcomes and where active interventions might be required. A systematic review is needed to provide robust evidence to address this question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/what-are-systematic-reviews">A systematic review</a> is important because it provide a comprehensive summary that includes all of the published studies which have investigated a given research question. For this reason, it is considered less prone to bias, including all relevant data rather than selecting data which confirms an existing hypothesis. Therefore, the finding from a clearly defined and robustly conducted systematic review can provide solid evidence which can then be used for developing clinical recommendations and making evidence-based policies. This was the premise for our study.</p>
<p>We undertook the first systematic review to determine whether an individual’s HRQoL was a good predictor of their future risk of dying. Our review included data from 47 studies with a total of approximately 1,200,000 participants living in the community (both with and without existing health conditions). Most participants were aged 65 years and older.</p>
<p>The studies varied in their duration, with some being very short (9 months between when the HRQoL was measured and death was recorded), and others much longer, by following participants for up to 18 years after HRQoL was assessed.</p>
<p>Our study found that individuals who reported poorer HRQoL were more likely to die and in a shorter time. Interestingly, we found that poorer physical HRQoL rather than mental HRQoL was most predictive of their risk of dying during the study.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we suggest that doctors should incorporate a HRQoL questionnaire into an annual screening checklist for individuals attending their clinical practice. This could be used to identify individuals at higher risk for future adverse health outcomes, and who may not otherwise be detected. This practice could in turn enable initiation of active interventions for those individuals at high risk of poorer health outcomes.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How do children learn to fear things that aren’t obviously scary, but that do pose a threat — to learn, say, that touching the base of a lit barbecue is a very bad idea, so should never be done? A parent might explain that it’s dangerously hot. But as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74170-1">new paper</a> published in <em>Scientific Reports</em> explores in detail, we also benefit from another more direct, wordless method of learning about threats. Or rather, we may typically benefit from it — but, Marie-France Marin at the University of Quebec and her colleagues argue, it might also help to explain how anxiety disorders are transmitted down through generations.</p>



<span id="more-40758"></span>



<p>Marin and her team set out to explore so-called vicarious learning between 83 child-parent pairs. This entails learning by observing another person’s reactions to objects or events. So if a child sees a parent flinch after touching  a lit barbecue, despite never having experienced that pain themselves, they can learn never to do it. The team wanted to look, though, at how this type of learning might manifest at the physiological level. Fear and anxiety are characterised by an increase in physiological arousal — a raised heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and so on — all of which gear up the individual for fight or flight.</p>



<p>For this study, the team focused on skin conductance as an indicator of general physiological arousal. Each parent was fitted with sensors to measure this, as well as electrodes that were set to deliver an “annoying” rather than painful shock. The parent was then videotaped while they watched, via a monitor, a lamp that flashed various colours. When one particular colour flashed (either red or blue), five times out of eight the parent received a shock. When another colour (yellow) was flashed, a shock was never administered. They learned, then, to associate one particular colour with receiving a shock, and one with being safe.</p>



<p>Each child was shown the video of their own parent’s reactions and also a video of a stranger of the same sex as their parent undergoing the same procedure. (The shocks were associated with a different colour for the stranger and parent: if the parent was shocked when a red light flashed, for instance, the stranger was shocked when the blue light flashed). The child was then put in the same experimental set-up as the adults, except that they were never actually shocked.</p>



<p>The skin conductance data showed that children reacted with alarm to the red and blue lights, but not the yellow light. They had, then, learned to fear the colours associated with a shock to either their parent or a stranger. This suggests that children can learn from any adult, at least to some extent. But the team also found that children who showed greater “physiological synchrony” with their parent — so the child’s shifts in skin conductance levels more closely mirrored those of its parent during the course of the experiment — had stronger alarm reactions when they saw their parent being shocked. This suggests that children who are better “tuned” into their parents’ emotional states vicariously learn fear faster. (Exactly what underpins “better tuning” is not clear, but the quality of the parent/child relationship and the expressiveness of the adult will play a role.)</p>



<p>In the real world, the team notes, “parents transmit a lot of information to their children through their body language and their reactions to environmental stimuli”. If a parent responds appropriately to objects or events in the environment — signalling an appropriate level of fear or pain in response to something that is genuinely dangerous, but not to non-threats — then the child will clearly benefit. However, if the parent has a fear or anxiety disorder and becomes afraid or anxious when there is no genuine threat, their child could then learn these inappropriate responses.</p>



<p>Anxiety disorders often emerge in childhood, with a median age of onset of 11. “Given that [the] risk for anxiety and fear-based disorders is transmitted within families, it is essential to study how children form fearful associations when learning from their parent’s experience,” the researchers stress. Clearly, there’s more work to be done to understand these processes, but this research suggests that the level of physiological synchrony between a child and parent has an influence. This is an area that the team now plans to explore further, in the hope of finding new approaches to preventing or treating anxiety disorders in children.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/04/five-strange-facts-about-dreams/">Five Strange Facts About Dreams</a></h4>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The latest episode of our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/03/episode-22-drifting-minds-maladaptive-daydreaming-and-the-hypnagogic-state/">PsychCrunch podcast</a> explores the blurry boundaries between wakefulness and dreaming. Presenter Ella Rhodes examines that strange transition period between being awake and falling asleep known as hypnagogia. She also learns about maladaptive daydreaming, a condition in which people can lose themselves in their daydreams for hours at a time.</p>



<p>To coincide with the release of the podcast, we’ve examined five strange findings about dreaming from the psychology literature:</p>



<span id="more-40745"></span>



<p><strong>1. Bad dreams are nothing to fear</strong></p>



<p>No one likes a bad dream, but they do serve a purpose: research suggests that they prepare us to better face our fears. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24843">This finding comes from a two-part study</a>. First, participants slept with EEG electrodes fitted to their heads. Several times in the night, they were woken by the researchers, who asked them about the content and emotional tone of any dreams. The team found that the key brain regions that are active when someone is feeling fear are the same whether they are awake or dreaming.</p>



<p>In a follow-up experiment, a fresh group of participants were shown a series of upsetting images, such as pictures of assaults. The more fear they’d experienced during their previous night’s sleep, the less fear they felt in response to these images. Dream fear had, it seems, reined in their fear reactions in waking life. “Dreams may be considered as real training for our future reactions and may potentially prepare us to face real life dangers,” says researcher Lampros Perogamvros at the University of Geneva.</p>



<p><strong>2. You can control your dreams</strong></p>



<p>During a so-called lucid dream, the dreamer realises that they are dreaming and can control what happens. There has been no end of attempts to find ways to induce lucid dreams — mostly unsuccessfully. However, <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/drm0000059">a study at the University of Adelaide, Australia</a>, that explored a few potential techniques found that one was effective. When used in the five minutes immediately before falling asleep, the “MILD” (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams) technique worked 46 % of the time. It consists of simply repeating (to yourself) the phrase: “The next time I’m dreaming, I will remember that I’m dreaming.”</p>



<p><strong>3. People who no longer think can still dream</strong></p>



<p>Auto-activation deficit is a condition, caused by damage to the basal ganglia, in which people not only report having no thoughts, but have lost all self-motivation. They have to be told by carers to do everything from brushing their teeth to eating. However, even though their mind is a blank while they’re awake, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/136/10/3076/329883">research published by a team in France</a>, shows that some, at least, do still dream. This group was much less likely to experience REM-stage dreams than healthy people, and the dreams they did have were lacking the complexity and emotion that characterises typical dreams. But they did still have some dreams. For example, one patient dreamed of shaving (something he could no longer do by himself), while another dreamed of writing, although, while awake, he never wrote anything without being instructed. </p>



<p>The simplicity of these patients’ dreams (together with the identification of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00187/full">a role for the basal ganglia in integrating information from various brain regions</a>) supports the “bottom-up” theory of dreaming — that dreams are initiated by activity in the brainstem, which is then followed by cortical input, which allows for complex emotional and sensory experiences.</p>



<p><strong>4. Certain drugs can allow you to “dream” while awake</strong></p>



<p>The psychedelic drug DMT (one of the main psychoactive constituents of ayahuasca) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51974-4">produces brain rhythms that look at lot like those observed during dreaming</a>. The team behind this finding reported that, compared with participants who’d received a placebo, the DMT group had much less alpha wave activity (the dominant electrical rhythm while we are awake) and also showed an increase in theta waves, which are associated with dreaming. “From the altered brainwaves and the participants’ reports, it’s clear these people are completely immersed in their experience,” comments lead researcher, Christopher Timmermann at Imperial College, London. “It’s like daydreaming only far more vivid and immersive — it’s like dreaming but with your eyes open.”</p>



<p><strong>5. Some people’s daydreams take over their lives</strong></p>



<p>For some people, their daydreams are so vivid and absorbing that “real life” fades into the background. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/25/people-with-maladaptive-daydreaming-spend-an-average-of-four-hours-a-day-lost-in-their-imagination/">As one sufferer of Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) explains it</a>: “I am careful to control my actions in public so it is not evident that my mind is constantly spinning these stories and I am constantly lost in them.” Although MD does not feature in standard mental health diagnostic manuals, there are online <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/">communities </a>dedicated to it. And as the researchers behind a recent study on MD write in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/">their paper</a>, “in recent years it has gradually become evident that daydreaming can evolve into an extreme and maladaptive behaviour, up to the point where it turns into a clinically significant condition.” </p>



<p>In a bid to better understand the mental health factors that accompany MD, Eli Somer at the University of Haifa, Israel and Nirit Soffer-Dudek at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev studied 77 self-diagnosed sufferers. The pair found that obsessive-compulsive symptoms predicted the intensity and duration of maladaptive daydreaming on the following day. However, few participants actually suffered from obsessive compulsive <em>disorder</em>, suggesting that while the two may share some common mechanisms, MD isn’t simply a type of OCD. The next step is to develop strategies to help sufferers control their daydreaming, so that it no longer constitutes a disorder. You can hear Soffer-Dudek talk more about her work in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/03/episode-22-drifting-minds-maladaptive-daydreaming-and-the-hypnagogic-state/">this week’s podcast</a>.</p>

<p>In this episode, Ella Rhodes, journalist for <em>The Psychologist</em>, explores the boundaries between wakefulness and dreaming. What can we can learn about consciousness from the strange transition period between being awake and asleep, known as hypnagogia? And why do some people experience visions and imaginings that take them away for hours at a time?</p>

<p>Open Access Week returned this year, bringing back themes of equity and inclusivity to the forefront of the community once again, as it has done in the past. </p>



<p>This OA week PLOS coordinated and participated in a mix of activities to illustrate the positive impacts Open Access can have on the scientific community and explored strategies to ensure that Open Access truly is open for everyone.<br /><br /><strong>Open Access Week 2020 with the Drexel Libraries</strong><br /><br />On October 20, Emily Chenette, <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief was a  virtual speaker at Drexel Libraries’, <a href="https://libcal.library.drexel.edu/event/7210114"><em>How Open Access Supports ‘Good Science’</em></a>. In this session, Emily explored questions such as: <em>what comes to mind when you think about good science? Is it reproducible? Impactful? Accessible? </em></p>



<p>The discussion delved into what we mean when we talk about good science, and how Open Access supports the practice and publication of it. She also discussed the steps PLOS takes to ensure that published papers are open and accessible, reproducible, conducted ethically, and contribute to the base of academic knowledge.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Voices and opinions of OA advocates</strong><br /><br />Throughout this year’s OA Week we saw a great number of people stand up and take part in a collection of online activities to share their thoughts in support of Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>One of the great things about OA Week is hearing from the community with their thoughts and opinions on what matters to them most. A lot of those people took part in our daily polls: </p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PLOS/timelines/1319329649332228097"><em>What is the most important reason to publish #OpenAccess?</em></a><em> </em></p>

<p><br /><strong>Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</strong><br /><br />This OA Week we took the time to reflect on the importance of research accessibility and the many benefits of Open Access in our blog post, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/building-equity-and-inclusivity-in-science/"><em>Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</em></a>. Don’t miss it! </p>



<p>PLOS’ entire ethos is built on the idea of research being open to a global community, however, we know there’s still plenty of work for us to do to make things better for researchers across the world. In this post we highlight the benefits of OA and what PLOS can do to make our journals more inclusive, equitable and diverse for the scientific community as a whole.<br /><br /><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">Read more on our plans for a more inclusive future.</a><br /><strong><br />What’s next?</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>We will continue to make PLOS an increasingly more inclusive, transparent and diverse platform for researchers across the globe to showcase their crucial findings. A part of this work has already started as we aim to bridge the gap between researchers and Open Access with the introduction of our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> initiative and our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">institutional partnerships</a>. Together with our latest message on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">price transparency</a> we hope our latest opportunities and resources will help researchers open their research and trust in science. </p>

From Google's English:  "Society needs humanistic knowledge. The humanities need to reach out to society. Therefore, for the sixth year in a row, the think tank Humtank awards the Humtank Prize to academics or institutions that have made a meritorious contribution to important humanities perspectives in society. This year's winner is the Royal Library, and this is the motivation:

 

The Royal Library (KB) has, by opening up its entire digitized newspaper archive on the internet during the corona pandemic, paved the way into the future. In a time marked by copyright and commercial tunnel events, KB gave everyone the opportunity to explore almost 400 years of Swedish news reporting and history - regardless of where they are in the country. A temporary copyright agreement meant that the entire archive could only be accessed freely for a few months, but through the initiative, the library has opened a wide window, which no researcher or good citizen wants to see closed anymore. In a far-sighted and meritorious way, KB has thus shown a genuinely digitized future, where history is free and accessible for everyone to explore."

In response to this threat, humans react in ways to boost their self-esteem and reinforce their own values (and punish outsiders). These cognitive processes are conceptualized as nebulous “defenses”  [<i>nebulous to me, at least</i>] that are deployed to minimize terror. Notably, however, experimental manipulation of mortality salience did <b><i>not</i></b> affect “worldview defense” in the large-scale <a href="https://www.cos.io/blog/many-labs-4-failure-replicate-mortality-salience-effect-and-without-original-author-involvement" target="_blank">Many Labs 4</a> replication project, which throws cold water on this aspect of TMT.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Predictive Coding and Perceived Risk of COVID-19</b><br /></p><p>An alternative view of how we disassociate ourselves from death awareness is provided by predictive coding theory.

A recent paper considered this framework with regard to beliefs generated during the pandemic, and how they're related to health precautions adopted by individuals to mitigate spread of the virus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242918/" target="_blank">Bottemanne et al, 2020</a>).

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/30/october-2020-highlights/">October 2020 Highlights</a></h4>

<p>The arXiv team has been busy this month! Here’s a recap.</p>
<p>Authors can now submit their work using <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/24/tex-live-2020-release-oct-1-2020/"><strong>TeXLive 2020</strong></a>, the most recent version of the TeX open source markup language that enables precision formatting for academic writing. The rollout was seamless, with zero interruptions in service. TeXLive 2020 — and, psst, an upcoming TeX log error highlighting feature — make submission smoother for authors.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="arXivLabs logo" class="alignright wp-image-682 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-150x150.png" width="150" /><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a></strong> – a new framework for collaboration – was launched. Plus, exciting new functionality was released in the arXivLabs tabs section of the abstract record page. Based on user feedback, it’s fabs. Code can now be linked to articles, thanks to the <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/">Papers with Code</a> collaboration.  Readers can also now easily check out articles that match their interest when they activate the <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/15/core-recommender-now-supports-article-discovery-on-arxiv/">CORE Recommender</a>. Community collaboration and cutting-edge features are important to authors and readers – which means they’re important to the arXiv team too.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/"><strong>new classifier</strong></a> was integrated into the submission system. This helps place papers in the right category, which is critical to helping research reach the right audience. The author experience didn’t change with this upgrade, but – bonus! – this classifier code is totally transparent and publicly available so that others can build up on it.</p>

This event also kicked off <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/19/giving-week-why-arxiv/">Giving Week</a>, arXiv’s first community fundraiser since the pandemic began. We were heartened to receive nearly 1400 individual donations, ranging from $5 to $1000. Each and every gift helps ensure that arXiv remains a non-commercial, community resource. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>Last, and certainly not least, arXiv hosted its very first <strong>virtual board meeting</strong>, where members of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board">Member Advisory Board</a> gathered to hear about updates, plans, challenges and opportunities — and provide their valuable insights. The meeting was intense and fruitful, with discussions ranging from big picture strategy to daily operations like moderator recruitment. Some of our board members have volunteered in this capacity for more than a decade, and we’re grateful that they continually inspire the staff to serve authors, readers, and open science. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/xcSDQxO7WxU/">PLOS Update</a></h4>

<p>Over four years ago we launched PLOS Channels to highlight research and news relevant to our research communities. Eventually, the portfolio grew to include 13 Channels in topics from stem cells to tuberculosis to cholera (see the full list below). New content was added to Channels by expert Channel Editors, who selected articles to include in a journal- and publisher-agnostic manner. Channels were initially conceived as a meaningful space to serve a variety of communities beyond typical journal boundaries and challenge the assessment of impact and importance of research.  </p>



<p>Today, we are announcing that we have made the difficult decision to stop updating the Channels. Despite positive feedback from some authors and their institutions, we have not seen the usage from the community that would allow us to achieve our goals. Moreover, we were not able to scale the program to meet everyone’s needs, and we suspect that post-publication curation of content may be best done by a neutral third party, rather than an organisation like PLOS, which publishes some of the content included in the Channels. </p>



<p>The content in all Channels will be archived and will remain available online. The following two Channels will migrate to PLOS Curated Collections, where they will continue to be updated with relevant research from PLOS to connect people to content and inspire collaboration:</p>



<p>–      <a href="https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc">  Veterans Disability &amp; Rehabilitation Research</a>: to maintain our commitment to the Veteran’s Administration</p>



<p>–      <a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs">  Disease Forecasting &amp; Surveillance</a>: because the current pandemic demonstrates the essential nature of this content, and its curation. This Channel will be renamed to Infectious Disease Epidemiology to ensure that all relevant content on this important topic is included.</p>



<p>PLOS would not exist without the people who believe in our mission and values, and who help us with  projects like Channels. We rely on scientists like our Channel Editors to keep pushing us on our collective journey to make science more open, accessible and transparent.</p>



<p>On behalf of everyone at PLOS, we want to thank all our Channel Editors and Administrators (past &amp; present) for their tireless work and dedication and all of the loyal subscribers who have followed PLOS Channels over the years. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You have truly enriched our organization and science as a whole.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kucfd8ARAo8/">How do researchers evaluate research?</a></h4>

<p>PLOS has received a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org/">Alfred</a><a href="https://sloan.org/"> P. Sloan Foundation</a> to study how researchers evaluate both the <strong>credibility </strong>and <strong>impact </strong>of research outputs (e.g. articles, preprints, data, and code). We will be conducting this research in partnership with the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/">American Society for Cell Biology</a><strong> </strong>(ASCB).</p>



<p>We’ll be looking at this in two contexts: (1) when researchers are <em>discovering </em>and <em>reading </em>these outputs in the process of their own research, and (2) when they are <em>assessing </em>these outputs while participating in grant application review panels and hiring committees.</p>



<p>We are interested in characterizing the steps that researchers go through to form judgments of both credibility and impact in these two contexts.</p>



<h3>Why is this new research needed?</h3>



<p>Previous research has explored the factors that influence trust and how researchers decide which articles to read and cite, showing that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-140725">personal inspection</a>, social clues, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206">peer review</a>, are important. Recently, preprints have created new challenges for researchers who evaluate large amounts of new information outside of the traditional framework of journal peer review. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux">survey by the Center for Open Science</a> suggested that cues related to Open Science content (e.g. signaling open availability of data) and independent verification are important for judging credibility of preprints.</p>



<p>Yet, the current system for assessing research is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914">dominated by signifiers of </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914"><strong>impact</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Since impact cannot be known until after time has passed, various proxies have been used that signal perceived, or the potential for, impact such as publication in a high Impact Factor journal.</p>



<p>PLOS and other organizations, in particular the multi-stakeholder organization <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA, </a>have stressed the negative consequences of such a narrow focus on proxies of impact and the need for reform. Most problematically, researchers are pushed to place a higher priority on pursuing these proxies than on making their research <strong>credible</strong>, <strong>reproducible, </strong>and <strong>reusable.</strong></p>



<p>Many have suggested that this focus on proxies for impact in research assessment is at least in part due to the <strong>practical limitations in evaluating credibility and impact</strong>. By understanding what truly matters to researchers in forming these judgments, we hope to find insights that can inform better practice in research assessment, inspire better tools for researchers, and help us evolve how we signal the markers of credibility in the articles we publish.</p>



<h3>Collaboration with ASCB</h3>



<p>We are not undertaking this project alone! We are excited to be conducting this research in collaboration with the ASCB. This partnership helps maximize the connection of this project to the research community. As the organizational sponsor of DORA, ASCB is also a scientific association demonstrably dedicated to advocating sound research policies and improving research culture.</p>



<h3>What comes after the research?</h3>



<p>We will publish a report on the insights obtained through this research. This report will have a CC BY license, with anonymized and aggregated data.</p>



<p>Future research might include a quantitative initiative to validate the findings with a broader group of researchers. Ultimately, we would like to understand if there are opportunities to better serve researchers’ needs to assess and discover new research than currently available methods. Therefore, we also hope that our initial report will prompt further research by others, which we believe is important for the research and scholarly communication communities. We are very thankful to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for their interest in this research project and dedicated support of <a href="https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/scholarly-communication">Scholarly Communication</a> issues in general.</p>



<p>We are confident that improvements to research assessment culture and practice are possible. And we also believe that there is no more important a moment to be doing this, as we experience a global crisis during which unbiased, rigorous, and credible research will play an unprecedented role.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">History was made this year when two women, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a genome editing method using CRISPR-Cas9, which has numerous applications in the editing of plant and animal genomes. However, even before the discovery of CRISPR-Cas’ use in DNA editing, the use of genome editing techniques in humans has long been considered unethical, with many countries making it illegal to edit human embryos. In 2018, the highly-controversial birth of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">‘CRISPR babies’</a> – twin girls allegedly born with CRISPR-edited genomes – shocked the world and renewed discussions about the ethics and legality of such practices.</p>
<p>Using cystic fibrosis scenarios as functional examples, Schleidgen <em>et al. </em>explore three consistently-debated issues of human germline therapies in relation to CRISPR-Cas: the risks of using the tool in human germline editing, what responsibilities future generations bear and whether the treatment is legitimate.</p>
<p>The authors argue that categorically prohibiting the use of CRISPR-Cas ‘one-generation germline therapies’ – which would theoretically phenotypically cure the developing embryo, but ensure that the changes are not passed onto offspring – would not be legally or ethically justifiable, provided that concepts surrounding human germline editing are clarified.</p>

<p>There are currently no unified guidelines to help individual healthcare professionals (and medical students) assess bias across different study types, an essential skill in the practice of evidence-based medicine. Study type-specific tools do currently exist, such as those that aid in the assessment of bias in observational studies, but can’t be reliably applied to other study types, such as randomized trials.</p>
<p>Luijendijk <em>et al.</em> have identified this gap and also argue that current frameworks are limited in requiring only methodological knowledge to detect bias, as some study aspects may only be appraised using subject-matter knowledge. In order to generate a unified framework, they applied a popular conceptual framework typically used only in observational studies to randomized trials, by defining the research question in terms of study population, intervention and outcome, and using causal diagrams to illustrate how each source of bias can lead to over- or under-estimations of treatment effects. The developed framework allows for the identification of three sources of bias independent of study design: bias due to a common cause, bias due to systematic measurement error, and bias due to a common effect.</p>

<p>The human gut is colonized by many commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which constitute part of the gut microbiome. Since it was established that the composition of the human gut microbiome can have major impacts on our health, the field of research has rapidly grown; in the last 40 years,<a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/9/1716?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"> 80% of human gut microbiome research was published between 2013 and 2017.</a> <em>Bifidobacteria</em> are relatively abundant in the human gut, and attract particular interest due to their potential for use as probiotics (live bacteria that are considered to be good for health) and as targets of prebiotics (substances that increase the abundance or activity of existing bacteria).</p>
<p>In their study, Chung <em>et al.</em> investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of AXOS (arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, which have been demonstrated to promote the abundance of <em>Bifidobacteria</em>) on gut microbiota. They carried out a crossover, randomised, double-blind trial whereby the diets of elderly volunteers were supplemented with AXOS or maltodextrin, and their effects on faecal bacteria and blood serum parameters were measured.</p>
<p>The faecal samples analysed revealed an increase in <em>Bifidobacteria </em>observed across the entire cohort in response to AXOS supplementation, independent of the observed inter-individual variation in gut microbiota. However, variation in the levels of baseline <em>Prevotella</em> species of gut bacteria did determine how responsive each patient was to AXOS supplementation. The authors conclude that AXOS supplementation is bifidogenic, suggesting that AXOS may be considered a viable prebiotic option in the elderly, and due to the influence of existing gut bacteria on the bifidogenic response, call for the consideration of microbiota profiling when testing the efficacy of prebiotics.</p>

<p>Conventional cigarette smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse effects on both mother and baby health, and is amongst one of the leading preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. The difficulties of quitting smoking during pregnancy have led many to consider alternatives to conventional cigarettes, such as electronic or ‘e’ cigarettes. As they contain fewer toxic chemicals than conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are largely believed to have fewer adverse health effects compared to traditional cigarettes, but there is little evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Authors Sooyong Kim and Sanda Cristina Oancea sought to determine whether e-cigarettes are safer in pregnancy than conventional cigarettes, by extracting and analysing data from the PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) study cohort, a large study that included data on 55,000 pregnancies. Participants were classified into three groups: complete tobacco abstinence, exclusive conventional cigarette use, and exclusive e-cigarette use, and adverse birth outcomes were defined as low birth weight, preterm birth and ‘small for gestational age’. They found that, when compared to conventional cigarette users, the risk of each adverse birth outcome was not significantly reduced, and e-cigarettes cannot be considered to be safer than conventional cigarettes. Following this, the authors encourage the complete abstinence from all tobacco products during pregnancy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/r-sIMq0e_IE/">Author Interview: Luca Morgantini on Burnout among Healthcare Professionals in COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Dr. Luca Morgantini worked with a diverse group of researchers to survey healthcare professionals across the globe to study the degree of burnout they were experiencing. For their <em>PLOS ONE</em> article, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238217">Factors contributing to healthcare professional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid turnaround global survey</a>, they surveyed 2,700 individuals across 60 countries in April 2020 and found that burnout had generally increased compared to pre-pandemic times. I asked Luca on whether there were any surprises he came across during this study, the scientific communities’ response to the crisis and more. </p>



<p><strong><em>This paper seems outside the scope of your usual work. How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: I decided to document the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers the moment I saw non-medical parts of our society downplay what was happening in March, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus was starting to spread in Europe and North America. This research is important because we gathered data during the height of the pandemic, providing solid foundations for future healthcare policies while avoiding recall biases.</p>



<p>It was evident from the reports of my Chinese friends and colleagues how serious was this disease, with Wuhan going on lockdown in late January. I observed how the infection slowly spread to the rest of the world hitting Italy, my home country, particularly hard. I completed my medical training in Milan, where my colleagues found themselves working in the red zone without adequate protection or directives from their supervisors. Soon the pandemic reached the United States, where I am currently living. While study is outside my usual scope of work, as a healthcare professional and researcher I felt the need to play my part in the fight against COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong><em>I note that you originally uploaded the manuscript to MedRxiv as a preprint. At what time in your career did you start thinking about Open Science, and why is it important to you?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: I believe that Open Science is essential for a fair and accessible future of science. Paywalls and other accessibility restrictions disproportionally affect early-career investigators or individuals with less economic means. I have been personally impacted by these paywalls, as institutions often cannot offer a subscription to all the countless scientific publishers. I understand there is a delicate balance between accessibility and profit, but I am convinced that other business models are feasible.</p>



<p>My team chose to publish a preprint on MedRxiv and then published our article on <em>PLOS ONE</em>, because one of the purposes of our research is to make all our collected data freely available for other researchers.</p>



<p><strong><em>You additionally opted to publish your peer review history with your publication. What led you to this decision and how important do you think transparency of the review process is?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: We decided to publish the peer review history for two reasons. First, we believe this is a way to recognize the tremendous work done by the Editor and the Reviewers. They significantly contributed to the relevance of our manuscript by providing constructive comments, and we want to acknowledge their role in our publication by making their comments public.</p>



<p>Second, we believe in the importance of a transparent review process. This will allow other researchers investigating this field to understand what the concerns of the reviewers were.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you consider this research interdisciplinary? If so, how crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of this type of research?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: Burnout is a complex phenomenon and an interdisciplinary approach allowed our team to evaluate it from different perspectives. My co-authors have different backgrounds in urology, psychiatry, biostatistics and epidemiology research. The heterogeneity of our team was essential in creating a short but comprehensive questionnaire.</p>



<p>An interdisciplinary team of reviewers is important for the same reasons. Analyzing such complex arguments from different points of view is required to better assess the eventual limitations of each study.</p>



<p><strong><em>Were you particularly surprised by anything your study uncovered or were the results generally what you expected?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: To be honest, we were simply amazed by the number of healthcare professionals that participated in our study. I feel that they appreciated our process because we were as inclusive as possible, considering parts of the healthcare workforce and geographical areas that are often overlooked in healthcare research. From the comments we received, we noticed how they appreciated our effort to study their quality of work and life, and their willingness to make their COVID-19 experiences count.</p>



<p>One of the most surprising results was the selflessness and dedication of healthcare workers: the vast majority is willing to continue working despite the obvious risk. Their main concern is not infecting themselves, but bringing the virus home to friends and loved ones. These results were consistent across all countries, genders, and healthcare professions.</p>



<p><strong><em>In your Conclusion, you mention a few actions that could potentially mitigate burnout for healthcare professionals. Are there any that you would particularly like to see pursued by institutions and other stakeholders?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: It is evident how our society and healthcare systems were not ready to withstand the first wave of a global pandemic. When the Spanish flu infected an estimated half a billion individuals around a century ago, the scientific community was only starting to understand what viruses are and how pandemics evolve. COVID-19 is the first true global pandemic where modern science can play an active and aware role. This is an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to document and understand how to improve the condition of frontline healthcare workers. The manuscript we published represents only one of the hundreds of studies that are being conducted on this topic that all together will contribute to mitigating the negative effects of future pandemics.</p>



<p>In particular, we observed how training was mostly reported to be ineffective and how adequate protective equipment was rarely available. We understood how healthcare workers are more concerned about their families than themselves, and future policies that would assure the safety of their loved ones, such as periodical testing, kindergartens, or short term rentals close to hospitals, would greatly improve their quality of life.</p>



<p><strong><em>What have you seen from peers and the scientific community as a whole during the COVID-19 pandemic?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is performing an extraordinary and unprecedented synergic effort towards improving diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. I felt this willingness to help and collaborate while conducting this research, where I received tremendous support from my institution, colleagues, and expert researchers. The lessons learned during these difficult times will greatly help our scientific community and will help build a collaborative and constructive future. I am grateful to be part of this collective scientific effort that is one of the positive lessons to be learnt from this pandemic.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr. Michio Murakami, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, speaks on the significance of Luca’s work and the need to work through differences to improve our world. </em></p>



<p>MM: Among the many published COVID-19-related papers, the paper by Morgantini et al. is particularly significant. First, they conducted a rapid survey of 60 countries, highlighting that burnout of healthcare professionals is an important issue around the world. Second, it points out the importance of training and organizational support as a solution to address burnout. Ultimately, the paper points out an issue that is shared globally and presents findings that can lead to solutions.</p>



<p>COVID-19 and the associated social response pose a diverse range of physical and socio-psychological health problems. Some of these issues relate to discrimination, prejudice and social division. Different values and cultural worldviews, depending on the identity and position of individuals and groups, may lead to different opinions and social division. We need to be respectful of our values to individuals and different groups, and increase awareness of the fact that society is built on mutual reciprocity. There are shared goals and a vision of the world we can aspire to, even though our values may differ.</p>



<p>Needless to say, there are many aspects of our health that is supported by healthcare professionals, and none of us want a world in which many healthcare professionals leave their work. This paper by Morgantini et al. provides useful insights on this global issues that should be addressed and encourages further discussion about the vision of the world we aspire to.</p>



<p><em>I extend my gratitude to both Luca and Michio for providing their thoughtful comments and for their hard work as researchers. </em></p>

<p class="">The auditory cortex is found in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>. Most of it is hidden from view, buried deep within a fissure called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lateral-sulcus" target="_blank">lateral sulcus</a>. Some auditory cortex is visible on the external surface the brain, however, as it extends to a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/superior-temporal-gyrus" target="_blank">superior temporal gyrus</a>.</p><p class="">The auditory cortex can be subdivided into multiple regions, although there is still some question about the most appropriate way to create those subdivisions in the human brain. There is general agreement, however, that the auditory cortex consists of a primary area—which is often referred to as the <em>core</em> region—as well as multiple non-primary areas.</p><p class="">The primary auditory cortex in humans is hidden within the lateral sulcus on a collection of gyri known as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/heschls-gyri" target="_blank">Heschl’s gyri</a> (aka the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/transverse-temporal-gyri" target="_blank">transverse temporal gyri</a>). The precise location of the primary region in humans is variable, however, as is the arrangement of Heschl’s gyri (some people have one of these gyri, while others have two or three). For example, in some individuals the primary auditory cortex seems to occupy one Heschl’s gyrus, while in others it may extend past that gyrus into a neighboring <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/sulcus" target="_blank">sulcus</a> (or beyond).</p><p class="">The region adjacent to the core is often referred to as the <em>belt</em> region, and surrounding that is an area often called the <em>parabelt </em>region. These neighboring areas are mostly buried within the lateral sulcus as well, but may extend out to the superior temporal gyrus. The demarcations of the auditory cortex in general, however, are imprecise.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the auditory cortex and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech. Damage to the auditory cortex can disrupt various facets of auditory perception. For example, damage (e.g., like that caused by a stroke) might cause deficits in the ability to detect changes in pitch, localize sounds in space, or understand speech.</p><p class="">The auditory cortex primarily receives auditory information from a nucleus in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/medial-geniculate-nucleus" target="_blank">medial geniculate nucleus</a>, which is where all incoming information about hearing is sent before it is processed by the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a>. Cells in the primary region of the auditory cortex  (and in some parts of the non-primary regions as well) are arranged so they form what is known as a <em>tonotopic</em> map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (<em>Frequency</em>, when referring to sound waves, is related to <em>pitch</em>. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.) </p><p class="">The tonotopic arrangement of the primary auditory cortex is similar to what is seen in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea" target="_blank">cochlea</a>, where sound processing begins. Thus, it can be said that the core of the auditory cortex contains a map of the cochlea, with each point in the cochlea corresponding to a strip of cells in the auditory cortex. This type of arrangement is similar to what is seen in other sensory cortices (e.g., the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">primary somatosensory cortex</a> contains a map of the sensory receptors of the body).</p><p class="">There are thought to be other patterns of functional organization of the primary auditory cortex as well, although the importance of these patterns in hearing is still poorly understood. For example, there seem to be cells (EI cells) in the auditory cortex that are activated only by stimuli coming from one ear; they are inhibited by stimuli coming from the other ear. Other cells (EE cells) are activated by information coming from both ears.</p><p class="">Sensory processing in the areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex is also not well understood, but it is thought that cells in the belt and parabelt are involved in higher-level processing of complex sounds. For example, research suggests these non-primary areas of the auditory cortex may be important in recognizing species-specific vocalizations, which implies they play a role in processing speech in humans. Studies have also found the non-primary auditory regions to be involved in distinct aspects of speech perception, like detecting the beginning and end of syllables, attending to one voice while ignoring another, and processing sounds in a logical temporal order.</p><p class="">Overall, there is still much to be learned about the fine details of auditory processing in the auditory cortex. It is clear, however, that this part of the brain plays a critical role in creating the rich sensory experience of hearing.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Amunts K, Morosan P, Hilbig H, Zilles K.

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__items">
<div class="field__item">
<p>Eleonora Presani’s first day as executive director of <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> was March 16, 2020 – the same day much of New York state went into lockdown.</p>
<p>Although she was new to arXiv, the free and open scientific research database maintained and operated by Cornell, she realized immediately that some things would have to change.</p>
<p>“Basically out of nowhere, we started to see more than 100 [coronavirus-related] papers per week,” Presani said during an Oct. 19 panel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Rapid Response: How arXiv and Other Open-Access Resources Are Adapting to Research Community Needs During the Pandemic.”</a></p>
<p>“We had to do something about it,” she said, “to make sure we could process them at the same service level we provide for our other papers.”</p>
<p>The mission of arXiv is to make scholarly research that has not yet been published freely available to researchers around the world. When COVID-19 struck, this mission became even more urgent, as scientists raced to learn more about the coronavirus and develop ways to control the pandemic. But it also highlighted the challenges faced by preprint servers, including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, in providing easy access to a huge volume of research that has not yet been peer-reviewed while minimizing the spread of potential misinformation.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_749" style="width: 270px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;t"><img alt="image of arXiv Video Screenshot" class="wp-image-749 size-full" height="182" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM.png" width="270" /></a>To watch the panel discussion in its entirety, view it here.</figure>
<p>With nearly 1.8 million articles in its collection, arXiv relies on a team of 185 volunteer moderators, supported by a small team of staff, to screen submitted papers. But since the majority of its content is in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science, the organization needed to quickly escalate its expertise in COVID-related research.</p>
<p>In addition to creating a new searchable category for coronavirus articles, arXiv hired a Cornell postdoctoral researcher in biomedicine to help screen these articles for potentially misleading content. arXiv also has partnered with other organizations compiling open-access research, in order to make these articles more easily accessible and to speed the pace of discovery worldwide.</p>
<p>At bioRxiv and medRxiv – which saw huge spikes in submissions as COVID-19 spread – moderators soon realized they needed enhanced measures to combat the risk of harmful misinformation. When a paper posted in January claiming that inserts in coronavirus’ spike protein resembled protein sequences from HIV, technical issues with the paper provoked a storm of criticism that led to its withdrawal, said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, during the panel.</p>
<p>“But we also noticed during that weekend that the paper had been picked up by conspiracy-oriented websites who were discussing the possibility that the virus had been human-engineered,” Inglis said. “We decided to put up an additional caveat about the use of preprints – a large yellow banner that reminded readers that these were preprints and, among other things, they should not be reported in the U.S. media as established information.”</p>
<p>The sites, hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, also put in place additional screening practices, including two-step scrutiny of every paper. The screeners are looking for issues such as plagiarism and assertions that could harm the public if they turn out to be wrong, Inglis said.</p>
<p>“Part of this was an awareness of the fact that in all the furor about hydroxychloroquine, for example, the run on the drug was such that patients who really needed hydroxychloroquine were denied access to it,” he said. “We were very conscious of not wanting to add to that problem, or create another similar problem.”</p>
<p>Papers from arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv are among those included in CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset), a new dataset made available to leverage artificial intelligence to make a vast trove of coronavirus-related research more easily searchable.</p>
<p>“We wanted to take all the research about COVID-19 and coronavirus, going back all the way to the 1960s and 1970s when initial research about coronavirus started getting published, and make that available in a machine readable format,” said panelist Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager at Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which created CORD-19 in partnership with other research groups.</p>
<p>When CORD-19 started in March, it contained 29,000 papers. It now has more than 280,000.</p>
<p>“It’s been absolutely incredible,” Kohlmeier said. “And one of the great driving forces behind making all the content available was a lot of the scientific publishers and preprint servers banded together to make COVID-19-related research open access, which was a very important component to making this research available to scientists who wanted to analyze the entire universe of coronavirus-related research.”</p>
