Last year, psychologists B. Keith Payne and colleagues breathed new life into the debate over 'social priming' with a paper called Replicable effects of primes on human behavior.



Behavioral or social priming - the idea that subtle cues can exert large, unconscious influences on our behaviour - was a major topic of research for many years, but it's since been largely discredited. The field’s reputation suffered when Diederik Stapel, a leader in the field, was exposed as a fraud. Many resea

<p>Smart people tend to perform better at work, earn more money, be physically healthier, and be less likely to subscribe to authoritarian beliefs. But a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31437-001">new paper</a> reveals that a key aspect of intelligence – a strong “pattern-matching” ability, which helps someone readily learn a language, understand how another person is feeling or spot a stock market trend to exploit – has a darker side: it also makes that person more likely to learn and apply social stereotypes.</p>
<p>Previous studies exploring how a person’s cognitive abilities may affect their attitudes to other people have produced mixed results. But this might be because the questions asked in these studies were too broad.</p>
<p>In the new study, published in the<em> Journal of Experimental Biology</em>, David Lick, Adam Alter and Jonathan Freeman at New York University decided to home in on social stereotyping. “Because pattern detection is a core component of human intelligence, people with superior cognitive abilities may be equipped to efficiently learn and use stereotypes about social groups,” they theorised.</p>

<p>To explore this, they conducted a total of six online studies involving 1,257 people recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. In the first two studies, volunteers saw pictures of aliens that varied on four dimensions (colour, face shape, eye size, ears), with most of the blue aliens  paired with an “unfriendly” behaviour (like “spat in another alien’s face”) and most of the yellow aliens paired with a friendly behaviour (like “gave another alien a bouquet of flowers”). The volunteers also completed items from Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices, which assesses pattern-matching ability.</p>
<p>A subsequent memory test involved the same participants attempting to pair previously seen faces with their earlier behaviours, but there were also some new blue and yellow faces that actually they hadn’t seen before.  Participants who were better at pattern-matching were more likely to attribute unfriendly behaviours to new blue aliens than to new yellow aliens – suggesting that they’d learned colour–behaviour stereotypes more readily, and applied them.</p>
<p>In studies three and four, volunteers were instead shown realistic pictures of male human faces. The displays were manipulated, so that most of the faces with a wide nose (for some participants) or a narrow nose (for others) were paired with negative behaviours – like “laughed and jeered at a homeless person”. Most of the faces with the other nose type were paired with friendly behaviours – like “sent flowers to someone who was sick”.</p>
<p>After viewing the faces, the volunteers played a trust game involving sharing money. They were led to believe this was an unrelated interlude in the study. Before the game began, they chose an avatar from a large group of faces to represent them online. They then played 12 rounds of what they believed was a real game, each time with a different partner who was represented by their own avatar.</p>
<p>In fact, the volunteers weren’t playing with real partners, and the experimenters manipulated the “partners’'” avatar photos, so that some had wider noses, and some had narrower noses (there were also female “partners” whose nose width did not systematically vary). The team found that volunteers who did better on the test of pattern detection gave less money to partners whose avatars had a nose width related, in the earlier trial, to unfriendly behaviour.</p>
<p>However, when these volunteers were given new information that contradicted the stereotype they had implicitly developed, the better pattern-detectors were also quicker to update their stereotype – to reverse their biases.</p>
<p>In a final experiment, the team used a real-world set of stereotypes, relating to traits they believe are often associated with men (such as being more authoritative) and with women (such as being more submissive). After counter-stereotype training – effectively being told that being authoritative is more associated with women rather than men, for example – good pattern-detectors showed a stronger decrease in stereotyping.</p>
<p>“To our knowledge, these findings are the first to systematically demonstrate that cognitive ability is associated with greater stereotyping,” the researchers write, before adding, “people with superior pattern detection abilities appear to act as naive empiricists, both learning and updating their stereotypes based on incoming information.”</p>
<p>While existing research tends to focus on the benefits of intelligence, these “findings join a small body of work guiding the field toward a more balanced understanding of the consequences of human aptitudes,” they note. For example, it’s also been suggested that superior, misguided, pattern-matching <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19969378">may play a role in obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD).</p>

<p>
 The clinical benefit for patients with diverse types of metastatic cancers that has been observed upon blockade of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 has highlighted the importance of this inhibitory axis in the suppression of tumour-specific T-cell responses. Notwithstanding the key role of PD-L1 expression by cells within the tumour micro-environment, our understanding of the regulation of the PD-L1 protein is limited. Here we identify, using a haploid genetic screen, CMTM6, a type-3 transmembrane protein of previously unknown function, as a regulator of the PD-L1 protein. Interference with CMTM6 expression results in impaired PD-L1 protein expression in all human tumour cell types tested and in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, through both a haploid genetic modifier screen in CMTM6-deficient cells and genetic complementation experiments, we demonstrate that this function is shared by its closest family member, CMTM4, but not by any of the other CMTM members tested. Notably, CMTM6 increases the PD-L1 protein pool without affecting PD-L1 (also known as CD274) transcription levels. Rather, we demonstrate that CMTM6 is present at the cell surface, associates with the PD-L1 protein, reduces its ubiquitination and increases PD-L1 protein half-life. Consistent with its role in PD-L1 protein regulation, CMTM6 enhances the ability of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells to inhibit T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that PD-L1 relies on CMTM6/4 to efficiently carry out its inhibitory function, and suggest potential new avenues to block this pathway.

<p>
 Developmental deconvolution of complex organs and tissues at the level of individual cells remains challenging. Non-invasive genetic fate mapping has been widely used, but the low number of distinct fluorescent marker proteins limits its resolution. Much higher numbers of cell markers have been generated using viral integration sites, viral barcodes, and strategies based on transposons and CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing; however, temporal and tissue-specific induction of barcodes in situ has not been achieved. Here we report the development of an artificial DNA recombination locus (termed Polylox) that enables broadly applicable endogenous barcoding based on the Cre–loxP recombination system. Polylox recombination in situ reaches a practical diversity of several hundred thousand barcodes, allowing tagging of single cells. We have used this experimental system, combined with fate mapping, to assess haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fates in vivo. Classical models of haematopoietic lineage specification assume a tree with few major branches. More recently, driven in part by the development of more efficient single-cell assays and improved transplantation efficiencies, different models have been proposed, in which unilineage priming may occur in mice and humans at the level of HSCs. We have introduced barcodes into HSC progenitors in embryonic mice, and found that the adult HSC compartment is a mosaic of embryo-derived HSC clones, some of which are unexpectedly large. Most HSC clones gave rise to multilineage or oligolineage fates, arguing against unilineage priming, and suggesting coherent usage of the potential of cells in a clone. The spreading of barcodes, both after induction in embryos and in adult mice, revealed a basic split between common myeloid–erythroid development and common lymphocyte development, supporting the long-held but contested view of a tree-like haematopoietic structure.

<p>
 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) pose challenges for drug discovery efforts because of the high degree of structural homology in the orthosteric pocket, particularly for GPCRs within a single subfamily, such as the nine adrenergic receptors. Allosteric ligands may bind to less-conserved regions of these receptors and therefore are more likely to be selective. Unlike orthosteric ligands, which tonically activate or inhibit signalling, allosteric ligands modulate physiologic responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, and may therefore have fewer adverse effects. The majority of GPCR crystal structures published to date were obtained with receptors bound to orthosteric antagonists, and only a few structures bound to allosteric ligands have been reported. Compound 15 (Cmpd-15) is an allosteric modulator of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) that was recently isolated from a DNA-encoded small-molecule library. Orthosteric β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, known as beta-blockers, are amongst the most prescribed drugs in the world and Cmpd-15 is the first allosteric beta-blocker. Cmpd-15 exhibits negative cooperativity with agonists and positive cooperativity with inverse agonists. Here we present the structure of the β2AR bound to a polyethylene glycol-carboxylic acid derivative (Cmpd-15PA) of this modulator. Cmpd-15PA binds to a pocket formed primarily by the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments 1, 2, 6 and 7 as well as intracellular loop 1 and helix 8. A comparison of this structure with inactive- and active-state structures of the β2AR reveals the mechanism by which Cmpd-15 modulates agonist binding affinity and signalling.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/A_4Jw-DOLws/nature23643">CMTM6 maintains the expression of PD-L1 and regulates anti-tumour immunity</a></h4>

<p>
 Cancer cells exploit the expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand 1 (PD-L1) to subvert T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. The success of therapies that disrupt PD-L1-mediated tumour tolerance has highlighted the need to understand the molecular regulation of PD-L1 expression. Here we identify the uncharacterized protein CMTM6 as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in a broad range of cancer cells, by using a genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 screen. CMTM6 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds PD-L1 and maintains its cell surface expression. CMTM6 is not required for PD-L1 maturation but co-localizes with PD-L1 at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes, where it prevents PD-L1 from being targeted for lysosome-mediated degradation. Using a quantitative approach to profile the entire plasma membrane proteome, we find that CMTM6 displays specificity for PD-L1. Notably, CMTM6 depletion decreases PD-L1 without compromising cell surface expression of MHC class I. CMTM6 depletion, via the reduction of PD-L1, significantly alleviates the suppression of tumour-specific T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the biology of PD-L1 regulation, identify a previously unrecognized master regulator of this critical immune checkpoint and highlight a potential therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion by tumour cells.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5vrgDODtADk/nature23642">Stromal R-spondin orchestrates gastric epithelial stem cells and gland homeostasis</a></h4>

<p>
 The constant regeneration of stomach epithelium is driven by long-lived stem cells, but the mechanism that regulates their turnover is not well understood. We have recently found that the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori can activate gastric stem cells and increase epithelial turnover, while Wnt signalling is known to be important for stem cell identity and epithelial regeneration in several tissues. Here we find that antral Wnt signalling, marked by the classic Wnt target gene Axin2, is limited to the base and lower isthmus of gastric glands, where the stem cells reside. Axin2 is expressed by Lgr5+ cells, as well as adjacent, highly proliferative Lgr5− cells that are able to repopulate entire glands, including the base, upon depletion of the Lgr5+ population. Expression of both Axin2 and Lgr5 requires stroma-derived R-spondin 3 produced by gastric myofibroblasts proximal to the stem cell compartment. Exogenous R-spondin administration expands and accelerates proliferation of Axin2+/Lgr5− but not Lgr5+ cells. Consistent with these observations, H. pylori infection increases stromal R-spondin 3 expression and expands the Axin2+ cell pool to cause hyperproliferation and gland hyperplasia. The ability of stromal niche cells to control and adapt epithelial stem cell dynamics constitutes a sophisticated mechanism that orchestrates epithelial regeneration and maintenance of tissue integrity.

<p>
 Synaptotagmin, complexin, and neuronal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins mediate evoked synchronous neurotransmitter release, but the molecular mechanisms mediating the cooperation between these molecules remain unclear. Here we determine crystal structures of the primed pre-fusion SNARE–complexin–synaptotagmin-1 complex. These structures reveal an unexpected tripartite interface between synaptotagmin-1 and both the SNARE complex and complexin. Simultaneously, a second synaptotagmin-1 molecule interacts with the other side of the SNARE complex via the previously identified primary interface. Mutations that disrupt either interface in solution also severely impair evoked synchronous release in neurons, suggesting that both interfaces are essential for the primed pre-fusion state. Ca2+ binding to the synaptotagmin-1 molecules unlocks the complex, allows full zippering of the SNARE complex, and triggers membrane fusion. The tripartite SNARE–complexin–synaptotagmin-1 complex at a synaptic vesicle docking site has to be unlocked for triggered fusion to start, explaining the cooperation between complexin and synaptotagmin-1 in synchronizing evoked release on the sub-millisecond timescale.

<p>
 The folate-driven one-carbon (1C) cycle is a fundamental metabolic hub in cells that enables the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids and epigenetic modifications. This cycle might also release formaldehyde, a potent protein and DNA crosslinking agent that organisms produce in substantial quantities. Here we show that supplementation with tetrahydrofolate, the essential cofactor of this cycle, and other oxidation-prone folate derivatives kills human, mouse and chicken cells that cannot detoxify formaldehyde or that lack DNA crosslink repair. Notably, formaldehyde is generated from oxidative decomposition of the folate backbone. Furthermore, we find that formaldehyde detoxification in human cells generates formate, and thereby promotes nucleotide synthesis. This supply of 1C units is sufficient to sustain the growth of cells that are unable to use serine, which is the predominant source of 1C units. These findings identify an unexpected source of formaldehyde and, more generally, indicate that the detoxification of this ubiquitous endogenous genotoxin creates a benign 1C unit that can sustain essential metabolism.

<p>
 Sepsis in early infancy results in one million annual deaths worldwide, most of them in developing countries. No efficient means of prevention is currently available. Here we report on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an oral synbiotic preparation (Lactobacillus plantarum plus fructooligosaccharide) in rural Indian newborns. We enrolled 4,556 infants that were at least 2,000 g at birth, at least 35 weeks of gestation, and with no signs of sepsis or other morbidity, and monitored them for 60 days. We show a significant reduction in the primary outcome (combination of sepsis and death) in the treatment arm (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.48–0.74), with few deaths (4 placebo, 6 synbiotic). Significant reductions were also observed for culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis and lower respiratory tract infections. These findings suggest that a large proportion of neonatal sepsis in developing countries could be effectively prevented using a synbiotic containing L. plantarum ATCC-202195.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/L0wsjOLsXqQ/nature23465">CDK4/6 inhibition triggers anti-tumour immunity</a></h4>

<p>
 Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumours. Their primary mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Here we use mouse models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer. The enhanced anti-tumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer treatment.

<p>
 Fenethylline, also known by the trade name Captagon, is a synthetic psychoactive stimulant that has recently been linked to a substance-use disorder and ‘pharmacoterrorism’ in the Middle East. Although fenethylline shares a common phenethylamine core with other amphetamine-type stimulants, it also incorporates a covalently linked xanthine moiety into its parent structure. These independently active pharmacophores are liberated during metabolism, resulting in the release of a structurally diverse chemical mixture into the central nervous system. Although the psychoactive properties of fenethylline have been reported to differ from those of other synthetic stimulants, the in vivo chemical complexity it manifests upon ingestion has impeded efforts to unambiguously identify the specific species responsible for these effects. Here we develop a ‘dissection through vaccination’ approach, called DISSECTIV, to mitigate the psychoactive effects of fenethylline and show that its rapid-onset and distinct psychoactive properties are facilitated by functional synergy between theophylline and amphetamine. Our results demonstrate that incremental vaccination against a single chemical species within a multi-component mixture can be used to uncover emergent properties arising from polypharmacological activity. We anticipate that DISSECTIV will be used to expose unidentified active chemical species and resolve pharmacodynamic interactions within other chemically complex systems, such as those found in counterfeit or illegal drug preparations, post-metabolic tissue samples and natural product extracts.

<p>
 The transition from dominant bacterial to eukaryotic marine primary productivity was one of the most profound ecological revolutions in the Earth’s history, reorganizing the distribution of carbon and nutrients in the water column and increasing energy flow to higher trophic levels. But the causes and geological timing of this transition, as well as possible links with rising atmospheric oxygen levels and the evolution of animals, remain obscure. Here we present a molecular fossil record of eukaryotic steroids demonstrating that bacteria were the only notable primary producers in the oceans before the Cryogenian period (720–635 million years ago). Increasing steroid diversity and abundance marks the rapid rise of marine planktonic algae (Archaeplastida) in the narrow time interval between the Sturtian and Marinoan ‘snowball Earth’ glaciations, 659–645 million years ago. We propose that the incumbency of cyanobacteria was broken by a surge of nutrients supplied by the Sturtian deglaciation. The ‘Rise of Algae’ created food webs with more efficient nutrient and energy transfers, driving ecosystems towards larger and increasingly complex organisms. This effect is recorded by the concomitant appearance of biomarkers for sponges and predatory rhizarians, and the subsequent radiation of eumetazoans in the Ediacaran period.

<p>“Figures such as Princess Diana, Oprah Winfrey, Mahatma Gandhi, Ronald Reagan, and Adolf Hitler share this triumphant, mysterious, and fascinating descriptor”, write the authors of a new paper on charisma. And yet, they add, “the empirical study of charisma is relatively young and sparse, and no unifying conceptualization of charisma currently exists”. The research and theorizing that has been done has focused on charismatic leadership, they explain, neglecting the everyday variety. In <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31803-001">their paper</a> in <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> the University of Toronto researchers describe how they developed their new six-item measure “The General Charisma Inventory” (GCI), and they show how scores on the GCI are associated with people’s persuasiveness and likability.</p>
<p><span id="more-28606"></span></p>
<p>The team, led by Konstantin Tskhay, began by asking just over a hundred American volunteers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online survey website to come up with four characteristics of charismatic individuals. The researchers then whittled these suggestions down in various stages, which involved volunteers rating the suitability of the items and other volunteers rating themselves on the items. Removing any redundancy, the researchers ended up with a six-item self-report measure of charisma loading onto two main factors to do with having influence over others (including being able to guide them) and coming across as affable (being able to make others feel comfortable and at ease).</p>
<p>Participants taking the new test are asked to rate their agreement on a five-point scale from 1 Strongly Disagree to 5 Strongly Agree, whether “I am someone who…”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a presence in a room</li>
<li>Has the ability to influence people</li>
<li>Knows how to lead a group</li>
<li>Makes people feel comfortable</li>
<li>Smiles at people often</li>
<li>Can get along with anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>(The first three items tap the influence factor of charisma and the last three items tap the affability factor.)</p>
<p>Having devised their test, the researchers put it through its paces in a number of ways. For example, they asked volunteers to complete the new charisma measure plus lots of other established psychological measures, and were able to show that scores on the new test are related to but distinct from established psychological constructs such as the Big Five personality traits, emotional intelligence and political skill. For instance, people’s scores on the the affability factor of the new test correlated with their trait Agreeableness, which makes conceptual sense. On the other hand, charisma scores appeared to be completely separate from intelligence, suggesting that “individual differences in general charisma are not redundant with cognitive ability”.</p>
<p>In another study the researchers asked small groups of unacquainted students to chat to each other for five minutes and to rate themselves and other group members on the charisma test. This showed that individuals’ charisma self-ratings on the test correlated with the charisma ratings they received from others. In another similar study, students’ self-ratings on the charisma test correlated with ratings they received from friends or family.</p>
<p>The researchers also asked pairs of unacquainted students to chat to each other for ten minutes and then rate each other’s likability. The students also rated themselves on standard personality measures and on the new charisma measure. The higher the students scored on charisma (specifically the affability factor), the more likable they tended to be rated by their partners, even after taking into account their scores on the Big Five personality traits of Extraversion, Agreeableness etc.</p>
<p>In another demonstration of the tests’ validity, the researchers asked more student volunteers to read out either a weak or strong argument for wind energy and then to complete the charisma test. Next, participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk listened back to the recordings and rated how persuasive they found them. When it came to the weak arguments, they found participants who’d scored themselves higher on charisma (specifically the influence factor) to be more persuasive. In relation to the affability factor, women who scored higher on this were rated as more persuasive, whereas for men the affability scores were not relevant (the researchers speculated this has to do with cultural expectations for women to be warm).</p>
<p>“We believe that the investigation of charisma in daily life is important for disentangling a construct previously understood primarily in terms of its consequences for leadership,” Tskhay and his colleagues concluded, “and hope that other researchers will share our enthusiasm about the potential new lines of research that this new conceptualization may elucidate.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/08/14/the-evidence-for-multitasking-is-it-overrated/">Multitasking: is it Overrated?</a></h4>

<p>The ability to multitask is usually viewed positively. But does it help in improving productivity? New research indicates that this is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>For years we have been hearing and being allured by the term multitasking, with many of us unwittingly believing that it is something supernatural and too good to neglect, and we ought to develop it in ourselves to succeed. But the question arises, is it as good as it sounds? What does the new research say? Is it possible for a person to concentrate and remain productive on several tasks at once?</p>
<p>Going through research articles can be perplexing for most of us, but most of the research seems to favor doing one task at a time. There are several downsides to multitasking, often resulting in decreased overall productivity and quality of work. A person who tries to finish one job at a time seems to do more at the end of the day. Multitasking could be valuable only to a certain extent if you are doing some simple tasks, but after a certain threshold productivity decreases and quality of work suffers. Multitasking often fails to improve productivity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it depends on the kind of tasks you are doing. If a person is doing lots of jobs, that are simple and the person performing them is adept at them, then maybe yes, in some cases multitasking may be good, but mostly this is not the case. Some people are inherently inferior to others in multitasking. One thing that most scientific research demonstrates is that multitasking results in significant loss of accuracy. The more you multitask, the more errors you are bound to make, thereby leading to reduced overall productivity. Considering that in some cases performance errors can even be catastrophic, improved performance with most multitasking is a mere illusion that comes at the price of poor results and higher error rate.</p>
<h3>Multitasking leads to mental overloading</h3>
<p>When people are given various tasks, they need some time to switch to another function. This results in the loss of both time and productivity. This switching time is directly related to the complexity of the task. If the task is being switched to is complicated and less familiar, one needs more time then when attending to more familiar task. Thus multitasking can result in mental overloading in reconfiguring mental settings as one switches between tasks. Also one has to memorize more information while switching between the various functions, like the progress status of the previous task. Research shows that these short mental blocks between the switching can bring down productivity by as much as forty percent. Scheduling tasks can be more efficient in increasing productivity as compared with multitasking.</p>
<h3>What about gender differences?</h3>
<p>Women may be better at juggling between several tasks, but this is true only when the tasks are simple in nature, the kind of tasks achieved on a daily basis, that do not require much mental processing. Examples include cleaning the house and talking on the phone. But when multitasking involves more complex tasks, this gender difference becomes irrelevant. Therefore,  talking on the phone while driving is equally dangerous for both sexes. In fact, one study demonstrated that women dislike multitasking as much as the men do. Given a choice, women don’t seem to switch between several tasks more often than men. When multitasking, both genders perform equally poorly. Whether multitasking is done by free will or it has been forced due to job constraints does not seem to have any effect on productivity.</p>
<h3>Who is multitasking and why?</h3>
<p>One study focused on finding personality differences between self-proclaimed multitaskers and non-multitaskers. The study tried to find out why some people opt to multitask while other may avoid, and if the multitaskers are actually any good at multitasking. Results of the research were quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Most of the people who multitask are not necessarily good at it. In fact, the results pointed to the opposite: people who are good at multitasking usually avoid doing it. Generally, those who are impulsive sensation seekers tend to multitask. By multitasking, some of these people seem to gain pleasure. Another reason why certain people multitask is due to overbloated self-assessment. Individuals who more regularly multitask often overrate their capabilities and fail to understand that they are not better than others in multitasking.</p>
<p>Multitaskers make mistakes more often, and they seem to be less self-critical about their abilities, and they have lowered understanding of their errors and losses. Further, multitaskers are often people with attention deficits who have difficulty focusing on a single given task.</p>
<h3>What we know so far about multitasking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multitasking decreases productivity in most cases, by as much as forty percent.</li>
<li>Multitasking results in much higher error rates, which reduces productivity and can be harmful in some cases.</li>
<li>There are no proven gender differences in efficient multitasking.</li>
<li>Multitasking is often related to certain personality traits like being impulsive and sensation seeking.</li>
<li>Multitaskers are not typically the people who are good at it.</li>
<li>Multitaskers often lack the ability to concentrate properly on a given task.</li>
<li>Effectiveness of multitasking depends on the complexity of the job, with multiple complex jobs being harder to do at the same time than multiple easy jobs.</li>
<li>Scheduling the various tasks can increase productivity relative to multitasking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus,  the existing research studies seem to favor doing tasks sequentially or one by one, rather than multitasking. Multitasking increases the risk of making mistakes, and this rule applies equally to both genders. Therefore, understanding the downsides of multitasking not only improves productivity, but might also save us from catastrophic errors.</p>

<p>Your body’s immune system normally fights illness or injury, but when it’s overactive over a prolonged period of time, the consequences can be harmful. “Chronic systemic inflammation” (marked by raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the body) has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579563/">linked to a wide range of physical and mental health problems</a>, including heart disease, diabetes and depression. One cause is a poor lifestyle, involving little exercise and an unhealthy diet. Anthony Ong, at Cornell University, US, and his team were interested in whether our emotional lives might play a role too. Their <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-27036-001">new research</a>, published in the journal <i>Emotion</i>, found that people with lower systemic inflammation didn’t simply report more happiness, rather they experienced a greater variety of positive emotions every day.</p>
<p><span id="more-28589"></span></p>
<p>“There’s growing evidence that inflammatory processes may help to explain how emotions get ‘under the skin,” the researchers write in their paper. They point to evidence suggesting that negative emotions, such as fear and shame, can stimulate inflammatory responses. And also to work finding that positive emotions are associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6 (two classic markers of inflammation). “Taken together, experiences of negative and positive emotion in both trait and state form appear to influence the adaptive regulation of core biological systems that maintain health,” they write.</p>
<p>The team analysed previously-collected data on 175 healthy people aged 45-60 living in Phoenix, Arizona. These volunteers had their levels of three inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen) measured at the start of the study, and at a six-month follow-up. They were also taught how to use a tablet computer to provide questionnaire-led diary entries each night for 30 days.</p>
<p>The questions included a measure of daily emotional experiences: the volunteers were asked to rate the extent to which they’d experienced 16 positive emotions (including feeling enthusiastic, determined or amused), and 16 negative emotions (including feeling afraid, distressed, jittery, anxious or ashamed) during that day.</p>
<p>When the team analysed the data, they found that greater positive “emodiversity” – regularly experiencing a broad range of positive emotions – was associated with lower levels of inflammation (this was after they’d controlled statistically for any influences of age, gender, medications, BMI, medical conditions and personality). There was, however, no significant relationship between negative emodiversity and inflammation. “These findings highlight the unique role daily positive emotions play in biological health,” the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>There were limitations with the study. Volunteers were asked to remember at night all the different emotions they’d experienced in the course of the day. Since chronic inflammation is also associated with poorer memory, it’s possible that people with elevated inflammation just couldn’t remember all their emotional experiences. Studies using a more intensive emotion sampling approach could provide more useful results.</p>
<p>It’s also impossible, from this study, to answer the question: how could experiencing a diverse spectrum of positive emotions influence inflammation? It’s possible that being more in tune with exactly how you’re feeling could lead to more adaptive health behaviours, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>But as they also concede, “the directionality of the observed associations cannot be determined.” It might be that a lack of diversity in emotion results from heightened levels of inflammation, rather than causes them. Certainly, when it comes to depression, for example, while raised levels of inflammatory markers are associated with depression, whether that’s a result or a cause is debated. Clearly, there’s a need for good longitudinal studies to clarify these relationships.</p>

<p>Preparing a child for eating out at a dine–in restaurant may present a challenge for some families. Children can be picky and fickle with their preferences; smell, color and even shape of food may drive a child to an extreme opinion, forever prejudicing them against an otherwise inoffensive foodstuff.</p>
<p>Finding a restaurant that their child is excited to visit is no small victory for caregivers. Though, for caregivers of children with food hypersensitivities, eating out with the family can prove to be more complex. Restaurants serving foods prepared with peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, milk, cereals containing gluten and crustaceans require careful approach. Or, frequently in cases where compromise appears improbable, total avoidance.</p>
<p>Food hypersensitivity is a generic descriptor, used for anyone who suffers reproducible and objective symptoms that occur after the ingestion of a particular food. Total avoidance is a common strategy for families of food hypersensitive children; both food items and the restaurants serving them can be abstained from to remove the chance of endangering a food hypersensitive child.</p>
<p>Given that eating out is attributed with 50% of deaths related to food allergen consumption, constant vigilance is required. Living with food hypersensitivity is an ongoing day-to-day challenge that can be described as “living with risk” for both the families and children with food hypersensitivities.</p>
<p><strong>Additional pressures</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>stick to the same place if you’ve been there once and its ok, and if he doesn’t have a reaction…if he likes it, it’s a bonus</p></blockquote>
<p>Anxiety for many caregivers can stem from an anticipated lack of competence or understanding on the part of restaurants, school cafeterias or other outside food venues. Worries can worsen when caregivers are not present to ensure their child’s safety. Accidental cross contamination of triggering foodstuffs may place a child at risk.</p>
<p>However, in some worrying cases, children may be directly served the food item that they have a hypersensitivity to even after being told the nature of the child’s allergy. One caregiver stated so much when they shared that “[At] the start (nursery) struggled….They have had a couple of slip ups like the (ready mix dessert) and a couple of times because the teacher will go on holiday… I feel quite let down sometimes because I stress to them when I go in.”</p>
<p>To avoid potential issues, monotony in dining can quickly become the norm, with a focus on safety over enjoyment. One parent explained that they would “…tend to stick to the same place if you’ve been there once and its ok, and if he doesn’t have a reaction…if he likes it, it’s a bonus.”  However, the authors describe the necessity for creating a balance between caution with variety; safety with social freedom; and preferences of the food hypersensitive child with preferences of their siblings.</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel quite let down sometimes because I stress to them when I go in</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Alleviating stressors </strong></p>
<p>The transfer of responsibility from caregiver to child during adolescent development may alleviate some of the anxiety experienced by caregivers; through the incorporation of a number of strategies to support self-management and autonomy in their children, caregivers may feel relief knowing that their child has the tools to navigate the world safely when outside of their homes.</p>
<p>By encouraging their children to clearly state their hypersensitivity and consequent dietary needs many children effectively avoid their allergen without the need of their caregiver’s direct supervision.</p>
<p>Giving food hypersensitive children the tools to operate without the immediate support of their caregivers is an important step towards providing them with a level of personal responsibility, while also relieving caregiver anxieties. However, a need exists for food proprietors to further their support and understanding of the tools and strategies to ensure positive eating out experiences for children with food hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Fiona M Begen et al. suggest that there is a potential to reduce the day-to-day anxieties of caregivers and to provide them and their children with improved quality of life.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/12862_2017_1014_Fig5_HTML-140x110.gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the last decade, automatic plant identification has become a key interdisciplinary research field that supports botanists in their efforts to identify and classify <i>all</i> plants on earth. Computer vision applied to plant images has been proven to be helpful for this task. It started with low accuracy results under extremely controlled environments but has quickly evolved to better and more accurate algorithms. Consequently we have useful tools such as <a href="https://identify.plantnet-project.org/">Pl@ntNet</a> that allow common citizens to identify species of plants with images taken in-the-wild.</p>
<p>The number of institutions that maintain herbaria around the world is around 3,000; with more than 350,000,000 specimens stored under controlled environments. This reflects the accumulated conservation efforts of thousands of botanists around the globe since centuries ago. If we couple both the herbarium sheet images and computer vision techniques, in particular deep learning, herbaria around the world would have more arguments to demonstrate the value and impact of maintaining and investing in these precious collections, as providers of a completely new dataset, most likely useful in the automatic plant identification domain.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers from <a href="https://www.tec.ac.cr/">Costa Rica Institute of Technology</a>, <a href="http://amap.cirad.fr/en/">CIRAD</a> and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/zenith">INRIA</a> does exactly this: it tackles the problem of automatic plant identification using deep learning techniques coupled with herbarium sheet images.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Plant Identification</b></p>
<p>Initial automatic plant identification was focused on leaf images for easier algorithm development and material preparation, evolving later to images of plants in-the-wild, with additional organs such as flowers, fruits, and others, and complex environments captured in the field. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2017/plant">PlantCLEF</a> evaluation campaign, algorithms have evolved to better accuracy and are now able to deal with high levels of noise in the images, as well as more images and species. A couple of years ago, the Pl@ntNET initiative involving several French research institutions (INRIA, CIRAD, INRA and IRD) started using deep learning technology for its mobile plant identification.</p>
<p><b>Deep Learning Technology</b></p>
<p>During the ImageNet computer vision competition, in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky beat the previous state-of-the-art generalistic identification systems by a considerable margin by using a Convolution Neural Network for the first time. Since then, deep learning has become the facto technology for artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision in the computer science community. This technology allows predictive models to “learn” concepts based on simpler concepts, in a sense similarly to the visual cortex of humans.</p>
<p>Deep Learning is not really a new technology. However, its full potential has been within reach in the last years thanks to two main factors, namely, the increased processing power of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and the availability of vasts amounts data. Models tend to require more data in order to be able to generalize better on unseen examples. This is where herbarium sheets become relevant, as their digitization can be useful to increase a global plant dataset for plant identification in the deep learning scene.</p>
<p><b>Scaling up a global visual plant dataset</b></p>
<p>As part of the need to apply deep learning on plant identification, there is a need for a global dataset with, hopefully, all known plant species, which is estimated to be around 400,000 species globally. As herbaria has hundreds of millions of specimens stored in their cabinets, it is logical to attempt to make use of those sheets as images in order to improve the global dataset in question. This global dataset improvement is in terms of size and also in terms of how balanced the dataset should be (machine learning algorithms tend to learn better when the number of images per class is roughly the same). Thanks to efforts such as <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/">iDigBio</a>, which invest a lot in delivering and aggregating digital images, we now have millions of digital records of specimens publicly available that can be used to build such a global dataset. Encyclopedia of Life, GBIF, iNaturalist, and Pl@ntNet, among others, have also generated and published large amounts of plant images.</p>
<p>One of the problems with herbarium images is visual noise. Normally, specimens are placed on sheets without automated visual processing needs in mind. For instance, organs are juxtaposed and elements such as labels are also present in the image. Deep learning is a technology that has been proven to deal particularly well with visual noise and complex images. So now it is the right time to attempt to use it with herbaria images.</p>

<p><b>Supporting Herbarium Institutions with Deep Learning</b></p>
<p>The study of Carranza-Rojas et al proves that using deep learning with herbarium images renders good accuracy results on species identification that use herbarium images for both training and testing in an identification system. This could result in a future identification system for herbaria to support botanists conduct  their work with the huge volume of visual data now available. The authors also prove that using herbarium images from one region of the world to train such models, can result in knowledge transferable to other regions of the world. This is one of the first “transfer learning” experiments in the botanical context. This could be particularly useful for herbarium institutions that still don’t have a large amount of digitalized images. Because some of the richest biodiversity regions of the world are the least prospected, this transfer learning approach can be very important to improve the use of datasets on these floras.</p>
<p>As a result of  this study, herbarium institutions may gain additional value. There is a  huge amount of work invested by field explorers, botanists, taxonomists, technicians, and data managers that has generated very useful data not only for the biological sciences but also for the computer science community. We hope that this work will open the door to stronger collaborations between these communities, particularly between Natural History Museums and Machine Learning / Computer Vision labs.</p>

<p>Fussy eating – also referred to as “selective eating” in scholarly research – is incredibly common among children, with upper estimates placing the prevalence at 50 per cent. Despite this, many parents understandably fret when their kids avoid a lot of foods, won’t try new things and/or will only eat certain meals. They worry whether their child is getting enough vitamins and if their child’s fussiness is some kind of precursor to later more serious eating problems.</p>
<p>A new, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015316302677?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">small study</a> in <em>Eating Behaviors</em> is the first to document how fussy eating develops in the same individuals over time into early adulthood and may provide a crumb (sorry) of comfort for anxious parents. It’s true that 60 per cent of fussy eating children in the study were also fussy eaters at age 23, but fussy eating young adults were no more likely to report signs of eating disorder than their non-fussy peers.</p>
<p><span id="more-28508"></span></p>
<p>The researchers led by Meredith Van Tine at Stanford University School of Medicine managed to catch up with 61 individuals, now aged 23, who’d participated as children in a long-running study in which their eating habits had been scored by their parents at ages 2, 7, 9.5 and 11, including any signs of fussy eating (being a “selective eater”, having strong likes and dislikes, and only eating a limited variety of foods etc). The participants were now asked to rate themselves on whether they were selective or fussy eaters, and they answered questions about whether they engaged in behaviours related to eating disorders.</p>
<p>Just over half the sample had been rated as fussy eaters at some point. Developmentally, the pattern was for fussy eating to increase in prevalence through early childhood, peak at age 6, then decline through middle childhood (when rated at ages 7 and 9). In terms of continuity from childhood to adulthood, six of the ten participants who’d been scored as fussy eaters at age 3 also rated themselves as fussy eaters now they were young adults.</p>
<p>Duration of fussy eating as a child was also associated with likelihood of being a fussy eater as an adult; in fact, all the participants who’d been a fussy eater for more than six years as a child also described themselves as a fussy eater as an adult.</p>
<p>Some of the participants had acquired fussy eating habits in adolescence or later. Among the 17 participants now describing themselves as fussy eaters, 6 had shown no signs as children (so they must have acquired the behaviour at some point between age 11 and 23).</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, as 23-year-olds, there was no evidence that the fussy eaters in the group were any more likely to engage in behaviours, like purging or bingeing, that are typically associated with eating disorders, nor did they show signs of being underweight, overweight or obesity. This tallies with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25747855">a recent larger survey</a> of hundreds of adult “picky eaters” who were found to be at no greater risk of eating disorder-related behaviours than non picky eaters.</p>
<p>The new research involved a small sample and the mix of early parent reports and later self-reports wasn’t ideal, but on the plus side it’s the first ever research to chart fussy eating in the same people from childhood to adulthood.</p>

<p>We've gotten the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom">Fedora classroom</a> sessions going again. After two really good ones, I taught the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-classroom-session-3/">third one</a> today - a beginners session to the command line. Unlike the previous ones that used video platforms, I decided that the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> was best suited to this session, even more so because I wanted it to be a hands-on session. It went off pretty well. Here are a few notes. Links to the logs are at the bottom of this post.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-metrics">
<h2>Some metrics</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Length: 2 hours (was planned to be an hour, but we quickly realised that it wouldn't be enough!)</li>
<li>Attendees: 29 - a few of us had FAS usernames too (so we shared cookies!)</li>
<li>About 800 sentences were spoken (I spoke about half of these, of course)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I quite enjoyed it, but then I enjoy tinkering with the command line anyway. A few folks stuck around for the full two hours, so that does indicate that they found the session somewhat useful. I'd put up a <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/sanjayankur31/f40070c6925e8885394d2dd750ae4cb8">gist here with a tentative agenda</a>. We didn't manage to go more than half way through it, though. We:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>did a quick introduction to what a shell is</li>
<li>learned how to get help using local information - using the man pages</li>
<li>quickly saw the difference between absolute and relative paths, and also learned about <code>..</code> and <code>.</code></li>
<li>went on to look at some more basic commands/built-ins and their switches/flags/options: <code>ls, apropos, clear, cd, pwd, which, alias, rm, tree, mkdir, wget, rmdir, rm, fpaste, wc, head, tail, more, less, cat, tac, grep, sort, uniq</code></li>
<li>used these commands to download a copy of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1120/pg1120.txt">"The tragedy of Julius Caesar" from Project Gutenberg</a>, and then extracted some information from it. For example, we obtained how many times Caesar was mentioned in the text. For a more advanced task we also obtained how many times Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca were each mentioned using a single set of commands. This required the use of <code>grep, sort, uniq, wc</code> in different combinations using input-output redirection (pipes in this case). At no point did we use a text editor, and we stuck to using local man pages.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="takeaways">
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>I hope that this rather quick session gave the participants some idea of how the shell can be used for lots of tasks. I also hoped to show them that there's a lot of information available on the system itself that a user can refer to.</p>
<p>I learned a few things myself. I learned that an hour is too short for a proper online session, for example. My supposition that demonstrating commands using tasks would make the session more appealing seems to have been correct too. Only, maybe next time I'll pick a more contemporary text?</p>
<p>For the next session, I'll try and cover slightly more advanced topics, such as tests, loops, maybe even a bit of awk. We shall see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feedback-is-always-welcome">
<h2>Feedback is always welcome</h2>
<p>If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:</p>

</ul>
<p>You can even comment on this blog post, and of course, you can give me feedback privately. I'm also looking to make a list of tasks that I can use in future sessions - tasks that would be useful, fun, and that would also require some command line tricks - such that they would demonstrate the power of the command line. So, if you have your pet command line tricks/aliases, please do get in touch.</p>

<p>While the idea that the lack of women in science and tech is <em>entirely</em> about cultural obstacles is contentious (as <a href="http://quillette.com/2017/08/07/google-memo-four-scientists-respond/">demonstrated</a> <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/no-the-google-manifesto-isnt-sexist-or-anti-diversity-its-science/article35903359/">by</a> the recent Google memo furore), few would argue that social and cultural factors aren’t important. And these social influences may begin early. For example there’s an argument that boys are encouraged to play with toys that are likely to promote skills that will help them in science and maths. Toys aimed at girls, in contrast, are more likely to promote stereotypically feminine skills, such as nurturing.</p>
<p>LEGO, say Megan Fulcher and Amy Hayes, the authors of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-017-0806-3">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Sex Roles</em>, is a case in point: its marketing is skewed towards boys, especially since the increase in packaged sets, which tend to feature stereotypically masculine items like pirate ships and castles. The result, they argue, is that boys are more attracted to LEGO, girls deterred from it, and that boys get to practice their building skills while girls don’t.</p>
<p>LEGO has heard some of this criticism (and no doubt also seen a gap in the market) and they’ve released girl-friendly packaged sets and product lines, including <em>Friends</em> items with a focus on people and including pink bricks. But Fulcher and Hayes – who very much speak from the nurture perspective on these issues (they fail to cite a single study demonstrating a biological basis for sex differences in toy preference) – fear this could be counterproductive because girlie bricks and sets are likely to promote more stereotypically feminine LEGO play and remind girls of their gender. To find out if their concerns are justified the researchers tested the LEGO building skills and choices of 116 girls and boys (aged 5 to 10) depending on whether they were given boyish LEGO bricks and packages or girlie ones.</p>
<p><span id="more-28339"></span></p>
<p>For the first phase of the study, the boys and girls were randomly assigned to follow instructions to build either a stereotypically male design (a dinosaur) or a female design (a cat). Also, whatever object they were trying to build, half were given boyish bricks to use (blue/green), and half were given girlie bricks (pink purple).</p>
<p>Fulcher and Hayes predicted that girls would be slower and less accurate to build the LEGO when they were tasked with building the cat and/or when they were using girlie bricks (because these items would activate “typically gendered play scripts” and remind the girls that “there is a different kind of LEGO for you”).</p>
<p>In fact, this wasn’t the case: the girls’ (and boys’) speed and accuracy was just the same regardless of what type of bricks they used. And girls and boys alike more quickly and accurately built the cat than the dinosaur, presumably because it was easier. However, whatever they were building, overall the boys were quicker at construction than the girls (with no accuracy tradeoff) and this remained the case even after factoring out experience with and interest in LEGO.</p>
<p>The second phase of the study involved free play. Half the girls and half the boys were given girlie bricks (pink and white) to play with and build whatever they wanted, the other half were given boyish bricks (blue and grey). Each set also included wheels (supposedly boyish) and eyes (supposedly girlie). The children could take as long as they wanted and when they’d finished they were asked to say what they’d built.</p>
<p>Overall, the boys built more stereotypically masculine objects than girls, such as water monsters and machine guns, they also incorporated wheels more into their designs than did the girls. This was as the researchers predicted since they believe that boys are not affected by any relevant cultural stereotypes or expectations that might be triggered by the different bricks. However, the researchers predicted that girls given pink bricks would be reminded of their gender and so build more girlie objects with these bricks, and that’s what happened.</p>
<p>Fulcher and Hayes believe this shows that while “more girl-targeted and ‘girl’-colour LEGO sets” may help attract more girls to play with LEGO, they do so at the cost of “restricting the kinds of structures and play with which they engage”. However, remembering the null effects in the first study phase, it seems they found only limited evidence to back up their concerns. And these are concerns which currently depend on a good deal of speculation – for instance, the new study doesn’t provide any direct evidence that it is at all harmful that girls are more likely to build stereotypically feminine objects with pink bricks. It also seemed an omission not to measure the boys’ and girls’ enjoyment. If girls prefer playing with girl-targeted LEGO more than other kinds, isn’t that also an important part of the equation?</p>
