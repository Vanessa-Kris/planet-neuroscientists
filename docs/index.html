<p><strong>The W particle may have been found</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-may-have-been-found"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 21, 1971</p>



<p>Physicists distinguish four different kinds of force by which objects in the universe act upon each other: the strong nuclear force, the weak force, electromagnetism and gravity. The developed theory of particle physics outfits each force with a so-called intermediate particle.… Now, from an abandoned silver mine at Park City, Utah, comes strong evidence of the existence of the weak-force quantum, known as the … W particle.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The “strong evidence” for this W particle, or W boson, fell apart under additional scrutiny. Physicists with CERN near Geneva finally <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-physics-missing-link-found">caught the boson</a> about a decade later (<em>SN: 2/5/83, p. 84</em>). Besides helping mediate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">the weak force</a>, which governs certain types of radioactive decay, the W boson has also helped scientists catch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">the Higgs boson</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/12, p. 5</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/higgs-running-out-hiding-places">Weighing the W boson</a> narrowed down the Higgs’ mass range, making the Higgs easier to look for. Physicists continue unraveling W boson mysteries, such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03256-1">how the particles form</a> and whether <a href="https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2021-026/">more massive versions</a> exist.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ancient-horseshoe-crab-brain">How fossilization preserved a 310-million-year-old horseshoe crab’s brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paleontologists can spend years carefully splitting rocks in search of the perfect fossil. But with a 310-million-year-old horseshoe crab brain, nature did the work, breaking the fossil in just the right way to reveal the ancient arthropod’s central nervous system.</p>



<p>Of all soft tissues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-fossilized-dinosaur-brain-unearthed-scientists-claim">brains</a> are notoriously difficult to preserve in any form (<em>SN: 10/31/16</em>). Stumbling across such a detailed specimen purely by chance was “a one-in-a-million find, if not rarer,” says evolutionary paleontologist Russell Bicknell of the University of New England in Armidale, Australia.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/doi/10.1130/G49193.1/606398/Central-nervous-system-of-a-310-m-y-old-horseshoe">fossilized brain</a> is remarkably similar to the brains of modern horseshoe crabs, giving clues to the arthropods’ evolution, Bicknell and colleagues report July 26 in <em>Geology</em>. And the brain’s peculiar mode of preservation could point paleontologists toward new places to look for hard-to-find fossils of soft tissues.</p>



<p>Horseshoe crabs have a fossil record spanning roughly 445 million years. But having a long fossil record is one thing. For many animals, including the crabs, fossils of their soft tissues are extremely uncommon because the tissues tend to degrade far quicker than fossilization can occur. Finding the delicate fatty structures that form a brain preserved in rock is especially rare. Only about 20 samples of fossilized arthropod neural tissue have been identified to date.</p>





<p>The newly described brain — part of a larger fossil of the extinct <em>Euproops danae</em> that Bicknell found at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History — was originally dug up from the Mazon Creek fossil beds roughly an hour southwest of Chicago. That site is one of the only known places in the world that could have saved the brain’s structure, says paleontologist Victoria McCoy of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.</p>



<p>“The fossilization at Mazon Creek is really, really exceptional,” McCoy explains. “It’s interesting because the fossils are preserved inside concretions,” which are spherical rocks that form around a central nugget of material, such as a long-dead crab. Most concretions in other fossil beds have no fossils or fossils that are just bones and hard parts, but “Mazon Creek has really good, soft-tissue preservation inside these concretions,” she says.</p>



<p>That’s because the concretions there are partly made of an iron-carbonate mineral called siderite that only forms in low-oxygen environments. That low-oxygen setting almost certainly slowed tissue decay, the scientists say, giving it time to be preserved. In an oxygenated environment, the decay could have happened in weeks, and the brain would have probably wasted away too quickly.</p>



<p>The actual process of preservation was a multistep ordeal, Bicknell says. “First, of course, the horseshoe crab had to die.” As the crab decayed, surrounded by mud and not much oxygen, that siderite coated the crab’s body, allowing it and its fragile brain structure to be preserved. After the brain degraded, the siderite “mold” was filled in with a pale, clay mineral called kaolinite, creating a white brain structure that stands out starkly on the otherwise tan fossil. Over time, a sphere of rock formed around the fossil before eventually breaking open in a fortuitous way.</p>

Bicknell <em>et al</em>/<em>Geology</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on studies in similar modern environments, such as the North Norfolk marshes in England, the whole preservation process probably took fewer than 50 years, McCoy says. That’s much faster than some other fossilization processes, which can take thousands of years or more. “Neural tissue degrades fairly quickly. We have no reason to think it would be stable,” she says. “While we don’t completely understand how concretions form, all the evidence so far is that it’s the concretion itself that is the preservation force keeping things from decaying away.”</p>



<p>The high preservation quality in these siderite concretions may point paleontologists in new directions for finding soft-tissue fossils. Only several environments capable of producing siderite concretions in the rock record have been identified so far, but the sites could be practical targets for future fossil searches.</p>



<p>“The most important part here is that purely by chance, the fossil was split along its brain,” Bicknell says. The concretion was cracked in just the right orientation to reveal a near-perfect cross section of the brain’s structure. “If it hadn’t broken that way, we wouldn’t have this level of information. It was ultimately quite lucky.”</p>



<p>The preserved central nervous system lends insight into the ancient crab’s behavior, the researchers say. Because the fossil brain is so similar to the brains of modern horseshoe crabs, Bicknell says, it’s safe to say the ancient animal’s walking, breathing and even feeding habits were probably similar to horseshoe crabs’ today, including eating with their legs. “Imagine eating a hamburger with your elbows,” Bicknell says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sports-soccer-ghost-games-psychology-fans-referee-pandemic">‘Ghost games’ spotlight the psychological effect fans have on referees</a></h4>

              
                <p>When the fans are away, the home team loses its sway, new research suggests.<br><br>During the 2019–2020 season, European soccer teams played in front of vacant stadium seats <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-limit-spread-social-distancing-travel-bans">due to COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). Home teams won less, lost more and tied about the same, compared with the season before the pandemic, researchers report August 19 in <em>Frontiers in Sports and Active Living</em>. What’s more, referees doled out much more foul calls to home teams than before during these crowdless “ghost games.”</p>



<p>The findings add to evidence that fans influence home team advantage — the phenomenon where athletes tend to do better on their own turf. “No fans, no home advantage,” says sports psychologist Fabio Richlan of the University of Salzburg in Austria.</p>



<p>Richlan and Michael Leitner, a sports psychologist also at the University of Salzburg, compared the outcomes of 645 games for the 2018–2019 season with the outcomes of 641 ghost games for the 2019–2020 season. Countries included in the analysis were Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Austria and Czech Republic.</p>



<p>With stands mostly or entirely empty, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2021.720488/full">home team win rate decreased</a> by 8.3 percentage points, from 48.1 percent to 39.8 percent, the researchers found. Meanwhile, loss rate increased by 8.4 percentage points, from 27.6 percent to 36 percent.</p>



<p>To examine how fan pressure on referees might have contributed to the discrepancy, the researchers looked at how often referees issued foul calls in the form of yellow cards. With fans absent, foul calls against home teams increased by around 26 percent, while calls against away teams increased by only about 3 percent.  <br><br>“Referees indeed give advantage to the home teams, because of the crowds,” Leitner says. But the findings suggest that referee bias tends to disappear when fans do. While it’s natural for people to change their opinions under pressure from others, Leitner says, hopefully this work can help referees become more aware of their biases. “When you know it, you can train against it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">Conspiracy Theories Are More “Entertaining” Than The Truth — And This Helps Explain Why People Believe Them</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Conspiracy theories stoke anxiety and uncertainty and can even threaten the health of those who espouse them. Take Covid-19 anti-vaxxers, for example, who put themselves at risk by refusing a vaccine. So given those negative consequences, it’s surprising that conspiracy theories are so prolific.</p>



<p>Research shows that beliefs that other groups are colluding secretly to pursue malevolent goals (the definition of a conspiracy theory) are more common during times of crisis — like a global pandemic. Heightened anxiety is thought to lead people to (erroneously) believe that there are hostile forces at play. But now <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12522?af=R">a paper</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> reveals another reason for why conspiracy theories can be appealing. Jan-Willem van Prooijen at the Free University Amsterdam and colleagues found that conspiracy theories provoke a stronger emotional reaction than relatively dull-but-true reality — and this encourages belief in them, especially for people who have the personality trait of being &#8220;sensation-seeking&#8221;.</p>



<span id="more-43248"></span>



<p>In two initial studies, participants read either a conspiratorial or an accurate story about the Notre Dame fire in Paris (which was in reality a tragic accident, but in the conspiratorial version was set on fire deliberately) or the death of the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein (who died by suicide in his cell, but in the conspiratorial version was ‘murdered’ by powerful people). Finally, all participants were asked whether they believed that there was a conspiracy behind the fire or death of Epstein.</p>



<p>The team found that participants who had read the conspiracy text also reported stronger belief in the conspiracy theory in both cases. But importantly, the conspiracy text was also judged to be more entertaining, and it seemed to be this “entertainment value” that ultimately led these participants to have a stronger belief in the conspiracy theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A further study more clearly linked the emotive nature of a text to its entertainment value. &nbsp;This time, participants read either an emotion-laden or emotionless description of a fictitious election, with no reference to any conspiracy theories. The text with lots of emotion was deemed to be more entertaining and also provoked a stronger emotional reaction. What’s more, even though it didn’t mention any conspiracies, participants who’d read this text were more likely to agree with conspiracy-related statements (such as &#8220;There will be cheating in the results counting process&#8221; or &#8220;A conspiracy will determine the election outcome&#8221;) — but only <em>if </em>they also scored relatively highly on a measure of sensation-seeking.</p>



<p>Sensation-seekers love excitement and thrills; they also enjoy scary movies and new and risky experiences, for example. And, according to yet another study reported in the paper, employees who score higher on the sensation-seeking dimensions of boredom susceptibility, disinhibition and adventure-seeking are more likely to believe that their&nbsp;bosses secretly pursue malevolent goals — in other words, to believe in workplace conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>A final study assessed participants’ belief in various common conspiracy theories, such as that the US government had advance knowledge of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that NASA faked the Moon landings. The researchers found a link between the strength of these beliefs and scores on the three dimensions of sensation-seeking identified in the employee study. “The results reveal that sensation seeking reliably predicts people’s belief in specific and concrete conspiracy theories,” they write.</p>



<p>So — yes, conspiracy theories may make people feel more anxious and uncertain. But perhaps sensation-seekers not only don’t mind this, they even enjoy it. The researchers add that to have this effect and attract believers, a conspiracy theory would have to be at least somewhat credible. But let’s not forget that some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/07/conspiracy-theory-paranoia-aliens-illuminati-beyonce-vaccines-cliven-bundy-jfk">12 million Americans </a>reportedly believe that the US is ruled by giant lizards…&nbsp; Scores on the sensation-seeking scale alone clearly don’t explain that extreme type of misguided belief. But given just how common conspiracy theories are, any insight into what encourages people to believe them is interesting.</p>



<p>Of course, the idea that adding emotion to a factual story makes it more appealing is hardly new: news outlets and true crime podcasts do it all the time. But this new work does also perhaps imply that the more entertaining we can make the truth, the more likely that sensation-seekers will buy into it, rather than a twisted alternative.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12522?af=R">The entertainment value of conspiracy theories</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-greater-sac-winged-bats-babble-learn-mating-songs">These baby greater sac-winged bats babble to learn their mating songs</a></h4>

              
                <p>At least 65 million years of evolution separate humans and greater sac-winged bats, but these two mammals share a key feature of learning how to speak: babbling.</p>



<p>Just as human infants babble their way from “da-da-da-da” to “Dad,” wild bat pups (<em>Saccopteryx bilineata</em>) learn the mating and territorial songs of adults <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abf9279">by first babbling out the fundamental syllables of the vocalizations,</a> researchers report in the Aug. 20 <em>Science</em>. These bats now join humans as the only clear examples of mammals who learn to make complex vocalizations through babbling.</p>



<p>“This is a hugely important step forward in the study of vocal learning,” says Tecumseh Fitch, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Vienna not involved in the new study. “These findings suggest that there are deep parallels between how humans and young bats learn to control their vocal apparatus,” he says. The work could enable future studies that might allow researchers to peer deeper into the brain activity that underpins vocal learning.</p>



<p>Before complex vocalizations, whether words or mating songs, can be spoken or sung, vocalizers must learn to articulate the syllables that make up a species’s vocabulary, says Ahana Fernandez, an animal behavior biologist at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. “Babbling is a way of practicing,” and honing those vocalizations, she says.</p>





<p>The rhythmic, repetitive “ba-ba-ba’s” and “ga-ga-ga’s” of human infants may sound like gibberish, but they are necessary exploratory steps toward learning how to talk. Seeing whether babbling is required for <em>any</em> animal that learns complex vocalizations necessitates looking in other species.</p>



<p>Many songbirds babble to learn their songs. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-marmosets-imitate-parents-sounds">marmosets babble too</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/15</em>), but only to solicit care, for example, not to learn a complex vocal repertoire, Fernandez says. Another mammal, the greater sac-winged bat, had been <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/16736178">heard making babbling-like sounds</a> in 2006. Males of this highly social species combine 25 different syllable types into songs used to defend territories and attract mates, but the babbling behavior wasn’t formally studied. Fernandez sought to change that by getting up close and personal with the bats.</p>



<p>At bat colonies in Panama and Costa Rica, Fernandez spent a couple of weeks before pups were born slowly inching closer to the adult animals, habituating them to her presence. By the time the pups arrived and started babbling, she could spend all day camped just meters from the bats. She observed and recorded the sounds of 20 pups over three months as the bats developed their vocal repertoire by imitating male tutors. All told, she and her colleagues captured and analyzed 55,056 syllables from 216 bouts of babbling.</p>



<p>Overall, “bat pup babbling is defined by the same characteristics as human infant babbling,” Fernandez says. Like humans and other babblers, the behavior started early in development, a little over two weeks after the bats’ birth. Protosyllables (akin to human “ba’s” or “ga’s”) were the most prevalent sound made and exhibited lots of variability. These seemingly playful experimentations might help pups shape their vocalizations to match adults, Fernandez explains. Syllables were repeated and were rhythmic, both common features of babbling.</p>

<h3>Babbling baby bats</h3>



<p>A greater sac-winged bat pup makes babbling sounds as it learns how to vocalize like adults. Adult male bats of this species (<em>Saccopteryx bilineata</em>), which live in Central and South America, attract mates and defend territories with songs.</p>

</div>



<p>Like humans, both male and female pups babbled, even though female bats don’t sing as adults. That is vastly different from most songbirds, where only the males are known to babble and sing.</p>



<p>“Females might use [their babbling experience] as a template” for making mating decisions as adults about which bats are better singers, Fernandez says.</p>



<p>The bats may not babble exactly like other known babblers, says Pralle Kriengwatana, a behavioral biologist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland who wasn’t involved in the study. Compared with some songbirds, “this ability to produce adultlike syllables seems to happen much quicker in bats,” she says, noting an abrupt rise in the number of adultlike syllables early in babbling. That rapid expansion might mean that practice through babbling is less important for certain bat syllables than growing the neurological and physiological capacity through normal development, she says.</p>



<p>“Obviously, the bats are babbling,” says Ofer Tchernichovski, an ethologist at the City University of New York’s Hunter College. He hopes the babbling behavior will be confirmed in a more controlled laboratory setting, and, more generally, he says he’s glad to have another animal through which to study vocal learning. “Songbirds are nice, but they’re very far from us.” By investigating another mammal, this research “opens the door,” he says, for studying the neural underpinnings of language’s fundamental building blocks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">How coronavirus vaccines still help people who already had COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some people who have been infected with coronavirus have questioned whether they really need vaccines. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people get vaccinated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html">regardless of whether they’ve already had COVID-19</a>. That’s in part because it’s still unclear how long immunity lasts after an infection. Studies have shown that antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-variant-immunity">hang around in the blood for at least eight months</a> after getting sick, but some recovered patients <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong">have gotten reinfected</a> (<em>SN: 6/11/21;</em> <em>SN: 8/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>COVID-19 jabs give the immune systems of people who were previously infected an extra leg up to fight the coronavirus, including against new, more transmissible variants, other research shows. And because the delta variant, first identified in India, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">can spread among vaccinated people</a>, that extra layer of protection for recovered patients is probably helpful (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>).</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>“If you’ve had exposure to COVID before, don’t think you’re immune to variants,” says Benjamin Ollivere, a trauma surgeon who studies COVID-19 at the University of Nottingham in England. “Have your vaccines.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the evidence that even recovered people benefit from the shots is mounting. Based on the latest studies, here’s what experts know about past infections and getting vaccinated.</p>



<h4>One dose may work, but two could be better</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-infection-one-shot-two-dose-coronavirus-vaccine">One vaccine dose might be sufficient</a> to protect people who have already had COVID-19, lab-based studies suggest (<em>SN: 3/3/21</em>). One shot for those who recovered from a prior infection boosts <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2782762">virus-attacking antibodies to levels similar to those of vaccinated people</a> who got two doses of an mRNA vaccine, researchers reported August 6 in <em>JAMA.</em> A second dose, however, didn’t further increase antibody levels for previously infected people.</p>



<p>Antibodies aren’t the only part of the immune response that benefit from the vaccine, although the immune proteins are crucial to prevent infection. A single shot was enough for recovered patients to reach <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(21)01004-4#%20">high levels of a subset of immune cells called T cells</a>, researchers reported August 3 in <em>Cell Reports</em>. T cells help coordinate and ramp up the immune response when a person is exposed to the virus again.</p>



<p>That suggests that people who had COVID-19 and then were vaccinated with a single dose could be as protected as fully vaccinated people who were never sick. But whether that plays out in the real world, outside the lab, is unclear.</p>



<p>A CDC-led study of previously infected people offers a hint. Kentucky residents who had recovered from a coronavirus infection but weren’t vaccinated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm">were around twice as likely to get infected again</a> as their vaccinated counterparts, researchers report August 6 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>People who were only partially vaccinated — meaning they had received only one of two mRNA vaccine doses or had finished a vaccine regimen less than two weeks prior to being infected — were about 1.5 times as likely to be reinfected as fully vaccinated people. So, even one shot offers protection, but two doses could be slightly better. (One caveat is that few people in the study were partially vaccinated, making it harder to estimate the risk of infection.)</p>



<p>Larger studies will help pinpoint whether previously infected people need more than one dose for protection, the researchers say.</p>





<h4>Shots are the best defense against variants</h4>



<p>Using a single shot to protect previously infected people is promising, but the spread of delta and other variants has called into question whether that single shot is enough.</p>



<p>Lab-based studies suggest that even a single COVID-19 shot makes antibodies from previously infected people better at recognizing other versions of the coronavirus. One mRNA vaccine dose was enough to increase infection-halting antibodies to levels <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6549/1413">up to 1,000 times higher than before vaccination</a>, researchers reported in the June 25 <em>Science. </em>That was true not only for an early version of the virus from China, but also the beta variant, which first emerged in South Africa, and the closely related virus that caused the 2003–2004 SARS outbreak.</p>



<p>Survivors of that 2003–2004 outbreak also benefit from COVID-19 vaccines. Antibodies from vaccinated SARS survivors could stop <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108453">not only the coronaviruses behind SARS and COVID-19 from infecting cells</a>, but also animal coronaviruses from bats and pangolins, researchers reported August 18 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Increasing the amount of time between two vaccine doses can also <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/08/10/scitranslmed.abj0847">help antibodies learn to recognize different coronavirus variants</a>, Ollivere and colleagues report August 10 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. Previously infected, fully vaccinated heath care workers in the United Kingdom — where officials allow shots to be given up to 12 weeks apart rather than the standard three or four — had antibodies that could attack variants including beta.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>It’s unclear whether the findings would be the same for the delta variant, but Ollivere expects that antibodies from previously infected, vaccinated people should fight that variant off too. That should hold true as long as there are no major structural changes in the spike protein, which would help the virus better hide from antibodies, he notes. “And we know delta doesn’t have structural changes.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate study supports that hypothesis. Previously infected and vaccinated health care workers in France had antibodies that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03777-9">recognized delta better than antibodies from workers who were infected</a> only, researchers reported in the Aug. 12 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<h4>There’s hope that vaccines can tackle yet-to-be-seen variants, too</h4>



<p>The more people the coronavirus infects, the more mutations it will pick up, making some experts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">concerned that more worrisome variants</a> than delta may be on the horizon (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>). But the immune system is apt at rolling with the punches, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">continually refining its antibody arsenal</a> to better recognize even mutated forms of the virus (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>One recent experiment offers even more evidence of vaccine-induced antibodies’ ability to recognize emerging variants. Antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients who had been vaccinated stopped a version of coronavirus with 20 changes in it spike protein. The spike protein acts as a key to unlock and infect cells, but <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.455491v1">even with all the changes, antibodies still prevented the virus from infecting cells</a>, researchers reported August 8 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>In the study, which has not yet been reviewed by other scientists, virologists Fabian Schmidt, Yiska Weisblum and colleagues engineered a harmless animal virus that doesn’t make people sick to sport mutated coronavirus spikes. The virus with 20 changes could replicate in lab-grown cells, but it didn’t fare as well as a version of the virus without those mutations — which suggests that the combination of mutations had negative consequences for the virus.</p>



<p>The team then tested how well antibodies from vaccinated or recovered people attacked the mutated virus. “The main question was, ‘What will it take for this virus to evade immunity?’” says Weisblum, of Rockefeller University in New York City.</p>



<p>Those 20 changes to the spike protein were enough to make the virus resistant to antibodies from vaccinated people who were never exposed to the virus, as well as antibodies from previously infected people who never got their shots. But people who were previously infected and vaccinated still had other antibodies that recognized the virus and stopped it from infecting cells — a sign that their immune system had adapted to better recognize its target.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible that a virus with that many mutations in the spike protein will pop up somewhere around the world and cause problems even among vaccinated people, though that remains to be seen, says Schmidt, also of Rockefeller University. Current variants of concern like beta and delta have around 10 spike mutations. If the virus did accumulate more mutations, booster shots should protect people, the finding suggests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As antibodies evolve over time, they “know what to do,” Weisblum says. Future vaccines might include slightly varied versions of the virus, to help the body craft a strong immune response. But even if researchers can’t predict how the virus might change in the future, she says, “the immune system will take care of the rest.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If proof of the existence or otherwise of a god-like deity was available, would you want to see it? What if you had access to a file that revealed whether your partner had ever been unfaithful? And would you take a new genetic test that would indicate whether you have a mutation linked to an incurable disease?</p>



<p>&#8220;All men, by nature, desire to know,&#8221; wrote Aristotle, more than 2,000 years ago. In fact, as the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-41153-001?CheckAccess=1">new paper</a> in <em>Psychology and Aging</em> point out, philosophers have long viewed people as having a thirst for knowledge, and a drive to resolve uncertainty. However, as Ralph Hertwig at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany and his colleagues also note, there are times when we prefer not to know the truth, and even bury our heads in the sand. Older people are often seen as being more prone to doing this. And the team’s research now suggests that this is indeed the case: people aged over 51 were more likely than younger people to choose to remain ignorant of information that would have an emotional impact on them — perhaps a positive impact, but perhaps a negative one.</p>



<span id="more-43243"></span>



<p>The team analysed interview responses from just under 2,000 residents of Germany aged 21 and over. The participants indicated whether or not they’d want knowledge about 13 scenarios. These included: knowledge of the date of their own death; the faithfulness of a future spouse; colleagues’ bonus payments; their genetic predisposition for various diseases; and the authenticity of a supposedly valuable statue in their possession. The team also included one extra item — knowledge of a job applicant’s gender and appearance — to look at people’s response to a type of knowledge that might be avoided in a bid to avoid bias, rather than an emotional reaction. The team then calculated the percentage of each participant’s responses in which they said they’d &#8220;prefer not to know&#8221;, which became their &#8220;Deliberate Ignorance&#8221; scores. Next, the team looked at scores for people in seven different age bands, from 21-30, 31-40 and so on, to 81-99.</p>



<p>As the age of participants increased, the group aged 51-60 was the first to show &#8220;substantial&#8221; differences in Deliberate Ignorance, with more “prefer not to know” responses compared to younger age groups. This increase in Deliberate Ignorance increased as participants got older still. In fact, the authors write, it “occurred quite consistently across items, with one exception” —  the job applicant’s gender and appearance. Participants of all ages had a strong and consistent preference not to know this information. So, it seems that older people are not more likely to avoid knowledge of any kind, but rather types of knowledge that might trigger an emotion, and call on them to regulate their emotions. Why might this be?</p>



<p>The team did assess the personality trait of openness, which is linked to being receptive to new and challenging thoughts and emotions, and which is known to decline with age. However, in their data, they didn’t find much of a link between openness and age. Perhaps, then, there’s a practical influence, they theorised: older adults’ relatively shorter life expectancy may reduce the usefulness of certain types of information, especially health-related information — and the data did support this. The biggest differences in deliberate ignorance item scores between the two oldest age groups and the youngest was for health-related items.</p>



<p>However, another idea may also be relevant here. &#8220;Socioemotional selectivity theory&#8221; holds that when people perceive their future as being wide open, they tend to prioritise goals that relate to the future — gathering information, expanding their horizons, and so on. But when people see their future as being more limited — and older people belong to this group — they focus more on the present, and, for them, emotional satisfaction is more of a priority. Older people may then strive to minimise the risk of receiving potentially negative information, even if that means that they give up the chance to get positive information (to discover that they in fact don’t carry a genetic variant linked to Alzheimer’s disease, say).</p>



<p>Clearly, more work is needed to tease apart the potential influences on the results. But for older people, avoiding the risk of disturbing negative emotions may explain why they are more deliberately ignorant than younger people. As the researchers write: “uncertainty in the present may be preferable to what may turn out to be a distressing certainty in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">See some of the most intriguing photos from NASA’s Perseverance rover so far</a></h4>

              
                <p>In February, NASA’s Perseverance rover touched down on Mars and went to work. The rover has seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">the first flight of a Martian robot</a>, gotten its drill bit dirty and begun traversing the floor of Jezero crater, thought to be the remains of an ancient lake (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>And what Perseverance is finding isn’t exactly what scientists expected. “The crater floor is super interesting,” says planetary scientist Briony Horgan of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., one of the mission’s long-term science planners. “We didn’t really know what we were getting into from orbit.”</p>





<p>Perseverance is getting views of enormous boulders that may have been transported by ancient floods, fine rock layers that look like they settled in calm waters, and rocks with large crystals that look volcanic. The rover’s landing site may include a volcanic lava flow from long ago, or signs of an earlier episode of water — or something else.</p>





<p>“It’s not as obvious as we thought,” Horgan says. “Whatever it is, it’s cool.”</p>



<p>Here are some of the image highlights from the rover so far.</p>



<h3>Taking the long view</h3>



<p>Before the rover landed, the Perseverance team knew that Jezero crater looked like the dry basin of an ancient lake, with a river delta flowing into it. The prospect of finding preserved lake floor sediments made the site good for searching for past life, one of the mission’s primary goals.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true" class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1.png" alt="brown, rocky ground with some layered rock" class="wp-image-3102734" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1.png 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-680x264.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-800x311.png 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-330x128.png 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-1-768x298.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102734">This picture, taken March 17, is a mosaic of five images taken with Perseverance’s Remote Microscopic Imager camera.

<p>Perseverance took this snapshot March 17 of a steep slope in a part of Jezero’s delta, from more than two kilometers away. The rover probably won’t reach that spot until sometime next year. But already, the rover’s Remote Microscopic Imager camera is uncovering details that could reveal new insight into the crater’s watery past.</p>



<p>For example, the tilted layers of sedimentary rock and cementlike mixtures of coarse sand and pebbles in this rock feature, nicknamed “Delta Scarp,” confirm the delta’s wet history. There are also individual large boulders cemented into the front of the scarp, suggesting that the region saw high floods, says Perseverance deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<h3>Closer to home</h3>



<p>Even eroded outcrops close to Perseverance’s landing site look like they had a watery history. This image of a remnant of part of the delta rising out of the crater floor was taken with Perseverance’s Mastcam-Z camera February 22.</p>

<p>“Many of us expected these outcrops to be quite uninteresting, based on orbital data,” Stack Morgan says. But images from the ground showed beautiful layers, just like what you would find in a deep-lake deposit.</p>



<p>“We weren’t expecting to find them here, but maybe they’re right next door to our landing site,” she says. These outcrops could be remnants of the edge of the lake that used to fill Jezero crater or could represent an even older lake that was replaced.</p>



<h3>Even closer</h3>



<p>Perseverance is taking close-ups of the rocks around it too. This closeup image of a rock nicknamed “Foux” was taken July 11 using the WATSON camera on the end of the rover’s robotic arm. The area in the image is only about 4 centimeters by 3 centimeters.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true" class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1495" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3.jpg" alt="closeup of textured martian rock" class="wp-image-3102729" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3.jpg 2000w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-512x383.jpg 512w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-602x450.jpg 602w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-249x186.jpg 249w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-768x574.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-1536x1148.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-776x580.jpg 776w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-3-1038x776.jpg 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102729">This close-up image of a larger rock was taken with Perseverance’s WATSON camera, part of the SHERLOC instrument on the rover’s robotic arm. It shows textured rocks with an interesting coating that might indicate interaction with water. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102729">JPL-Caltech/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The textures in this image are fascinating, as are the “crazy red coatings” that are more purple than typical Mars dust, Horgan says. “What rocks are these?” The coatings probably imply alteration by water, and the purple color suggests that they contain some iron, she adds.</p>



<h3>Volcanic grains?</h3>



<p>Perseverance has also found evidence of igneous, or volcanic, rocks on Jezero’s crater floor. That wasn’t surprising — observations from orbit suggested that volcanic rocks should be there, and scientists hoped to pick up some to help researchers back on Earth figure out the rocks’ absolute ages. Right now, the timing of past events on Mars is based on the sizes of craters and the ages of rocks from the moon, and it’s not extremely precise.</p>

The Perseverance rover abraded the rock to prepare for drilling into it. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102730">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Igneous rocks on Mars tend to be old and preserve a record of their ages well. “If you want to figure out when things happened on Mars, you want an igneous rock,” Stack Morgan says.</p>



<p>On the ground, though, things are a little more complicated. This rock was the first that Perseverance cleared dust from in preparation for taking a sample. The image shows mysterious holes, which could have been formed by erosion or by air bubbles trapped in lava as it cooled. And the surface is divided into light and dark patches that could be individual crystals, or cemented grains.</p>



<p>If they’re crystals, that suggests volcanic activity, Stack Morgan says — but these crystals are bigger than expected for lava that would have cooled at the planet’s surface. Similar crystals form deep in the subsurface of Earth, where magma solidifies slowly. When lava cools at Earth’s surface, the crystals “don’t have time to grow big,” Stack Morgan says. The next step, she says, is “thinking through how rocks like this could have formed here, if they are indeed igneous or volcanic rocks. How would we get a rock that looks like this?” Maybe this rock formed underground and was transported to the surface, but it’s not clear how.</p>



<h3>First sample attempt</h3>



<p>That same rock carried more surprises when the rover team tried to drill into it August 6. The drill worked perfectly, to the team’s elation. “One of the most complex robotic systems ever designed and executed worked perfectly with no faults the first time,” Stack Morgan says. “We were like ‘Oh my god, this is amazing.’”</p>



<p>But when they looked inside the tube that was meant to capture the rock sample, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/320/assessing-perseverances-first-sample-attempt/">it was empty</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s been a bit of an emotional roller coaster,” Stack Morgan says.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true" class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="421" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-5.jpg" alt="split image with a wide view and close view of a borehole in the Martian ground" class="wp-image-3102731" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-5.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-5-680x278.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-5-800x327.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-5-330x135.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-5-768x314.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102731">Perseverance’s shadow (left) looms over the borehole that the rover made on its first attempt to drill into the Red Planet.

These images were taken August 6.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102731">JPL-Caltech/NASA, MSSS</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team thinks that the rock was more crumbly than expected, and essentially turned to dust. “The rock was not able to keep its act together,” Stack Morgan says. The drill is designed to sweep the small grains produced in the drilling process, called cuttings, up and out of the sample tube. Stack Morgan thinks the entire sample was treated as cuttings and ended up in a pile of dust on the ground.</p>



<p>There is a silver lining: Now the rover has a sealed sample of Martian atmosphere. And the rover will attempt to take another sample of a hardier rock sometime soon, Stack Morgan says.</p>



<h3>In the wind</h3>



<p>Mars may have had lakes and rivers in its past, but today the dry, dusty landscape is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">shaped mostly by wind</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>). Perseverance has seen a number of dust devils and windstorms sweep through Jezero crater as a beautiful reminder of how environments are always changing, even on a dried-up planet like Mars.</p>



<figure data-amp-lightbox="true" class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="766" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6.jpg" alt="a tornado-like dust devil swirls across a brown Martian landscape" class="wp-image-3102732" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6-515x383.jpg 515w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6-605x450.jpg 605w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6-250x186.jpg 250w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6-768x571.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_LG_percy_inline-6-780x580.jpg 780w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102732">A dust devil swirls across the Martian landscape.

<p>“We often think of Mars as this barren wasteland where not much happens today,” Stack Morgan says. “But when you see these dust devils move across the images, you’re kind of reminded that Mars, even though not Earthlike, is its own very active planet still.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">With a powerful laser blast, scientists near a nuclear fusion milestone</a></h4>

              
                <p>With a powerful laser zap, scientists have blasted toward a milestone for nuclear fusion.</p>



<p>A fusion experiment at the world’s biggest laser facility released 1.3 million joules of energy, coming close to a break-even point known as ignition, where fusion begins to release more energy than required to detonate it. Reaching ignition would strengthen hopes that fusion could one day serve as a clean, plentiful energy source, a goal that scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-nuclear-fusion-still-hasnt-delivered-clean-energy">have struggled to make progress toward</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>By pummeling a tiny capsule with lasers at the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, scientists triggered fusion reactions that churned out more than 10 quadrillion watts of power over 100 trillionths of a second. In all, the experiment, performed August 8, released about 70 percent of the energy of the laser light used to set off the fusion reactions, putting the facility much closer to ignition than ever before.</p>



<p>Notably, because the capsule absorbs only a portion of the total laser energy focused on it, the reactions actually produced more energy than directly went into igniting them. “That, just fundamentally, is a truly amazing feat,” says plasma physicist Carolyn Kuranz of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the research. By that metric, the fusion reactions produced about five times as much energy as was absorbed.</p>





<p>“It’s a really exciting result, and it wasn’t clear that NIF would be able to get to this result,” Kuranz says. For years, NIF scientists have strived to reach ignition, but they have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ignition-failed">plagued with setbacks</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/13</em>). While the new results have yet to be published in a scientific journal, NIF scientists went public with their discovery after word got out to the scientific community and excitement mounted.</p>



<p>“It makes me very hopeful … for fusion in the future,” Kuranz says.</p>



<p>Nuclear fusion, the same process that powers the sun, would be an appealing source of energy on Earth because it checks several boxes for environmental friendliness: It wouldn’t generate climate-warming greenhouse gases or dangerous, long-lived radioactive waste. In nuclear fusion, hydrogen nuclei meld together to form helium, releasing energy in the process. But fusion requires extreme temperatures and pressures, making it difficult to control.</p>



<p>NIF is not alone in the fusion quest. Other projects, such as ITER, an enormous facility under construction in southern France, are using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">different techniques to tackle the problem</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>). But those efforts have also met with difficulties. Perhaps unsurprisingly, controlling reactions akin to those in the sun is challenging no matter how you go about it.</p>



<p>In NIF’s fusion experiments, 192&nbsp;laser beams converge on a small cylinder containing a peppercorn-sized fuel capsule. When that powerful laser burst hits the cylinder, X-rays stream out, vaporizing the capsule’s exterior and imploding the fuel within. That fuel is a mixture of deuterium and tritium, varieties of hydrogen that respectively contain one or two neutrons in their atomic nuclei. As the fuel implodes, it reaches the extreme densities, temperatures and pressures needed to fuse the hydrogen into helium. That helium can further heat the rest of the fuel, what’s known as alpha heating, setting off a fusion chain reaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1.jpg" alt="illustration of blue lasers blasting a fuel capsule" class="wp-image-3102720" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102720">In fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility, lasers (blue in this artist’s rendering) blast a tiny cylinder containing a fuel capsule (white sphere). That process produces X-rays that vaporize the capsule’s exterior and compresses the fuel to the extreme pressures and temperatures needed to drive fusion.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102720">LLNL</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That last step is crucial to boosting the energy yield. “What’s new about this experiment is that we’ve created a system in which the alpha heating rate is far larger than we’ve ever achieved before,” says NIF physicist Arthur Pak.</p>



<p>Scientists navigated a variety of quagmires to get to this stage. “There’s a whole a host of physics issues … that we’ve faced off and mitigated,” Pak says. For example, researchers took pains to make the capsule absorb more energy, to eliminate tiny defects in the capsule and to carefully tune the laser pulses to maximize fusion.</p>



<p>In 2018, researchers began seeing the payoff of those efforts. NIF achieved a then-record fusion energy of 55,000 joules. Then, in spring 2021, NIF reached 170,000 joules. Further tweaking the design of the experiment, scientists suspected, could increase the output even more. But the new experiment went beyond expectations, producing nearly eight times the energy of the previous effort.</p>



<p>Further studies will help NIF scientists determine exactly how their changes created such bountiful energy and how to enhance the output further. Still, even if NIF achieves full-fledged ignition, using fusion to generate power for practical purposes is still a long way off. “There will be a huge amount of work needed to turn the technology into a viable source of energy,” says laser plasma physicist Stuart Mangles of Imperial College London, who was not involved with the research. “Nevertheless, this is a really important milestone on the way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/haiti-earthquake-citizen-science-seismology-risk">Haiti’s citizen seismologists helped track its devastating quake in real time</a></h4>

              
                <p>On August 14, a powerful magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti, triggering landslides, toppling buildings and killing at least 1,900 people, with over 9,000 people injured. Rescue workers are racing against time to find survivors in the rubble, hampered by heavy rains from Tropical Storm Grace that battered and flooded the country’s southern peninsula on August 16.</p>



<p>Scientists, too, are rushing to the region to learn what they can from the devastation the quake left behind, in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the seismic hazards faced by the country.</p>



<p>The epicenter of the quake was near Petit Trou de Nippes, a town on Haiti’s southern peninsula about 125 kilometers west of Port-au-Prince. The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone passes straight through that peninsula, marking where the Caribbean tectonic plate to the south grinds against the small Gonâve tectonic plate to the north. Scientists often eye this fault zone as the likely source when a deadly quake strikes Haiti, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-scramble-analyze-haiti-quake">the 2010 earthquake that killed at least 200,000 people</a> (<em>SN: 1/16/10</em>).</p>



<p>But several months after that quake, scientists discovered that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/haiti-quake-reveals-previously-unknown-fault">its origin was on a previously unknown fault</a>, near but not part of the well-known Enriquillo zone (<em>SN: 8/11/10</em>). The fault was within a region of faults not mapped before, in part due to a dearth of seismometers in Haiti. Since then, researchers have worked to increase seismic measurements and understanding of the country’s seismic hazards, including through the creation of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.542654/full">a network of volunteer “citizen seismologists</a>.” Data <a href="https://ayiti.unice.fr/sismo-ayiti/">collected by those volunteers</a> have already proved invaluable to tracking the most recent quake and its aftershocks, says geologist Dominique Boisson of the University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince.</p>





<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Boisson and geophysicist Eric Calais of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris about what we know about the new earthquake, scientists’ rapid-response efforts to map its impacts and how citizen seismologists can help. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do we know about where exactly this earthquake occurred?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: Just after an earthquake, we have preliminary results that give you a sense of where the epicenter was. But we don’t have precise information — was it on this fault or another fault? That’s why we are doing the measurements we are doing right now.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: We should keep in mind what happened in 2010. Right after the earthquake, it was the same thing: The Enriquillo fault is the main feature there, it’s got to be that fault. Then the data started coming in, and it became more and more clear that it was not that fault that had ruptured. And in the end, it was demonstrated that it was a small, secondary fault nearby. From a geologic standpoint, that’s very common. A good example is the 1989 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/loma-prietas-long-distance-punch">Loma Prieta earthquake </a>&nbsp;[in California] — that was not caused by the San Andreas Fault, it was triggered by a fault right next to it (<em>SN: 4/21/90</em>).</p>



<p>So are we in this situation from the earthquake of last week? The jury is still out. [This quake] seems to be shallower than the 2010 earthquake, and there’s a gap of about 50 kilometers between [where that quake and the August 14 quake occurred].</p>



<p>A question that a lot of seismologists have is what about this gap — will there be an earthquake [there]? Well, probably, but when, we don’t know. But it’s going to be an area of intense research in future years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>What can we learn from the just-launched seismology fieldwork that researchers at the University of Haiti are doing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It’s essential after any earthquake anywhere to be able to go to the field as quickly as possible to make a scientific assessment, of course without putting the emergency response into any difficulty. What it involves in practice is sending people to the field with instruments like seismometers and geodetic instruments [such as GPS receivers that can provide 3-D coordinates].</p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: Right now, with GPS, they are going to make a survey of the position of the ground, and where it was displaced. We are going to compare these measurements with measurements [from these areas] in the past, and we will track how this movement evolves in the next weeks and months. [We’re] also sending in teams to study landslides [triggered by the quake]. So there is a lot of work to do right now.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: In the case of this earthquake, it’s particularly difficult to reach the field, but we are glad to be able to report that two of the researchers are safe in the field … [and] are deploying instruments to better understand the mechanism of the earthquake. That will be very important to assess what might be coming next, and in particular to better understand what the aftershocks are telling us.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>How well are the faults of this area mapped? And how might measurements of microseisms — abundant tiny earthquakes difficult to distinguish from background noise — help to image Haiti’s subsurface?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: The big [Enriquillo] fault is well-known. But we are very far from having detailed maps of the active faults of the southern peninsula or other parts of the country. There’s a lot of work to be done to have a good map of the active faults and what is the real shape of the structures underneath.</p>



<p>With data on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-million-tiny-earthquakes-revealed-southern-california">microseisms</a>, including from citizen seismologists, it will be very helpful to get this kind of information for <a href="https://seismosoc.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/12/details/5621">imaging the structures in the subsurface</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/19</em>). Even though the data [from the citizen seismologists] is not of the same quality as the professional networks, it’s very important for helping to image the structures.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How important has the citizen seismology project been to tracking the recent earthquake and its aftershocks?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It has been essential. It’s just amazing how proactive the seismic station hosts have been. We call them hosts, because they host a tiny little box, about 10 centimeters by 5 centimeters by 5 centimeters. And you just connect it to power and the internet, and it provides data in real time. And then we have built a system that analyzes the data in real time and provides aftershock locations. So within 30 seconds of an aftershock, we know exactly where it happened, what was the magnitude and the depth and so on.</p>

Calais</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How many citizen seismologists are working with you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: We have 15 stations throughout the country, and in the epicenter area, we have six stations. And we’re deploying more as we speak. We have a new project that’s just been approved to augment the network with an additional 50 stations.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>So who are these volunteers? What are some of the challenges they face in doing this work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: Their backgrounds vary — we have a public notary, we have a hotel owner, we have a civil engineer. It’s all over the map really. It’s not easy to have internet and power available all the time in Haiti — there’s no place, almost, where that’s possible. So everybody has a power generator of some kind; you buy your internet plan by the day. We had one station, the station closest to the epicenter … the host was so sorry because he had not renewed his internet plan when the earthquake happened. And right away he contacted us and said, “Well, I just ran to the internet provider and I just bought a new plan!” And his station came back online right away.</p>



<p>So it’s an amazing effort. It shows that there is really an interesting bridge to build between citizens who want to participate and want to be informed, and scientists. The data are very, very useful to us, and the interaction we’re having with the hosts is teaching us a lot also about how the risk is perceived and what kind of message [about potential seismic hazards] is useful.</p>



<p>The message of a seismologist is a very technical one, and so how do we convey a message that is actionable, that makes sense to the people who receive it? We’re not trained for that, and we need to learn from our audience what they need.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>In 2020, you (Calais and Boisson) and your colleagues published a preliminary report on the citizen seismology project, calling it a socio-seismology experiment. How might this work improve earthquake awareness and potentially reduce risks from these hazards?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It’s a very interesting endeavor because it’s not only seismology that we’re interested in. It’s a project that we’re conducting with sociologists and anthropologists. The project is too young to be able to tell whether it has made any difference in the level of preparedness. But right now are we are trying to organize a team of sociologists to send into the field to interview people and build a baseline of information about how risk is perceived. We don’t have that. It’s a shame that we tend to send emergency response, seismologists and so on, [but] we don’t think so much about sending sociologists.</p>



<p>After the 2010 earthquake, which was really a dramatic experience for a lot of people, there was no baseline study that was done right after. So you come back 10 years later, and you can’t tell a difference between how the risk is perceived. So we’re trying to change that.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">How extreme heat from climate change distorts human behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a sweltering summer afternoon almost a decade ago, Meenu Tewari was visiting a weaving company in Surat in western India. Tewari, an urban planner, frequently makes such visits to understand how manufacturing companies operate. On that day, though, her tour of the factory floor left her puzzled.</p>



<p>“There were no workers there … only machines,” says Tewari of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>



<p>The missing employees weren’t far away; they were resting in the shade under a nearby awning. Scorching temperatures had been causing workers to make mistakes or even faint near the dangerous machinery, Tewari’s guide told her. So the company had mandated that workers come in earlier and leave later so that they could rest during the midday heat.</p>



<p>Physiologically, people’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">bodies aren’t built to handle heat</a> beyond wet bulb temperatures — a combined measure of heat and humidity — of around 35° Celsius, or about 95° Fahrenheit (<em>SN: </em><em>5/8/20</em>). Mounting evidence shows that when heat taxes people’s bodies, their performance on various tasks, as well as overall coping mechanisms, also suffer. Researchers have linked extreme heat to increased aggression, lower cognitive ability and, as Tewari and colleagues showed, lost productivity.</p>



<p>With rising global temperatures, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know">record-breaking heat waves</a> baking parts of the world, the effects of extreme heat on human behavior could pose a growing problem (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="454" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1.jpg" alt="tailors working at desks in Mumbai" class="wp-image-3102684" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1-574x383.jpg 574w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_sg_heat-human-behavior_inline1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102684">Factory workers in India, such as these tailors in Mumbai, must often work in buildings without air conditioning.

<p>And lower-income people and countries, with limited resources to keep cool as climate change warms the world, are likely to suffer the most, researchers say. &nbsp;“The physiological effects of heat may be universal, but the way it manifests … is highly unequal,” says economist R. Jisung Park of UCLA.</p>



<h4>Heat and aggression</h4>





<p>Scientists have been documenting humans’ difficulties coping with extreme heat for over a century. Much of that work, however, has taken place in laboratory settings to allow for a high degree of control.</p>



<p>For instance, a few decades ago, social psychologist Craig Anderson and colleagues showed undergraduates four video clips of couples engaged in dialog. One clip was neutral in tone, while the remaining three showed escalating tension between the duo. The undergraduate students watching the clips were each sitting in a room with the thermostat set to one of five different temperatures, ranging from a cool 14° C to a hot 36° C. The researchers then asked the students to score the couples’ hostility level. Anderson, now of Iowa State University in Ames, found that students in uncomfortably warm rooms scored all the couples, even the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260100800040">neutral one, as more hostile</a> than students in rooms with comfortable temperatures did. (Interestingly, students in uncomfortably cold rooms also scored the couples as more hostile.)</p>



<p>Heat tends to make people more irritable, says Anderson, whose findings appeared in the 2000 <em>Advances in Experimental Social Psychology. </em>And as a result, “they tend to just perceive things as being more nasty when they’re hot than when they’re comfortable.”</p>



<p>Research suggests that such perceptions can give way to actual violence when people lack an escape hatch. But this “heat-aggression hypothesis” has been hard to demonstrate outside the lab because teasing out the effect of heat from other environmental or biological variables linked to aggression is tricky in the messy real world. Studies in the last few years, however, have started confirming the idea. &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Fueling crime</h3>



<p>Researchers have long known that people can become more aggressive when overheated. A new study looking at crime data in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2017 shows that violent crime rises when temperatures exceed a pleasant 65° to 70° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>For instance, a July working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research came close to re-creating the level of control found in a lab by focusing on inmates in Mississippi prisons and jails that lack air conditioning. Economists Anita Mukherjee of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Nicholas Sanders of Cornell University looked at rates of violence across 36 correctional facilities from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2010. Overall, each facility averaged about 65 violent acts per year. But the pair found that on days above around 27° C — which occur about just over 60 days per year — the probability of <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28987">violence among inmates rose 18 percent</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t seem that hot, most of those days of had an average maximum temperature of roughly 34° C; nor do those temperature readings account for Mississippi’s high humidity, Mukherjee says. Moreover, many of the country’s aging correctional facilities lack both air conditioning and proper ventilation, and temperatures inside the facilities often exceed temperatures outside.</p>



<p>Politicians often frame providing inmates with air conditioning as a matter of comfort, Mukherjee says. “When we’re talking 120-plus degrees [Fahrenheit] inside a prison for many days a year, it becomes a moral issue.”</p>



<p>Extrapolating from the Mississippi data, Mukherjee and Sanders estimate that heat generates an additional 4,000 violent acts each year in U.S. correctional facilities.</p>



<p>Research also suggests that violence spikes alongside heat outside of prisons. For instance, for the months May to September from 2010 to 2017, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727272100044X">violent crime in Los Angeles was about 5.5 percent higher</a> on days with temperatures from about 24° C to 32° C (75° to 89° F), compared with days below those temperatures, researchers reported in the May <em>Journal of Public Economics</em>. Violent crime was almost 10 percent higher on even hotter days, the researchers found.</p>



<h4>Heat and performance</h4>



<p>The relationship between heat and human behavior extends well beyond violence. Consider students taking exams in hot school buildings. Park, the UCLA economist, zoomed in on students in New York City sitting for standardized subject-specific high school exams. Each take about three hours and are administered at the student’s home school for a two-week period at the end of June. Temperatures at that time can vary from 15° C to almost 37° C.</p>



<p>Park looked at scores for almost 1 million students and about 4.5 million exams from 1999 to 2011. That analysis, appearing March 2020 in the <em>Journal of Human Resources, </em>found that students who take the exam on an approximately 32° C day are <a href="http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2020/03/03/jhr.57.2.0618-9535R3">10 percent less likely to pass</a> a given subject than if they had taken that exam on a 24° C day. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Park and colleagues also looked at how hot temperatures might affect students’ performance across the country. This time, they zoomed in on the PSAT, a standardized exam administered to high schoolers in October that measures college readiness and provides a pathway to scholarships. The team evaluated 21 million scores from nearly 10 million students who took the exam at least twice from 1998 to 2012. That way, the researchers could compare how students performed relative to themselves. The team also correlated exam scores with daily temperature data from around 3,000 weather stations across the country, as well as information about each student’s access to air conditioning.</p>



<p>Student scores typically increase between the first time they take the exam and the second. But even when the researchers factored in that rise, students in schools without air conditioning scored lower than would have been expected, the researchers reported in the May 2020 <em>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</em>. What’s more, Black and Hispanic students were more likely to attend school and test in hotter buildings than their white counterparts, and the researchers estimate that the resulting temperature differences <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fpol.20180612">explained 3 to 7 percent of the PSAT’s racial achievement gap.</a></p>



<p>That sort of performance decline doesn’t just happen in academic settings; it extends to the workforce too. Following Tewari’s visit to the weaving factory in Surat, she began combing through data on worker output in India — where industrial air conditioning can be rare — at several weaving and garment sewing factories and a steel company that supplies rails for railways.</p>



<p>Tewari and colleagues observed workers from roughly one to nine years, depending on the industry. When temperatures climbed beyond 35° C,&nbsp;average&nbsp;daily production in weaving dropped by about 2 percent and garment sewing by as much as 8 percent, compared with days under 30° C, the researchers estimate in the June <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>.</p>



<p>The team then scaled up to industries across India using national survey data. That analysis showed that productivity started dropping when average daily maximum temperatures rose above 20° C. The researchers’ calculations suggest that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713733">average annual output will decrease by 2.1 percent if average daily temperatures warm by 1 degree C</a> over current conditions; annual gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced in a single year, would drop by 3 percent.</p>



<p>The takeaway: Extreme heat hurts some countries’ bottom line, Tewari says.</p>





<h4>Universal air conditioning?</h4>



<p>The burdens of high heat are often borne by a country’s poorest residents. For instance, in the United States, a long legacy of discriminatory housing policies means poor people often live in the hottest parts of a city, a July report from Climate Central, an independent climate science research and communications organization, notes. In these concentrated pockets of heat, called “urban heat islands, <a href="https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/uploads/general/2021_UHI_Report.pdf">midafternoon temperatures can rise by 8° to 11° C</a> above outlying areas. The effects tend to be worse in poor neighborhoods due to high density, limited green space and shade and an abundance of paved roads and surfaces that absorb rather than reflect heat.</p>



<p>Similarly, in that study linking intense heat to violent crime spikes in Los Angeles, researchers found strong geographic differences. “Beverly Hills doesn’t have much violent crime on any of those days. But in the poorest communities in Los Angeles, you see a larger correlation between heat and violence,” says environmental economist Matthew Kahn of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Compared with wealthier city residents, poor people in Los Angeles have less space and far fewer air conditioning units, Kahn adds.</p>



<p>Given these inequities, the simplest choice is to provide everyone with air conditioning, Kahn says. But cooling buildings is far from free. Cooling equipment, including primarily air conditioners, accounted for about <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33094/CoolRep.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">17 percent of the world’s total electricity demand</a> in 2018, according to a 2020 United Nations report. Estimates suggest that air conditioning use in emerging economies alone will lead to 33 times as much energy consumption by the year 2100. And, at the moment, most of that energy comes from nonrenewable sources, chiefly oil, coal and gas, so meeting that demand would contribute to global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The choice over whether or not to install an air conditioning unit in a given facility, as with many things, comes down to relative costs and benefits, Tewari says. Even with soaring temperatures, air conditioning entire factories remains more expensive than giving workers midday siestas or selectively air conditioning only those rooms where precision is most required.</p>



<p>Moreover, better cooling options exist, say Tewari and others, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">maintaining or increasing tree cover in cities and using “cool” building materials</a> that reflect sunlight (<em>SN: </em><em>4/3/18</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Air conditioning is not sustainable,” Tewari says. “There are urban planning mechanisms through which you can reduce ambient temperatures.”</p>



<p>But Kahn says poor people deserve access to air conditioning. The long-term solution is not to keep overheating the poor, but to expedite efforts to green the energy grid, he says. “The poor have the least capacity to adapt. In a fair society, I hope we don’t just shrug at that fact.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/space-iconic-landmarks-mexico-city-google-office-03-21-2014/">ball pits</a> to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f23e63b-8768-441d-abc7-68e27ca6feed">free beers</a>, fun job perks have received plenty of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/19/working-for-tech-companies-quirks-of-the-job?CMP=twt_gu">press attention</a> over the last few years. For millennials, such benefits should surely be appealing — they are, after all, the generation these perks were ostensibly designed for.</p>



<p>But according to a new study, young people themselves have a different priority in the workplace — respect. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23294884211016529">Writing in the <em>International Journal of Business Communication</em></a>, a team led by Danielle LaGree from Kansas State University finds that being valued and respected by managers was the key factor in employees’ ability to positively adapt to the workplace. And, in turn, this impacted how loyal workers were to their employers, how much they engaged in their work, and how happy they felt overall.</p>



<span id="more-43238"></span>



<p>Participants were 1,036 adults aged 21 to 34, all of whom were in full time employment. First, participants answered questions about “respectful engagement” at their workplaces — the extent to which colleagues express appreciation and respect for each other’s work, emphasise each other’s good qualities, and speak to each other in a respectful way. Next, they completed a measure of how they felt they were judged by bosses or supervisors, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “my boss values what I contribute to work” and “my boss appreciates my unique contributions to the job”.</p>



<p>Occupational resilience was measured next, with participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements related to the way they handle setbacks at work, as well as how satisfied they felt at work in general. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to remain at their current company in the future, and how engaged they were at work, responding to statements including “I strive as hard as I can to complete my job”, “I feel positive about my job” and “I pay a lot of attention to my job”.</p>



<p>Those who felt they were respected and valued both by colleagues and by bosses were more likely to experience occupational resilience — that is, they were more able to deal with the challenges of the workplace. In turn, greater occupational resilience led these people to say they were more likely to want to stay employed at their company, and more willing to engage with their roles.</p>



<p>There was no difference by gender or ethnicity of participants, though there were different outcomes based on field: those working in computing reported significantly more respectful engagement at work than those working in retail, healthcare, education or sales.</p>



<p>Together, the results show that having supportive colleagues and supervisors can increase employees’ job satisfaction and engagement, and make them more likely to retain their position — and it seems that this is because a supportive environment creates employees who are able to deal with the trials and tribulations of the workplace. The team suggests that these findings could be a useful tool — training bosses in particular how to communicate respectfully, for example, could make for happier, more satisfied workplaces with employees who are unlikely to seek new work.</p>



<p>Looking explicitly at other perks and benefits could provide additional insight. To what degree do perks mitigate disrespectful workplaces, if at all? Overall, however, the results suggest that workplace happiness is mostly dependent on fundamental principles of respect and appreciation. They, more than free beers or ball pits, are likely to define employees’ experiences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildflower-carnivore-plant-sticky-hair-insect-trap">A well-known wildflower turns out to be a secret carnivore</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gleaming, gluey, deathtrap hairs have betrayed the secret identity of a well-known wildflower: It’s a carnivore.</p>



<p>A species of false asphodel (<em>Triantha occidentalis</em>) uses enzyme-secreting hairs on its flowering stem to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2022724118">snare and digest insects</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 17 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Scientists have known about<em> T. occidentalis</em> since the 19th century, but its taste for meat has gone undetected until now.</p>



<p>Sticky hairs by themselves aren’t unusual — many noncarnivorous plants use them to defend against pests<em>. </em>But <em>T. occidentalis</em> has qualities that some meat-eating plants share: a love of bright, boggy, nutrient-poor habitats and the absence of a gene that fine-tunes how plants get energy from light. Together, those features felt like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle hinting at carnivory, says botanist Sean Graham of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>To solve the puzzle, Graham and colleagues needed to know if the wildflower pulls nutrients from insect corpses. Luckily, <em>T. occidentalis</em> grows along North America’s West Coast, from Alaska to California, and can be found on hikes near Vancouver. “They’re right on our doorstep,” Graham says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="454" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1.jpg" alt="bugs stuck to stems of Triantha occidentalis wildflowers" class="wp-image-3102665" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1-574x383.jpg 574w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102665">Experiments confirm that <em>Triantha occidentalis </em>wildflowers are carnivorous, getting nutrients from insects that get caught in their sticky stem hairs (shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102665">Qianshi Lin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team attached fruit flies fed with nitrogen-15, an isotope that can be used to track changes in nitrogen levels, to the flowering stems of bog-dwelling <em>T. occidentalis</em> plants in British Columbia’s Cypress Provincial Park. Over half of the wildflowers’ nitrogen came from the fruit flies, the team found. Those levels are comparable to known carnivorous plants. What’s more, the wildflowers’ sticky hairs oozed phosphatase, a digestive enzyme that many carnivorous plants secrete to consume prey.</p>



<p>Most of the world’s roughly 800 meat-eating plant species <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/pollinators-venus-flytrap-plants">set traps and flowers far apart</a> to avoid killing pollinating visitors (<em>SN: 2/6/18</em>). <em>T. occidentalis</em> bucks that trend. “Putting your traps close to your flowers is, on the surface, a really big conflict,” Graham says. But the plant’s hairs may be just sticky enough to catch small flies and beetles without entrapping bigger pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>



<p><em>T. occidentalis’</em> sticky hairs might also hint at how some meat-eating plants evolved. In nutrient-poor soils, it may have been advantageous for some plants to co-opt hairs for carnivory, Graham says. “The insects are being trapped anyway, so might as well use them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">New studies hint that the coronavirus may be evolving to become more airborne</a></h4>

              
                <p>Small aerosol particles spewed while people breathe, talk and sing may contain more coronavirus than larger moisture droplets do. And the coronavirus may be evolving to spread more easily through the air, a new study suggests. But there is also good news: Masks can help.</p>



<p>About 85 percent of coronavirus RNA detected in COVID-19 patients’ breath <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab691/6343417">was found in fine aerosol particles</a> less than five micrometers in size, researchers in Singapore report August 6 in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>. The finding is the latest evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is spread mainly through the air in fine droplets that may stay suspended for hours rather than in larger droplets that quickly fall to the ground and contaminate surfaces.</p>



<p>Similar to that result, Donald Milton at the University of Maryland in College Park and colleagues found that people who carried the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.21261989v1">alpha variant had 18 times as much viral RNA in aerosols</a> than people infected with less-contagious versions of the virus. That study, posted August 13 at medRxiv.org, has not been yet been peer reviewed. It also found that loose-fitting masks could cut the amount of virus-carrying aerosols by nearly half.</p>

<p>In one experiment, the Maryland team grew the virus from the air samples in the lab. That could be evidence that may convince some reluctant experts to embrace the idea that the virus spreads mainly through the air.</p>



<p>The debate over aerosol transmission has been ongoing since nearly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission">200 scientists wrote a letter to the World Health Organization</a> asking for the organization to acknowledge aerosol spread of the virus (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>). In April, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">WHO upgraded its information</a> on transmission to include aerosols (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had acknowledged aerosols as the most likely source of spread just a few weeks before.</p>



<p>Previous studies in monkeys have also suggested that more virus ends up in aerosols than in large droplets. But some experts say that direct evidence that the virus spreads mainly through the air is still lacking.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of indirect evidence that the airborne route — breathing it in — is dominant,” says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, who studies viruses in the air. She was one of the 200 scientists who wrote to the WHO last year. “‘Airborne’ is a loaded word in infection control circles,” she says, requiring health care workers to isolate patients in special rooms, wear protective equipment and take other costly and resource-intensive measures to stop the spread of the disease. For those reasons, infection control experts have been reluctant to call the coronavirus airborne without especially strong proof.</p>



<p>Most COVID-19 cases have been among close household contacts — typically within the 6-feet splash zone of large droplets. It can be hard to tease out whether such infections were passed on by large droplet contamination or by breathing the same air. But for other situations, such as when patrons get infected while sitting across a restaurant from someone with COVID-19, aerosols are really the only explanation, Marr says.</p>



<p>Mechanical engineer Kwok Wai Tham of the National University of Singapore set out to sample how much virus COVID-19 patients produce when they breathe, talk or sing, in part, to address skeptics’ concerns. “I’m doing this to convince some very close friends,” he says. He and colleagues rolled a mobile lab into 22 patients’ rooms and had volunteers stick their heads into a large metal cone.</p>





<p>The researchers collected both aerosols and larger droplets that the patients exhaled while breathing quietly for 30 minutes, while repeating passages from Dr. Seuss’ <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> for 15 minutes, or while singing simple tunes like the “Happy Birthday” song, “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” or the “ABCs” for 15 minutes. The scientists tested both aerosols and large droplets in the air samples for coronavirus RNA and calculated how many copies of the virus’s nucleocapsid protein gene, or N gene, were present. That gives an estimate of how much virus is in a sample.</p>



<p>Of the 22 patients who sang for science, only 13 spewed forth detectable levels of viral RNA. In general, singing created the most virus-laden aerosols, but some people generated more while talking. Those differences might be attributable to the volume at which volunteers sang, Tham says. “Some people were shy and sang softer. Others were quite uninhibited.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The overall amount of virus that people produced varied widely. Scientists already knew that some people are more likely to spread the virus than others, including some people involved in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">superspreading events</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 6/18/20</em>). In this new study, the differences weren’t due to symptoms — some asymptomatic people made more virus than those with fevers, coughs or runny noses.</p>



<p>Only one factor stood out as affecting the amount of virus emitted. People who were earlier in the course of infection tended to produce more virus, the researchers found. That agrees with data from lab animal studies and other human studies suggesting that people are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">most contagious in the first week</a> after catching the coronavirus (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>So far, Tham’s skeptical virologist friends aren’t convinced that he’s demonstrated that aerosol transmission is the major route of COVID-19 spread. “They say, ‘we need the golden evidence. Show me a live virus that is retrieved from the air,’” Tham says.</p>



<p>Viral RNA could be debris from dead viruses that can’t cause infection, says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved in either study. “In the absence of infectious virus, the significance of aerosols on transmission is still a bit unclear.”</p>

<p>The study from the Maryland group may provide that evidence. In that study, people with asymptomatic or mild coronavirus cases recited the ABCs, shouted “Go Terps!” (the Maryland mascot) or sang “Happy Birthday” into a similar device. In this study, the infected people did the activities once while wearing a mask and once while not wearing one.</p>



<p>About 45 percent of fine aerosol particles contained viral RNA, as did 31 percent of coarse aerosols larger than 5 micrometers and 65 percent of droplets called fomites collected from swabs of the volunteers’ mobile phones, the researchers found.</p>



<p>In addition, the increased amount of alpha variant in aerosols may suggest that the coronavirus is evolving toward more efficient airborne spread, the researchers propose. The study was done from May 2020 to April 2021, before the delta variant began its surge in the United States.</p>



<p>Researchers were able to grow infectious virus from two of 66 aerosol samples, both collected while people were wearing masks. None of the coarse aerosols or fomites yielded any infectious virus.</p>



<p>Although the Maryland group used an efficient way to look for infectious virus in aerosols, it was still rare to find them, Pekosz says. “It would be difficult to make the case that this was what is responsible for increased spread of alpha.”</p>



<p>But Marr says the data do suggest the coronavirus is evolving toward more efficient spread through the air. Although the study involved only four patients infected with alpha, those people consistently released more virus than people infected with other variants. “These results combined with epidemiological observations about the spread of alpha, and now delta, support the idea that these variants are supercharged when it comes to aerosol transmission,” she says.</p>



<p>The masks volunteers wore in the Maryland study were mostly loose-fitting. They ranged from a single-layer homemade cloth mask early on and progressed over the course of the study to double-layer commercially made cloth masks, to double masks, surgical masks and one KN95 mask by the end. On average, the masks reduced the number of virus-containing, coarse aerosols produced by 77 percent compared with no mask. And virus-laden fine aerosols were reduced an average of 48 percent, though the reduction ranged from 3 percent to 72 percent. Masks performed equally well against the alpha variant as for other variants. &nbsp;Previous studies have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting masks — ones that seal tightly to the face and don’t leave gaps at the tops, bottoms or sides for the virus to pass unfiltered — may reduce coronavirus exposure by 96 percent</a> if everyone is wearing them (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>The latest results suggest that masks can help reduce the amount of virus people give off, though the coronavirus can still escape if the face coverings are worn loosely. “With the dominance of newer, more contagious variants than those we studied, increased attention to improved ventilation, filtration, air sanitation, and use of high-quality tight-fitting face masks or respirators … will be increasingly important for controlling the pandemic,” the researchers wrote. That’s especially important in places with low vaccination rates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunbirds-feathers-iridescence-heat-light">Sunbirds’ dazzling feathers are hot, in both senses of the word</a></h4>

              
                <p>For sunbirds, all that shimmers is piping hot.</p>



<p>The birds’ flashy, iridescent feathers heat up more than other types of feathers, possibly making it harder to stay cool in hot, sunny conditions. If so, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0252">the colorful plumes may be costly ornaments for luring mates</a>, researchers report August 4 in the <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. </p>



<p>Many studies on the thermal properties of animal color have previously focused on differences between how dark and light colors derived from pigments react to light and heat, says Svana Rogalla, a biophysicist at the Biofisika Institute in Bilbao, Spain. Less attention has been paid to how heat interacts with structural color — often vibrant, iridescent hues created by light refracting off of microscopic structures. These structures are found in everything from the scales of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-worms-elvis-species">deep-sea worms</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>5/25/20</em>) to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-structures-give-peacock-spider-its-radiant-rump">spiders</a>’ exoskeletons (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/9/16</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, Rogalla and colleagues turned to sunbirds, nectar-feeding birds typically smaller than sparrows that are native to Africa, Asia and Australia. Sunbirds have feather colors that come from a mix of sources, including pigments like fiery carotenoids and dark melanin as well as iridescent structural color.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The researchers examined 15 sunbird species preserved at the Field Museum in Chicago, heating the specimens under a lamp that mimics sunlight and then measuring the surface temperatures of feathers and the preserved birds’ skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iridescent feathers heated up more than feathers that had only pigment-based colors, the team found. In breast feathers, for example, iridescent feathers averaged about 74° Celsius at the feather surface after a few minutes of light exposure, where feathers with yellow to red carotenoid pigments reached just over 63° C. This heat transferred to the skin, too, with skin under iridescent feathers growing about 5 degrees C and 8 degrees C hotter than skin under feathers with olive or yellow to red pigments.</p>



<p>Light scattering off of microscopic layers of air, the protein keratin and melanin-containing structures called melanosomes creates iridescent feathers’ sheen. But the plentiful melanin also makes the feathers absorb more solar radiation than other lighter-colored, less melanin-rich feathers, Rogalla says, which contributes to heating.</p>



<p>What’s more, high-powered microscopes and heat simulations showed that melanosomes’ arrangement in an iridescent feather⁠ encourages heat absorption. Melanosomes in a dark, noniridescent feather sit relatively disorganized in layers. But the melanosomes in the stacked, microscopic structures that produce iridescence are more organized and densely packed. Iridescent feathers likely heat up more than black feathers because those shimmering plumes have more melanosomes over a given feather area, Rogalla says.</p>



<p>The shape of the melanosomes may make a difference too. Iridescent feathers tend to have plate-shaped melanosomes, with rod-shaped ones in black feathers and spherical ones in gray feathers. The team’s simulations showed plate-shaped melanosomes heating up more than the other two shapes.</p>

Those feathers absorb more light than other feather types, possibly making it harder to stay cool.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102575">Svana Rogalla</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Iridescence is more pronounced in male sunbirds than females and is used in courtship displays. Rogalla wonders if the flashy colors, by possibly contributing to heat stress, create an evolutionary conflict between mating and staying cool, or thermoregulating. “It could be a trade-off,” she says, “being very colorful to attract females, but then you have a cost when you sit in the sun when it’s hot.”</p>



<p>Allison Shultz, an ornithologist at the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County in California who was not involved with this research, says the flashy plumage may act as a signal demonstrating a male bird’s relative vigor and resilience.&nbsp;“Maybe it shows [females] that males are able to deal with this higher heat load by having iridescent colors.”</p>



<p>Still, there’s a big caveat to the experimental setup. The study’s results may be “difficult to put in perspective” because the experiments were conducted on dead birds, says Vinod Kumar Saranathan, an evolutionary biologist at Yale-NUS College in Singapore.&nbsp;“You don’t have the benefit of the live bird [to evaluate], manipulating its body and doing various things to actively thermoregulate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunbirds can release heat by panting or changing feather positions. And the birds rarely stay in the sun for long, Saranathan says, explaining that they dart from flowers in sunny areas to more shaded forest. If iridescent feathers lose heat as quickly as they acquire it, the sunbirds could use shade to cool off, blunting the effect of the hot plumage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Iridescence has evolved so many times independently across the [bird evolutionary tree],” Saranathan says. If shiny feathers were particularly burdensome to birds, he says, that repeated evolution wouldn’t be likely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the findings have implications for how iridescence could contribute to heat effects from climate change. Rogalla points out that small birds like sunbirds — vulnerable to big swings in ambient temperatures — have already perished en masse from extreme heat events. Such instances of mass death have occurred among Australian parrots, for example, where intense heat waves have killed <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/heatwave-kills-hundreds-of-birds-in-wa-20090113-7g1f.html">hundreds of budgerigars</a> and scores of <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/PC110141">cockatoos</a> in recent years. With their hot feathers, iridescent sunbirds may be especially at risk.</p>



<p>A warming climate may force iridescent birds to be active for shorter amounts of time during hot days to avoid the additive impact of solar heating, Saranathan says.&nbsp;If so, he adds, such a truncated schedule may increase competition for food in the precious remaining active hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262046121">Bright Galaxies, Dark Matter, and Beyond</a><br><em>Ashley Jean Yeager</em><br><em>MIT Press, $24.95</em></p>



<p>Vera Rubin’s research forced cosmologists to radically reimagine the cosmos.</p>



<p>In the 1960s and ’70s, Rubin’s observations of stars whirling around within galaxies revealed the gravitational tug of invisible “dark matter.” Although astronomers had detected hints of this enigmatic substance for decades, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Rubin’s data helped finally convince</a> a skeptical scientific community that dark matter exists (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>“Her work was pivotal to redefining the composition of our cosmos,” Ashley Yeager, <em>Science News</em>’ associate news editor, writes in her new book. <em>Bright Galaxies, Dark Matter, and Beyond</em> follows Rubin’s journey from stargazing child to preeminent astronomer and fierce advocate for women in science.</p>





<p>That journey, Yeager shows, was rife with obstacles. When Rubin was a young astronomer in the 1950s and ’60s, many observatories were closed to women, and more established scientists often brushed her off. Much of her early work was met with intense skepticism, but that only made Rubin, who died in 2016 at age 88, a more dogged data collector.</p>





<p>On graphs plotting the speeds of stars swirling around galaxies, Rubin showed that stars farther from galactic centers orbited just as fast as inner stars. That is, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">the galaxies’ rotation curves were flat</a>. Such speedy outer stars must be pulled along by the gravitational grip of dark matter.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>staff writer Maria Temming spoke with Yeager about Rubin’s legacy and what, beyond her pioneering research, made Rubin remarkable. The following discussion has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: What inspired you to tell Rubin’s story?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>It all started when I was working at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., in 2007. I was walking around the “Explore the Universe” exhibit and noticed there weren’t many women featured. But then there was this picture of a woman with big glasses and cropped hair, and I thought, “Who is this?” It was Vera Rubin.</p>



<p>My supervisor was a curator of oral histories. He was working on Rubin’s, so I asked him about her. He said, “I have one more oral history interview to do with her. Would you like to come?” So I got to interview her. She was charismatic, kind and curious — not a person who was all about herself, but wanted to know about you. That stuck with me.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: You spend much of the book describing evidence for dark matter besides Rubin’s research. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>I wanted to make sure I didn’t portray Rubin as this lone person who discovered dark matter, because there were a lot of different moving pieces in astronomy and physics that came together in the ’70s and early ’80s for the scientific community to say, “OK, we really have to take dark matter seriously.”</p>



<p><strong>Temming: What made Rubin’s work a linchpin for confirming dark matter?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She really went after nailing down that flat rotation curve in all types of galaxies. Mainly because she did get a lot of pushback, continually, that said, “Oh, that’s just a special case in that galaxy, or that’s just for those types of galaxies.” She studied hundreds of galaxies to double-check that, yes, in fact, the rotation curves are flat. People saying, “We don’t believe you,” didn’t ever really knock her down. She just came back swinging harder.</p>



<p>It helped that she did the work in visible wavelengths of light. There had been a lot of radio astronomy data to suggest flat rotation curves, but because radio astronomy was very new, it was really only once you saw it with the eye that the astronomy community was convinced.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: Do you have a favorite anecdote about Rubin?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>The one that comes to mind is how much she loved flowers. She told me about how on drives from Lowell Observatory to Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, she and her colleague Kent Ford would always stop and buy wildflowers. The fact that picking these wildflowers stuck with her, I thought, was just representative of who she was. Her favorite moments weren’t necessarily these big discoveries she’d made, but stopping to pick some flowers and enjoy their beauty.</p>

<p><strong>Temming: Did you learn anything in your research that surprised you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>I didn’t initially grasp how many different types of projects she had. She did a lot with looking for larger-scale structure [in the universe] and looking at the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-bursts-universe-expansion-hubble-constant">Hubble constant</a> [which describes how fast the universe is expanding] (<em>SN: 4/21/21</em>). She had a very diverse set of questions that she wanted to answer, well into her 70s.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: I was surprised by her decision to get out of the rat-race of hunting for quasars, when that area of research heated up in the 1960s.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She very much didn’t like to be in pressure situations where she could be wrong. She liked to go and collect so much data that no one could [dispute it]. With quasar research, it was just too fast, and she wanted to be methodical about it.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: Why is Rubin’s story important to tell now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>Unfortunately for women and minorities in science, it’s still very relevant, in that there are a lot of challenges to pursuing a career in STEM. Her story demonstrates that you have to surround yourself with people who are willing to help you and get away from the people who want to keep you down. Plus her story is also very encouraging: Your curiosity can keep you going and can fuel something way bigger than yourself.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: How did she advocate for women in astronomy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She was very outspoken about it. At National Academy of Sciences meetings, the organizers always dreaded her standing up, because she would say, “What are we doing about women in science? We’re not doing enough.” She was constantly pushing for women to be recognized with awards. She kept tabs on the number of women who had earned Ph.D.s and who had gotten staff positions — and their salaries. She was very data-driven. She’d cull that information and use it to advocate for better representation and recognition of women in astronomy.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: How would you describe Rubin to someone who hasn’t met her?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She was one of the most persistent, gracious and nurturing people that I’ve ever met. You could strip away all that she did in astronomy and she would still be this incredible figure — the way she carried herself, the way she treated people. Just a beautiful human being.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>No one likes the sound of someone else chewing or drinking. But for some people, it’s enough to cause overwhelming feelings of anger or disgust — and in some cases, send them into a violent rage. People with &#8220;misophonia&#8221; (literally a hatred of sounds) over-react to some common everyday &#8220;trigger sounds&#8221; — typically, sounds made by another person. Though the <a href="https://allergictosound.com">phenomenon has been well documented</a>, exactly what causes it hasn’t been clear. Now a <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/41/26/5762.full.pdf">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> provides a compelling explanation: that misophonia isn’t related to hearing so much as to an &#8220;over-mirroring&#8221; of someone else’s physical actions. The team, led by Sukhbinder Kumar at Newcastle University, thinks that this excessive mirroring causes anger in some sufferers, and anxiety and distress in others.</p>



<span id="more-43233"></span>



<p>So-called &#8220;mirror neurons&#8221; in the premotor cortex were first discovered in monkeys. Groups of these neurons fire when a monkey either performs a specific action, like opening a peanut shell, or watches another monkey doing the same action. This system is thought to aid learning from others, and also the coordination of actions, so that a troop can hunt together effectively, for example. In people, there is evidence for mirror systems for movement and also emotion. (I should note, though, that some researchers <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/25/there-is-only-weak-evidence-that-mirror-neurons-underlie-human-empathy-new-review-and-meta-analysis/">dispute the strength of this evidence</a>.)</p>



<p>Misophonia has been thought of as a disorder of sound emotion processing — that sufferers over-react emotionally to trigger sounds. However, Kumar and his colleagues observed that most trigger sounds involve physical movements of the mouth and face. They wondered whether this might be important for understanding the disorder.</p>



<p>The team used fMRI to look at activity in the brains of 33 people with and without misophonia while they were in a &#8220;resting state&#8221; — when they were not actively engaged in doing anything in particular. They also analysed existing fMRI data on 42 people with and without misophonia while they listened to three categories of sounds: known trigger sounds (including gulping, slurping, eating food and sniffing); other generally unpleasant sounds (such as the sound of a baby crying or a dentist’s drill); and neutral sounds (like rain or a helicopter).</p>



<p>A number of intriguing differences emerged between sufferers vs non-sufferers. While in a resting state, people with misophonia showed stronger functional connectivity between the auditory and visual cortex and the ventral premotor cortex (functional connectivity is a measure of how closely correlated brain activity is in different regions). This latter region includes the orofacial motor area, which is responsible for movements of the face and mouth region. While listening to sounds of any kind, people with misophonia also showed stronger connectivity between the auditory cortex and the orofacial motor area. Finally, in response to known trigger sounds, they showed stronger activation of the orofacial motor area.</p>



<p>The fact that the misophonia group showed differences specifically involving facial motor regions points to misophonia being caused by aberrations in the motor mirror system — by excessive mirroring of someone else’s facial movements — rather than abnormal sound processing, per se. “Our results support a model of misophonia based on ‘hyper-mirroring’ of the orofacial actions of others with sounds being the ‘medium’ via which action of others is excessively mirrored,” the team explains.</p>



<p>It’s a fascinating idea. And it sits neatly with other work on different kinds of hyper-mirroring, such as &#8220;<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/20/whats-different-about-the-brains-of-the-minority-of-us-who-feel-other-peoples-physical-pain/">mirror pain</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://banissylab.com/mirror-touch/">mirror touch</a>&#8220;. However, people with these conditions <em>feel </em>at least some pain or touch when they see someone else being hurt or being touched, and these experiences don’t tend to make them angry. Why would hyper-mirroring of someone else’s mouth movements make misophonia sufferers so distressed, or induce rage?</p>



<p>The team suggests that if they’re not aware of what’s actually going on (and mirror pain would be a lot more noticeable than facial movement mirroring), someone with misophonia could experience a sense of a loss of control over their own actions and goals. “Since anger can be described as perceived goal interference, the drive to imitate others would make anger (or aggression) the dominating emotional response,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Clearly, there&#8217;s more to explore here. But this new conception of misophonia could have immediate practical impacts. For some sufferers and their families, misophonia is a very serious problem. It can lead to social isolation and even suicide. If sufferers could be trained to associate trigger sounds with the sound sources rather than orofacial movements specifically, perhaps this might work as an effective treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-grave-finland-warrior-nonbinary-person-gender">A 1,000-year-old grave may have held a powerful nonbinary person</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, a roughly 1,000-year-old grave in southern Finland has been thought to have held a powerful woman who might have been a warrior. But an individual who was biologically male may have actually have been interred there, researchers now say. And there are signs that this person was perhaps a respected individual with a nontraditional gender identity.</p>



<p>Discovered in 1968 at a site known as Suontaka, the Finnish grave held a largely decomposed human skeleton. Only two leg-bone fragments were successfully excavated. The grave also included jewelry traditionally associated with women and two swords, including one with a bronze hilt, typically attributed to men. Items in the Suontaka grave date to the latter part of Finland’s early medieval period, between 1050 and 1300.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of a tiny amount of nuclear DNA extracted from a leg-bone fragment suggests that the grave held an individual born with an extra X chromosome, say archaeologist Ulla Moilanen of the University of Turku in Finland and colleagues. Symptoms of this condition in present-day males, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353949">Klinefelter syndrome</a>, include low testosterone, lack of facial and body hair, enlarged breasts and learning and language-related problems. Effects of this rare condition on growth and appearance range from mild to noticeable.</p>



<p>That genetic evidence, combined with the unusual mix of male- and female-related items in the grave, suggests that the grave held an individual who was nonbinary, Moilanen’s group says. Gender identity refers to a person’s concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither. It often, but not always, coincides with a person’s biological sex. Nonbinary individuals have gender identities that are not strictly male or female.</p>





<p>Even in early medieval societies that emphasized masculinity and warfare, some individuals who didn’t fit community expectations about how males and females should behave may have been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/woman-with-a-sword-weapon-grave-at-suontaka-vesitorninmaki-finland/33A89DB1D7E4900F017833D87C997D3D">interred in ways that commemorated their nontraditional social gender identities</a>, the scientists conclude July 15 in the <em>European Journal of Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>“This burial [at Suontaka] has an unusual and strong mixture of feminine and masculine symbolism, and this might indicate that the individual was not strictly associated with either gender but instead with something else,” Moilanen says.</p>



<p>The nature of that alternative gender identity remains a mystery. Further complicating matters, early medieval gender identities may have been shaped by poorly understood social and community forces, not personal choices, Moilanen says.</p>



<p>Men today vary greatly in their responses to Klinefelter syndrome, says psychologist Chris Kraft, codirector of clinical services at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Sex and Gender Clinic. Some develop nontraditional gender identities, while others express confusion about their gender identity. But many men with Klinefelter syndrome adopt a traditional gender identity for their biological sex. Reasons for these differences are poorly understood.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to know how someone in early medieval Finland would have reacted to having Klinefelter syndrome,” Kraft says.</p>



<p>Intriguingly, though, the Suontaka individual not only had a likely case of Klinefelter syndrome but was also buried with that curious mix of male and female items. Moilanen’s group studied 23 animal hairs and three bird feather fragments retrieved from soil that had been excavated with the leg-bone fragments. Based on that evidence, the Suontaka individual was likely dressed in feminine clothes made of sheep’s wool and furs from animals that included rabbits or hares, the researchers say. Bird feathers came from a pillow or bedding, which along with brooches placed in the grave were associated with females, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>But in a move closely tied to early medieval ideas about masculinity, a hiltless sword was apparently placed on top of the man’s body at the time of burial. A fancier sword with a carved bronze hilt was probably placed next to the body later, perhaps to show continuing respect for the Suontaka individual, the investigators suggest.</p>

<p>The new study plausibly suggests that the Suontaka grave held a respected person who had neither a typical male nor female sense of their social gender identity, says archaeologist Marianne Moen of the University of Oslo, who was not part of Moilanen’s group.</p>



<p>But even if a woman had been placed in the grave with swords and jewelry, the evidence would indicate that some individuals with outside-of-the-box identities — such as a woman who viewed herself as biologically female but socially male according to conventions about warriors at the time — were respected in early medieval Finland and perhaps elsewhere in Scandinavia, Moen adds.</p>



<p>Other researchers have controversially proposed that an approximately 1,000-year-old grave in Sweden held the remains either of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-ignites-debate-over-whether-women-were-viking-warriors">a Viking warrior woman</a> or a woman buried with the apparel and weapons of a warrior (<em>SN: 9/13/17</em>).</p>



<p>Rare instances in Scandinavia of early medieval graves containing men who were buried with jewelry and other feminine items have been difficult to interpret. Perhaps the closest parallel to the Suontaka individual is a man who was interred at Vivallen, Sweden, nearly 1,000 years ago with attire of both high-ranking males and females, as well as jewelry and a small knife, Moilanen says. Some researchers suspect that this man was a ritual specialist, since there is evidence that shamans dressed in women’s clothes in early medieval Scandinavia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-aurora-poles-super-heat-upper-atmosphere">Jupiter’s intense auroras superheat its upper atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>Jupiter’s upper atmosphere is hundreds of degrees warmer than expected. After a decades-long search, scientists may have pinned down a likely source of that anomalous heat. The culprit, a new study suggests, is the planet’s intense auroras, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-electrons-space-magnetic-field-waves-earth">Jupiter’s version of Earth’s northern and southern lights</a> (<em>SN: 6/8/21</em>).</p>



<p>The temperature of the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, which orbits an average distance of 778 million kilometers from the sun, should be about –73° Celsius, says James O’Donoghue, a planetary scientist at the JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Sagamihara, Japan. That’s largely due to the feeble illumination of the sun there, which amounts to less than 4 percent of the energy per square meter that hits Earth’s atmosphere. Instead, the region several hundred kilometers above the planet’s cloud tops has an average temperature of about 426° C.</p>



<p>Scientists first noticed this mismatch more than 40 years ago. Since then, researchers have come up with several ideas about where the upper atmosphere’s thermal boost might originate, including pressure waves or gravity waves created by turbulence lower in the atmosphere. But observations by O’Donoghue and his colleagues now provide convincing evidence that the auroras pump heat throughout the planet’s upper atmosphere.</p>



<p>The researchers used the 10-meter Keck II telescope atop Hawaii’s dormant Mauna Kea volcano to observe Jupiter on one night each in 2016 and 2017. Specifically, the team looked for infrared emissions that betray the presence of positively charged hydrogen molecules (H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>). Those molecules are created when charged particles in the solar wind, among other sources, slam into the planet’s atmosphere at hundreds or thousands of kilometers per second, painting polar auroras.</p>





<p>Measuring the intensities of these molecules’ infrared emissions let the team pin down how hot it gets high above the cloud tops. In those polar regions, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03706-w">temperatures in the upper atmosphere likely top out at about 725° C</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 5 <em>Nature. </em>But at equatorial latitudes, the team’s heat map showed that the temperature falls to about 325° C. That pattern of a gradual drop-off in temperature toward lower latitudes bolsters the notion that Jupiter’s auroras are the source of anomalous heat in the upper atmosphere and that winds disperse that warmth from the polar regions.</p>



<p>One of the nights the team observed Jupiter — January 25, 2017 — was particularly well-timed because Jupiter was experiencing a strong solar flare at the time. Besides an intense aurora, data revealed a broad swath of warmer-than-normal gases at mid-latitudes, which the researchers interpret as a wave of warmth rolling southward. “It was pure luck that we captured this potential heat-shedding event,” says O’Donoghue.</p>



<p>The team’s observations “are close to a ‘smoking gun’ for the redistribution of auroral energy,” says Tommi Koskinen, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The next challenge, he notes, is to understand the underlying mechanisms of heat production and heat transfer and to then incorporate them into researchers’ simulations of Jupiter’s atmospheric circulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/probiotics-lab-coral-heat-stress-death-reef-survival-ocean-warming">Probiotics help lab corals survive deadly heat stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Warming seas threaten to turn coral reefs from kaleidoscopes of color into bleached fields of rubble. To stop this degradation, some scientists are exploring a surprising salve: probiotics.</p>



<p>Dosing corals with a mix of beneficial bacteria <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg3088?_ga=2.77567516.861410186.1628708147-402785923.1584982368">staved off death</a> in a heat wave simulated in an aquarium, researchers report August 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>. In comparison, nearly half of corals given a benign saline solution instead did not survive those same conditions. The research offers a proof of concept that probiotics could help some corals survive heat stress.</p>



<p>“The results are incredibly promising,” says Blake Ushijima, a microbiologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington who wasn’t involved in the research. The work lends legitimacy to using probiotics as coral medicine, he says, “but we’re just scratching the surface. We don’t understand how a lot of these beneficial microbes work.”</p>



<p>Corals are not singular entities, but coalitions of cooperative players. Center stage are the photosynthetic algae that harness the power of the sun, providing energy to their animal host, the coral polyp. Scores of bacteria live in the coral too, many supporting their host by cycling nutrients or fighting pathogens. Collectively referred to as the coral “holobiont,” corals and their microbial partners form the bedrock of one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet.</p>





<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-heat-waves-are-becoming-more-common-and-lasting-longer">Worsening marine heat waves</a> are testing the integrity of healthy holobionts (<em>SN: 4/10/18</em>). Under heat stress, corals’ algae spew toxic chemicals, prompting polyps to kick them out. This process, known as bleaching, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reef-rehab-could-help-threatened-corals-make-comeback">can kill corals</a> (<em>SN: 10/18/16</em>). For example, bleaching from a 2016 heat wave wiped out <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/coral-reefs.html">29 percent</a> of shallow water corals in the northern Great Barrier Reef. Bacterial communities shift under heat stress too, disrupting the benefits some bacteria provide.</p>



<p>“Overall, we see a breakdown of symbiotic relationships, and all the microorganisms start to struggle,” says Raquel Peixoto, a marine ecologist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. She and her colleagues previously showed that treating corals with carefully concocted probiotic cocktails <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-018-0323-6">could mitigate coral bleaching</a> in lab experiments. That’s good, she says, “but we wanted to find out if we can protect them against mortality.”</p>

Her research focuses on treating heat-stressed corals with probiotics.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102647">Helena Villela</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the most recent setup, the researchers simulated a marine heat wave across 10 aquaria, each with four fragments of&nbsp;<em>Mussismilia hispida</em> stony corals, turning up the temperature to 30° Celsius for 10 days before returning it to 26°C. Half the corals were squirted with six bacterial strains from <em>M. hispida</em> every three days during the heat wave and every five days afterward, while the other half got a saline treatment. Over the course of 75 days, Peixoto and her colleagues measured coral health and changes in the holobiont’s metabolic activity, along with which genes got turned on and off.</p>



<p>Corals in both groups bleached, but the probiotic treatment ultimately worked. While 40 percent of saline-treated corals succumbed to the heat, all corals bathed in bacteria survived. “That was surprising and super exciting,” Peixoto says. The probiotic seems to aid the recovery of corals by inducing genetic and metabolic changes in the host that are associated with tamping down inflammation and allowing damaged cells to rebuild themselves, the researchers found.</p>



<p>“Climate change is affecting corals faster than they can adapt,” but their microbial partners can respond to changes more quickly, says Kimberly Ritchie, a marine biologist at University of South Carolina Beaufort who wasn’t involved in the research. &nbsp;Such changes, which probiotic treatments could induce, might “buy corals more time,” she says.</p>



<p>Peixoto and her colleagues plan to move beyond the aquarium, starting experiments in mid-August in to see whether probiotics can help wild corals. But some scientists are skeptical of the added bacteria’s ultimate utility, especially for large reefs that boast hundreds of coral species. “Probiotics are sexy right now,” says Ty Roach, a molecular ecologist at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Kaneohe. “I can imagine scenarios where this would be a great approach… but I don’t think they’re going to save the reefs.”</p>



<p>For example, applying probiotics to large reefs that boast hundreds of coral species seems logistically challenging, Roach says. And there could be unintended consequences. “What’s good for one coral may not be good for other corals or organisms,” Roach says. “For ecosystems as complex as coral reefs, I can’t see doing this on a large scale without having some unforeseen, potentially harmful, effects.”</p>



<p>Peixoto says that the probiotics used here are carefully screened and no strains known to be harmful to life are used. Overall, probiotics “aren’t going to be a silver bullet,” she says. The only thing that will save the reefs is mitigating carbon dioxide emissions to reduce global warming. “But we still need restoration and rehabilitation to cope with the reality that we have now,” she says, and probiotics show promise.</p>

<html><body><p>You find the ideal article online, but the specific methodologies are unclear. Following hours of laborious searching you find a defined outline of the methods, costing you valuable research time. This is just one of many practical difficulties presented by a lack of Openness in scientific publishing, and consequently has opened the door for a transition towards Open Science, a more collaborative approach with publishers and researchers working together.</p>



<p>Open Science, defined as the practice of inclusive and trustworthy science, requires a vision of Openness that goes beyond access to formal research articles alone. The application of publishing options that provide greater transparency and accessibility to scientific research help actualise these fundamentals of Open Science.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&ldquo;Open Science is key to sharing and accessing scientific information. I chose to post the preprint as a way of sharing findings earlier.&rdquo; </p><cite>Pie Ntampaka, University of Rwanda</cite></blockquote>

Kristen Brown said: “This image represents both the beauty and bounty of our oceans as well as the spiraling crisis unfolding within the marine environment. Coral reefs with high coral cover and plentiful fish populations like this one at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef are sadly becoming rarer. Without a concentrated effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve water quality, coral reefs as we know them are at risk of disappearing within our lifetime.” Senior Editorial Board Member Josef Settele recommended the entry, saying: “Marine biodiversity sustains life and the health of our planet, but human activities are threatening the well-being of the world’s oceans. Kristen Brown’s striking image is a symbol for the need for concentrated efforts to manage biodiversity loss and set conservation priorities.”</p>

<p>Our runner up and best image for this category was submitted by Kseniya Vereshchagina, an ecologist who studies Lake Baikal in south-eastern Siberia. Lake Baikal is one of the oldest and deepest lakes in the world, giving rise to rich and particularly unique freshwater fauna. However, Kseniya explains that in areas of heavy industry and active tourism, &#8220;there is a significant impact on coastal communities.&#8221; Kseniya and her lab group at Irkutsk State University found that in areas of intense human activity, the immunity of endemic amphipod crustaceans is weakened, making them more susceptible to parasitic infection. Kseniya tells us that this image shows &#8220;an endemic amphipod crustacean densely covered with an overgrown colony of parasitic ciliates.&#8221; Lake Baikal holds exceptional scientific value to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Such research highlights the need to minimize the impact of human activity on this precious site.</p>

<p>This stark winning image for the &#8216;Behavioral Ecology category&#8217; was submitted by an evolutionary biologist and conservation photographer affiliated with the University of Valencia, Spain. Roberto tells us that “Spiders are one of the most sophisticated hunters on earth. Nevertheless, they cannot escape from what evolution has provided to other species. In particular, some groups of wasps are specialized in hunting spiders and use them as a trophic resource for their larvae. I found this epic scene in a wall of a biological station in Tiputini, Ecuador.”</p>

Roberto said: “Thousands of soldier termites are able to migrate in a complex social environment where each individual has its own mission framed altogether in a global objective: the survivorship and reproduction of the colony. In this case, these termites used meters of an abandoned rope to move across the Malaysian forest. Once humans disappear, nature recovers its space and uses what is needed to survive.”</p>

Mammals cannot repair severe damage to tissues &#8211; a severed limb does not grow back. However, zebrafish have a spectacular ability to regenerate various tissues after traumatic injury. Chey tells us that &#8220;This image shows the blood vessels in a regenerated zebrafish tail fin two weeks after clipping at the horizontal white line. Whether regeneration is a primitive or adaptive trait to environmental conditions is the subject of much debate, and the mechanisms underlying the regeneration process are not yet fully understood. Transgenic zebrafish, such as the line used to generate this image, are an important tool to help us better understand why some animals have the power of regeneration by allowing the visualization of certain cell types labelled by fluorescent reporters.&#8221;</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>As children head back to school, teachers and parents will of course be concerned about kids catching up on their education after the Covid-19 lockdowns. But, as <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/child-play-priority-after-lockdown">many psychologists have pointed out</a>, they <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341992762_Impact_of_COVID-19_Restrictions_on_Young_Children's_Play_Learning_Development_Preliminary_Findings_from_the_Play_and_Learning_in_the_Early_Years_PLEY_Survey">need to catch up on play</a>, too. So what does the research tell us about the need for and the importance of play?</p>



<span id="more-43228"></span>



<p><strong>First: why do kids need to play?</strong></p>



<p>Well, of course, it’s fun — and as we all know, having fun is critical for kids’ psychological wellbeing. But there are also all kinds of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/">documented developmental benefits</a>. For example, play helps children learn how to interact successfully with others and to get better at regulating their emotions. Kids also learn through play: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/">as we discussed in our recent podcast</a>, it helps them to develop concepts and skills, including mathematical concepts and problem-solving, and to stretch each other. If they are running around and navigating obstacles (even if those obstacles are just other kids), it also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/01/we-have-many-more-than-five-senses-heres-how-to-make-the-most-of-them/">trains their senses —&nbsp;especially proprioception and their vestibular senses</a>. For all sorts of reasons, it’s vital. In fact, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states clearly that “<a href="https://ipaworld.org/childs-right-to-play/uncrc-article-31/un-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child-1/">every child has the right… to engage in play</a>”. In <a href="https://theconversation.com/four-ways-children-say-their-well-being-can-be-improved-104195">one pre-Covid-19 survey</a>, children in Wales were asked what they would change to make themselves healthier and happier — and more time and space to play and feel safe was a top response.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t drop afternoon breaks</strong></p>



<p>Many UK schools have now shortened or even dropped afternoon break-times, replacing them with extra teaching time instead. Given the reduced teaching during lockdowns, more schools may find it tempting to lose that break. But there’s evidence that this would harm children’s wellbeing. The <a href="https://happen-wales.co.uk">HAPPEN (Health &amp; Attainment of Pupils in a Primary Education Network) project </a>on children aged 9 &#8211; 11 in Wales found that those who had afternoon breaks were physically fitter, for example, and, notably, they did no worse in Key Stage 2 tests than children who’d instead been taught during this time. Physical activity doesn’t have to be restricted to break time and PE lessons, however. A <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/win-win-physically-active-academic-school-lessons-boost-pupils-activity-levels-and-focus/">preliminary trial on 8- and 9-year-olds in 10 London schools</a> found that those in active maths and English lessons — in which they ran on the spot, for example, while answering questions — were more focused in the class.</p>



<p><strong>There are other benefits to playing outside</strong></p>



<p>For one, as supported by a recent paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85825-y">increase in myopia (short-sightedness) in many countries has been linked to reduced time spent outdoors in childhood</a>. Regular playtimes in green spaces, such as parks, are also associated with <a href="https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1758-0854.2011.01052.x">milder symptoms for kids with ADHD</a>. And there could ultimately be environmental &nbsp;benefits from kids spending longer outside, too: work led by Catherine Broom at the University of British Columbia, Canada, has linked <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/australian-journal-of-environmental-education/article/abs/exploring-the-relations-between-childhood-experiences-in-nature-and-young-adults-environmental-attitudes-and-behaviours/029FC630519229DA5744DBFC257C0EA1">time spent outdoors in childhood to a love of nature and concern for the environment </a>in young adulthood.</p>



<p><strong>Make &#8220;enhanced&#8221; pretend play part of the curriculum?</strong></p>



<p>Periods of time devoted to imaginative play are common in preschools and in classes of younger school children. Certainly, they give kids the opportunity to learn how to interact well with others. But Édouard Gentaz at the University of Geneva and colleagues wondered whether teacher-guided pretend play sessions that focused more explicitly on social and emotional development might have extra benefits. <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12484">They recently ran a study involving classes of 5 &#8211; 6 year-olds</a> in Valais, Switzerland. Some of these children got 11 hour-long weekly play sessions guided by a teacher who had been trained to encourage them to pretend to be bursting with joy, for example, or who challenged them to solve a dispute, while the others had non-guided pretend play sessions. The team found that the children who’d been guided were better at recognising emotions and had a bigger emotional vocabulary. Whether or not that translates into better interpersonal skills is not yet clear. A more extensive trial is now underway, again in the region of Valais.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t panic about newly aggressive pretend play</strong></p>



<p>After the pre-Easter lockdown, my 10-year-old came home with all kinds of stories of playground bust-ups. I’m sure the same thing happened in every school. After so long in isolation, it’s no wonder that some kids struggled with managing anger. For a minority, though, this is an ongoing problem. And a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjdp.12352">recent study</a> led by Zhen Rao of the Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning at the University of Cambridge found something really interesting about the impact on classmates.</p>



<p>The team observed children aged 7 to 10 in China while they played with toys in pairs. (The toys were &#8220;neutral&#8221;; there were no toy guns, for example.) The results showed that when a child was paired with one who was deemed by fellow classmates to be bad-tempered, that first child was 45% more likely to introduce aggressive themes into their joint play. The child’s own temperament didn’t seem to influence this — it was to do with who they were with.</p>



<p>A lot of research on aggression in play has focused on potential associations with the child’s own temperament. But the study suggests that kids use play as a safe context in which to explore how to best handle an aggressive person in real life. For some children, then, aggression-themed play may not be a sign that they struggle to &#8220;play nicely&#8221; with other kids, but rather a sign of social-emotional learning.</p>



<p>All of this work argues that as our children go back to school, teachers should keep sight of what of course they know to be true — that play time as well as study is vitally important — while parents can ensure that children get as much play, and especially outdoor play, as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-school-testing-kids-safe">How different COVID-19 testing plans can help keep kids safe in school</a></h4>

              
                <p>Backpack? Check. Notebooks and pencils? Check. Coronavirus test? Check.</p>



<p>As fall approaches, many parents and teachers hope to leave Zoom school behind and have kids return to the classroom. But the exceptionally transmissible delta variant threatens to dash these hopes as schools scramble to prepare. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that schools employ a suite of COVID-19 mitigation measures, including social distancing, masking for all students and teachers, improving air filtration and testing students regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing, in particular, “is a way we can spend money to reduce transmission while maintaining in-person school time,” says Alyssa Bilinski, an infectious disease modeler at Brown University in&nbsp;Providence, R.I. “It’s a flexible tool that can be scaled up or down depending on the on-the-ground situation, and it can both stop transmission and provide real-time, school-specific information that can inform decision making.”</p>



<p>While some coronavirus outbreaks did occur in schools during the last school year, transmission was usually <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html">equal to or lower than community levels</a> of the virus, especially when schools had mitigation measures in place, the CDC says. Now, as pandemic fatigue calcifies, many school districts are under pressure to remove measures like masking or social distancing or testing, even as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">delta variant</a> drives a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).</p>

<p>A layered approach that incorporates all of these mitigation measures is best, but with delta, “testing is going to be even more critical” in schools, says Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.</p>



<p>In a perfect world, all students could be tested each day with a free test that instantly revealed, with 100 percent accuracy, whether they were infected, Gronvall says. But such tests do not exist, and schools have limited budgets and bandwidths to create perfect protocols. Instead, districts will need to weigh trade-offs among different coronavirus tests, and balance frequency and scope of testing to fit schools’ needs.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at some of the testing strategies that schools are using and their inherent benefits and challenges.</p>



<h4>When tests are pooled</h4>



<p>Last February, Northborough-Southborough public schools in eastern Massachusetts started a new routine. Once a week, thousands of students (with parental consent) swabbed their noses at home, stuck the swab in a plastic baggie and brought it to school. There, swabs were pooled into groups of 16 and shipped off to a nearby lab, where technicians combined material from the swabs in each group for individual PCR tests.</p>



<p>Laboratory <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-college-university-campus-cases-testing">PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, tests</a> can detect bits of coronavirus genetic material in samples, and represent the gold standard of diagnostic testing (<em>SN: 2/23/21</em>). A PCR test will almost never say someone without the coronavirus has it — what’s known as a false positive — but can miss infections, perhaps <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.00995-20">10 to 20 percent</a> of the time. Still, it’s the most accurate test currently in use, though that performance comes at the price of time and money.</p>



<p>Combining individual samples into pools, as Northborough-Southborough public schools did, is one cost-saving strategy. For example, if a pooled sample tested negative, the school system saved about $240 per pool each week by not having to test all 16 students individually with a $16 test. If a sample was positive, the lab then tested each swab to see who had the virus.</p>



<p>The strategy offers a relatively simple and cost-effective way to screen Northborough-Southborough’s approximately 4,100 students while still catching infections, says Mary Ellen Duggan, the school system’s director of health and wellness. A similar scheme will be implemented this year.</p>



<p>Theoretically, some pooled testing strategies can identify up to <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/589/eabf1568">20 times as many true positives</a> as testing individual students, given a limited testing budget, researchers reported April 14 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. With only so many dollars to spend, pooled testing can cover a larger population of people, catching infections that might otherwise be missed by using that same budget to only test individual swabs.</p>



<p>Northborough-Southborough schools had all individual swabs tested if a pool turned positive, but other schools have employed different protocols. “Some just send everyone home and say go get tested,” Gronvall says. “There’s a lot of flexibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For pooled testing to work, buy-in from students is crucial. In Northborough-Southborough schools, peak participation rates were about 60 percent, on average. When students tested positive, nurses at the school would scramble to call the children and instruct them to isolate, and identify and call their contacts too, a practice known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-u-s-contact-tracing-end-social-distancing">contact tracing</a> (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>“To get this program up and running was a full-time job,” Duggan says, but it paid off. Overall, Northborough-Southborough schools saw very few cases, a result of the full suite of mitigation strategies that the schools employed, Duggan says.</p>



<p>But pooled testing has downsides. Not all schools have easy access to labs capable of running PCR tests. If administrators can have the tests run, it can still take a couple of days to get results back and then even more time to do contact tracing, ample opportunity for infected students to spread the virus. This might prove especially problematic with the delta variant, which may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">spread much sooner after infection</a> (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).</p>

<p>For speedier information, some schools have instead opted to use rapid antigen tests, which don’t quite match a PCR test’s ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-rapid-tests-rna-virus">identify only true positive cases</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/20</em>), but can reveal an infection in just 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Test-to-play, test-to-stay</h4>



<p>High school football players were the guinea pigs for Utah’s rapid testing strategy.</p>



<p>Almost all schools in the state tried to stay in person during the 2020–2021 school year. “In the first couple months of school, we saw a spike in case counts [among students],” says Kendra Babitz, the COVID-19 state testing director for the Utah Department of Health. That spike peaked in November, prompting all extracurricular activities to be canceled, except for the football playoffs.</p>



<p>“They were just about done, and we thought this would be a great place to test out testing,” Babitz says.</p>



<p>To compete, athletes had to present a negative test, usually an <a href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/diagnostics-testing/BinaxNOW-what-you-need-to-know.html">Abbott BinaxNOW rapid antigen test</a> provided by the state, within 72 hours before a game or practice. Players with positive tests were barred from participation and instructed to isolate for 10 days, with the option of testing out of isolation after seven days. Their close contacts were told to quarantine too.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, this test-to-play strategy incentivized adherence to other preventive measures, like wearing masks, Babitz says. The playoffs themselves went off with few hitches, and the percentage of positive tests among players dropped from about 4 percent to about 2 percent over two weeks. Over the next several weeks, test-to-play was extended to all extracurricular activities at 127 public high schools across the state.</p>



<p>Off the heels of the test-to-play strategy’s success, 13 high schools adopted a similar protocol for sustaining in-person learning. Instead of sending all students home for remote learning in the early stages of an outbreak, schools that used a “test-to-stay” program would screen all consenting students with rapid antigen tests whenever COVID-19 cases spiked above 1 or 2 percent of the student body. (Some schools went further, testing students every two weeks, regardless of cases.)</p>



<p>Those who tested negative could stay in school — effectively testing out of remote learning — while students who tested positive had to isolate at home for 10 days. Students who opted out of the test-to-stay program were recommended, but not required, to switch to remote learning for 10 days if testing participation rates were below 60 percent, or if more than 2.5 percent of participating students tested positive.</p>



<p>Allowing students to test out of remote learning after an outbreak <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e2.htm#:~:text=Test%20to%20Play%20was%20implemented,extracurricular%20winter%20athletics%20competition%20events.&amp;text=Test%20to%20Stay%20was%20conducted,%2Dperson%20instruction%20student%2Ddays.">saved more than 100,000 in-person student learning days</a>, Babitz and others reported May 28 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. </em>Reported COVID-19 cases in the schools also declined overall after test-to-stay was implemented, though this study did not assess the impact of this intervention on transmission in schools. But a study in England found that schools where students could rapidly test out of quarantine had <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.21260992v1">similar transmission rates</a> as schools that kept students out of school during the full quarantine period, researchers reported July 25 at medRxiv.org.</p>

<p>Overall, the test-to-play and test-to-stay programs were “a big success,” Babitz says. All told, nearly 60,000 students were tested through both programs, and nearly 1,900, or 3.2 percent, got a positive result.</p>



<p>Still, while declining cases meant that the whole suite of COVID-19 mitigation measures that schools were using were working, Babitz explains, that could sometimes lead to skepticism from the community. People ask, “Is this really worth the lift if we&#8217;re not getting that many people?” she says. Participation rates in the testing programs fell as the year progressed. This fall, Babitz worries that more parents will be resistant to enrolling their children in the Utah programs, hamstringing them from the start.</p>



<p>Other states, including Delaware, are planning to implement similar rapid testing strategies this coming school year.</p>



<p>Antigen tests work by rapidly detecting proteins from the coronavirus instead of having to sequence genetic material as PCR tests do, which takes more time. That quick turnaround offers significant advantages over PCR testing. But some experts worry that the rapid tests’ higher propensity for false positives among people without symptoms could isolate some students in unnecessary quarantines.</p>



<p>“If you’re using a rapid test for screening, it’s important to have a confirmatory test available and available quickly so that you can get confirmation of a positive result and know whether you really need to isolate that person and quarantine their contacts,” says Andrea Ciaranello, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>



<h4>Innovative ideas</h4>



<p>Last year, Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction went beyond simply swabbing students’ noses, opting to also surveil the endpoint of potentially virus-laden excrement: wastewater.</p>



<p>Infected individuals shed virus into their stool. Once flushed, that stool flows through pipes, interweaving with the plumbing of other toilets, rooms, buildings and even neighborhoods, providing a slurry that can be sampled. Testing wastewater for coronavirus, via PCR, at different stages of the system offers a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">quick way to screen groups</a> of tens to thousands of people (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="339" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline2_wastewater.jpg" alt="two people check a wastewater monitoring station on a field at the University of Colorado Boulder campus" class="wp-image-3102515" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline2_wastewater.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline2_wastewater-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102515">During the 2020–2021 school year, some U.S. universities tested wastewater from dormitories to surveil for COVID-19 outbreaks. Samples can be collected from wastewater monitoring stations, like this one on the University of Colorado Boulder’s campus.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102515">Glenn Asakawa/CU Boulder</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Colorado Mesa University <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-college-university-campus-cases-testing">sampled individual dormitory’s wastewater</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/21</em>), which allowed the school to detect five COVID-19 outbreaks in their early stages last year. Such surveillance testing can provide information on transmission within a community and can guide decisions about whether other mitigation measures should be scaled up or down.</p>



<p>“Wastewater is ideal for a residential system, where everyone is pooping into the same sewage system,” Ciaranello says. That’s not always the case in a K-12 school setting, she says, since students are there for only a few hours each day.</p>



<p>But there is another place that the coronavirus can accumulate: air filters. David Coil, a microbiologist at the University of California, Davis, is developing a form of surveillance testing that piggybacks off of the increased use of air filters in some schools.</p>



<p>“By testing air filters for viral RNA, we can see whether a virus is circulating in a classroom,” he says. It’s like the testing of pooled samples in that it covers many students in a single sample but doesn’t require wrangling parental consent forms and actual swabs from kids, he says. That wrangling becomes necessary if a classroom tests positive, of course, but surveilling air filters instead of students could help schools get a course look at transmission without the rigmarole of testing lots of students.</p>



<p>More creative testing measures like these may be necessary this fall, as a delta-driven COVID-19 surge collides with kids going back to school. With $10 billion in testing funding for K-12 schools through the American Rescue Plan, there’s an opportunity to scale up promising approaches, says Bilinski, the infectious disease modeler at Brown University. “At this stage of the pandemic, we have both the technology and the funding to make exposures less costly and disruptive. We should use it.”</p>

                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Note: the following announcement is courtesy of<a href="https://sparcopen.org/"> SPARC.</a></p>



<p>The 2021 Open Access Week Advisory Committee is pleased to announce that the theme for this year&rsquo;s International Open Access Week, to be held October 25-31, will be &ldquo;It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This year&rsquo;s theme intentionally aligns with the recently released&nbsp;<a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a>, of which Open Access is a crucial component. Circulated in draft form following discussion by representatives of UNESCO&rsquo;s 193 member countries, the Recommendation powerfully articulates and centers the importance of equity in pursuing a future for scholarship that is open by default.</p>



<p><em>Open Science should embrace a diversity of knowledge, practices, workflows, languages, research outputs and research topics that support the needs and epistemic pluralism of the scientific community as a whole, diverse research communities and scholars, as well as the wider public and knowledge holders beyond the traditional scientific community, including Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and social actors from different countries and regions, as appropriate. (UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, Page 7)</em></p>



<p>As the first global standard-setting framework on Open Science, the UNESCO Recommendation will provide an important guide for governments around the world as they move from aspiration to the implementation of open research practices. This year&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity&rdquo; highlights the Recommendation&rsquo;s call for equitable participation for all producers and consumers of knowledge.</p>



<p><em>Open Science should play a significant role in ensuring equity among researchers from developed and developing countries, enabling fair and reciprocal sharing of scientific inputs and outputs and equal access to scientific knowledge to both producers and consumers of knowledge regardless of location, nationality, race, age, gender, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language, religion, disability, ethnicity or migratory status or any other grounds. (UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, Page 7)</em></p>



<p>International Open Access Week is a time for the wider community to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to ensure that equity is at the center of this work. This year&rsquo;s Open Access Week will be held from October 25th through the 31st; however, organizers are encouraged to host discussions and take action around this year&rsquo;s theme whenever is most suitable during the year and to adapt the theme and activities to their local context. This is especially true as countries around the world continue to face varying levels of disruption due to COVID-19 and increasing disruption due to climate change.</p>



<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be consistently prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community discussions to the governance structures we use. International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge&mdash;discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out.</p>



<p>Details for a global kickoff to International Open Access Week on Monday, October 25th, will be announced shortly and posted at openaccessweek.org.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-mass-measure-new-technique-accretion-disk">Measuring a black hole’s mass isn’t easy. A new technique could change that</a></h4>

              
                <p>An actively feeding black hole surrounds itself with a disk of hot gas and dust that flickers like a campfire. Astronomers have now found that monitoring changes in those flickers can reveal something that is notoriously hard to measure: the behemoth’s heft.</p>



<p>“It’s a new way to weigh black holes,” says astronomer Colin Burke of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. What’s more, the method could be used on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abg9933">any astrophysical object with an accretion disk</a>, and may even help find elusive midsize black holes, researchers report in the Aug. 13 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to measure a black hole’s mass. For one thing, the dark behemoths are notoriously difficult to see. But sometimes black holes reveal themselves when they eat. As gas and dust falls into a black hole, the material organizes into a disk that is heated to white-hot temperatures and can, in some cases, outshine all the stars in the galaxy combined.</p>



<p>Measuring the black hole’s diameter can reveal its mass using Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But only the globe-spanning Event Horizon Telescope has made this sort of measurement, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/m87-black-hole-image-best-mass-estimates-star-motion">for only one black hole</a> so far (<em>SN: 4/22/19</em>). Other black holes have been weighed via observations of their influence on the material around them, but that takes a lot of data and doesn’t work for every supermassive black hole.</p>





<p>So, looking for another way, Burke and colleagues turned to accretion disks. Astronomers aren’t sure how black holes’ disks flicker, but it seems like small changes in light combine to brighten or dim the entire disk over a given span of time. Previous research had hinted that the time it takes a disk to fade, brighten and fade again is related to the mass of its central black hole. But those claims were controversial, and didn’t cover the full range of black hole masses, Burke says.</p>



<p>So he and colleagues assembled observations of 67 actively feeding black holes with known masses. The behemoths spanned sizes from 10,000 to 10 billion solar masses. For the smallest of these black holes, the flickers changed on timescales of hours to weeks. Supermassive black holes with masses between 100 million and 10 billion solar masses flickered more slowly, every few hundred days.</p>



<p>“That gives us a hint that, okay, if this relation holds for small supermassive black holes and big ones, maybe it’s sort of a universal feature,” Burke says.</p>



<p>Out of curiosity, the team also looked at white dwarfs, the compact corpses of stars like the sun, which are some of the smallest objects to sport consistent accretion disks. Those white dwarfs followed the same relationship between flicker speed and mass.</p>



<p>The analyzed black holes didn’t cover the entire possible range of masses. Known black holes that are from about 100 to 100,000 times the mass of the sun are rare. There are several potential candidates, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">only one has been confirmed</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). In the future, the relationship between disk flickers and black hole mass could tell astronomers exactly what kind of disk flickers to look for to help bring these midsize beasts out of hiding, if they’re there to be found, Burke says.</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Vivienne Baldassare of Washington State University in Pullman studies black holes in dwarf galaxies, which may preserve some of the properties of ancient black holes that formed in the early universe. One of the biggest challenges in her work is measuring black hole masses. The study’s “super exciting results … will have a large impact for my research, and I expect many others as well,” she says.</p>



<p>The method offers a simpler way to weigh black holes than any previous technique, Burke says — but not necessarily a faster one. More massive black holes, for example, would need hundreds of days, or possibly years, of observations to reveal their masses.</p>



<p>Upcoming observatories are already planning to take that kind of data. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> is expected to start observing the entire sky every night beginning in 2022 or 2023 (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>). Once the telescope has been running long enough, the observations needed to weigh black holes “will fall out for free” from the Rubin Observatory data, Burke says. “We’re already building it. We may as well do this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/statistical-significance-p-value-null-hypothesis-origins">How the strange idea of ‘statistical significance’ was born</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the field of psychology had a problem. In the wake of the Manhattan Project and in the early days of the space race, the so-called “hard sciences” were producing tangible, highly publicized results. Psychologists and other social scientists looked on enviously. Their results were squishy, and difficult to quantify.</p>



<p>Psychologists in particular wanted a statistical skeleton key to unlock true experimental insights. It was an unrealistic burden to place on statistics, but the longing for a mathematical seal of approval burned hot. So psychology textbook writers and publishers created one, and called it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">statistical significance</a>.</p>



<p>By calculating just one number from their experimental results, called a P value, researchers could now deem those results “statistically significant.” That was all it took to claim — even if mistakenly — that an interesting and powerful effect had been demonstrated. The idea took off, and soon legions of researchers were reporting statistically significant results.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, psychology journals began to publish papers only if they reported statistically significant findings, prompting a surprisingly large number of investigators to massage their data — <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/MeasPrevalQuestTruthTelling.pdf">either by gaming the system or cheating</a> — to get below the P value of 0.05 that granted that status. Inevitably, bogus findings and chance associations began to proliferate.</p>





<p>As editor of a journal called <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> from 1993 to 1997, Geoffrey Loftus of the University of Washington tried valiantly to yank psychologists out of their statistical rut. At the start of his tenure, Loftus published an editorial telling researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closed-thinking">stop mindlessly calculating whether experimental results are statistically significant or not</a> (<em>SN: 5/16/13</em>). That common practice impeded scientific progress, he warned.</p>



<p>Keep it simple, Loftus advised. Remember that a picture is worth a thousand reckonings of statistical significance. In that spirit, he recommended reporting straightforward averages to compare groups of volunteers in a psychology experiment. Graphs could show whether individuals’ scores covered a broad range or clumped around the average, enabling a calculation of whether the average score would likelychange a little or a lot in a repeat study. In this way, researchers could evaluate, say, whether volunteers scored better on a difficult math test if first allowed to write about their thoughts and feelings for 10 minutes, versus sitting quietly for 10 minutes.</p>



<p>Loftus might as well have tried to lasso a runaway train. Most researchers kept right on touting the statistical significance of their results.</p>



<p>“Significance testing is all about how the world isn’t and says nothing about how the world is,” Loftus later said when looking back on his attempt to change how psychologists do research.</p>



<p>What’s remarkable is not only that mid-20<sup>th</sup> century psychology textbook writers and publishers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/null-science">fabricated significance testing out of a mishmash of conflicting statistical techniques</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/97</em>). It’s also that their weird creation was embraced by many other disciplines over the next few decades. It didn’t matter that eminent statisticians and psychologists panned significance testing from the start. The concocted calculation proved highly popular in social sciences, biomedical and epidemiological research, neuroscience and biological anthropology.</p>



<p>A human hunger for certainty fueled that academic movement. Lacking unifying theories to frame testable predictions, scientists studying the mind and other human-related topics rallied around a statistical routine. Repeating the procedure provided a false but comforting sense of having tapped into the truth. Known formally as null hypothesis significance testing, the practice assumes a null hypothesis (no difference, or no correlation, between experimental groups on measures of interest) and then rejects that hypothesis if the P value for observed data came out to less than 5 percent (P &lt; .05).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>P value</h3>



<p>A P value is the probability of an observed (or more extreme) result arising only from chance.</p>

<p>The problem is that slavishly performing this procedure absolves researchers of having to develop theories that make specific, falsifiable predictions — the fundamental elements of good science. Rejecting a null hypothesis doesn’t tell an investigator anything new. It only creates an opportunity to speculate about why an effect might have occurred. Statistically significant results are rarely used as a launching pad for testing alternative explanations of those findings.</p>



<p>Psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Harding Risk Literacy Center in Berlin, considers it more accurate to call null hypothesis significance testing “the null ritual.”</p>



<p>Here’s an example of the null ritual in action. A <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/493">2012 study published in <em>Science</em></a> concluded that volunteers’ level of religious belief declined after viewing pictures of Auguste Rodin’s statue <em>The Thinker</em>, in line with an idea that mental reflection causes people to question their faith in supernatural entities. In this study, the null hypothesis predicted that volunteers’ religious beliefs would stay the same, on average, after seeing <em>The Thinker</em>, assuming that the famous sculpture has no effect on viewers’ spiritual convictions.</p>



<p>The null ritual dictated that the researchers calculate whether group differences in religious beliefs before and after perusing the statue would have occurred by chance in no more than one out of 20 trials, or no more than 5 percent of the time. That’s what P &lt; .05 means. By meeting that threshold, the result was tagged statistically significant, and not likely due to mere chance.</p>



<p>If that sounds reasonable, hold on. Even after meeting an arbitrary 5 percent threshold for statistical significance, the study hadn’t demonstrated that statue viewers were losing their religion. Researchers could only conjecture about why that might be the case, because the null ritual forced them to assume that there is no effect. Talk about running in circles.</p>



<p>To top it off, an independent redo of <em>The Thinker</em> study found no statistically significant decline in religious beliefs among viewers of the pensive statue. Frequent failures to confirm statistically significant results have triggered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">a crisis of confidence in sciences wedded to the null ritual</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>).</p>



<p>Some journals now require investigators to fork over their research designs and experimental data before submitting research papers for peer review. The goal is to discourage data fudging and to up the odds of publishing results that can be confirmed by other researchers.</p>

</div>



<p>But the real problem lies in the null ritual itself, Gigerenzer says. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and without ever calculating the statistical significance of anything, Wolfgang Köhler developed Gestalt laws of perception, Jean Piaget formulated a theory of how thinking develops in children and Ivan Pavlov discovered principles of classical conditioning. Those pioneering scientists typically studied one or a handful of individuals using the types of simple statistics endorsed decades later by Loftus.</p>



<p>From 1940 to 1955, psychologists concerned with demonstrating the practical value of their field, especially to educators, sought an objective tool for telling real from chance findings. Rather than acknowledging that conflicting statistical approaches existed, psychology textbook writers and publishers mashed those methods into the one-size-fits-all P value, Gigerenzer says.</p>



<p>One inspiration for the null ritual came from British statistician Ronald Fisher. Starting in the 1930s, Fisher devised a type of significance testing to analyze the likelihood of a null hypothesis, which a researcher could propose as either an effect or no effect. Fisher wanted to calculate the exact statistical significance associated with, say, using a particular fertilizer deemed promising for crop yields.</p>



<p>Around the same time, statisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson argued that testing a single null hypothesis is useless. Instead, they insisted on determining which of at least two alternative hypotheses best explained experimental results. Neyman and Pearson calculated an experiment’s probability of accepting a hypothesis that’s actually true, something left unexamined in Fisher’s null hypothesis test.</p>



<p>Psychologists’ null ritual folded elements of both approaches into a confusing hodge-podge. Researchers often don’t realize that statistically significant results don’t prove that a true effect has been discovered.</p>



<p>And about half of surveyed medical, biological and psychological researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9">wrongly assume that finding no statistical significance in a study means that there was no actual effect</a>. A closer analysis may reveal findings consistent with a real effect, especially when the original results fell just short of the arbitrary cutoff for statistical significance.</p>

</div>



<p>It’s well past time to dump the null ritual, says psychologist and applied statistician Richard Morey of Cardiff University, Wales. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245918776023">Researchers need to focus on developing theories of mind and behavior that lead to testable predictions.</a> In that brave new scientific world, investigators will choose which of many statistical tools best suits their needs. “Statistics offer ways to figure out how to doubt what you’re seeing,” Morey says.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the illusion of finding truth in statistical significance still appeals to researchers in many fields. Morey hopes that, perhaps within a few decades, the null ritual’s reign of errors will end.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">An Indigenous people in the Philippines have the most Denisovan DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Denisovans are an elusive bunch, known mainly from ancient DNA samples and traces of that DNA that the ancient hominids shared when they interbred with <em>Homo sapiens</em>. They left their biggest genetic imprint on people who now live in Southeast Asian islands, nearby Papua New Guinea and Australia. Genetic evidence now shows that a Philippine Negrito ethnic group has inherited the most Denisovan ancestry of all. Indigenous people known as the Ayta Magbukon get around 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans, a new study finds.</p>



<p>This finding fits an evolutionary scenario in which two or more Stone Age Denisovan populations independently reached various Southeast Asian islands, including the Philippines and a landmass that consisted of what’s now Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania. Exact arrival dates are unknown, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-stone-tools-raise-tantalizing-questions-over-who-colonized-sulawesi">nearly 200,000-year-old stone tools found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi</a> may have been made by Denisovans (<em>SN</em>: 1/13/16). <em>H. sapiens</em> groups that started arriving around 50,000 years ago or more then interbred with resident Denisovans.</p>



<p>Evolutionary geneticists Maximilian Larena and Mattias Jakobsson, both at Uppsala University in Sweden, and their team describe the new evidence August 12 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Even as the complexities of ancient interbreeding in Southeast Asia become clearer, Denisovans remain a mysterious crowd. “It’s unclear how the different Denisovan groups on the mainland and on Southeast Asian islands were related [to each other] and how genetically diverse they were,” Jakobsson says.</p>





<p>Papua New Guinea highlanders — estimated to carry close to 4 percent Denisovan DNA in the new study — were previously thought to be the modern record holders for Denisovan ancestry. But the Ayta Magbukon display roughly 30 percent to 40 percent more Denisovan ancestry than Papua New Guinea highlanders and Indigenous Australians, Jakobsson says. That calculation accounts for recent mating of East Asians with Philippine Negrito groups, including the Ayta Magbukon, that diluted Denisovan inheritance to varying degrees.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses suggest that Ayta Magbukon people retain slightly more Denisovan ancestry than other Philippine Negrito groups due to having mated less often with East Asian migrants to the island around 2,281 years ago, the scientists say. Their genetic analyses compared ancient DNA from Denisovans and Neandertals with that of 1,107 individuals from 118 ethnic groups in the Philippines, including 25 Negrito populations. Comparisons were then made to previously collected DNA from present-day Papua New Guinea highlanders and Indigenous Australians.</p>



<p>The new report underscores that “still today there are populations that have not been fully genetically described and that Denisovans were geographically widespread,” says paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth of the University of Tübingen in Germany, who was not part of the new research.</p>



<p>But it’s too early to say whether Stone Age <em>Homo</em> fossils found on Southeast Asian islands come from Denisovans, populations that interbred with Denisovans or other <em>Homo</em> lineages, Posth says. Only DNA extracted from those fossils can resolve that issue, he adds. Unfortunately, ancient DNA preserves poorly in fossils from tropical climates.</p>



<p>Only a handful of confirmed Denisovan fossils exist. Those consist of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dates-narrow-down-when-denisovans-and-neandertals-crossed-paths">a few fragmentary specimens from a Siberian cave</a> where Denisovans lived from around 300,000 to 50,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/30/19</em>), and a roughly 160,000-year-old <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jawbone-shows-denisovans-lived-tibetan-plateau-long-humans">partial jaw found on the Tibetan Plateau</a> (<em>SN: 5/1/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fossils from the Philippines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines">initially classed as <em>H. luzonensis</em></a>, dating to 50,000 years ago or more (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>), might actually represent Denisovans. But a lack of consensus on what Denisovans looked like leaves the evolutionary identity of those fossils uncertain.</p>



<p>Larena and Jakobsson’s findings “further increase my suspicions that Denisovan fossils are hiding in plain sight” among previously excavated discoveries on Southeast Asian islands, says population geneticist João Teixeira of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Denisovans may have genetically encompassed <em>H. luzonensis</em> and two other fossil hominids found on different Southeast Asian islands, <em>H. floresiensis</em> on Flores and <em>H. erectus</em> on Java, Teixeira suspects. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbit-history-gets-new-preface"><em>H. floresiensis</em>, or hobbits</a>, survived from at least 100,000 years ago to around 60,000 years ago (<em>SN: 6/8/16</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>H. erectus </em>arrived on Java</a> about 1.6 million years ago and died out between 117,000 and 108,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>).</p>



<p>Geographic ancestry patterns on Southeastern Asian islands and in Australia suggest that this region was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01408-0">settled by a genetically distinct Denisovan population</a> from southern parts of mainland East Asia, Teixeira and his colleagues reported in the May <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The impact of technology on young people is an oft-debated topic in the media. Is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">increased screen time</a> having a serious impact on their mental health? Or have we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/">over-exaggerated</a> the level of risk young people face due to their use of tech?</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00863-1">new study</a>, published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, </em>we could be asking the wrong questions. A team led by Nastasia Griffioen at Radboud University Nijmegen suggests that rather than looking at screen time in a binary way, researchers should explore the nuances of smartphone use: <em>how</em> young people are using their phones, rather than the fact they’re using them at all.</p>



<span id="more-43220"></span>



<p>The original aim of the study was to look at how stress regulation affected social media use. First, 114 participants aged 18 to 25 filled in measures of depression, anxiety, emotional regulation, self-compassion and rejection sensitivity. They were then split into two conditions: a stress condition, in which they had to give a recorded presentation for five minutes, and a control condition, in which they simply viewed and rated two presentations.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to wait in the experiment room for ten minutes and told not to move from their seat; meanwhile, and unknown to the participants, a camera recorded their activity, looking closely at phone use. Upon the researcher’s return, participants were shown the video and were asked to share their motivations, thoughts and feelings each time they had started a new activity on their phones.</p>



<p>Due to methodological issues, the stress manipulation didn’t seem to work. But the team still found some interesting results regarding smartphone use overall. Phone use was widespread: 96.5% of participants used their phone at some point during the ten minutes, 80% of whom started using their phone as soon as the experimenter left the room. Just over 48% used their smartphone for the full ten minutes. <em>How</em> participants used their phones, however, was more varied. Some used mainly social media, while others engaged in online shopping, read articles, or played games; similarly, some participants switched between apps only once, while others switched up to twenty one times.</p>



<p>Only a quarter of participants said they felt bad during an activity they’d engaged in on their phones, and these negative feelings were not normally related to social interactions: for instance, some participants reported feeling generally bored, while one reported feeling bad after finding out that their football club had lost. While some reported feeling bad because of what someone else had posted or sent them, these experiences were in the minority. Nearly 94% of participants also reported having positive feelings while using their phone — laughing at a funny post, feeling curious about something, or simply enjoying looking through their feeds. Messaging apps were associated with the highest level of positive feeling.</p>



<p>The team also looked at active vs. passive use of phones. While some participants made a conscious choice not to use their smartphone at all, passive phone use was most closely associated with social media, which participants largely engaged with out of habit or boredom. However, there wasn’t much evidence that participants’ feelings were different during passive vs active use.</p>



<p>With such disparate phone activities established, the team then turned to the mental health symptoms measured at the start of the study. Adults with high levels of depression symptoms reported fewer positive feelings associated with using social media, and in particular with passive use of social media — but at the same time were also more likely to use Facebook. This was also the case for those with higher levels of anxiety. Participants with higher levels of sensitivity to rejection were less likely to spend time messaging, and less likely to experience positive feelings while messaging, using social media, and scrolling. On the other hand, those with higher levels of self-compassion were more likely to experience positive feelings, more likely to use a varied number of social media platforms, and showed higher engagement in non-smartphone based activities.</p>



<p>So while phone use was fairly ubiquitous, it’s clear that participants differed in terms of the activities they chose to do, how they felt about doing them, and the individual differences that impacted both. The team argues that the fact young people use their phones in many different ways and for many different reasons essentially renders catch-all questions about “screen time” useless. Because the study was time-limited and conducted in a lab, future research could also look at how smartphones are used in daily life.</p>



<p>As the team says, the results suggest a “complex, dynamic, and variable picture” when it comes to phone use and its impact. Looking more carefully at these individual differences, rather than simply condemning phone use completely, could provide more useful insights and more useful interventions for those kinds of use that do cause harm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-steal-animal-hair-fur-nest-new-word-video">Scientists have a new word for birds stealing animal hair</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some tiny birds take bold risks to gather a beakful of hair for their nests. Titmice have been spotted dive-bombing cats, alighting on dozing predators’ backs and plucking strands of hair from people’s heads. Now, there’s a term for the unusual behavior: kleptotrichy.</p>



<p>Derived from the Greek words for “to steal” and “hair,” kleptotrichy has rarely been described by scientists, but <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3501?af=R">dozens of YouTube videos capture the behavior</a>, researchers report online July 27 in <em>Ecology. </em>Titmice — and one chickadee — have been caught on video tugging hair from dogs, cats, humans, raccoons and even a porcupine.<strong></strong></p>



<p>“Citizen scientists, bird watchers and people with dogs knew this behavior much more than the scientists themselves,” says animal behaviorist Mark Hauber of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “Popular observations precede science rather than the other way around, which is a valid way to do science.”<strong></strong></p>

The team dubbed the behavior “kleptotrichy” after a search of the scientific literature and amateur videos on YouTube turned up more than 100 instances of hair thievery by birds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Witnessing a bird steal hair from a mammal in the wild is what first inspired Hauber’s colleague, ecologist Henry Pollock, to dig deeper. While counting birds in an Illinois state park in May 2020, Pollock and colleagues spotted a tufted titmouse pluck fur from a sleeping raccoon. “I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen anything like that,” says Pollock, also of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>





<p>In South America, palm swifts snatch feathers from flying pigeons and parrots — a behavior already known as kleptoptily. Searching through the scientific literature, Hauber, Pollock and colleagues found only 11 anecdotes of birds stealing hair from live mammals. While most published accounts involve titmice in North America, at least five other bird species get in on the action. Researchers have seen an American crow harvest hair from a cow and a red-winged starling in Africa peck a small antelope called a klipspringer. In Australia, three honeyeater bird species steal fur from koalas.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, a YouTube search by the team turned up 99 videos of tufted titmice, a mountain chickadee and a black-crested titmouse plucking hair from mammals. The latter two bird species had not previously been identified as hair thieves in the scientific literature.</p>



<p>Scientists generally assume that birds gather hair for their nests in low-risk ways, relying on carcasses or stray fluff shed into the wind. “Plucking hairs from raccoons, which are common avian nest predators, suggests that it&#8217;s obviously worth it to get that hair,” Pollock says.</p>



<p>Hair-harvesting species tend to live in colder climates, so those birds probably prize hair’s insulating properties, the team says. Some birds might also spruce up their nests with mammal hair to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stinking-decorations-protect-nests">confuse would-be predators</a> and parasites (<em>SN:</em> <em>8/28/01</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5J69ZGH_lVw/">A peek into the PLOS ONE review process</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>Author</strong><br>Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE<br><br>When <em>PLOS ONE</em> launched nearly 15 years ago, it was the very first multidisciplinary journal that aimed to publish all ethically and methodologically rigorous research, regardless of the novelty of the findings or the perceived impact of the work. We were then &ndash; as we are now &ndash; immensely gratified by the strong community support for the journal and for accessible Open Access publishing, and were <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2011/01/welcome-nature-seriously-2/">delighted</a> when other publishers took notice and launched Open Access &ldquo;megajournals&rdquo; of their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I meet <em>PLOS ONE</em> authors I&rsquo;ll often ask why they chose to submit to us and what they think sets the journal apart from its cousins. Often authors will mention the speed of the review process, or our publication criteria, or the calibre of our editorial board members. Some authors say that PLOS&rsquo; mission and strong support for Open Science was a major draw. Occasionally, they&rsquo;ll say that they&rsquo;ve been encouraged to submit by a member of our editorial board or another past author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what about the quality of the review process? After all, administering high-quality peer review is a fundamental role for any scientific journal. The process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> is quite special, especially given the volume of submissions we receive. I&rsquo;m really happy to have this opportunity to share a bit more about our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process">review process</a> and why I think it makes <em>PLOS ONE</em> unique.</p>



<h3>Detailed initial editorial checks</h3>



<p>All new manuscript submissions &ndash; and we receive &gt;100 of them every day &ndash; are subjected to an initial technical check to ensure that the submission is complete. Once manuscripts pass this stage, they are individually assigned to and assessed by our team of subject matter experts, who have expertise in the study topic. The assessment at this stage focuses on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-1">scope</a>, whether the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-3">methods are presented in sufficient detail</a> for review purposes, the overall <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-5">quality of the language</a> and whether the research was conducted with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-6">appropriate ethical approval and meets high ethical standards</a>. Manuscripts that do not comply with our standards are desk rejected with a detailed letter explaining why the submission does not meet our publication criteria (we reject around 20% of submissions without review).&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Robust editorial and peer review</h3>



<p>Manuscripts that pass these initial screening steps are then sent on to members of our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/static/editorial-board">Editorial Board</a>, who administer the peer-review process. Academic Editors assess the manuscript against our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">seven publication criteria</a>, paying particular attention to whether the conclusions are supported by the data provided, and we work closely with our board to ensure that this process is as efficient as possible. For example, when an Academic Editor agrees to handle a new manuscript submission, we share any concerns that have arisen during our initial screening steps (such as missing details of animal care) and provide information on community standards that might be helpful in the review process (such as STRENDA guidelines for enzymology studies and PRISMA for systematic reviews). Additionally, if a manuscript has been posted as a preprint, we share the preprint link with the Academic Editor so that they can consider any comments that have been made. We also partner with initiatives like <a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</a> and <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">Peer Community In</a> to weave pre-submission commenting into the review process and further streamline decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="342" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1024x342.png" alt="" data-id="19265" data-full-url="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2.png" data-link="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?attachment_id=19265" class="wp-image-19265" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1024x342.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-300x100.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-768x256.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1536x513.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-2048x684.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">The PLOS ONE peer review process.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the full complement of required feedback has been received, the Academic Editor issues a decision. We ask Academic Editors to justify their decisions in detail, which is especially important when there is discordance between the reviewers&rsquo; comments. Rejection decisions are sent straight to the authors at this point. However, if the Academic Editor submits a revision decision, additional journal requirements are added to the decision letter before it is transmitted to the authors. This can include reminding authors to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-software-and-code-sharing">deposit their software or code</a>, provide their original <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements">gel or blot data</a>, amend their <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests">competing interests</a> or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/disclosure-of-funding-sources">financial declaration</a> disclosures, or to indicate <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">where their data are available or can be obtained</a>. The complete decision letter is then sent to the authors, after which the Academic Editor and reviewer(s) also receive a copy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Aligning with our publication criteria and policies</h3>



<p>On resubmission, the revised manuscript undergoes another technical check to ensure that the rebuttal letter is present and that concerns around ethics, language or reporting that were identified by our subject matter experts have been addressed. The revised manuscript is then sent back to the original Academic Editor, who determines whether it can be accepted for publication or requires further review. When the Academic Editor is satisfied that the manuscript meets <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s publication criteria, it is provisionally accepted for publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this stage, we perform one final series of checks, including ensuring that there are no copyright concerns, all relevant data have been made available, and that no apparent conflicts of interest arose during review. We also ask authors whether they would like to publish the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">peer review history</a> of their submission. Once these checks are complete, the manuscript is formally accepted for publication, typeset, and published.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Partnering with our Editorial Board for efficient, rigorous review&nbsp;</h3>



<p>What makes this process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> unique? In my experience, the partnership between our subject matter experts and Academic Editors, and the way we work together to focus on rigor rather than glamor, is rare. It&rsquo;s all the more incredible given that we collaborate to assess tens of thousands of submissions every year. This relationship aims to make peer review as smooth and rapid for authors as possible, while still ensuring that only robust, reproducible science is published. Partnering with our board in such a way also ensures that the publication process is efficient, that authors understand the basis for editorial decisions, and that all publishable research is open and accessible to all. We are grateful to our Academic Editors and to the reviewers they recruit for making this process work so well.</p>



<p>We will continue to seek ways to refine and streamline the review process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> in a way that best serves the needs of our communities. Please do <a href="mailto:plosone@plos.org">get in touch</a> if you have feedback on the review process or ideas for how we can further improve it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">Colds and other common respiratory diseases might surge as kids return to school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As U.S. schools resume in-person learning this fall, parents and administrators may have to deal with more outbreaks of colds and other seasonal respiratory illnesses than usual. If so, these outbreaks aren’t likely to be especially dangerous for school-age children, but could be problematic for traditionally more vulnerable younger siblings or elderly relatives, experts say. And because the symptoms of these illnesses often mirror those of COVID-19, it could make having kids back in the classroom — and keeping them there — that much more challenging.</p>



<p>Respiratory viruses, which cause common colds and the flu, typically circulate in colder months. But last year’s cold-and-flu season was practically nonexistent. Some cold-causing viruses, such as rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, kept spreading, though at reduced levels. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, however, were held to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">historically low levels</a>, an unintended effect of COVID-19 pandemic precautions such as border closings, wearing masks and social distancing (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). Other respiratory pathogens that cause cold-like symptoms, such as adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34292924/">also had very mild seasons last winter</a>, researchers with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report July 23 in<em> Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s been a huge, huge change during the COVID pandemic in the circulation of what we think of as the commonplace respiratory viruses and the seasonal respiratory viruses,” says Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine. RSV and flu “have virtually disappeared during the COVID pandemic, almost certainly because of the mitigation measures.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-school-testing-kids-safe">How different COVID-19 testing plans can help keep kids safe in school</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>But, worryingly, that absence has created a larger-than-usual population of people vulnerable to these common respiratory viruses. When people don’t get sick with the viruses for a year or two, immunity to them wanes. That makes those people, including school-age kids, more likely to get sick in the coming months.</p>



<p>Keeping COVID-19 precautions such as wearing masks in place could help keep these other respiratory viruses from surging. Without those precautions this coming winter, experts think high rates of RSV and other common respiratory viruses are probable.</p>



<p>A string of endless colds would be annoying and possibly disruptive to schooling, given that these viruses often cause symptoms like runny noses and cough, similar to some COVID-19 symptoms. That means kids might have to miss school while waiting for COVID-19 test results. What’s more, these kids can pass these infections on to very young or elderly family members.</p>



<p>“The kids are going to go to school, they&#8217;ll bring it home to the family and the younger children,” says Ian Barr, a virologist at the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Those family members “are the ones who will … end up with the symptomatic and in some cases, serious infections.”</p>



<p>Influenza and RSV are the most serious seasonal respiratory viruses, especially for the very young and the elderly. The CDC estimates that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html">RSV typically puts about 58,000 children under age 5 in the hospital each year</a> and is the most common cause of pneumonia in children under a year old. It also hospitalizes more than 177,000 adults 65 and older. Influenza viruses typically kill around 36,000 people a year in the United States and hospitalize almost half a million, the CDC estimates.</p>

<p>With the pandemic-induced lull in these diseases, there is now a larger population of people vulnerable to RSV and that has led to unusual, <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.29.2100186#html_fulltext">off-season outbreaks</a> of the illness in some places, researchers report July 22 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. Multiple states in Australia saw off-season RSV peaks in summer months that were even larger than traditional winter peaks. In Western Australia, the normal cold-weather peak for RSV is a little over 40 detections per week in the middle of July. But in 2020, there was no cold-weather peak. RSV infections stayed low until the warm months, and then <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1906/6140790">peaked at over 100 detections a week in December</a>, researchers reported in February in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>In the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html">detections of RSV have been mostly rising since spring</a>, according to the CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System. In late March, there were about 100 detections a week in the surveillance system. In the week ending July 24, there were more than 3,100 weekly detections. That’s still far below a normal RSV season; for example, cases peaked at 24,280 detections a week in December of 2019. But the timing is the thing, experts say. “It&#8217;s rare for most of these respiratory diseases to be circulating in summer,” says Barr, a coauthor of the <em>Eurosurveillance</em> study.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>On the rise</h3>



<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is usually a winter virus that affects primarily young children and the elderly. It all but disappeared earlier during the pandemic. But the five-week moving average of RSV detections in the United States shows that cases of RSV have been rising as governments and businesses lift COVID-19 precautions. The most recent weeks’ detections may increase as more data comes in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Short and sharp summer outbreaks of RSV — like those seen in Western Australia in December of 2020 — seem to lead to a lower surge later, Barr says. But places where levels of RSV and other seasonal respiratory viruses stay low through the warm months, could turn into hot spots in the fall and winter with a larger-than-normal season.</p>



<p>There is one big exception to that prediction: If the coronavirus is widespread during winter, “it may still keep these other viruses low,” says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If so, that wouldn’t just be because of COVID-19 precautions left in place to help control the coronavirus. At play would also be a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">viral interference</a> — when one respiratory virus dampens the spread of other viruses (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). There are two ways that this can happen: by sickening people and having them stay home — removing them from the population than can be infected at a given school or workplace — or by directly priming infected individuals’ immune system to fight off other viral infections.</p>



<p>“When one virus is there, there&#8217;s a heightened state of general antiviral defenses” in the body, Foxman says. “So you would predict that for a certain … period after somebody has one viral infection, they may be more resistant to getting another viral infection.” Still, this scenario would mean relatively high levels of coronavirus cases in the country — not exactly something to hope for.</p>

<p>“If [I] had to guess what was going to happen, [I&#8217;d say] that some of these other respiratory diseases are going to be more of a problem than influenza when your kids go back to school,” Barr says. “The parainfluenzas, the adenoviruses, RSV — these sorts of viruses are more likely to circulate than influenza.”</p>



<p>That’s partly because the flu vaccine exists, which can help lessen influenza outbreaks. And it’s partly because of the way that the flu spreads and evolves as it moves around the world, experts say, and how that spread seems to be more affected by border closures and reduced travel than other respiratory viruses. Less travel around the world in the last two years has prevented influenza epidemics from spreading out of countries to other places, and the flu remains at very low levels worldwide.</p>



<p>Ultimately, “it&#8217;s a little hard to predict what&#8217;s going to happen, because we have never had this kind of disruption before in the transmission of these viruses,” Foxman says. “But of course, it&#8217;s very interesting to follow it and important to see what happens, because we&#8217;re going to learn a lot.”</p>
