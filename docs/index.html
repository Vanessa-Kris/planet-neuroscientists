            Airline travel during the holidays is one big headache. But for some people, “airplane headache” is a truly painful experience. The headache occurs during take-off and landing, is unique to plane travel, and is not associated with other conditions. The pain is severe, with a jabbing or stabbing quality, and located on one side of the head (usually around the eye sockets or forehead).

<p>Many of our relationships begin with that moment when our eyes meet and we realise the other person is looking right at us. Pause for a second and consider the intensity of the situation, the near-magical state of two brains simultaneously processing one another, each aware of being, at that very instant, the centre of the other’s mental world. Psychologists have made some surprising discoveries about the way that mutual gaze, or the lack of it, affects us mentally and physically and how we relate to each other. Here we digest the fascinating psychology of eye contact, from tiny babies’ sensitivity to gaze to the hallucination-inducing effects of prolonged eye-staring.</p>
<p><span id="more-14240"></span></p>
<p>Our sensitivity to eye contact begins incredibly early. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11293433_Eye_contact_detection_in_humans_from_birth">Infants of just two days of age prefer looking at faces that gaze back at them</a>. Similarly, recordings of the brain activity of four-month-olds show that they process gazing faces more deeply than faces that are looking away; and at 7-months, infants’ brains process eye contact differently from averted gaze even when the eyes are shown for just 50ms – far too quick for any kind of conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Most children recognise the social significance of eye contact, but they seem to take it too far. At the age of three and four, for instance, they often believe that so long as they cover their eyes – thus preventing eye contact – that they will be completely hidden from view. In fact, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/23/why-do-children-hide-by-covering-their-eyes/">children will often claim to be hidden even if they simply avert their gaze while another person looks at them</a>.</p>
<p>Children with autism often show a noticeable lack of eye contact and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1995.tb00687.x/abstract">part of the reason</a> is their difficulty understanding the social significance of another person’s gaze, and that they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19414711">find it difficult to infer other people’s mental state from their eyes</a>.</p>
<p>As adults, locking eyes with another person <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/26/eye-contact-makes-us-more-aware-of-our-own-bodies/">immediately triggers in us a state of increased self-consciousness</a>. Researchers showed this by asking participants to rate their own emotional reactions to various positive and negative images, some of which were preceded by a face staring straight at them, others by a face with gaze averted. Participants had more insight into their own emotional reactions (which were measured objectively through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity">galvanic skin response</a>) after they’d made eye contact with a face. “Our results support the view that human adults’ bodily awareness becomes more acute when they are subjected to another’s gaze,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In fact, eye contact is such an intense experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/18/why-its-hard-to-talk-and-make-eye-contact-at-the-same-time/">it even seems to consume extra brain power</a>, making it difficult to perform other challenging mental tasks at the same time. This year a pair of Japanese researchers tested participants on a verb generation task while at the same time they looked at a realistic on-screen face that was either making eye contact with them or had its gaze averted. Making eye contact impaired the participants’ performance on the hardest version of the verb generation task, presumably because it consumed spare brain power that might otherwise have been available to support performance on the verbal task.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who mostly know instinctively to break eye contact to help concentrate on what they’re saying, children will tend to maintain gaze even when asked a difficult question. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/01/05/helping-children-by-teaching-them-to-look-away/">Developmental psychologists have shown that children can benefit from being trained to avert their gaze to help them think things through more clearly</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not other people make eye contact with us changes the way that we think about them and their feelings. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615320">we are more likely to remember faces with which we’ve experienced mutual gaze</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755215">we consider displays of anger and joy to be more intense when shown by a person making eye contact</a>. In fact, when a person or human-like entity (such as a human face morphed with a doll) makes eye contact with us, <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/42/12/1666.full">we assume that he/she/it has a more sophisticated mind</a> and a greater ability to act in the world, such as to show self-control and act morally, and a greater desire for social contact.</p>
<p>Indeed, such is the importance of eye contact to socialising that we tend to form rather low opinions of people who persistently avoid our gaze, assuming that they are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-34932-001">less sincere</a> and, at least if they’re female, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886996001481">less conscientious</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643789">we’re more likely to believe statements made by a person who looks us in the eye</a>. Yet <a href="http://www.psychopathicwritings.com/2011/06/truth-or-myth-psychopathic-stare-part-5.html">maintaining eye contact with <em>too much</em> intensity is seen as a feature of psychopaths</a>.</p>
<p>To try to identity the optimum length of unbroken eye contact to make, psychologists recruited participants at London’s Science Museum and asked them to rate how comfortable they found different lengths of eye contact made by faces shown in video clips, ranging from between 100ms (a tenth of a second) to 10,300ms (just over ten seconds). <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/07/psychologists-have-identified-the-length-of-eye-contact-that-people-find-most-comfortable/">On average, the participants were most comfortable with eye contact that lasted just over three seconds</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to deciding whether we trust another person, it turns out that it’s not only a question of how much eye contact they make, but also what we see in their eyes. Remarkably, <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/30/0956797615588306.full">it seems that we pay attention at a subconscious level to the behaviour of their pupils</a>, and if they dilate – a sign of attraction and emotional arousal – we judge them to be more trustworthy, whereas if they constrict – a sign of fear or feeling threatened – then we judge them less trustworthy. Also, when we trust a partner with dilating pupils, our own pupils tend to mimic theirs and show similar dilation.</p>
<p>We think poorly of conversation partners who consistently avoid eye contact, but it is our feelings of belonging that are hurt when a stranger looks our way and deliberately avoids meeting our eyes – an experience captured by the German expression “wie Luft behandeln”, which means to be looked at as though air. <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/01/13/0956797611427921.full">Psychologists demonstrated this in a field study on their university campus</a>, in which they subjected passersby to the “wie Luft behandeln” experience after which they reported feeling disconnected from others.</p>
<p>Thankfully we seem to have an inbuilt defence mechanism to avoid these feelings of disconnection when we’re already feeling rejected. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/16/after-rejection-your-brain-performs-this-subtle-trick-to-help-you-make-friends/">Psychologists showed us this</a> by prompting some participants to feel ostracised in a game of online ball passing, and then asking them to judge whether a series of faces were looking right at them or not. Compared with control participants, those feeling ostracised were more likely to believe that other faces were making eye contact with them, even if in truth their eyes were slightly averted.</p>
<p>And finally, it seems extreme eye contact can lead to some very strange psychological effects. If you and a partner look into each other’s eyes for 10 minutes while sitting in a dimly lit room, you are likely to experience odd sensations that resemble mild “dissociation” – a psychological term for when people lose their normal connection with reality. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/">When the Italian psychologist Giovanni Caputo tested these effects for a paper published in 2015</a>, he found that participants experienced odd feelings of time slowing down, sounds seeming quiet or loud, and 90 per cent said they’d seen some deformed facial features, 75 per cent said they’d seen a monster, 50 per cent said they saw aspects of their own face in their partner’s face, and 15 per cent said they’d seen a relative’s face.</p>
<p>The meeting of minds and souls that occurs through eye contact can be a wonderful thing, but is perhaps best practised in moderation, or at least in full daylight!</p>

            <p>Body mass index (BMI) has been linked to inflammation, and systemic inflammation has been linked to decreased cognition. Now, a new study directly links a high BMI to lower cognitive functioning. The current study, published in the journal <em>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</em>, is the first step in identifying a biologically plausible mechanism for the connection between BMI and cognition.    </p>
<p>The authors evaluated 2 cohorts of people aged 50 years and older from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging. One group contained 9000 people and the other contained approximately 12,500.</p>
<p>When the authors correlated BMI, inflammatory markers, and cognition over a 6-year period, the results in both groups were the same: higher BMI was associated with greater cognitive decline. </p>
<p>Specifically, the higher the BMI at the beginning of the study, the greater increase in levels of inflammatory markers (specifically, C-reactive protein [CRP]) over the next 4 years. The change in CRP predicted greater decline in memory and executive functioning over the following 2 years (a total of 6 years from the start of the study.) Established literature already links inflammation to cognitive decline, but these findings take it a step further by highlighting the role of BMI in systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>Physical activity and body mass are related to cognitive function in adults. BMI is a function of body mass (i.e., weight) and height, and most data reveal an inverse relationship between physical activity and BMI. Likewise, regular exercise has been shown to prevent cognitive decline in adults who are middle aged and older. </p>
<p>The relationship between physical activity and BMI, however, is nuanced because BMI does not account for a person’s amounts of body fat or muscle mass, both of which can skew the calculation. Still, the general trends are intuitive: engage in more physical activity, decrease body weight, lower BMI, and improve cognition.</p>
<p>In the current study, BMI, by way of inflammation, predicted cognitive decline. While no absolute criteria are reported for preventing cognitive decline, the authors provide one more reason – if one is even needed – to maintain an appropriate body weight and levels of physical activity. Changes in cognition related to aging often take years – even decades – to appear, so a healthy BMI at younger ages may prevent cognitive changes years later.</p>
<p>A recent landmark study indicated that healthy lifestyle habits were cumulative in their protective effects against cognitive decline, asserting that exercise and maintaining health body weight were important for 20 years before the onset of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Healthy BMI is correlated to decreased risks of many diseases and conditions that affect most of the major body’s major organ systems. Now, simply reducing BMI may be a simple, low-cost intervention to decrease the burden of cognitive impairment.</p>

            Is it the job of peer reviewers to detect scientific fraud?



I've been pondering this question for a while but lately my interest was sparked by the case of a retracted cancer biology paper in the high-profile journal Nature Cell Biology. Written by Taiwanese researchers Shih-Ting Cha et al., the article was published on the 15th August and retracted just three months later, after anonymous posters on PubPeer noticed several anomalies in the results.

For instance, there was image duplic

            <p>Keeping up with research publications is always a challenge for researchers. There's simply too much going on. Most of us have a daily or maybe hebdomadal slot where we go over various journals and news. We use things like e-mail alerts, RSS feeds, and that sort of thing. I have a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sanjayankur31/feedlists">rather long list of RSS feeds</a> set up in the excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://lzone.de/liferea/">Liferea</a> reader myself.</p>
<p>Now, the one problem with using a desktop application is that it must be set up on every machine that you use - even on your phone. This isn't ideal, really. It is also not ideal that we all end up having our own private lists. So, I thought it'd be nicer if I could set something up on the web that we could all access from everywhere without needing an app. The simple choice was to use <a class="reference external" href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">venus</a> to set up <em>planet</em> instances.</p>
<p>Those that have been around the free and open source community will already know what planets are. They're web pages that aggregate feeds from various sources - usually community members' blogs. There are quite a few around and I follow a few myself -  <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.fedoraproject.org/">Planet Fedora</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://planet.mozilla.org/">Planet Mozilla</a>, for example. They're extremely useful to keep onesself up to date with the happenings in the communities.</p>
<p>So, I've gone ahead and set up two new planet instances to aggregate information from a myriad of neuroscience sources. The first is <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscience/">Planet neuroscience</a>. The feeds this one aggregates are all from peer reviewed journals. So, pure research on this one. It's one long list of new publications.</p>
<p>The second one is <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscientists/">Planet neuroscientists</a>. On this one, I collect posts from various neuroscience news sites and blogs. Quite a few of these sources help make neuroscience more accessible by summarising concepts and results. They also discuss more general topics such as the research method, collaboration, open access, and the sort. So, these are also quite useful to read.</p>
<p>I hope that these two planet instances will help us keep up to date with neuroscience research with less effort than before. They're both hosted on Github and are therefore, public pages. I don't reckon there'd be any bandwidth issues either. They're just static pages. Please do give them a go to see if you find them useful and of course, please spread the word too.</p>
<p>At the moment, I have a cron job that updates them once daily, and I've put up some initial source that I was already following. If you know of any other sources that are worth following too, please do get in touch with me. The themes are extremely simple. You can always open pull requests if you'd like to make them better.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend, and do drop me a line if you find these new planets useful!</p>

<p>Imagine it: you’re happily surfing through your social media feeds – or what we nowadays call your filter bubble – when some unexpected perspectives somehow manage to penetrate. After you “like” the latest critique of police power, for instance, you come across an article arguing that cracking down on crime can benefit minority neighborhoods. Or, elbowing its way into a crowd of articles celebrating trickle-down economics, you encounter a study showing higher taxes boost growth. What happens next? In <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X16300455">new research</a> in <em>Contemporary Educational Psychology</em>, Gregory Trevors and his colleagues looked at how reading conflicting information can push our emotional buttons, and lead us either towards resistance or a chance to learn.</p>
<p><span id="more-14222"></span></p>
<p>Nearly three hundred students from various Canadian and American universities first indicated their “epistemic beliefs” – that is, their beliefs about how knowledge comes about, such as whether facts are eternal or open to question. Next they read a series of texts on climate change, ordered in a way to maximize dissonance. To begin, an article emphasised anthropogenic change due to human-produced climate gases. To follow, an article emphasised how climate change has been greatly shaped by astronomical causes beyond our control. This “natural cycles” take was then upended by an article on catastrophic consequences of the current climate trend, and then one final switcheroo – a description of how rising temperatures will produce some global opportunities.</p>
<p>After each article, the participants indicated how strongly they felt emotions like frustration, confusion or surprise. At the end, each participant had to synthesise what they had got out of the texts by writing a short summary, which was analysed by text-matching algorithms and human judges to see when participants were prepared to integrate controversial texts, and when they preferred to stick to a simple narrative.</p>
<p>Different beliefs about knowledge led to different emotional reactions, and to different ways of handling the text. For example, for readers who said they believed you can’t verify knowledge based on gut feelings, but need to contrast and compare across many sources, the jarring text on astronomical causes of climate change led to greater feelings of surprise and curiosity. In turn, these feelings appeared to motivate them to take in this new information as shown by the way their summaries acknowledged multiple viewpoints.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the participants who endorsed the idea that knowledge comes to us as food does to baby birds, offered by an authority figure for our easy digestion, felt confused when faced with the prospect of multiple authorities. Confusion makes it harder to take in and remember information, and this appeared to take place here, as these participants’ summaries turned out to be more monotone and lacked reference to the controversial information.</p>
<p>Not every belief turned out to have the expected effect – in particular, believing that knowledge is certain, led participants to experience less surprise, not more, when confronted with contradictions. The researchers speculated that perhaps these participants simply hadn’t engaged with the text enough to take in its implications.</p>
<p>Although we shouldn’t allow our models of the world to be battered around by every spurious claim, the intelligent approach is to acknowledge credibly sourced evidenced-based arguments – especially those that dissent from the dominant narrative. This research shows us how this process can be obstructed by how we feel, and suggests two solutions for educators and influencers. The first is to anticipate the likely reactions to <em>this specific argument</em>: consider where and how your audience might be disengaging due to their emotional feelings and shape your message to redress this. The second is to try to <em>shift how people actually think about</em> <em>knowledge itself,</em> by referencing the robust evidence underlying your claims, linking to counter-evidence and explicitly weighing different sources. You won’t always win minds on the specific argument, but you might open minds, to the benefit of all the conversations to come.</p>

            <p>There are certainly different types of drunks. “Sober Dave is boring, you should hang out with Drunk Dave, he’s wild!” or “She is usually a sweetheart, but watch out, she’s a mean drunk”.  Having documented the transition to our drunk alter-egos for 100s of years, we are no strangers to the concept of drunk personality types. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that alcohol can change our personalities from a sober type to a drunk type.    </p>
<p>Today, research pioneered by University of Missouri graduate student, Rachel Winograd, supports the existence of at least 4 categories of drunk personalities. Importantly, she reveals if one’s type of drunk personality puts them at greater risk of alcohol-related harms (e.g. regrettable sexual encounters or drunken injuries), as well as alcohol addiction. </p>
<p>187 pairs of undergraduate drinking buddies answered questions linking their drunk personality to the “big five” personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). Cluster analysis of these answers led to the description of four main drunk personality types as outlined below. </p>
<p>Not only is it a bit of fun to ask, “What kind of drunk are you?”, the drunk personality research field holds promise for the development of novel interventions to help problem drinkers.</p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type 1: The Ernest Hemingway</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Ernest Hemmingway" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/ernest-hemmingway-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>As Ernest Hemingway wrote, he ‘‘can drink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk.” Thankfully, this is the most common drunk personality type shared by 42% of the undergrads, who reported behaving roughly the same and only slightly changing when intoxicated.  </p>
<p>Compared to the other personality types, the personality factors that tend to change the most when drunk — i.e. conscientiousness (being prepared, organized, prompt) and intellect ( understanding abstract ideas, being imaginative) — do not change drastically.  It is no surprise then that this drunk personality type was not linked with experiencing more negative consequences or alcoholism symptoms. </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type 2: The Mr Hyde</strong><strong> </strong></p><strong>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Mr Hyde" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/Mr-Hyde-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second most common drunk personality type (23% of the sample) is the monster of a drunk named after the twisted alter-ego of Dr. Jeckyll, Mr. Hyde. They are characterized by being less conscientious, less intellectual and less agreeable than their sober selves or other drunk personality types.</p>
<p>Their drunk personality being the perfect recipe for increased hostility when under the influence, they are statistically more likely to have alcohol use disorder symptoms (i.e. have a higher risk of alcohol addiction). They also suffer a whole range of negative consequences from drinking, from blacking out to being arrested for drunken behaviour. </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Personality Type  3: The Nutty Professor</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Nutty Professor" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/nutty-professor-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>This type of drunk, comprising 20% of the study participants, does a personality 360 when they get drunk. They are particularly quiet and introverted when sober, but their drunken persona has a large increase in extraversion and decrease in conscientiousness (compared to the other drunk types and their sober self). This is likened to the the Disney character, Shermen Clump, when he transforms from taking his secret chemical formula in <em>The Nutty Professor</em>.</p>
<p>Despite having the most drastic personality change, Nutty Professors were not associated with experiencing more negative alcohol-related consequences from drinking. </p>
</strong><p><strong><strong>Drunk Personality Type 4: The Mary Poppins</strong></strong></p>
<p><img alt="Drunk Personality Type Mary Poppins" src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-poppins-drunk-personality-type.jpg" /></p>
<p>The least common drunk personality type in the study, found in 15% of the participants, was ‘The Mary Poppins. They are not only particularly agreeable (i.e. embodying traits of friendliness)when sober, they are also agreeable and friendly when drunk. Like Hemmingways, they also decrease less than average in conscientiousness and intellect when getting drunk. </p>
<p>Their drunken sweetness sets them apart from less agreeable Hemmingways. They are essentially the opposite of the Mr Hyde drunk type of drunk, resulting in significantly less negative consequences from getting drunk. </p>

<p>Television programs portraying ordinary people in unexpected situations are almost as old as the medium of television itself. First aired in 1984, <em>Candid Camera</em> is often seen as a prototype of the reality show. Its premise was simple – unsuspecting people were confronted with unusual, funny situations and filmed with hidden cameras. However, the genre exploded as a phenomenon in the late 1990s and 2000s with the global success of such series as <em>Survivor</em>, <em>Idol</em>, and <em>Big Brother</em>, and to this day many people continue to abandon their own activities for the voyeuristic other.</p>
<p>Reality shows have not only amassed incredible popularity but have also become an object of severe, wide-ranging criticism. Among the most serious complaints is the allegation that the shows rely on viewers’ enjoyment of the humiliation and degradation of participants. It is quite difficult to find an individual who is indifferent to such programmes. We either hate reality shows or we watch them, quite often without considering why.</p>
<p>Up until now, scholarly opinion on the subject has been divided. Some maintain that the shows’ appeal constitutes an extension of fictional drama, and is thus driven by positive feelings like empathy and compassion. Others claim that reality TV viewers are driven by a voyeuristic desire to intrude on others and to see them in their most private and embarrassing moments. Michal Hershman Shitrit and Jonathan Cohen from University of Haifa in Israel recently tested these contrasting perspectives for a <a href="http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-1105/a000186">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Media Psychology</em>.<span id="more-14195"></span></p>
<p>They surveyed 183 participants about 12 different reality shows including local versions of well-known productions such as <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>American Idol</em>, <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em>, <em>Master Chef</em>, and <em>Super Nanny</em>. Participants stated how often they watched each show, how much they enjoyed the shows, the extent to which they would want to participate if offered a chance, how happy they would be if a family member was interested in participating, etc. Among the most important questions were ones involving self-disclosure (items asked to what extent one would reveal to a stranger various types of information, such as “Your personal habits” or “Things you have done and feel guilty about.”), as the researchers hypothesized that self-disclosure would be positively correlated with one’s own willingness to participate in reality shows.</p>
<p>The idea behind the questions about loved ones participating was to measure attitudes towards participation at a slight distance, independent from the respondents’ own personality traits and willingness to participate. Shitrit and Cohen assumed that if people do not wish to be humiliated or see their loved ones publicly humiliated, and at the same time they enjoy reality shows for the humiliation involved, one would expect a negative correlation between enjoyment and willingness to participate. If, on the other hand, empathy is the main reason why people enjoy these shows, the correlation should be positive.</p>
<p>Overall, interest in participating in reality shows was not very high, but crucially, the more that participants said they enjoyed the shows, the more likely they were to say that they’d like to participate, or for a loved one to participate. Unsurprisingly, participants who scored highly in the self-disclosure measure also tended to be more interested in participating in reality shows. On the whole, approval for family members’ participation in reality shows was higher than the desire for self-participation.</p>
<p>Shitrit and Cohen concluded that this tricky and innovative test of the real reasons behind enjoyment of reality shows allowed them to discover that humiliation is not the central motivation, which must rather be empathy.</p>
<p>Are these findings good news for all those who enjoy reality shows and for those who would like to perceive human creatures as good and positive? I would not be so eager to shout the good news to the whole world. Humans are quite complex creatures. Not only do we love others, but quite often we do not like some of them, and at times even hate them. I wonder what results would be generated by a study in which we asked participants not about their loved ones, but rather those they despised? Isn’t it true that we are overly optimistic not only about ourselves but also about our loved ones, and we can’t imagine that we or they would find themselves in embarrassing situations? Conversely, isn’t it the case that we would like to see our enemies embarrass themselves, and we can easily imagine this occurring? In which case, surely it’s possible that we enjoy reality shows in part because of feeling empathy and sympathy when watching participants we like, while at the same time finding enjoyment in seeing those we do not like in their most humiliating and embarrassing moments?</p>
<p>I think that before we trumpet to the whole world the researchers’ “good news” interpretation of their study, it would be desirable to get answers to these questions first.</p>

            <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.med.uio.no/klinmed/english/people/aca/tuomomm/">Tuomo Mäki-Marttunen</a> joins us for a special journal club session this week.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The recent progress in electrophysiological and optical methods for neuronal recordings provides vast amounts of high-resolution data. In parallel, the development of computer technology has allowed simulating ever larger neuronal circuits. A challenge in taking advantage of these developments is the construction of single-cell and network models in a way that faithfully reproduces neuronal biophysics with subcellular level of details while keeping the simulation costs at an acceptable level. In this talk, I will present our work on a stepwise method for fitting a neuron model to data with fine spatial resolution, such as that achievable with voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and Ca2+ imaging.</p>
<p>We applied our method to simulated data from layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) and constructed a model with reduced neuronal morphology. We connected the reduced-morphology neurons into a network and validated against simulated data from a high-resolution L5PC network model. The reduced-morphology neuron model obtained using our approach reliably reproduced the membrane potential dynamics across the dendrites as predicted by the full-morphology model, and was more than 20 times faster to simulate. The network models produced using our method are cost-efficient and predict that interconnected L5PCs, largely due to the medium afterhyperpolarization mediated by the Ca2+-activated SK current, are able to amplify delta-range oscillatory inputs across a large range of network sizes and topologies.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="signature-giphy-2" class=" size-full wp-image-14186 alignleft" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/signature-giphy-2.gif?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>When you sign your name, do you like to fill the available space with bold strokes or is your personal scribble a more modest mark?  A group of psychologists from Uruguay, the Netherlands and Curaçao say that the answer could be a sign of your personality – from analysing the traits and signatures of 192 women and 148 men (psych students in Uruguay), they found that men and women with bigger signatures tended to score higher on “social dominance” – measured by agreement with statements like “I certainly have self confidence” and “I am not shy with strangers”. Among women only, a bigger signature also correlated with narcissism – agreement with claims like “I am a special person” and “I am going to be a great person”. Signature size was not correlated with self esteem or aggressive dominance, which is more about controlling other people for self-serving reasons.</p>
<p>If true, these <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616301362">results</a>, published recently in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, would appear to provide some support for the quack field of graphology – the idea that our handwriting style reveals our personality (listed as one of the 50 great myths of psychology in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Myths-Popular-Psychology…">the book</a> by Scott Lilienfeld and his colleagues, based in part on <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-07238-011">a decisive meta-analysis of the area</a> published by Geoffrey Dean in 2002). But the authors of the new research are careful to argue that it is signatures specifically, not handwriting more generally, that may be revealing of personality, precisely because they are such a personal form of self expression.<span id="more-14120"></span></p>
<p>Sceptics may take some convincing, but consider that previous findings have also suggested signatures have a special psychological significance, including <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/38/15197.full">a study</a> that showed people are more honest in a document when they sign it at the beginning rather than the end, presumably because their signature activates attention to their sense of self.</p>
<p>The new findings also add to other research linking signature styles with personality, including <a href="http://prx.sagepub.com/content/62/1/152.abstract">a paper from 1988</a> that found women who embellished their signatures with lines and exclamation points scored higher on narcissism, and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144419">another from 2014</a> that found CEOs with bigger signatures tended to receive higher salaries, but their companies performed worse. There’s even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4708124">research</a> that showed boosting people’s self-esteem, by giving them inflated feedback on an IQ test, led them to produce a larger signature.</p>
<p>Alvaro Mailhos and his colleagues say their study is an advance on the existing literature because they used three different measures of signature size – essentially based on the area of the smallest possible rectangle than can be placed around the scribble, either on a horizontal or at an angle, or based on the space filled by a curved outline drawn round the scribble.</p>
<p>They also controlled for complicating factors such as the size and number of individual characters in the person’s name, and signature style such as signing with one’s initials or a simple stylistic flourish. Importantly, they also showed that only signature size and not the size of one’s printed name was linked with social bravado and narcissism, likely because printing your name is less personal and expressive.</p>
<p>The correlations between signature size and social dominance and narcissism (in women) were modest in size (the beta coefficients in a regression were 0.12 and 014, respectively) but given they held across the different measures of size and after controlling for confounds, the researchers suggested their findings are robust and meaningful.</p>
<p>“We unambiguously demonstrate a link between personality traits and signature size, and also, in so doing, we offer a robust methodological approach to study the relationship between handwritten gestures and psychological traits that could be of value for further research,” they concluded.</p>

<p><b>A deadly Ebola mutation. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">New research suggests that a mutation in the Ebola virus may be responsible for the scale of the epidemic that began in 2013 in West Africa.

The mutation made the virus better suited for humans than its natural host, the fruit bat, which may have allowed the virus to spread more aggressively. Working independently, </span><a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31396-4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another team of researchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to a similar conclusion, but the role of the mutation in Ebola’s virulence and transmissibility still needs to be clarified.

He measured the tree using a laser scanning technology called LIDAR (for Light Detection and Ranging), and since the measurement was taken remotely, they are unsure of the exact species of the tree, but think it is likely in the genus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorea</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p>Experiments suggest that telling if two unfamiliar faces are the same or different is no easy task. Such research has sometimes presented participants with full body shots, has more commonly used cropped shots of people’s heads, but almost never placed the faces in a formal context, such as on a photographic ID card. But these are the situations in which face-to-photo matching is most relevant, when a shop assistant squints at a driver’s license before selling alcohol to a twitchy youth, or an emigration official scrutinises passports before their holders pass ports. Moreover, it’s plausible that the task is harder when juggling extra information, something already found in the realm of fingerprint matching, where <a href="http://https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/14/fingerprint-matching-is-biased-by-the-assessors-prejudices/">biographical information can lead to more erroneous matches</a> because it triggers observer prejudices. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3281/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new article</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em> confirms these fears, suggesting that our real-world capacity to spot fakes in their natural setting is even worse than imagined.</p>
<p><span id="more-14097"></span></p>
<p>Jennifer McCaffery and Mike Burton at the University of York asked 80 adult participants to make judgments on pairs of face photographs, deciding when the two shots were of the same person or two different individuals. In some instances, one of the two faces was embedded in a passport image (see below), and in these cases the participant was also asked to keep an eye out for data errors in the passport, which were sprinkled through a minority of instances. McCaffery and Burton found that when matching against a passport-embedded photo, participants showed a bias towards thinking the two faces were of the same person, a bias which led them to miss more instances where the photos didn’t match; in a real situation, this translates to letting someone through control on another person’s passport.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_14102" style="width: 464px;"><img alt="screenshot-2016-11-17-18-19-35" class=" size-full wp-image-14102 aligncenter" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screenshot-2016-11-17-18-19-35.png?w=845" />Sample stimuli from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3281/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">McCaffery and Burton, 2016</a>.</figure>
<p>In another experiment, the researchers investigated how the task of face-matching affects the way we evaluate passport data and vice versa. As well as making face judgments, participants had to look out for errors in the passport, such as: the gender of the name not matching the gender of the supposed passport owner; the wrong year of birth, which could be off by 20 years (this should be an easy task, as people can typically judge age from a photograph to within five years); and an error in the place of birth, which was indicated by spelling mistakes in well-known British place names, such as “Luuton”. The participants’ error-spotting performance was compared against control participants recruited in earlier research who were challenged to look for errors without also having to perform face-matching.</p>
<p>Combining face-matching and data-matching into one situation harmed performance in both areas. Once again, faces in a passport context were more likely to be falsely waved through as a match than when the comparison was between headshots alone. And participants were poorer at spotting the data errors, compared to control participants, only catching one in five of the place of birth and year of birth errors, versus well over half caught by control participants. What’s more, participants were worse at spotting data errors when the faces were a true match, suggesting the confidence from this task leaked over to the other and made them less vigilant.</p>
<p>It’s well-known that tasks with multiple demands are harder, loading on things for our mind to deal with and allowing the possibility of interference between the two tasks. So the findings are understandable, but still troubling. Perhaps the procedure behind identity checks needs tuning by breaking it into discrete steps – perhaps even undertaken by different individuals. Moreover, this work is an important reminder that even well-established findings can be wide of the mark of how things truly operate, when based on laboratory research that doesn’t take account of real-world conditions.</p>

<li>You’re on your way to the traditional Thanksgiving family get-together. You drive down a familiar street, locate your familiar house, and park in a familiar spot.<br />
<em>Thank you, hippocampus, for dutifully encoding Wisteria Drive, the light-blue-colored Colonial house and the parking spot next to the creepy oak tree almost twenty-eight years ago. I owe you one.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Wait a minute. <em>Whose new convertible is that on our driveway?</em><br />
<em>Hippocampus, remind me to find out.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You step out of your car and notice that the neighbors still have their Halloween pumpkins on display. Ew! They look hideous.<br />
<em>Well, at least I can decipher a ‘face’ in those god-awful, shriveled carvings. Thanks, fusiform gyrus.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You quickly snap a picture, and send it to your roommate, along with, of course, the face-with-tears-of-joy emoji.<br />
<em>Thanks, again, dear fusiform gyrus, to help comprehend the world of two hundred and seventy nine emojis. You’ve revolutionized the way we text.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You stare at the magnificent spread on the dining table. But tonight, you resolve to eat in moderation. No matter how delicious the food is, as an evolved human, you have the ability to suppress an urge.<br />
<em>Thank you, prefrontal cortex, for being my sleek, determined executive controller. Your strong-willed decisions have saved my many embarrassments, especially around free food.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As soon as you open the door, you catch a whiff of blissful aroma from the kitchen. Ah! You smell pumpkin pie.<br />
<em>Wow, olfactory receptor neurons, you went from transducing smells to the olfactory bulb to making my stomach growl in no time! Thanks. Now I really have to eat.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ovoid, curvaceous gravy boat sits proudly next to the turkey, fulfilling its sole responsibility on Thanksgiving Day. You’ve always cracked up at its odd shape.<br />
<em>Hey, visual cortex, thanks to your ventral pathway for helping make sense of shapes. They sure ask “what” a lot, but I know they mean well.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your pants feel tighter as you eat, but you continue gorging the smooth, creamy mashed potatoes. <em>I can’t stop! This is so good!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations. You’ve fallen for the moves of the neural seductress, the ventral tegmental area. She has the (electrical) potential to make you feel so loved, so rewarded, and so addicted.<em> <em>Thank you, thank you, and I don’t care!</em></em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex shakes his head in utter disappointment.</p>
<p>Psst! Cerebral gossip: Ever since you made a New Year’s resolution to lose weight earlier this year, the steadfast prefrontal cortex has been in a complicated relationship with the ravenous ventral tegmental area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amid the clatter of forks and plates, your aunt interrupts your intimate moment with the pumpkin pie with, “Say, when are you going to graduate and get a “real” job?”<br />
<em>Whaaa, where did this come from?</em> Your vigilant amygdala senses potential fear, and nudges the hypothalamus to sort out a fight or flight response. Your eyes widen. Your heart is beating faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>But let’s face it. You’re too stuffed for a fight. You’re too stuffed for a flight.</p>
<p>The amygdala makes a note: <em>Your mind wanders to an ongoing manuscript revision. Do not fear unsolicited questions about career. Especially when eating dessert.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Your mind wanders to an ongoing manuscript revision.</li>
</ul>
<p>[In reviewer voice] You missed being thankful for the brain stem.<br />
<em>Wait, really? Why should I?</em><br />
[In reviewer voice] Because no one messes with the Mr. Brain Stem. We’re all just happy to have the support, and always cite him.<br />
<em>You sure have the nerve to randomly name-drop Mr. Bigwig Brain Stem.</em><br />
[In reviewer voice] Yes, (cranial) nerves III – IX, to be specific.</p>
<p>Your corrected manuscript now reads: <em>I’m extremely thankful for the brain stem.</em></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>It’s 10:30 PM. You try to keep your eyes open, but the idea of snuggling into your bed seems rather appealing. Oh, the sweet relief of melatonin. Yawn.<br />
<em>Thanks, suprachiasmatic nucleus. Nighty-night.</em></li>

            <p><em><img alt="Female head and refresh icon" class=" size-medium wp-image-14084 alignleft" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/thinkstockphotos-468413800-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" width="300" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>In the ongoing, complex debates about the extent and meaning of psychological differences between the sexes, mental rotation ability is usually quoted as one of the most robust examples of where a difference can be found. This is the ability to rotate objects in your mind’s eye, and while there is a lot of overlap between men’s and women’s performance, there is plenty of evidence that men, on average, are better at this than women. Can we take this to reflect a genuine, specific difference in average cognitive ability between the sexes?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. A new, small <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-015-0704-7">study</a> in <em>Psychological Research</em> reminds us why this field of science is so difficult to interpret. The findings suggest that the mental rotation ability of women who habitually suppress the public display of their emotions is equal to that of men. In other words, sex differences in mental rotation ability may reflect an emotional difference between the sexes – emotional suppression is known to be more common in men than women – rather than a cognitive difference.<span id="more-14012"></span></p>
<p>Anne-Katharina Faltung and Markus Kiefer asked 28 men and 28 women to fill out some surveys about their emotional lives, including their proneness to angry outbursts and their tendency to suppress public displays of emotion (one example item was “I keep my emotions to myself”).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_14091" style="width: 167px;"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-17-09-19" class=" size-medium wp-image-14091 alignright" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-17-09-19.png?w=157&amp;h=300" width="157" /><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701">Shepard &amp; Meltzer, 1971</a>.</figure>
<p>Then the participants completed 48 trials of a classic mental rotation task, which involved judging within four-seconds per trial whether or not a three-dimensional shape on the left of the computer screen was the same as the one on the right, just rotated to a different orientation. The trials got harder as the task went on, and emoji-type symbols and spoken feedback (such as “Oh dear, you made a mistake”) informed the participants whether they’d got each trial right or not.</p>
<p>Overall, the men outperformed the women in terms of making fewer total errors, and in being less likely to follow up one error with another. The researchers were particularly interested in these follow-on errors because they are a sign of the participant reacting badly to negative feedback, either through being distracted or giving up.</p>
<p>But then Faltung and Kiefer split up their male and female groups according to emotional suppression habits. Overall men reported suppressing their emotions more than women, but there was enough variation among the women to create two subgroups – one group who said they mostly let their emotions out, and another group who said they more often suppressed their emotions.</p>
<p>Women who did not habitually suppress their emotions made more total errors on the task than men (both high and low emotional suppressors) and more follow-on errors, but crucially, women who habitually suppressed their emotions performed as well as the men on the rotation task, in terms of total errors and follow-on errors (there was still a tendency for higher performance among men, but the difference in their scores and those of the emotion-suppressing women was not statistically significant).</p>
<p>We must beware over-interpreting such as small study, but the researchers say their results demonstrate an important principle, namely that investigations into potential cognitive differences between the sexes need to take sex differences in emotional strategy into account. Mental rotation ability – often heralded as one of the most robust examples of a sex-linked cognitive difference – may be more about emotions than about visuospatial ability.</p>
<p>This need for nuance in the field of sex-differences research is in addition to other findings that have highlighted the way that cultural pressures can influence sex differences in cognitive performance. For example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/07/01/womens-true-maths-skills-unlocked-by-pretending-to-be-someone-else/">it’s been shown</a> that women perform as well as men on maths when competing under an alias, presumably because this removes the pressure not to conform to sex-related prejudices about ability.</p>
<p>Another angle to these new findings concerns emotional regulation strategies. It’s a mistake to think that the male tendency for emotional suppression is inherently superior.  In fact emotional suppression is usually considered unhelpful, especially over the longer term, because it’s linked with increased risk of stress and depression. But these findings suggest that in the short term, and in certain contexts, it may be advantageous by helping to avoid the distracting effect of negative feedback.</p>

            <p>Can sexual abuse make you gay? The short answer according to new research is, no. Child sexual abuse is not a common cause of being gay. But, new research says that the opposite is true. There is something common in the childhood of homosexual men that makes them a target for pedophilia and sexual abuse — gender non-conformity. </p>
<p>Many homophobic religious institutions make unfounded claims about same-sex sexual child abuse causing homosexuality, like those coming from the pro-heterosexual, anti-gay activist group, Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment (HOME):</p>
<blockquote><p>We can see that sexual abuse can theoretically account for every case of homosexuality…</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the lens of science these claims are considered ridiculous and laughable at best, often followed by outrageous and scientifically unfounded claims that being gay is the cause of pedophilia.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, non-heterosexuals with a history of same-sex sexual abuse as a child often ask if this made them desire the same-sex as an adult. Similarly, gay men and women who were sexually abused by the opposite sex as a child, ask if this caused a sexual fear and revulsion towards the opposite sex that ‘made’ them gay. </p>
<p>Whether the pedophile or child molester was gay or straight, gay victims tend to ask the same question at some point, “Did sexual abuse make me gay?”</p>
<p>Research indicates that this isn’t true of straight people abused as children, they are less likely to question if being abused made them straight. Thus it is often argued that it is the culturally ingrained negative views of gay people, particularly of gay men, or simply belonging to a minority group, that the question is even asked in the first place. </p>
<p>Even so, it is still a common view that sexual abuse can ‘turn’ a child gay despite no convincing or reliable evidence that premature sexual activity or child sexual abuse grossly changes sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The main withstanding argument in support of this view is that child sexual abuse is more common in the gay community than the straight community. In fact, meta-analysis indicates that sexual minority school children were on average almost 4 times more likely to experience sexual abuse than heterosexual children. </p>
<p>The latest research stands against this argument, providing the most convincing causal evidence yet that it is a common aspect of many gay men’s childhoods that is linked with higher rates of sexual abuse in boys who later identify as gay in adulthood — not sexual abuse ‘making’ a child gay. </p>
<p>Published in <em>Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment</em> the new research suggests that a child’s gender nonconformity, which is more common for non-heterosexuals, that may make them more desirable targets for pedophiles and child abusers.</p>
<p>To clarify, gender nonconformity you may also know as gender bending. Gender nonconformity is when people identify with or behave like what is culturally considered typical for the opposite sex, going against the gender grain if you will. For example, boys that like to play dress-up, or girls that prefer rough play. </p>
<p>In the study, 1753 participants filled out an online survey that regarding their sexual orientation, history of child abuse, and the degree of gender nonconformity they recall from childhood, including the activities and kinds of play and types of clothes they liked.</p>
<p>Although other research has suggested a link between gender nonconforming and sexual abuse in children, whether nonconforming caused abuse, or abuse caused nonconforming had not previously been assessed this directly. By using a special type of analysis called instrumental variable analysis, the new study was able to estimate causal relationships. It is therefore study able to more confidently address the complex question “Can sexual abuse make you gay?”</p>
<p>In line with other research, gay participants (being male or female homo and bisexuals) in the new study had greater odds (~45% greater) of being sexually abused in childhood than heterosexual participants. </p>
<p>They also found that heterosexual and non-heterosexual men who are more gender nonconforming (i.e. ‘feminine’) in childhood had higher chances of abuse than sexual orientation matched boys who are more gender conforming (i.e. ‘masculine’). In other words being gay or not had nothing to do with it. It was whether boys behaved like stereotypical boys or not that was key. </p>
<p>However, gender non-conforming girls were not at higher risk of sexual abuse than conforming girls in the present study. It is research supported factoid that gender nonconformity in girls, like being a ‘tomboy’, is generally more socially accepted, approved of and tolerated in Western cultures than gender nonconforming in boys, who are often considered as mama’s boys, sissies or brats.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that gender nonconforming boys are less generally approved of partly due to cultural femi-negativity. Cultural femi-negativity being where femininity is particularly devalued when it does not adhere to gender norms. The idea that abusers target children with feminine qualities as to make for more compliant and less socially valued abuse targets fits well with the study and the body of research as a whole considering more girls are targets of pedophilia and child molestation than boys, and that more gender non-conforming feminine boys are targeted more than masculine conforming ones, whether they are gay or not.  </p>
<p>This also makes sense when considering research suggesting that most abusive pedophiles are generally aroused by youth, and that the child’s sex, at the core of their desires, is pretty immaterial. Whether they abuse mainly boys or girls, it’s about a child being a child, ease of access to that child and avoiding getting caught through ease of controlling the child.</p>
<p>Whereas adult child molesters, who can be a pedophiles (i.e. someone specifically attracted to children) but are not necessarily pedophiles, get a sexual kick out of domination, power and control, marking those with more feminine qualities as being easier and less risky targets. </p>
<p>Importantly, the research suggests that it is having feminine personality traits and behaviors more common to gay boys, i.e. gender nonconforming, that leads to such high rates of child abuse cases in gay men. There is no credible research as of yet that indicates that it is common that child sexual abuse is a cause of being gay. </p>
<p>It seems that there is something, or somethings, about gender-non-conforming in boys that puts them at an increased risk of sexual abuse. If research now focuses on exploring further what those somethings are we can better protect children from the traumas of sexual abuse.</p>

            Are the eyes the windows to intelligence? In an interesting paper, Georgia psychologists Jason S. Tsukahara and colleagues report that there's a positive correlation between pupil size and cognitive ability.



It's well known that our pupil size varies over time due to changes in both emotional state and cognitive 'effort'. As Tsukahara et al. put it
Starting in the 1960s it became apparent to psychologists that the size of the pupil is related to more than just the amount of light enterin

The cutting edge of this research was presented at the nanosymposium on <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/session/424" target="_blank">Molecular and Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease</a></strong> Saturday afternoon. From genetics to brain structure to molecular markers, this session highlighted the diversity of tools researchers are employing to better understand the neural effects of both normal and pathological aging.</p>
<p><strong>Structural Biomarkers</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease pathology is known to originate in the brain’s medial temporal lobe – most notably in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus – before spreading to more extensive cortical regions. Although prior research has therefore focused largely on structural changes in this region, new evidence shared at SfN this year suggests that aberrant brain structure <em>beyond the medial temporal lobe</em> may serve as an additionally powerful disease biomarker.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?taylor" target="_blank">Taylor Schmidt</a></strong> from the University of Cambridge presented findings that basal forebrain gray matter atrophy precedes atrophy in the entorhinal cortex, in cognitively impaired and healthy older adults with high amyloid burden, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Not only did basal forebrain atrophy predict delayed recall performance, but this effect was mediated by amyloid levels. Could subcortical atrophy, perhaps driven by amyloid deposition, precede cortical degeneration to serve as an earlier biomarker of Alzheimer’s pathology?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~nikolai/arash_ahamohammadi_sereshki.html" target="_blank">Arash Sereshki</a></strong> of the University of Alberta expanded upon these findings, encouraging researchers to look beyond the hippocampus for signatures of brain aging. Using high-resolution MRI, his work showed that volume of the amygdala, a region involved in fear and reward learning among other functions, was a strong predictor of age-related neural changes. The basal nucleus of the amygdala showed the most robust atrophy with age, but this association only occurred in men.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/owen-phillips" target="_blank">Owen Philips</a></strong> from Stanford University explored the effects of Alzheimer’s disease on white matter, delving beyond the thick, deep fibers that characterize the brain’s celebrated connective superhighway. Instead of examining the white matter of the cingulum, corpus callosum or fornix, his group evaluated whether superficial white matter – which myelinates later and is more complex than deep white matter – is affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Using vertex-wise analysis, they found widespread increased diffusivity in the superficial white matter of Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to healthy controls, most prominently in the temporal lobe. This diffusion signal negatively correlated with global cognitive function, indicating that greater superficial white matter diffusion was a good indicator of the severity of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><strong>Genetics</strong></p>
<p>Various factors integratively determine the type and extent of neuropathology that one may sustain in older age, and which may ultimately lead to the neurodegenerative changes discussed by Schmidt, Sereshki and Phillips. Although genetics only play one part in this pathological cascade, the APOE and BDNF genes are well-documented contributors to risk for cognitive impairment in older age.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-sweeney-67a2b01b" target="_blank">Melanie Sweeney</a></strong> of the University of Southern California examined effects of the APOE4 allele, which increases risk for Alzheimer’s disease, on neurovascular health. Her group reported that breakdown of the blood brain barrier, which selectively filters substances into the brain from the blood, is greater in individuals with APOE4 than those without the risk gene. APOE4 carriers also demonstrated increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, even at preclinical stages (i.e., before any disease symptoms), beginning first in the hippocampus, one of the earliest sites to undergo neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~nikolai/nikolai_malykhin.html" target="_blank">Nikolai Malykhin</a></strong>, also from the University of Alberta, looked more closely as how genetics affect morphometry in subregions of the hippocampus. In cognitively normal adults, volumes of all hippocampal subregions were greater for those carrying the APOE2 variant, which lowers risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Volume of the dentate gyrus – but no other hippocampal subregions – was reduced for BDNF met-carriers, showing that BDNF effects on hippocampal size were more specific than APOE effects.</p>
<p><strong>Molecular biomarkers</strong></p>
<p>Although amyloid and tau are the molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, they have been remarkably challenging to detect in the living human brain. However, thanks to impressive methodological advances, there has been a recent surge in the development of tools to visualize the most sensitive molecular disease biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N13-1271" target="_blank">Xiaotian Fang</a></strong> from Uppsala University presented a novel imaging technique that uses an antibody that, fused with a blood brain barrier-passage molecule, can enter the brain and bind to amyloid protofibrils, suspected to be the toxic component of amyloid plaques. This tracer effectively labeled amyloid protofibrils in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and holds promise as a more sensitive imaging tool than current amyloid plaque tracers.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maja_Mustapic" target="_blank">Maja Mustapic</a></strong> of the NIA explored the potential of extracellular vesicles in the blood – which can transport molecules such as amyloid or tau to the brain – as Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. Levels of phosphorylated tau in these vesicles distinguished Alzheimer’s disease patients from normal controls with high accuracy, both at disease onset and before symptoms were manifest. Analysis of other vesicular molecules is underway.</p>
<p>As exemplified by the diverse techniques presented in this session, a multimodal approach may be our best bet for the most accurate early detection of neuropathological events. I’m already eagerly awaiting #SfN17 for updates on the ongoing advances in the development of Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers over the coming year.</p>

<p>When someone’s talking to you, have you noticed how they seem to keep breaking off eye contact, as if finding it hard to both talk and look you in the eye at the same time? Similarly, when you’re explaining something to someone or telling them a story, do you find yourself looking away from their eyes, so that you can concentrate on what you’re saying? A pair of Japanese researchers say that this happens because eye contact has a “unique effect” on our “cognitive control processes”. Essentially, mutual gaze is so mentally stimulating that it can be tricky to think straight and maintain eye contact at the same time.</p>
<p><span id="more-13922"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211385">Past</a> <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/000712608X371762/abstract">research</a> has shown that eye contact interferes with other mental tasks such as those involving visual imagination. Arguably this isn’t so surprising because both eye contact and visual imagination are obviously tapping the same mental domain. In their <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716302360">new paper</a> in <em>Cognition</em>, Shogo Kajimura and Michio Nomura tested whether eye contact also interferes with our ability to generate verbs in a word task, and whether this happens in all cases, or only when the verb generation task is made extra difficult.</p>
<p>Twenty-six participants were asked to look directly at a stranger’s face shown on-screen, while simultaneously performing an auditory verb generation task. Six men’s and women’s faces featured in the study, and were shown either looking straight at the participant or with their gaze averted. The faces were video animated so they appeared naturally, blinking and breathing. Each trial, the participant looked at the face, heard a noun, then their task was to respond out loud with a verb that could be used with the noun in a sentence.</p>
<p>The researchers used a range of nouns that are easier or harder to respond to, based on how strongly associated to the noun any related verbs are (i.e. retrieval demands high or low); and whether one possible response is much more dominant than any others versus there being many equally plausible alternatives (i.e. selection demands high or low).</p>
<p>To take one example, the noun “milk” is easy on both measures, because it’s strongly associated with “drink” and much more so than any other verb.</p>
<p>The key result is that participants were much slower at the verb generation task when making eye contact with the face on-screen, as opposed to when the face’s gaze was averted, but only in the most difficult version of the verb generation task, when retrieval and selection demands were high.</p>
<p>Kajimura and Nomura said this shows that eye contact doesn’t directly interfere with mental processes specifically related to verb generation – if it did, then performance times ought to have been longer for eye contact across easy and difficult versions of the verb task. Instead, they said the results are consistent with the idea that eye contact drains our more general cognitive resources – the kind that we need to draw on when some other task, such as speaking, becomes too difficult to be handled by domain-specific resources. That’s why the more complicated the story you’re telling (or excuse you’re making), the more likely you are to need to break off eye contact.</p>
<p>Looking away when we’re talking is something most of us do instinctively as adults, but this isn’t necessarily the case for children. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/01/05/helping-children-by-teaching-them-to-look-away/">Past research</a> has shown that young children can benefit from being taught to avert their gaze when they’re thinking.</p>

<p>Places of work have become fairer thanks to their embrace of meritocracy: the idea that the best person for the job is the right person for the job. Formal assessment processes, for example, help ensure that interviews are granted on merit, rather than allocating them based on which resumes remind the hiring manager of a younger version of themselves. One consequence of meritocracy is the replacement of seniority-based promotion – you get a better position when “it’s your time” – with one based on ability, a development that means younger people with the appropriate skills can leapfrog older colleagues and end up managing them. Unfortunately, according to <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.2129/abstract">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Organizational Behavior</em>, this can have nasty repercussions.</p>
<p><span id="more-13894"></span></p>
<p>Florian Kunze and Jochen Menges surveyed employees at 61 German companies, based primarily in the service industry, but also finance, manufacturing, and trade. Nearly 8000 participants described their age difference in relation to their managers, and a subset reported their experience of various negative emotions over the last six months. Managers tended to be older than those they managed, but on average a quarter of relationships did involve younger managers. Crucially, in companies where the size of the age gap was larger between younger managers and older subordinates, employees tended to report more negative emotions, such as anger or fear, experienced over the last six months.</p>
<p>Why would this be? Consider how the older subordinates might feel. We tend to measure our life progress by using our peers as a benchmark, particularly those in our age cohort, who may provoke a flush of envy if they rise far past us. But more brutal yet is when those who should be <em>behind</em> us pull ahead, rubbing our faces in our own inability to keep pace. And when such a person is managing you, it’s hard to avoid this.</p>
<p>More broadly, being under the supervision of someone younger than us is a simple status incongruence, like being lectured on your dress sense by your precocious 8-year-old nephew. This is an engine for resentment-based negative emotions. Such emotions, Kunze and Menges suggest, can then reverberate through the wider organisation, especially – and as established by diversity research – because employees will typically pay more attention to what happens to colleagues who tend to stand out, or in this case, to relationships that deviate from the norm.</p>
<p>Kunze and Menges also asked the leadership of each company to report their recent financial performance, as well as measures of productivity and efficiency. After controlling for company size and efficiency, they found that companies experiencing more negative emotions showed worse performance on all counts. More youthful managers of older subordinates, therefore, contribute to worse company performance through the negative emotions their existence encourages, presumably through sapping morale and enthusiasm for collective effort in the face of so much frustration.</p>
<p>The data revealed a buffer against this harmful outcome, but it’s a bitter pill to ask anyone to swallow: when employees reported that suppressing their emotions was the norm in their organisation, age differentials didn’t lead to more negative emotions in the wider organisation. The researchers reasoned that when emotions are unexpressed, there is no signal to the rest of the workforce that something is up, so they can go about their days in blissful ignorance. But this isn’t to solve the problem, but to distil it into a smaller but more concentrated form, as long-term emotion suppression <a href="http://https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12212647">can lead to</a> depression, damaged health, and impaired cognitive performance, a cruel fate to which to consign these older workers.</p>
<p>But companies shouldn’t “revert to the old workplace with traditional age structures”, say Kunze and Menges, because their research says nothing about the overall benefits of merit-based promotion. However, they do believe the negative repercussions that they’ve revealed should be addressed. One suggestion is to help older subordinates make sense of their feelings and explore whether they can come to terms with them rather than simply suppress them. Another suggestion, which I warmly advocate, is to address the root causes, changing the culture around “career time tables” and addressing issues of hierarchy and voice, so that old-timers, whether managers or not, can share their accrued wisdom and fully participate in the organisations to which they have given for so long.</p>

<p>Besides problems with social interactions, it has been known for a while that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16940314">many people with autism experience sensory difficulties, such as hypersensitivity to sounds, light or touch</a>. With sensory impairment now officially included in diagnostic manuals, researchers have been trying to see if there’s a link between the sensory and social symptoms. Such a link would make intuitive sense: For instance, it is easy to imagine that if someone experienced sensory stimuli more strongly, they would shun social interaction due to their complexity. More specifically, you would expect them to struggle with filtering out and making sense of social cues against the backdrop of sensory overload.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175094671400230X">Past research</a> has suggested that tactile hyper-responsiveness in particular may be relevant. The correct processing of tactile information plays an important role in differentiating yourself from others (so-called “self-other discrimination”), a crucial requirement for social cognition. In fact, touch may be unique among the senses because there is a clear difference in the tactile feedback received when you touch something compared to when you see someone else touch something. Now <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613781">a study</a> in <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em> has used recordings of participants’ brain waves to provide more evidence that tactile sensations are processed differently in people with autism and that this may contribute to their social difficulties.</p>
<p><span id="more-13857"></span></p>
<p>The researchers from Ghent recruited 19 men and women diagnosed with high functioning autism and 17 neurotypical control participants matched for gender, intelligence and age – both groups had an average age of around 32 years. While everyone filled out questionnaires assessing everyday problems with sensory processing, participants with autism received an additional questionnaire on the severity of their autism symptoms</p>
<p>To deliver tactile sensations, two electrodes were placed on the participants’ index and middle fingers of their right hand, which was covered with a dark cloth. Before the experiment began, 30 tactile stimulations (mild electric currents) were delivered to both fingers to familiarise participants with the device.</p>
<p>The actual experiment was relatively straightforward and involved the researchers recording the participants’ brain waves with EEG throughout. Each trial began with a picture displaying either a human or a wooden hand in a non-flexed position, resembling the position of the participants’ hidden right hand. Next, a picture was shown of either a tapping index or middle finger, which was accompanied by a single stimulator “tap” sent to the electrode on either the participant’s index or middle finger. This way, the tactile feedback the participants experienced was either congruent with the observed action (e.g. they saw a tapping index finger and received stimulation to their index finger) or incongruent (e.g. they saw a tapping index finger but received stimulation to their middle finger).</p>
<p>The researchers were especially interested in spikes of brain activity that are known to be relevant to processing tactile sensations, including the so-called N100 (a negative spike that occurs 100ms after the sensation) and a later positive spike (the P3) that has been linked with self-other discrimination in various contexts. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761757">previous studies</a> found an amplified P3 signal when participants heard their own name compared to another name or saw their own face compared to someone else’s. Crucially, this congruency effect <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152577">is also seen</a> when observed movements match experienced tactile sensations.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesised that if social impairment is related to sensory processing, then the participants with autism would show a reduced congruency effect in P3, and the size of this irregularity would be negatively correlated with their social functioning. And this is exactly what they found.</p>
<p>Compared to controls, participants in the autism group demonstrated differences in their brain waves both at earlier stages of sensory processing (the N100) as well as later stages. In line with the hypothesis, congruent trials (tactile feedback compatible with the observed action of a human hand) led to amplified P3 signals in the controls, but not in the autistic group. Furthermore, in the participants with autism, the greater their sensory and social impairments, the smaller the amplitude of the P3 component of their brain waves in response to congruent pictures.</p>
<p>These findings allow for two suggestions: First, individuals with autism struggle to differentiate between themselves and others (based on purely tactile information), which is similar to what other studies have found. Second, this difficulty was more pronounced in those individuals who also showed a higher degree of social and sensory impairment, suggesting these two domains are linked.</p>
<p>So does this mean that sensory hypersensitivity causes the social deficits that individuals with autism face? While this study cannot establish which is caused by which (or if they are both caused by a completely different factor), it does provide experimental evidence of a link between the two. To what extent this knowledge will improve treatment options for patients with autism remains to be studied by future investigations.</p>

<p>From artists to scientists, mothers, mathematicians and business visionaries, people in every corner of the world are dreaming up solutions to our most pressing problems. Whether tackling war and peace or the principles of machine learning, ingenuity starts with one thing: a spark.</p>
<p>And regardless of where the spark takes hold, inspiration demands action to reach its greatest potential. At the third installment of TED@IBM — part of the <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-institute">TED Institute</a>, held on November 15, 2016, at the SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco — a diverse and brilliant collection of speakers and performers dared to ask: What if we used our collective expertise and insights to provide a spark that could change the world for good?</p>
<p>After opening remarks from Michela Stribling, IBM’s editorial director, the talks in Session 1 challenged us to think about how we can work together to solve problems and, maybe, leave the planet better than we found it.</p>
<p><strong>Where light meets sound.</strong> In a performance that blurs the boundaries of light and sound, <strong>Ryan and Hays Holladay</strong> create a visual experience of beats and tones shaped around reverberations of color. With multicolored projections and an assortment of carefully placed lamps, the brothers transcribe their music across the illuminated bursts of surfaces suddenly made visible. Here, music becomes the performer, rather than the performance, directing us not toward itself but toward the tempo and rhythm that orchestrates its narration. It’s a melody as much seen as it is heard: a series of intonations whose colorful pattern of sound eventually collapses into the nearly faded spotlight of a solitary lamp.</p>
<p><strong>The answer to fighting cybercrime.</strong> Cybercrime netted $450 billion in profits last year, with 2 billion records lost or stolen. As the vice president at IBM Security, <strong>Caleb Barlow</strong> recognizes the insufficiency of our current strategies to protect our data from the ultra-sophisticated criminal gangs that are responsible for 80 percent of all cyber attacks. His solution? When a cyber attack occurs, we should respond to it with the same collective effort and openness as a health care crisis — we need to know who is infected and how the disease is spreading. Last year, Barlow and his team started publishing all of IBM’s threat data in an effort to encourage the same sharing from other major corporations, governments and private security firms. If we’re not sharing, he says, then we’re part of the problem.</p>

The key to a happy workplace is to balance that mix. Grant speaks at TED@IBM: Spark. (Photo: Russell Edwards/TED)</p></div>
<p><strong>One bad apple spoils the bunch.</strong> The success of any company is defined by the quality of people who work there. Organizational psychologist <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers"><strong>Adam Grant</strong></a> has spent a lot of time analyzing business structures, and he’s concluded that there are three different types of employees: givers, takers and matchers. To achieve a balanced workplace with equal opportunity for and distribution of work, power and play, companies must endeavor to hire givers and matchers, whose personalities allow employees to feel supported, heard and acknowledged. The challenge is to stop takers from getting a seat at the table, because they so often undercut the spirit of collaboration workplaces need to thrive.</p>
<p><strong>The business of rewriting stereotypes.</strong> After what felt like a lifetime spent simultaneously living out stereotypes and being imprisoned by them, <strong>Villy Wang</strong> wondered how she could break the cycle of racism and still make a living. She hit upon the idea of empowering young, diverse kids — those most misrepresented in the media — to become storytellers, training them in filmmaking so they can create new, authentic stories. After training, she helps place them into creative industries that influence media and entertainment, helping rewrite stereotypes at one of its sources. Wang has nested this entire program within a professional media production studio, a business that helps fund and ensure the future of the program. “Obviously, racism is deeply rooted in our history, politics, media and language,” she says, “but I believe if we can empower more diverse kids to take that narrative and change it, we will break hold of these ugly roots.”</p>

<p><strong>We are not mud, we are fertile ground.</strong> Spoken-word artist and activist <strong>Ise Lyfe</strong> sparks crucial dialogue on social justice through performance. With music accompaniment by master cellist <strong>Michael Feckses</strong>, Lyfe unravels the impact of the displacement of minority communities in American cities, threaded from his personal experience in East Oakland. By using the image of a flag in the mud to convey the claiming of a muddy territory, Lyfe creates a symbol for gentrification but urges: “I reject the notion of your flag in our mud. Let us be the spark to convey. We are not mud, we’re fertile ground waiting on the rain.”</p>
<p><strong>AI and justice for all.</strong> You need a good lawyer if you’re involved in a legal case. But a typical case can cost thousands of dollars in legal fees — and a lot of that money goes toward the time it takes to learn the case and study the law around it, sifting through hundreds of documents and databases to find a winning angle. Lawyer and entrepreneur <strong>Andrew Arruda</strong> set out to democratize this process by partnering with a computer scientist to create the world’s first artificially intelligent lawyer, ROSS. Using ROSS, a lawyer can search through millions of documents in a matter of minutes, saving hours of research time. ROSS is already being rolled out, for free, to pro-bono lawyers who are helping those most in need. “Justice should cost the same for everyone,” Arruda says. “More money should not buy better justice.”</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence, knowledge and wisdom … in the age of smart machines.</strong> Artificial intelligence is a next step in the evolution of our species; some say, in fact, we have come to the limits of our own intelligence. But intelligence is only part of the story — it’s what we do with that intelligence that matters. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vsYjKXPcHw">a special video created for TED@IBM</a>, Guruduth Banavar, chief science officer of cognitive computing at IBM, asks us to cultivate the wisdom necessary to improve our future.</p>
<p><strong>An organic approach to an organic problem.</strong> Beset by plunging biodiversity, pathogens and skyrocketing populations, our global food supply is at risk — but solutions that rely on chemicals and genetically modified organisms come with their own problems. Computational geneticist <strong>Laxmi Parida</strong> proposes instead that we use the genetic biodiversity that already exists within plants, wrought over millennia by evolution, in order to safeguard our food. To sort through and make sense of the vast amount of sequenced DNA, artificial intelligence and machine learning don’t quite make the cut. Parida has another technique in mind: discrete mathematics. Using math, Parida is cracking open our understanding of the links between DNA and external traits, like stress resistance, so we can breed more robust crops while reducing strain on the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Building with dust.</strong> The world-changing promise of nanotechnology remains just that — a promise. We don’t yet have the disease-fighting nanobots, elevators to space or quantum computers that nanotech could someday provide. Why? Because building things from nanomaterials is incredibly difficult, says <strong>George Tulevski</strong>, a nano architect and researcher at IBM. We don’t have tools small enough to manipulate nanomaterials into something useful. But Tulevski and his team think they’ve located the missing link: chemistry. They’re developing chemical processes to compel billions of nanoparticles to simultaneously assemble themselves into the patterns needed to build circuits, much the same way that natural organisms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolaria"><em>Radiolaria</em></a> build intricate, diverse and elegant structures. It’s like building a sculpture from dust, Tulevski says, and it may be the key to delivering on — or far exceeding — those original promises of nanotechnology.</p>

<p><strong>One of the most important tools in the fight against cancer? Time.</strong> An early cancer diagnosis can be the difference between a chance to fight for life, or death. But diagnostic tools tend to be costly, invasive and slow to reveal results, and they’re not always totally accurate. Cancer fighter <strong>Joshua Smith</strong> presents an affordable, formidable weapon in the fight against cancer that combats these statistics — a noninvasive early-warning system that works like a pregnancy test by intercepting and analyzing the biomarkers that may hint at the presence of cancer. With this streamlined process, says Smith, early-stage cancer detection can happen more frequently and start when a person is still healthy. It’s a strong beacon of hope in the fight against cancer.</p>

<p><strong>How to cure ailing governments.</strong> In the current political climate, it’s easy to want to give up on transforming government, says cancer researcher <strong>Charity Wayua</strong> — but we can’t afford to be afraid to tackle challenges like government efficiency head-on. Starting in 2014, Wayua, a trained biochemist, and a team of scientists, engineers and technologists began to “treat” the government of Nairobi, Kenya, as an ailing patient in order to restore the health of the country and its economy. In keeping with a biomedical approach, the team examined the government, its divisions, its employees and every single one of its malfunctions before making a diagnosis and devising a strategic treatment plan. Within two years, the efforts of Wayua and her team paid off, and Kenya moved from 136 to 92 on the World Bank’s index ranking the ease of doing business there. As Wayua says, just because something is sick doesn’t mean it’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>Behavior hacks for the well-intentioned.</strong> “Why is it that we have such a difficult time doing what’s right?” asks behavioral scientist <strong>Bob Nease</strong>. “It’s because intention and action don’t often go hand-in-hand.” That is, good intentions don’t always lead to good behavior, while bad behavior is not always the result of bad intentions. So how do we bridge the gap between good intention and positive action? Nease offers two simple mind-hack solutions: first, make the right thing <em>so</em> easy to do that it requires minimal mind power to arrive at a good decision. Then make the wrong thing so drawn out and convoluted that it’s nearly impossible to justify doing. Nease applies these principles to current issues surrounding health, business and even government reform.</p>
<p><strong>The drumming habits of neurons.</strong> In March 1993, an article published in the journal <em>Cell</em> identified the single gene responsible for Huntingon’s disease. The product of a nearly ten-year effort by scientists from around the world, the article held great promise that a cure for the neurodegenerative disorder would soon follow; yet today, there is still not a single medicine able to slow, stop, or reverse this disease. <strong>James Kozloski</strong> has watched a generation of neuroscientists struggle with this, and his conclusion is that neuroscientists have focused far too long on just the neuron. He argues that the answer lies not only in showing how neurons suffer from genetic disorders but also in how genes suffer from nervous disorders. Comparing the communication of neurons to the beat of a drummer, Kozloski highlights that in brains, things like a bad gene, an injury or aging can lead to changes in circuits that first create and then reinforce subtle bad drumming habits, which are often difficult to detect until it’s too late. His team has been working to detect these habits early in order to break them, mapping the brain’s core components and connecting them together in what he calls the Grand Loop. “Before we can fully understand how genes cause imbalance in neurons leading to their death,” he says, “neuroscience must understand how the brain’s core circuitry balances itself, how genes change synapses, and how brain feedback onto neurons, synapses and genes can push imbalance to the tipping point.”</p>
<p><strong>How the internet of things is transforming the routine.</strong> How do we protect our aging population while letting them keep the comfort of their lives and their daily routine? Everyday objects with sensors and WiFi can track each step of that routine and form a picture of a life being lived, in real time, to the children and support systems caring for the safety and independence of their loved ones. Learn more about how the internet of things is changing the routine in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qjf_VuGW7A">another special video produced for TED@IBM</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A library of human cognition.</strong> What if you could consult Winston Churchill on a looming international crisis? Or ask Einstein what he thinks about the latest scientific breakthrough? National security expert <strong>Juliane Gallina</strong> is working on a way to harness the best minds of all time to make the world safer. When Gallina was in the military, she learned a special concept: the OODA loop, a mental model (which stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) designed to help intelligence officers get into the minds of their adversaries. You’re in the OODA loop right now, Gallina says, and every person or team that makes decisions is constantly using it. Today, Gallina is a technologist, and she’s using the OODA loop in her work on cognitive computing. Her goal: to create a way to systematically record the way we think when solving problems so that future generations can better tap into the wisdom of the past. “Let’s find and record the exquisite thinking strategies of innovators and pioneers,” Gallina says, “and then let’s use it.”</p>
<p><strong>The untold story behind a landmark NASA mission.</strong> Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, Mary Jackson — you’ve probably never heard their names, but these three African-American women were instrumental in putting astronaut John Glenn into orbit around Earth. Their story has been largely untold until now with the upcoming release of biographical film <em>Hidden Figures</em>. <strong>Elizabeth Gabler,</strong> president of Fox 2000 Pictures, talks with TED@IBM curator Bryn Freedman about what drew her to make film and shares with the audience more about the women from the upcoming film and the barriers they overcame.</p>
<p><strong>No expertise required.</strong> The problem with music, says <strong>Tim Exile</strong>, is that it’s so perfect. For those of us who didn’t grow up playing an instrument, instruments can never be objects of play because we’re often too afraid to mess around and try things out due to a strict idea of what an instrument should sound like. In a talk-performance hybrid, Exile demos a software instrument that he designed to allow anyone, whether they have musical training or not, to record loops, mix sounds and make music. “Apart from anything else,” he says, “this is is a hell of a lot of fun, and we’re all missing out!”</p>

<p><strong>The illusion of intelligence.</strong> When we think about artificial intelligence and its possibilities, it becomes difficult to disassociate the concept with the dangers outlined by films like <em>The Terminator</em> and <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. For supporters like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, such fears are far from misplaced; they and others argue that artificial intelligence represents an existential threat to humanity. But according to <strong>Grady Booch</strong>, super-knowing is not the same as super-doing. Cognitive systems, he argues, are far different from the software-intensive systems of earlier generations, in that, “by and large, we don’t program them: we teach them,” imparting onto those machines reflections of our already-present human values. Rather than worry about any existential threat of superintelligence, Booch cautions us to focus instead on the realities that we currently face, “for the rise of computing already brings to us a myriad of other human and societal issues to which we must attend.” Indeed, from raising the level of education around the world to helping humans eventually reach the surface of Mars, “the right question we should now be asking is how shall we best use this technology to augment our humanity, not diminish it.”</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103453/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103453/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103453&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            A remarkable paper claims that staying off Facebook for a week could make you happier: The Facebook Experiment, by Morten Tromholt of Denmark.





What makes this study so interesting is that it was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and so was able, at least in theory, to determine whether quitting Facebook actually causes changes in well-being. Previously, there has been lots of research reporting correlations between social network use and happiness, but correlation isn't causation.

Public health officials this year, along with <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, convened in Denver, Colorado to discuss these rights at the <a href="http://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association’s</a> (APHA’s) Annual Meeting and Expo which took place from the 29th October to the 2nd November. This year’s theme, “Creating the Healthiest Nation: Ensuring the Right to Health,” brought to the forefront a diverse range of public health issues, including the Zika epidemic, suicide and prescription drug overdose which gained particular attention this year<em>.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Public health approach to suicide prevention</strong></p>
<p>Opening session speakers included Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper who <span class="st"> discussed sexual and reproductive health care, legal marijuana, drug abuse and suicide, which is one of the major challenges facing Colorado considering that it has the seventh highest suicide rate in the nation.<br />
</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8175" style="width: 310px;"><img class="wp-image-8175 size-medium" height="229" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/suicide-300x229.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Suicide in middle aged men is on the rise</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Flickr: Mic445</div></figure>
<p>Alex Crosby, the Branch Chief of the Surveillance Branch of the Division of Violence Prevention in the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, gave an intriguing talk about the CDC’s unique role in suicide prevention. To address the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, the CDC looks at promoting individual, family and community connectedness in order to prevent suicidal behavior. It has also helped produce a common language to facilitate identifying and monitoring such behavior.</p>
<p>A new CDC report has shown that overall suicide rates in middle aged men aged 45-64 has increased by 43 percent in the last 15 years compared to overall suicide rates which rose 24 percent. There doesn’t seem to be one cause that can explain this spike but there is likely a convergence of multiple factors within middle aged men that makes them especially vulnerable. The CDC have made it a priority to fund programs looking into suicide behavior in this group further.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stigma and taboo surrounding suicide means that funding is affected. Jarrod Hindman, Director of the Suicide Prevention Center in Denver, explained that, in the last 10 years, federal funding has been invested in research on leading causes of death such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, and prostate cancer. Major progress has led to decreased mortality rates and so it’s time the same is done with suicide where death rates are on the rise.</p>
<p><strong>Prescription drug overdose</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8174" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="The number of pain relievers prescribed in the US has skyrocketed" class="size-medium wp-image-8174" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/drugs-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The number of pain relievers prescribed in the US has skyrocketed</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Flickr: frankieleon
</div></figure>
<p>In his opening speech, Governor John Hickenlooper also discussed drug abuse and proudly announced that Colorado had expanded access to naloxone, which reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, noting that he learned how to administer the medicine and carries a dose of it in his state trooper’s vehicle in case he encounters someone in need.</p>
<p>Availability of prescribed drugs, which is the second most abused type of drug in adolescents following marijuana, can be an important determinant of suicidal behavior. Opioids, CNS depressants for anxiety and sleep disorders and stimulants often prescribed for ADHD are the classes most commonly abused. An astonishing 2.4 million Americans have used prescription drugs non medically for the first time within the last year and an estimated 52 million people have used these drugs for non medical reasons at least once in their lifetime. Mian Hossein, a Professor at Morgan State University, discussed the mental health consequences of nonmedical prescription drug use among youths aged 12-17 in the United States. His research, which uses data from 176,200 youths over a period of 10 years documents a relationship between the use of nonmedical prescription drugs and major depressive episodes in this group.</p>
<p><strong>A public health emergency – the Zika virus</strong></p>
<p>As concerns about the spread of the Zika virus continue to grow, APHA is one of 11 national organizations funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support and disseminate evidence based approaches for preventing and controlling the spread of the virus.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8173" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Aedes aegypti mosquito" class="size-medium wp-image-8173" height="202" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/mosquito-300x202.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Flickr: Sanofi Pasteur</div></figure>
<p>A special session organized at the conference discussed staging a multisectoral and epidemiological approach to the emergent threat of the virus. Lyle Petersen, Director of the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), spoke about the virus’ presence in the United States. He explained that, as there was no previous experience with the virus in the western hemisphere, diseases such as Dengue Fever and Chikungunya had to be looked at to give an idea of how the virus might spread.</p>
<p>Zika prevention strategies currently include vector control, warnings against travel for pregnant women, blood donor screening and providing access to contraceptives. However, there is still a lot which is not known regarding other possible modes of transmission, what the duration and magnitude of risk is in sexual transmission of the virus as well as what the preconception risk is.</p>
<p><strong>APHA 2017</strong></p>
<p>We left APHA this year with an encouraging message from Governor John Hickenlooper to the thousands of public health practitioners attending this year: <strong>“You guys are gonna save the world.” </strong></p>
<p>We can’t wait to attend next year’s conference in Atlanta where ongoing efforts will be recognized and shared with the goal of achieving healthier communities and health equity globally.</p>

<p>Social power may be an abstract concept, but it has serious, concrete consequences. Certainly for our ancestors, and also for many people today, the ability to identify who is in charge might literally be considered a survival skill, as the boss is often the person controlling the distribution of food and other resources.</p>
<p>It’s already known that even infants expect smaller characters to give way to larger ones – in effect, social power based on physical dominance. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12643/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new paper</a> in <em>Child Development</em> has explored the related question of when and how young children are able to discern social power from more subtle social dynamics between two parties, finding that already by age three children can interpret various forms of social power – resource control, goal achievement, and permission giving – to identify who’s in charge. The setting of social norms (such as what clothing ought to be worn) is recognised as a sign of social power at age 5-6, while perhaps surprisingly, actually giving orders was not recognised as marking social power until age 7–9. <span id="more-13731"></span></p>
<p>Selin Gülgöz and Susan Gelman recruited most of the participating children at a science museum, and they tested them via illustrated vignettes that featured two characters, of equal size and shape, one exerting a form of social power over the other. It was made clear that these characters were the same age as each other, and that they were the same gender as the participant (to control for any assumptions about the social power attached to age and gender); and the characters’ names were chosen to be similar to each other and to convey little meaning. After listening to each story, the children (tested individually) were simply asked to say in each case which character was in charge, and to explain their reasons.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of one of the vignettes, in this case involving “goal achievement”, which 3-year-old’s recognised as a mark of social power, in this case correctly identifying Flip as the boss:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flip and Blip wanted to get dessert. Flip wanted to get ice cream, while Blip wanted to get candy. They could only go to one place. Flip and Blip went to the ice cream store and got ice cream.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s a vignette depicting the setting of social norms by one character over the other (in this case Dizz is the boss), which was identified as a form of social power at age 5-6:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Dizz was telling Fizz and their friends that red is the best color and that from now on everyone should wear red. The next day, Fizz came to school wearing a red t-shirt, just like the one Dizz had been wearing. Fizz told Dizz, ‘Look at my red t-shirt.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, a vignette featuring the giving of orders, not recognised as social power until age 7-9:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rafyy and Zaffy were playing with blocks. Raffy was telling Zaffy what to build. Raffy told Zaffy to build a house, and Zaffy built a house.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall the results from this first study showed that the ability to identity social power begins extremely early in life – at least as early as three years of age – but that it also matures through childhood, taking in new manifestations.</p>
<p>The researchers explained that “giving orders” and “norm setting” may take longer to recognise as expressions of social power because they require an understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic">deontic logic</a> – abstract rules of obligations and permissions – in contrast to goal attainment and resource allocation, which are more concrete expressions of power. The fact that three-year-olds recognised “permission giving” as social power seems to defy this explanation, but the researchers explained that their vignettes may have confounded permission with resource allocation by describing one character giving permission in relation to toys or other resources.</p>
<p>A feature of all the vignettes used in the first study was that social power was used to some extent malevolently, with the powerful person exercising control over their subordinate. In a follow-up study, the researchers tested whether young children also understand social power when used benevolently, for example with one character choosing to give up their own goal to allow the other character to reach theirs. The results showed that children could also recognise benevolent social power, although they found it more difficult than recognising malevolent power (testing of adults on the same vignettes showed that they too found it easier to recognise instances of malevolent power).</p>
<p>Gülgöz and Gelman concluded that “children have an early-emerging and complex understanding of social power across various possible manifestations”. They noted that the children they tested were from middle class backgrounds, and that it would be interesting to see whether and how children’s early life experiences, and the culture in which they are raised, affects the way they identify and process different expressions of social power.</p>

            <p>This year marked the <a href="http://liverpool.worldlunghealth.org/">47<sup>th</sup> Union World Conference on Lung Health</a>, held in Liverpool, UK, and <a href="http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em></a> was lucky enough to attend.</p>
<p>The annual conference, run by the <a href="http://www.theunion.org/">International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease</a> (The Union), includes many aspects of lung health; however the main focus is tuberculosis (TB) research, with this year’s theme being ‘Confronting Resistance: Fundamentals to Innovations’.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8163" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Barry Skeates/Flickr" class="wp-image-8163 size-medium" height="156" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/liverpool-300x156.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Barry Skeates/Flickr</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Given the release of the <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/">World Health Organization’s 2016 Global Tuberculosis Report</a> which showed a sizable increase in deaths due to tuberculosis (due to improved reporting of cases) it is clear that much more needs to be done if we are to achieve the <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/post2015_strategy/en/">End TB goals</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of the specific scientific sessions there was a huge effort towards engaging both the patient and local communities. Alongside the <a href="http://liverpool.worldlunghealth.org/programme/community-common">Community Common</a>, which was open to the public, local charities and organizations relevant to the scope of the conference had prominent space to discuss their work and speakers such as <a href="http://liverpool.worldlunghealth.org/updates/plenary-three-social-protection-for-a-more-holistic-approach-to-ending-tb">Amy McConville</a>, a TB survivor,  ensured that the human side to the diseases was not forgotten.</p>
<p>Given the theme of the conference it was not surprising that multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), was a major focus. As well as many insightful talks on new drugs and diagnostics there was also acknowledgment that we could be doing better with the tools we already have. In addition ways to reduce transmission were discussed, such as the use of UV disinfection in a talk by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/edward-nardell/">Edward Nardell</a>, and the upcoming <a href="http://www.impaactnetwork.org/studies/IMPAACT2003B.asp">PHOENIx trial</a> highlighted by <a href="http://www.auruminstitute.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=57:prof-gavin-churchyard&amp;Itemid=126">Gavin Churchyard</a> for investigating reducing household transmission (the primary cause of MDR-TB in children).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8167" style="width: 274px;"><img alt="WHO/http://www.who.int/tb/strategy/en/" class=" wp-image-8167" height="171" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/TB-300x194.jpg" width="264" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">WHO/http://www.who.int/tb/strategy/en/</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>It is clear that in order to reduce TB deaths by 95% and to cut new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035 a huge amount more needs to be done. However we left Liverpool with confidence everything possible will be done by the attendees to meet these targets.</p>

            <img alt="NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Flickr, CC)" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/NASA-Goddard-Space-Flight-Center-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Keeping up one’s physical fitness is a battle for anyone, but trying to stay fit in outer space, where living quarters are cramped and the exercise regimen is rigorous and monotonous, is an extra challenge. Exercise is extremely important during space travel because prolonged weightlessness decreases muscle strength, bone density, and cardiovascular functioning. Motivation and adherence to high intensity exercise, coupled with a socially isolating environment with atypical access to social support, may be compromised. Exercising with a partner can help with motivation, but that is not possible for astronauts where space and exercise equipment is limited. Even using earth-based virtual partners is impractical due to reduced communication and scheduling, especially the further one goes into deep space.</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="feltz_gameshot_5375" class="wp-image-8152 size-medium alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Feltz_gameshot_5375-300x200.jpg" title="D Feltz CC" width="300" />
<p>Our research grant from the National Space Biomedical Research Institute of NASA is exploring the best ways to keep astronauts motivated to exercise when they go on long-duration space flights by using an exercise-video game (exergame) with a software-generated partner–one that is anthropomorphic but clearly artificial and synthetic. Our software-generated partner incorporates group-dynamics principles (behaviors and psychological processes occurring within, or between, social groups), such as upward social comparison and indispensability to group achievement, to address lack of motivation for vigorous physical exercise (i.e., the level of effort).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, we can’t conduct our research with astronauts themselves at this stage, so have recruited men and women, ages 35 to 62 (the average age of an astronaut is 48), who were as physically healthy as astronauts, to test our exergame and software-generated partner.</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="interval-track-male" class="wp-image-8154 size-medium alignleft" height="168" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Interval-Track-Male-300x168.png" title="D Feltz CC" width="300" />
<p>We are using an exergame that involves a stationary bike, where individuals exercise on a variety of bike trails with or without a software-generated partner, under high-intensity interval training conditions. The partner is programmed to be slightly superior to the exerciser (upward social comparison) and to be a teammate, where the team score (exercise effort) is based on the weaker partner, thus creating a sense of value and indispensability (not letting the partner down) for the exerciser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been testing various features of the game and different versions of the partner to see what works best to keep participating exercisers motivated to give their best efforts while exercising at vigorous intensities 6 days per week over a 6-month time period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While this research is important for astronauts, it also has practical applications for those of us who remain earth-bound. Interpersonal and social concerns (for comparing favorably with others or for not letting a partner down) have the potential to add powerful sources of motivation to exercise. These sources of motivation could open up a set of new tools in exergame design for fitness, especially for those with social physique anxiety, those who lack the time and/or resources to join an exercise group, and those in exercise rehabilitation therapies. None of the existing exercise games currently on the market incorporate the critical design features suggested by contemporary social psychological research, particularly research on motivation gains in task groups (namely immediate feedback on performance of one or more other players, the ability to control the discrepancy in abilities of players, and most importantly, the indispensability of individual player effort for determining group outcomes). Thus, our research has the potential for earth-based commercial applications to build more engaging and enjoyable exercise video games for various populations.</p>

<p>Are we more likely to remember the good or the bad done by people on our team? In general, we favour our own group over outsiders, classically demonstrated by Henri Tajfel’s “minimal group” experiments, in which sorting people into groups by something as arbitrary as a coin toss resulted in higher positive ratings of traits of in-group members, and more negativity towards out-group members. You might expect, then, that we’re disposed to remember our colleagues’ good behavior. But <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716301913">new research</a> in <em>Cognition</em> shows us that the opposite is true.</p>
<p><span id="more-13705"></span></p>
<p>Stefanie Hechler and her colleagues from the University of Jena began by asking 132 students to complete a perception task that pretended to sort them into two groups – “figure-perceivers” or “ground-perceivers” – an arbitrary distinction that meant little in the real world but gave them a team colour to identify with. Participants then viewed 36 photos each showing a person’s face against a background of either their team colour or the rival colour, revealing which individuals were in-group members. Each photo came with a character description, one third being neutral, one third showing how cooperative they were, and a third showing uncooperativeness, such as: “KP is a gas station attendant. He fleeces inattentive drivers of their change.”</p>
<p>During this task, participants thought their job was simply to rate the likability of each individual. However, shortly after viewing the photos, participants were given a surprise memory test where they had to distinguish previously seen faces from new ones, and judge whether they thought the face was associated with good, bad or neutral behaviour – guessing when necessary.</p>
<p>Faces of cooperative and uncooperative individuals alike were better remembered than neutral ones, and their behaviour was less likely to be confused than for neutral individuals, who clearly made less of an impression. In the out-group, correctly identifying the behaviour of nice and nasty individuals stood at similarly high rates. But within the in-group, the individuals who stuck most in mind were the miscreants, those whose behaviour was uncooperative and harmful to others. When it comes to your team, what really sticks in the mind is infamy.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this finding we can see it make sense: unless we’ve been very unlucky in the past, we expect that the people around us will cooperate and go along with social norms, and any behaviour that violates our expectations is generally better remembered. And to ignore this has a great cost: in-group members tend to be the people we mix with, rely upon, and let our guard down around. An untrustworthy in-group member is like a broken stair in your building: you need to keep that fact in mind, or you’re going to sprain your ankle – or worse. Meanwhile, it’s not so important to have the specifics of who in the out-group is bad because you’re not planning to be vulnerable to them anyway.</p>
<p>But this story has a further twist. Using data modeling that allowed them to distinguish when participants were guessing as opposed to making confident identifications, the researchers found that when participants were guessing about at an out-group member’s character, they were as likely to see them as uncooperative as cooperative. However, guesses about in-group members showed a positivity bias: for instance, participants were more likely to guess that a neutral in-group member was cooperative than uncooperative. Paradoxically, we have a general sense our team is more cooperative, even though we recall proportionately more instances of specific bad behaviour by group members.</p>
<p>Eating your cake and still having it is an impressive feat, but on the strength of this evidence, our minds can pull it off. Recording high-resolution images of risky in-group members, but still viewing the group as a whole in a flattering soft-focus, we keep ourselves feeling safe and feeling good.</p>
<p>Committing an uncooperative act in a work or social group is high risk precisely because once detected, it flips us from one category to the other, from presumed innocent to certainly guilty. Of course, as an in-group member, we can always hope that our particular sin is forgotten, and we can quietly migrate back to a state where our colleagues assume the best of us.</p>

            <p>Reducing bit error rate and improving performance of modern coherent optical communication system is a significant issue. As the distance travelled by the information signal increases, bit error rate will degrade. Support Vector Machines are the most up to date machine learning method for error correction in optical transmission systems. Wavelet transform has been a popular method to signals processing. In this study, the properties of most used Haar and Daubechies wavelets are implemented for signals correction. Our results show that the bit error rate can be improved by using classification based on wavelet transforms (WT) and support vector machine (SVM).</p>

<p>When planning my SfN itinerary, the amazing <a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071" target="_blank">meeting planner</a> helped me identify plenty of sessions and presentations that sound really interesting. Here, I’d like to share some of my favorites with you. If you, like me, are interested in psychiatry, neuroimaging, developmental disorders, adolescent development, or early stress and adversity, the following presentations may be worth attending:</p>
<p><em>388.05. <strong>Rewarded approach of threatening spiders engages areas of the mesolimbic dopamine system</strong> (F. Ahs) Monday 2-2.15pm @SDCC2</em></p>
<p>Professionally, I’d love to learn more about dopaminergic modulation of fear; personally, however, I’m terribly afraid of spiders, to put it mildly. My ambivalence is probably very similar to what the brave arachnophobic volunteers in Ahs’ study felt while in the MRI scanner, as they were invited to view spider pictures for money. To be totally honest: at the moment of writing, I haven’t yet decided whether I’ll go see the spider presentation or not. Follow my blog over the next few days to see which was stronger: fear or curiosity.</p>
<p><em>662. <strong>The social brain in human adolescence</strong> (S-J. Blakemore). Wednesday 11.30am-12.40pm @SDCC Ballroom 20</em></p>
<p>It’s intriguing how children inevitably grow up, change, struggle, learn, adapt, experiment, get confused and then refocus. The majority of mental illnesses surface before the age of 24, with adolescence as a major high-risk period. I’m looking forward to the presentation of professor Blakemore, arguably a leading expert in the field and a great speaker.</p>
<p><em> </em><em>772.06. <strong>Early adversity affects amygdala-cortical functional connectivity: links to adversity and gut microbial community structure</strong>. (B.L. Callaghan) Wednesday 2.15-2.30pm @SDCC5B</em></p>
<p>The brain is pretty cool, but luckily it’s not the only organ we have. The more I learn about neuroscience, the more I realize that all organs should be treated with equal respect. Seeing work such as that of Callaghan et al., I can’t help but think that the current neuroscience craze may simply be another symptom of society’s irrational belief in the rationality of human behaviors. Are we, neuroscientists, guilty of tunnel vision? Or worse, have we been staring at the wrong organ? You’ll definitely find me attending this presentation!</p>
<p><em>PDW13. <strong>How to Present Science Using Visual Tools</strong> (workshop). Monday 9-11am @SDCC30C</em></p>
<p>“A picture is worth a thousand words”. That is, a good picture. A thousand words! Imagine having one thousand <em>extra</em> words for that paper you’ve been trying to shorten in order to meet the journal’s word count, and you’ll understand my excitement about this workshop. In addition, good visuals are very helpful when explaining our findings to audiences that have not read our papers, and are not necessarily planning to do so. Sleek visuals will make you stand out from the crowd. In this workshop on Monday morning, experienced speakers will share their tips, tricks, and tools to create attractive visuals. I’m looking forward to learning about new tools to communicate my science and engage my audience!</p>

<p>In the recent past, there has been a great divide between the sciences and arts. However, recent studies are uncovering the connections between science and art and their importance to healthy and productive lives. It seems the Renaissance women and men were onto something! With the rise of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) as well as art and music therapy, scientists, clinicians, educators, and society are beginning to realize the importance of both disciplines working together to improve health and education. As someone who is both a musician and neuroscientist in training, I am thrilled that both disciplines are gaining national attention and being represented on such a high-level platform such as Society for Neuroscience!</p>
<p>There are two opportunities to learn about and discuss neuroscience and the arts:</p>
<p>On <strong>Sunday, November 13</strong> from 8:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., a symposium titled <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4071/session/111" target="_blank"><em>Neuroscience of Music: Novel Discoveries and Their Implications in the Understanding of Music and the Brain</em></a></strong> will discuss the implications and importance of the neuroscience of music for the discussion of new, thought-provoking ideas. Experts in the areas of neuroscience and music include Dr. John Iversen, Dr. Nina Kraus, Dr. Daniel Levitin, and Dr. Elizabeth Stegemöller, who will speak on topics including music and neuroplasticity, music and neurochemistry, and the biology of auditory learning.</p>
<p>On <strong>Tuesday, November 15</strong> from 3:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M., an advocacy forum open to the public titled <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4071/session/847" target="_blank"><em>Art, Music, and the Brain: How the Arts Influence Us from Youth to Maturity</em></a></strong> will tackle the role and influence of art and science in human creativity, productivity, and health. The panel will consist of neuroscientists, artists, and educators including Dr. Kenneth Elpus, Dr. Ping Ho, Dr. Nina Kraus, Dr. Daniel Levitin, and Dr. Bill Martin.</p>
<p>As Einstein once said: “All religions, arts, and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man’s life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom” (<em>Out of My Later Years)</em>. So, make your way to each of these sessions to learn from these leading experts about the role of the arts not only in the neurohealth and neuroeducation of society but also in the enrichment of your own life. I hope to see you there!</p>

Among other conditions, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gherig’s disease) and frontotemporal dementia ravage the cognitive and motor functions of their victims. While these diseases have unique genetic or environmental origins, they have one common neuropathological signature: aberrant accumulation of proteins – such as amyloid-β, tau, α-synuclein, huntingtin or SOD1. Because of this commonality, immunotherapy–by targeting the proteins implicated in disease onset and progression–is a promising candidate for treating a host of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>On <strong>Wednesday, November 16</strong> at the 2016 Society for Neuroscience conference, Dr. Eliezer Masliah, of the National Institutes of Health, will present the latest research on the use of immunotherapy for various neurodegenerative diseases, in his talk <strong><a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/session/137" target="_blank"><em>Capturing Immune Responses to Understand and Treat Neurodegenerative Disease</em></a></strong>. In this Q&amp;A, Dr Masliah explains the state of immunotherapy for neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: Why do immunotherapies hold more promise for treating neurodegenerative disease than other treatments? How have clinical trials so far supported their efficacy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: The advantage of immunotherapy is that it can work via several mechanisms and can be very specific. Multiple mechanisms of action include blocking propagation, targeting oligomers, modulating immune responses, reducing toxicity, reducing inflammation, stimulating clearance, lysosomal clearance autophagy pathways, etc. Recent anti-amyloid phase III trials show some promise in post-hoc analysis. Synuclein immunotherapy has been shown to be safe and early preliminary studies show promise.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: What are the main challenges that immunotherapies face?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: Most recent studies have shown that new approaches are safer and more specific. Potential challenges are cost in particular with passive immunotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: Do you expect that immunotherapies would be as effective against intracellularly accumulating proteins as against extracellular proteins? For example, would a tau or α-synuclein antibody be as effective as an amyloid-β antibody?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: Yes, there is extensive evidence that antibodies enter cells and target abnormal intracellular proteins; however, it is worth noting that most proteins such as amyloid-β, tau synuclein, are actually secreted and propagate from cell to cell. There are many opportunities and mechanisms for antibodies to target abnormal aggregated proteins. In fact, the more toxic forms might be those secreted.</p>
<p><strong>ER</strong>: There is uncertainty as to whether preventing protein accumulation can stop progression of some neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, some trials that effectively lower amyloid-β levels have failed to show cognitive effects. Are there certain diseases, which we are confident are in fact caused by toxic protein accumulation, that may be better targets for immunotherapy than others?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Masliah</strong>: The trials you refer to were in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease that for practical purposes represent full blown disease, not good examples. Primary and secondary prevention trials such as A4, DIAN-TU and others are underway in patients with pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment. Results won’t be known for a few more years.</p>

            <p>Brain dynamics emerge from the collective and orchestrated activity of single neurons. The main characteristics of neurons are their morphologically elaborate structures to receive and integrate inputs (i.e., the dendrites) and communicate their signal to other neurons (i.e., the axons). Because dendrites receive, integrate and transform inputs into relevant output they can be considered as the functional workhorses of the brain.</p>
<p>In this presentation, I’ll outline the problematic relation between dendrite structure and function in neurons. Then I’ll show how highly non-trivial processing can take place in neurons due to the spatial extend of dendrites. Lastly, I will present my current work on distilling the essence of dendritic computations using simplified models.</p>

<p>This fall, TED welcomes Colin Helms as its Head of Media. In this leadership team role, Colin will oversee strategy and operations of TED’s core media business, including video production, new format development, distribution, social media, mobile and design.</p>
<p>Colin brings more than 20 years of experience in both digital and traditional media content strategy and platform development. Prior to joining TED’s New York office, he was the SVP of Connected Content at MTV, where he oversaw the brand’s digital evolution from broadband video and social media to its pioneering multi-screen programming and original digital content studio. Before that, he served as a founding editor of <em>Complex</em> magazine as well as the editor-in-chief of the music magazine and festival CMJ.</p>
<p>“It’s more important than ever to give ‘ideas worth spreading’ their greatest potential audience,” said TED curator Chris Anderson. “Colin’s expertise navigating today’s media landscape—at once vast and unpredictable—will help us expand that mission into an exciting new future.”</p>
<p>“My team’s challenge is to make TED available and relevant to audiences we haven’t reached yet,” Colin says. “Media behaviors and habits vary depending on so many factors — geography, economics, cultural norms, you name it — and our job is to meet these audiences where they already are. That means online, yes, but it could also mean TV, radio, and a very broad variety of other content platforms. I’m excited to help TED become a part of millions more people’s media habits.”</p>

            <p>The prevalence and functional effects of depressive disorder following traumatic brain injury are significant. Now, sertraline may be effective for preventing depressive symptoms after TBI.</p>
<p>A group of researchers at Baylor College of Medicine evaluated 94 patients aged 18 to 85 years who had been hospitalized for mild, moderate, or severe <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/04/01/traumatic-brain-injury-can-deep-sleep-be-neuroprotective/">traumatic brain injury</a> (TBI). Most of the patients (n=92) were Caucasian and more than half (n=56) were male. The research team randomized the patients to receive either 100 mg daily of sertraline (48 patients) or placebo (46 patients) for 24 weeks or until symptoms of a mood disorder occurred.</p>
<p>Overall, sertraline was effective at preventing the onset of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/06/brooding-buddies-co-complaining-linked-with-depression-and-anxiety/">depressive symptoms</a> compared to placebo. Sertraline was also well tolerated  and adverse effects in both treatment groups were mild. It is unclear how long the effects of sertraline last in this patient group.</p>
<p>The incidence of TBI is rising and it now is a major cause of death and disability. TBI can occur from injury, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/05/shift-work-linked-with-risk-of-severe-stroke/">stroke</a>, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and violence. People suffering moderate to severe TBI are at risk for depression and loss of life roles. Life satisfaction declines in this population, so prevention of depressive symptoms is imperative for maintaining health and function.</p>
<p>Sertraline, an antidepressant, has been used to treat PTSD but its effects in TBI are still being defined. The results of the study, which were published in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>, need to be confirmed with larger sample sizes and in multicenter trials. Further, a question remains if combining sertraline with cognitive behavioral interventions will optimize long-term outcomes.</p>

            Do you find gruyère gross? Are you repelled by roquefort?



Neuroscientists are now investigating why this might be. A new paper claims to reveal The Neural Bases of Disgust for Cheese.

French (heh) researchers Jean-Pierre Royet and colleagues used fMRI to scan 15 people who liked cheese and 15 who "hated" it. During the scan, the participants were shown images of cheese and were exposed to cheese odors.

The six neuro-cheeses were blue cheese, cheddar, goat cheese, gruyère, parmesan,

When a species shows a very small census size (e.g. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099941">blue-throated macaws</a>), it is obvious that it is threatened and that urgent conservation measures are needed to preserve it. However, there are stunning examples in which a species can go from billions of individuals to vanishing, within a human lifetime.</p>
<p>Understanding how an abundant species can suddenly disappear is tricky. However, there are certain factors to watch out for. Factors that when combined at the right time and place can cause these “unexpected” extinctions. One paradigmatic example is the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/29/10636.full">passenger pigeon (<em>Ectopictes migratorious</em>)</a>. The passenger pigeon was an abundant species (2-5 billion individuals) that became extinct in blink of an eye. What caused such a drastic event? Two main identified factors were: that the species was going through the shrinking stage of its naturally oscillating demography and this coincided with a strong hunting pressures imposed by humans.</p>
<p>What can we learn from the passenger pigeon? Are the factors that led to its disappearance generalizable to other taxa? It seems that there are intrinsic factors that make certain species more sensitive to extinction, for example the tendency to undergo drastic <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215004005">demographic oscillations</a>. On the other hand, there are also extrinsic factors, like those imposed by humans (e.g. hunting, environmental degradation).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when comparing the current situation of the European turtle dove with that of the passenger pigeon, there are many similarities that could push the former in the direction of its less fortunate cousin. The European turtle dove is an abundant species (6-10 millions individuals). However its numbers have been decreasing, leading to its classification as vulnerable to extinction (<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22690419/0">IUCN red list</a>). In the United Kingdom alone it has shown a 97% decline in 40 years. The main reasons for this decline are habitat degradation and game hunting. Moreover, our genomic analysis suggests that the species has a naturally fluctuating demographic history, and that it is currently going thorough a shrinking stage…</p>
<p>Is there something we can do to prevent history from repeating itself? We can first learn from recent history, and continue to emphasize the importance of using cutting edge tools (such as genomics and niche modeling techniques) to help understand the population genetic structure and demographic history of species. This kind of research is valuable, not only because it helps understand evolutionary processes, but also because it provides useful information for researchers involved in the creation of international <a href="http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/life-eurosap">cooperation networks</a> for the protection of species and their natural environments. With this kind of research we can transform the unexpected into expected, and that is a very important first step towards conservation.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">by <a href="http://brainblogger.com">Brain Blogger</a> on November 06, 2016 01:09 PM.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>During the prenatal period, the fetus begins to form one of the most complex structures in nature, the human brain. This process is called neural embryogenesis and it represents one of the most complicated processes in prenatal life. The process relies on the tight regulation of behavior of the cells that will make up the brain. Neuronal stem cells (NSC) play a key role in embryonic brain development.</p>
<p>NSCs need a special environment in order to be able to carry out their function in neural embryogenesis, the creation of new cells to populate the nervous system. However, in some cases, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/04/20/preteens-feel-the-effects-of-moms-pregnancy-bad-habits/">harmful environmental exposure</a> can result in abnormal NSC behavior. Prenatal exposure to lead is one of these harmful influences that may overwhelm the NSCs’ mechanisms of coping with cellular damage. As a result, NSC-regulated processes in neural embryogenesis may become affected, often leading to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>Upon fertilization, from a single cell, a mass of cells is formed and later this mass divides into several layers from which all structures of the human body originate. This is also the case for the central nervous system. It derives from one of the layers that forms the neural tube, the precursor to the brain, brainstem, and the spinal cord. Initially, the neural tube is rather small, but due to the creation of new cells from NSCs it gradually enlarges. Later, the cells in the neural tube get specialized to different functions by changing their cellular and biochemical characteristics. Evidently, if something goes wrong at any of these steps, developmental brain abnormalities may occur.</p>
<p>Lead has been a part of human civilization for a long period of time. However, only recently has the mechanisms by which lead causes negative health effects began to emerge. Lead is particularly harmful to NSCs, even when the exposure is minimal. Very minimal <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/10/06/new-report-on-the-use-of-antidepressants-during-pregnancy/">prenatal exposure</a> to lead has been linked to lower IQ, aggressiveness, and other problems. Research studies have also shown that prenatal exposure to lead produces more harm than exposure during the postnatal period. These findings have been linked to the mechanisms behind cellular injury of NSCs by lead. The proposed mechanisms affect essential cellular functions that result in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations in DNA methylation.</p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/09/05/could-targeting-mitochondria-be-the-key-to-treating-psychosis/">Reactive oxygen species</a> are molecules that are naturally occurring as a result of cellular respiration. However, during pathologic conditions their levels can increase substantially. Chronic lead intoxication results in the increase of ROS through several mechanisms. Among them, there is a direct effect of lead ions on the proteins that regulate ROS levels. Additionally, lead can increase the level of ROS indirectly through interaction with aminolevulinic acid, a biochemical precursor for the components of hemoglobin. ROS can damage various structures in the cell and while doing this, create even more ROS. Additionally, ROS are involved in cellular death signalling and other cellular responses.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms regulating <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/11/epigenetics-and-its-major-influence-on-life/">gene expression</a>, and the regulation of gene expression is one of the bases of cellular differentiation. It has been shown that exposure to lead results in the alteration of DNA methylation, which in turn is associated with the inhibition of NSCs differentiation. Through mechanisms that are not yet known, lead causes changes in the methylation patterns close to genes strongly associated with neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p>Cells do not remain passive during these processes. Like other cells, NSCs have mechanism by which they counteract many of these harmful events. One the most recent investigation has studied the process involving the protein Nrf2.</p>
<p>Nrf2 has been directly linked to NSC’s protective mechanism against oxidative stress caused by exposure to lead.  Nrf2 is associated with protein KEAP1 in the cytoplasm. When the levels of ROS increases, Nrf2 separates from the KEAP1, migrates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA regions called antioxidant response elements (AREs). Upon Nrf2 binding, AREs activate expression of its target genes that code for diverse proteins responsible for cellular ROS detoxification.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new Nrf2 target, SPP1 protein, has been recently identified. SPP1 has particular significance in the lesion of NSC because it has been associated with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/31/nurturing-the-brain-part-9-blueberries/">neuroprotective properties</a> through <em>in vitro</em> studies and through the association of mutations in its coding gene sequence with neurological diseases. These effects are the result of the signalling mechanism involving an anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative process. The process results in compensatory responses to lead inhibition of NSCs proliferation. As a result, SPP1 has been proposed as a protective mediator of neurotoxicity in lead exposure.</p>
<p>Many diseases result from excessive cellular damage that cells are not able to adapt to. This is the case for NSCs where essential neurodevelopmental processes can be altered by lead toxicity. Although NSCs are equipped with protective mechanisms, they are often not powerful enough to counteract the harmful environmental influences. In such cases, the alterations of neural embryogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation take place.  Specific changes leading to particular neurological manifestations still remain to be investigated in detail.</p>
<p>Our improved understanding of the harmful effect of lead on prenatal neurodevelopment calls for increased attention to avoid the exposure of future mothers to this toxic element. It is believed that millions of pregnant women around the world are regularly exposed to high concentrations of lead in food and drinking water. This often affects the health of the younger generation in many countries around the world.</p>

            "You shouldn’t blame lying on the brain", according to Prof. Richard Gunderman writing in The Conversation.



Gunderman notes the media interest in a recent paper about how brain activity 'adapts' to lying. CNN, for instance, covered the study with the headline: "Lying may be your brain's fault, honestly". Gunderman doesn't like this idea:
There is the suggestion that a behavior such as lying can be explained "mechanistically." Saying so implies the brain is a mechanism that can be account

<h3><strong>Reflections on Open Science at PLOS</strong></h3>
<p>PLOS has proven that making quality research openly available for anyone to read, download and reuse is a viable business model. Our collaborative efforts with like-minded organizations have inspired others – from individual researchers to the larger publishing industry – to move toward a more open ethos. In this environment, Open Access is no longer constrained to free access to research, it’s also about <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/02/10/zika-emergency-puts-open-data-policies-to-the-test/" target="_blank">open data and a more open way of working together</a></strong>. Examples of this at PLOS include our pioneering a <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank">forward-thinking data policy</a></strong> at scale and contributions to the community-developed open-standard <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" target="_blank">taxonomy of contributions</a></strong> – the CRediT Project – that provides specific and comprehensive attribution on research articles for all who participate in generating a published work.</p>
<p>We are proud to be <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/01/author-credit-plos-orcid-update/" target="_blank">Open in Action collaborators</a></strong> with other publishers including The Royal Society, <em>eLife</em>, Science journals and EMBO Press in making a <strong><a href="http://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter" target="_blank">public commitment</a></strong> to implement persistent identifiers such as <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">ORCID iDs</a></strong> by year end. These iDs enable researchers to receive credit for a wide range of research outputs in addition to publications (for example blog posts at PLOS) and we are well on the way to meeting this goal. With <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/" target="_blank">many of these same collaborators</a></strong> (The Royal Society, <em>eLife</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>EMBO Journal,</em> <em>Nature </em>and Professor of Structural Biology Stephen Curry and Associate Professor of Information Science Vincent Larivière) we committed to publish citation distributions of our journals to demonstrate a key flaw with impact factors—they simply do not reflect article citation rates. In publishing this data, PLOS hopes to “strengthen a call for action originally voiced by Stephen Curry, one of the authors, and to encourage other journals to follow suit.” The original <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/05/062109" target="_blank">paper and dataset are posted on bioRxiv</a></strong> for all to access.</p>
<h3><strong>Open Policies and Open Research</strong></h3>
<p>Data sharing and Open Access are a matter of course for PLOS authors, providing open and rapid dissemination of their original research in all areas of science. PLOS supports authors who wish to share early versions of their research manuscripts to receive feedback before – or in parallel to – formal peer review, and <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/" target="_blank">encourages researchers to share via preprint servers</a></strong> either before or after submission to a PLOS journal. PLOS has a long-standing policy of accepting manuscripts previously posted to preprint servers, however we have eased the process for authors for this rapid dissemination vehicle that also brings transparency to the review process. Authors can now use bioRxiv’s <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript" target="_blank">direct transfer to journal service drop-down menu</a></strong> to submit directly to PLOS.</p>
<p>We have exemplified Open in Action as the first publisher to react to the Zika outbreak with a Call for Research and <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/zika" target="_blank">The Zika Collection</a></strong>. This placed PLOS on the map for rapid dissemination and discovery of results during the outbreak. As a result, work of authors who published with PLOS caught the attention of legislators: The US Capitol called PLOS to ask for additional information regarding the <strong><a href="http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Currents: Outbreaks</em></a></strong> article, “<strong><a href="http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/travel-volume-to-the-united-states-from-countries-and-u-s-territories-with-local-zika-virus-transmission/" target="_blank">Travel Volume to the United States from Countries and U.S. Territories with Local Zika Virus Transmission</a></strong>” as they were considering this information for use in upcoming legislation.</p>
<p>The practical impact of Open Access and open data may not always be immediate. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (<strong><a href="https://www.iucn.org/" target="_blank">IUCN</a></strong>), publishers of the <strong><a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a></strong>, voted in September 2016 to adopt the <strong><a href="https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/014" target="_blank">Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa</a></strong> (EICAT) for classifying invasive species, work originally <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001850" target="_blank">published in <em>PLOS Biology</em></a></strong> in 2014. Author Tim Blackburn stated “IUCN has approved the motion on our method for classifying alien species impacts…The adopted text requires a consultation before EICAT becomes an IUCN standard… [but] it is an extremely positive development… Getting the paper published somewhere so high profile (and open) really made a difference, so thank you!”</p>
<p>Actionable knowledge on an international scale extends beyond conservation efforts to inform human health and disease initiatives. The <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/ferg2015" target="_blank">WHO Estimates of Foodborne Disease Collection</a></strong> reports the first estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) <strong><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/242847" target="_blank">Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group</a></strong> of the incidence, mortality and disease burden caused by 31 foodborne hazards. Outcomes reported in the Collection – from PLOS, WHO and <strong><a href="https://f1000research.com/browse" target="_blank"><em>F1000Research</em></a></strong> authors – can contribute to improvements in food safety throughout the food chain when incorporated into policy development at regional, national and international levels.</p>
<p>If you choose to be Open in Action with PLOS, you can also have a bit of intellectual fun. The <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleocomm/" target="_blank">PLOS Paleo Community</a></strong> held a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleocomm/2016/09/14/vote-for-the-top-10-open-access-fossil-vertebrates-of-2016/" target="_blank">competition</a></strong> for the paleontology research community for the <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/paleo-top-ten" target="_blank">Top 10 Open Access Fossil Vertebrates</a></strong> of the year, to honor researchers that have thought long and worked hard to provide our community quality research that is openly available to all. Articles represent the vertebrate diversity published in Open Access journals, from <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a></strong> to <strong><a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2027/" target="_blank"><em>PeerJ</em></a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/5/e1501659.full" target="_blank"><em>Science Advances</em></a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2016/1490-new-marsupial-lion" target="_blank"><em>Paleontologia Electronica</em></a></strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Encouraging the Next Generation of Open</strong></h3>
<p>PLOS supports the growth of <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/" target="_blank">Early Career Researchers</a></strong> (ECRs) as they build skills in science communication, become champions of Open Science and develop into ambassadors of change for a future where all research is freely available, all work is evaluated fairly and all members of the scientific community have opportunity to participate in the dialogue of and about science. To support the efforts of ECRs, we are continuing to offer our Early Career Researcher Travel Award (ECRTA) program, launched in 2015. For its first round in 2016, applicants were asked to describe characteristics of the optimal peer review process and how they might build this in a way that makes science more transparent and research more rapidly available. <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2016/07/16/ecrawards1/" target="_blank">Winners were profiled</a></strong> and we’ve now completed a second award round asking what ECRs consider to be the value of a preprint server and how its broad adoption might benefit the scientific community and society.</p>
<p>As a participant in <strong><a href="http://www.opencon2016.org/" target="_blank">OpenCon 2016</a></strong>, a conference focused on educating and empowering the next generation in the areas of Open Access, Open Education and Open Data, PLOS will have the opportunity to hear directly from participants regarding their desires and concerns for the future of science communication. In a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtiyYK1U-Vs" target="_blank">video welcoming address</a></strong>, Publisher Louise Page acknowledges the inspiration provided by this annual gathering of Open Science thinkers and presents highlights of the past year at PLOS that reflect how the organization is Open in Action.</p>

<p>A new <em>BMC Plant Biology</em> article describes a valuable new tool to study plant cell walls and glycobiology. Glycans are carbohydrate molecules that attach to plant cell walls and proteins, and serve critical regulatory functions in development, cell-cell communication and immunity. The inability to directly label and image endogenous plant glycans with fluorescent tags has thus far hindered study of these molecules and their function in cellular processes. However, the copper-free click chemistry approach from Hoogenboom et al (2016) offers a novel method to fluorescently label plant glycans with high specificity and low toxicity.</p>

<p>Galactic cosmic rays are a significant source of high-energy radiation and may pose a health hazard to those involved in deep space missions. <sup>56</sup>Fe ions, a component of such rays, have previously been shown to affect memory in juvenile mice, though the mechanisms underlying such effects were unclear. In this study published in <em>BMC Genomics</em>, the authors investigated the effects of <sup>56</sup>Fe ion radiation on the cognitive function of 6-month old mice. Radiation exposure resulted in behavioral changes that were correlated to epigenetic remodeling within the hippocampus, highlighting the need for further investigations on the different types of irradiation that astronauts will encounter.</p>

<p>Physical activity is often recommended to men diagnosed with prostate cancer, in order to counteract the side effects that treatments often have on their quality of life. Whilst previous trials to promote physical activity in men have been hampered by short follow-up periods and the clinical settings, it is hoped that the study protocol published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> will provide some empirical data obtained in a real-world setting. In this trial, participation in community-based football (soccer) forms the basis in which to assess the effectiveness such activities have on health promotion and in promoting long-term physical activity. The study is expected to be completed by November 2017, so watch this space!</p>

<p>There is now growing evidence that there are some modifiable risk factors that affect the onset of dementia: “diabetes, midlife hypertension and obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity, and low educational attainment”. However, as yet, little is known about the effects that environmental risk factors may have on dementia. In this systematic review, it would appear that there is moderate evidence that dementia risk may be affected by air pollution, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields amongst other factors.</p>

<p>Due to evolutionary pressures in mammals, it is a general pattern that males are often larger than their female counterparts, both in body size and mass. However, this isn’t often the case in tree and flying squirrels. New research using data collected over 22 years seems to support this idea in Siberian flying squirrels, which has shown that females were generally larger than males throughout the year.</p>

<p>DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) and MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) are important molecules that can trigger innate immune responses in both plants and animals. This <em>BMC Plant Biology</em> mini-review from Hyong Woo Choi and Daniel F. Klessig of Cornell University provides an excellent overview of this ancient and highly conserved immune system, in addition to discussing the newly discovered NAMPs, which are molecules specifically associated with immune defence against nematode infection in plant species.</p>

<p>A hurdle in species conservation that often has to be overcome is in understanding the population structure and the patterns within it. A study in the sub-Antarctic has found that there is very low level of genetic differentiation between penguin colonies, with some colonies spanning over 7000km apart. The authors suggest that any efforts in monitoring and conserving penguin populations should be done at an archipelago level, rather than at colony level.</p>

<p>Tuberculous meningitis, caused by an infection of the meninges by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a serious condition that is often accompanied by high death or disability rates, particularly in developing nations. Although this disease is well characterized in Vietnamese adults, there is little data on how this disease manifests and affects children in Vietnam. This <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em> study aimed to address this by describing the current practices in disease management, as well as presenting the predictors of poor outcome. The authors conclude that much research is still necessary in developing strategies to treat afflicted children in order improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Just a few of the intriguing headlines involving members of the TED community this week:</p>
<p><b>The cascading effect of small lies. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tali Sharot is the senior author on a paper published in </span><a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4426.html" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Neuroscience</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that sheds light on the possible slippery-slope effect of telling small, self-serving lies. Using an fMRI scanning device to monitor the amygdala, an area of the brain associated with emotional response, the researchers found that when participants believed lying was to their benefit, “they were more inclined to dishonesty and their lies escalated over time,” reports</span> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/science/why-big-liars-often-start-out-as-small-ones.html" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, as their lying progressed, the response in their amygdalas decreased — and the bigger the decrease, the bigger their next lie would be. The findings suggest that the brain becomes desensitized over time to the negative emotional effects of lying, but Sharot cautions that, while we know the decreased activity is related to lying, whether or not it’s related to a negative emotional reaction is still speculation. Fellow TEDster Dan Ariely is a co-author on the paper.

Typically, bacterial detection requires the use of DNA probes that are target-specific, which means detection can be costly and slow when dealing with new or mutating species. Instead, the new method uses a small number of DNA probes randomly generated that are not target-specific, greatly reducing the cost and time of detection.

            A new paper could prompt a rethink of a basic tenet of neuroscience. It is widely believed that the motor cortex, a region of the cerebral cortex, is responsible for producing movements, by sending instructions to other brain regions and ultimately to the spinal cord. But according to neuroscientists Christian Laut Ebbesen and colleagues, the truth may be the opposite: the motor cortex may equally well suppress movements.

            <p>With less than a week until America casts ballots in what has become one of the most controversial US presidential elections in history, TED invited the social psychologist and expert on the psychology of morality Jonathan Haidt to talk about our divisions — and how we might heal.</p>
<p>In conversation with TED curator Chris Anderson at TED HQ in New York, Haidt draws on a social science perspective to explain why people on the left and right don’t just disagree with each other these days, they actually think the other side is a threat to the nation.</p>
<p>“We’re tribal — we evolved for tribalism,” Haidt explains. “It’s how we created society. We’re not doomed to always be fighting each other, but we’ll never have world peace.”</p>
<p>On the left, that tribalism has manifested itself with people who want to define their tribe more globally. On the right, the definition stops at local communities and nations. Haidt quotes the UK pollster Stephan Shakespeare, who put it this way: “We are either ‘drawbridge up’ people or ‘drawbridge down’ people.”</p>
<p>Another principle of social science explains why political arguments feel so unreasonable lately: As humans, our intuition comes first, while reason comes second. “Our intelligence actually may have evolved to help us manipulate each other and defend our reputations,” Haidt says. “That’s why you can’t win a political argument with reasoning and evidence.” Add in the internet, he says, and our post-hoc reasoning is ramped up on speed.</p>
<p>There’s also a historical explanation for the current division, <span class="il">Haidt</span> says. The influence of World War II can’t be overstated, because the generation of people who fought and endured it had to learn to come together to endure hardships, making them more cooperative and willing to compromise even years later. The next generation, the Baby Boomers, grew up without the same kind of unifying national event, and never had to confront the fatal consequences of divisiveness the way their parents did. So, he says, it makes sense that they wouldn’t be able to compromise in politics.</p>
<p>So is there a salve for a divided America?</p>
<p><span class="il">Haidt</span> provides an interesting vision for how we might move forward. America was built on federalism and local control, he reminds us, and conservatives continue to value small government. World War II and then the Baby Boomers put more and more control in the hands of the federal government — in part, <span class="il">Haidt</span> says, as a political maneuver to get Civil Rights legislation passed. But now, he points out, young people today are watching the government, specifically Congress, accomplish nothing at all. “What if young people find ways outside of government to make change?” he asks. “If we can take an awful lot off the federal plate, then people won’t feel the government is dominating their life as much.”</p>
<p>“Both sides are right about something,” Haidt says. “There are a lot of problems in the country, but neither side is capable of seeing them all.” He suggests turning to the ancient wisdom of Buddha, Jesus and Marcus Aurelius for advice on how to drop fear, reframe our differences and stop seeing other people as your enemy. “Be more humble; you don’t know as much as you think,” he says. “Make an effort to meet someone on the other side. Only with people who challenge us can we find the truth.”</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103414/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103414/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103414&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            <p>Addiction is a medical condition in which the person has uncontrollable desire to take a substance or engage in an activity, despite knowing that it may lead to adverse effects. Taking that substance or engaging in that activity will make the person feel good. Does sugar fit the bill? Clearly yes, as so many of us cannot control cravings for something sweet.</p>
<p>Sugar is used daily by most of us. Modern food is very rich in sugar and this abundance of sugar is viewed as one of the main reasons for growing obesity epidemics. Overconsumption of sugar does not only results in a flood of extra calories – it can also lead to addiction. Sugar can interact with different substances in the brain, influencing and changing their normal levels. Most notably, it affects the level of dopamine. It can also change the concentration of some receptors in the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/06/26/blood-glucose-and-the-brain-sugar-and-short-term-memory/">brain</a>.</p>
<p>The most common form of sugar in our food is sucrose. When ingested, this sugar is split in the digestive system into its two constituents, glucose and fructose. Insulin and glucagon are two enzymes most important for the metabolism of glucose. They both regulate the level of glucose in the human body.</p>
<p>After ingestion and degradation of sugar, glucose molecules are absorbed and distributed to all organs and cells in the body. A group of proteins called GLUCs are responsible for transportation of glucose in the blood. GLUT1 is the main transporter of glucose to the brain.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/02/02/willpower-glucose-and-belief/">glucose</a> reaches destination cells, it has to go inside the cells where it is consumed. There are different mechanisms to achieve this aim. Some cells, such as red blood cells, use passive transport, also known as diffusion, to get the glucose from the blood plasma. Many other cells use active transport mechanisms to deliver glucose inside the cells.</p>
<p>One of the human tissues which cannot tolerate low levels of glucose is brain tissue. The main reason for that is the inability of neurons to store glucose and use that stored glucose when levels decrease. That is the reason why the human brain is the first in line for the glucose supply. The brain is also the biggest burner of glucose in the human body.</p>
<p>Some people might say that they eat candies to feel happy. And they are not wrong. Sugar increases the release of neurotransmitter serotonin, which gives a person the happy feeling.  The catch is that sugar also causes the release of insulin which eventually normalizes the glucose level, and when glucose is back to relatively low levels, we will again strive to take sugar just to feel happy again. This may lead to a vicious circle of constantly eating sweets just to feel good. The result is overeating and possible addiction.</p>
<p>We all know how much children love sweets and sugar. That love is not a consequence of habits and upbringing, though. Recently, researchers have found out that childrens’ love for candies is caused by the biology of their brain. The concentration of neurotransmitters and their receptors is different in children compared to adults. That difference slowly reduces while we grow older. The problem is, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/30/is-sugar-the-new-cocaine/">sugar addiction</a> can be formed early in childhood and stay for the rest of life.</p>
<p>Another problem with sugar addiction is the fact that the human brain reacts differently to the different types of sugar that we ingest. There are big differences between brain reactions to glucose and fructose. For example, our body will need much less glucose to feel good and to trigger the impulses that tell us to stop eating. With fructose the situation is rather different. The human body needs much more fructose to suppress eating.</p>
<p>Researchers from Yale School of Medicine discovered this phenomenon using  functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis. They conducted their study on healthy non-obese subjects. The scientists used fMRI to detect different brain reactions on glucose and fructose. After taking glucose, there was a reduction of blood flow in brain areas responsible for appetite, the reward system, and motivation. It also caused immediate satisfaction. Fructose ingestion did not cause these changes in blood flow.</p>
<p>The problem is that fructose is often used in modern food and drinks. Since the human brain can’t regulate fructose ingestion properly, it may lead to food-seeking behavior, overeating, and eventually obesity.</p>
<p>There is a number of different cells in the human brain, each with a different set of functions. Glial cells surround neurons and provide them with support. One type of glia cells are <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/03/the-many-emerging-roles-of-astrocytes/">astrocytes</a>, which play an important role in creating the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier controls the movement of substances between brain tissue and blood in both directions. New research studies show that the functions of astrocytes can be controlled by enzymes such as insulin and leptin.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Technical University of Munich found that astrocytes play an important role in glucose intake. They have insulin receptors on their surface that react to glucose in blood. PET scans indicated that insulin can interact with astrocytes and regulate their permeability to glucose that will result in differences in the brain levels of glucose. When astrocytes in the parts of the brain responsible for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/24/making-decisions-on-a-hangry-impulse/">appetite</a> get activated, this leads to the feeling of satisfaction. However, when these astrocytes are not reached by glucose, they do not get activated and the person will continue to strive for glucose.</p>
<p>Despite resent discoveries, sugar addiction and especially its mechanisms of action in the brain remain poorly studied. A better understanding of this phenomenon may pave the way to more effective therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing obesity.</p>

            <img alt="Public domain" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/seal-1718007-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>For most land living mammals, a lack of oxygen usually results in irreversible damage to the brain within a few minutes. One of the reasons why this happens is because this highly active tissue cannot cope with the imbalance between energy production and demand under oxygen deficient conditions (also known as hypoxia). On the other hand, the brains of diving mammals, such as whales and seals, may survive recurrent and extended periods of hypoxia caused by diving without damage.</p>
<p>To some degree, this cerebral tolerance is credited to the combination of behavioural, anatomical and physiological diving adaptations, such as a lowering of the heart rate and constriction of peripheral blood vessels. Far less studied are cellular and molecular adaptations in the brains of the diving mammals that possibly contribute to their hypoxia tolerance as well.</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the idea that cellular and molecular mechanisms do play a role arose from electrophysiological studies of brain slices from the hooded seal <em>Cystophora cristata</em>. This seal is an expert diver with recorded dives of up to 1 hour and depths of more than 1000m. When challenged with hypoxia <em>in vitro</em>, the neurons of this arctic phocid seal remained active for an extended period, while mice neurons died immediately.</p>
<p>In our article, we investigated the molecular adaptations of the hooded seal using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We first obtained a transcriptome of the visual cortex of the hooded seal with more than 10,000 transcripts. Then, the mRNA levels were compared with those in the cortex of a close terrestrial relative, the ferret. We found in the seal brain a general reduction of the expression levels of genes related to energy metabolism. Most importantly, we identified two potential candidate genes which have an unusually high expression level in the seal brain and thus may contribute to its unusual hypoxia tolerance.</p>
<p>The highest mRNA level in seal cortex was found for clusterin (CLU), which is a chaperone with a variety of functions. For example, CLU interferes with the BAX-mediated apoptosis pathway, thereby promoting cell survival. The high level of CLU in the seal brain can be interpreted either as a preadaptation that protects it from the damage associated with dives or as a consequence of the stressful condition during or after a dive.</p>
<p>The largest difference in the mRNA levels between the hooded seal and the ferret brain was found for S100B, which is highly expressed in the seal brain. S100B is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding stress protein with functions such as regulation of cell proliferation and activation of astrocytes during brain damage and diseases. Most interestingly, further comparative analyses of the available brain transcriptomes showed that S100B mRNA levels were also high in the minke and the bowhead whale, but low in terrestrial mammals. Thus, S100B seems to be component of a common adaptation mechanism that evolved convergently in whales and seals to better survive the reduced oxygen supply during dives.</p>
<p>However, this is not the end of the story. The functions of these two candidates in dive adaptation must be further investigated since, for example, S100B may also promote cancer, and CLU is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases in humans as well as being associated with aging.</p>

            <p>In this talk I will present a paper [1] about a thalamocortical network model I will use as part of my research. I will start by providing a brief summary of the background and the research questions.</p>
<p>Our collaborators at Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, found that it is possible to stop epileptic absence seizures by exciting cerebellar nucleus (CN) neurons in a closed loop system (this work was done together with a former PhD student, Parimala Alva, [2]). In my PhD work, I will try to understand the mechanisms underlying the termination of seizures by optogenetic stimulation of CN neurons. For this purpose, I will use a thalamocortical network model of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons, as described in [1].</p>
<p>In the paper [1] the occurrence of Asynchronous Irregular (AI) states in thalamocortical networks of non-linear integrate-and-fire neurons has been investigated together with the role of spike-frequency adaptation. The main findings are that the thalamocortical networks can display AI states or Up-Down state dynamics, depending on the level of adaptation in cortical cells.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <p class="p1">In April 2016, Rachel Dolezal spoke at an independently organized TEDx event held at a university. As you may know, Ms. Dolezal is a former president of the NAACP’s Spokane chapter who sparked a national debate and resigned after the public discovered that she was a white woman identifying herself as a black woman.</p>
<p class="p1">Recently she announced on TV that she had recorded “a TED Talk.” Some of you were upset by this. Indeed, the news surprised us too, because we knew she hadn’t spoken at a TED event. But it turned out she had spoken at one of the thousands of TEDx events that are held around the world.</p>
<p class="p1">TEDx organizers host events independent of TED, and they have the freedom to invite speakers they feel are relevant to their communities. These volunteers find thousands of new voices all over the world — many of which would not otherwise be heard — including some of our most beloved, well-known speakers, people like Brene Brown and Simon Sinek.</p>
<p class="p1">What TEDx organizers have achieved collectively is remarkable. But, yes, some of them occasionally share ideas we don’t stand behind.</p>
<p class="p1">This particular talk has sparked much internal debate. For many on our staff, sharing the talk risks causing deep offense, and runs counter to TED’s mission of ideas worth spreading. But for others, now that the talk has been recorded, refusing to post it would unduly limit an important conversation about identity, and the social underpinning of race — and would be counter to TED’s guiding philosophy of radical openness. There’s no easy middle ground here.</p>
<p class="p1">So, in a doubtless flawed attempt to do the right thing by all of our constituencies, we have decided to make the talk available to you here, while highlighting the context in which the talk was created and the deeply felt concerns it has raised.</p>
<p class="p1">We are lucky to have a thoughtful audience, and we hope the conversation you engage in here will transcend the material that sparks it.</p>
<p class="p1">Sincerely,<br />

            <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="Art: Chris Gash" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103388" height="540" src="https://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ted_comment_bully.jpg?w=900&amp;h=540" width="900" />Bullies never win — not even in the comments section. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TED’s community manager, Katie Pierce, shares these tips on how to react to a comment-thread bully.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up with a dad who was a baseball-loving criminal investigator, so in my house, dinner conversation was about two things: Yankees batting averages and criminal psychology. At the table, I was introduced to the science of lying and the secrets of writing analysis — and I learned how to remove fear from the equation when dealing with bad guys. And believe me, this comes in handy as a comment moderator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TED’s website comments are a place where civility is important, and I’ve had to take on some big bullies while steering our community. I used to see these bullies as completely opposed to TED’s mission to create meaningful interaction in the comment threads on every TED Talk. But after much time spent trying to eradicate them, I’ve realized how valuable bullies can be to listen to and learn from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, listening for changes in word choice and tone helps me identify potential bullies even before they’ve begun actively bullying their next target. So I take notice when someone starts using more combative language, expressing their superiority or posting with an abnormal frequency. </span></p>
<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I’ve got your back on TED.com, bullies will certainly try to sneak into other areas of your life too. Here are my tricks to dealing with a bully that work online, offline … anytime. The first three are the most important: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Remain calm</strong></li>
<li><strong> Remain calm </strong></li>
<li><strong> Remain calm</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That moment when bullying hits you — it really, really hurts. Your emotions are billowing out like a mushroom cloud in your brain and you can’t think straight through all the smoke. Just remember: you are not under siege. You are still the person you were before you encountered the bully. They’ve only stated an opinion, not wished the awful thing into being. If you can tough it out until the emotional plume settles, you’ll be in a great place to respond effectively. </span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Determine the severity of the bullying</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be difficult to look beyond yourself when you’ve just been emotionally provoked, which is why steps 1–3 are so important. Make sure your heartbeat has slowed back down and you’re taking full, deep breaths. Then, ask yourself, “Am I angry because this speaker is being aggressively wrong and rude in a general way — or is this a personal attack on me?” Sometimes a comment is pointed enough for you to be in danger: Does it make a specific threat? Does it contain information about you that you don’t want shared? If this happens on the TED.com comment threads, flag the comment so our mods see it right away, and <a href="mailto:contact@ted.com">write to me</a>.</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Ask for the help you need … and be the help you need</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what else you do, make sure to address this reality: Being bullied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sucks</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bullying is not a normal stressor, and denying that you feel bad after an incident does not make it easier to work through. Maintaining your mental health while dealing with a bully is absolutely essential. Bullies do their real damage if you skip this step. So: Ask a friend to have a decompression session to discuss the interaction; do your favorite form of exercise; or employ another form of self-care that works for you. And in online spaces that have a moderator, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need backup! As a moderator myself, I hate that a bully hurt you, and I really do want to help! Bonus: Involving a moderator helps protect your fellow community members, and it also helps the mods do their jobs better.</span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Leave no one behind</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of combating bullying is sticking up for the bullied when you can. Be the friend you’d hope for if the situation were reversed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comment-thread bullying will never end if the bullies can’t see the large — and growing larger — united front that rejects their behavior. Even if you’ve never been bullied a day in your life, even if you used to be a bully yourself, this is still your fight. If you hope to be protected, you must also be willing to protect. So, the next time you see someone dealing with a bully, make your allegiance clear. Remind the bully that there truly is strength in numbers, and that the numbers are on our side. </span></p>

            <p>At this year’s TEDWomen conference, we tried out some new ideas for accommodating attendees with small children. Beyond a lactation room, for instance, we offered a list of local, vetted caregiver services to call upon, a free livestream pass for caregivers, a free breast-milk shipping service, and a suite at a nearby hotel where attendees and caregivers with small children could gather and watch the livestream together.</p>
<p>We did not, however, reverse our grownups-only policy. That’s because, simply put, our attendees have been vocal about us maintaining it.</p>
<p>But in our attempt to accommodate all our audiences, we fell short: A newborn was turned away from TEDWomen last week, and the disappointed mother wondered how an organization like TED could leave her with so few options.</p>
<p>That disappointment touches a nerve here at TED. Many of us are parents, and there’s no denying that many of the moving ideas shared on stage last week — ones that demanded a healthier world for babies and their parents — prompt us to ask: How can TED do its part to set a new standard?</p>
<p>We haven’t figured this out yet, but we are trying — and listening. We’ve been in touch with parents from this event and others to help us take a hard look at how we can better support parents of babies and small children. We recognize the importance of getting this right. Stay tuned.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103385/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103385/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103385&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            <p>Cancer is challenging to treat. Despite recent advances in earlier diagnostics and targeted therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the mainstream treatments to complement surgery.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy is an umbrella term referring to multiple aggressive drugs administered to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/19/glioblastoma-are-cancer-stem-cells-the-ultimate-target/">cancer</a> patients. What unites them is the way they work by targeting fast dividing cells in the body. The therapy can reduce the size of tumors and/or patient’s symptoms. In some cases, chemotherapy can even destroy all cancer cells in the body and lead to complete recovery. But despite its relative efficiency, chemotherapy is associated with a large number of undesirable and often severe side effects. Cancer cells are not the only fast dividing cells in the body, and the lack of specificity associated with the use of chemotherapeutic agents means that normal non-cancerous cells can also be targeted and killed by these drugs.</p>
<p>The most affected tissues include bone marrow, hair follicles, the cells of gastrointestinal tract and reproductive cells. But other organs and tissues such as the brain can also become affected by chemotherapy.</p>
<p>It is well know that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/03/11/this-is-your-brain-this-is-your-brain-on-chemotherapy/">chemotherapy</a> can cause decline in cognitive functions. There is a term used for that cognitive impairment – chemobrain. The condition is characterized by reduced cognitive abilities, impaired motor functions, loss of memory, and weaker attention. At least some symptoms of cognitive decline are often observed after chemotherapy and can cause severe problems for patients.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms behind the chemobrain phenomenon are poorly studied. Researchers believe that genetic factors play some role in cognitive decline after chemotherapy. These genetic risk factors may include weaker mechanisms of DNA repair,  lower capacity for repairing neurons, and lower activity of neurotransmitters in the brain.</p>
<p>Impairment of cognitive functions can be expected in a short period after chemotherapy, but in most cases it disappears quickly. However, in some cases the impairment persists and can last for a long period of time. In one recent study, a mouse model was used to test the effects of chemotherapy on the cognitive functions in a longer run (three months in this particular case). The results clearly show that animals subjected to chemotherapy agents learned new tasks much slower. Their neurons lived a shorter period of time and differentiated more slowly. This study was designed to test the effects of drugs given to post-menopausal women undergoing chemotherapy treatment for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/10/21/breast-cancer-catching-it-early/">breast cancer</a>. The study also provided evidence that omega-3 fatty acids do not have any positive effect on reducing the symptoms of cognitive impairment after chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Another study that was also conducted using laboratory animals focused on the changes in level of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Researchers used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to detect levels of the neuromediators. They compared the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brains of mice which were receiving chemotherapy, and in the brains of the control group of mice that did not receive chemotherapy. The results demonstrated that the release of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/20/the-role-of-serotonin-and-glutamine-in-aggression/">serotonin</a> and dopamine is impaired after chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Human studies of chemobrain focused mostly on breast cancer sufferers, and the data described below were gathered on this group of patients. There are good reasons to believe that the results will be similar for other types of cancer too.</p>
<p>One study compared the total brain volume in individuals with breast cancer that used chemotherapy and the total brain volume in the control group without cancer. The study was important as it examined the long-term consequences of chemotherapy on human brain volume. Researchers measured the total brain volume 21 years after chemotherapy. Their results show a significant loss of total brain volume and a loss of grey brain matter. The white matter remained mainly unaffected. The scientists think that this loss of total brain volume and grey matter may lead to the development of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>A similar research study was conducted on another group of patients with breast cancer. The study mainly focused on the changes in the brain’s white and grey matter after chemotherapy. The measurements were done 9 years after the chemotherapy. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect any changes. The findings show that there is a link between chemotherapy and changes in the structure of the human brain. Chemotherapy causes damage to white matter, specifically axonal degeneration and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/06/02/promoting-remyelination-in-multiple-sclerosis-an-interview-on-rhigm22/">demyelination</a>, but also it is harmful for the grey matter.</p>
<p>Another study was conducted on almost 200 female breast cancer patients that had chemotherapy 20 years ago. Researchers used neuropsychological tests to determine the level of cognition among these patients and in a cancer-free control group. The results showed significantly worse scores in the chemotherapy group compared to the control group. The cancer patients had problems with verbal <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/22/uncovering-the-secrets-of-memory-to-reverse-damage-in-alzheimers-patients/">memory</a> and psychomotor speed and functioning. These problems are the same as those occurring shortly after chemotherapy. This indicates that the patterns of cognitive impairment do not change even after a long period of time post-chemotherapy.</p>
<p>A very recent study compared the integrity of white matter in females with breast cancer before and after chemotherapy. Scientists assessed and compared the cognition scores before and after the treatment. Also, they performed the same tests on a group of females with breast cancer which did not undergo chemotherapy. The findings show significantly weaker test results in the chemotherapy group.  In this group, there were notable changes in the white matter in frontal, parietal, and occipital tracts.</p>
<p>Although cancer chemotherapy does work very well for many cancer patients, most certainly it can also cause dangerous and permanent brain damage. Chemotherapy can change how the brain works through changing the level of neurotransmitters. It can even change the structure of the brain, reducing its volume and reducing grey matter in the brain. Eventually this leads to cognition impairment which is strongest shortly after finishing the chemotherapy but can persist for decades after.</p>

            <p>When Hillary Clinton became the first female nominee of a major political party in the United States this summer, she reflected that this achievement “belongs to generations of women and men who struggled, sacrificed and made this moment possible.” Women have been leaders throughout history, making positive changes in their communities. But in so many places around the world, women are held back from leadership on the largest stages by social, cultural and religious barriers.</p>
<p>In the final session of TEDWomen 2016 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, eight speakers and one performer tackled one of the most fundamental issues facing women today: leadership.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_103347" style="width: 910px;"><img alt="Halla Tómasdóttir at TEDWomen 2016 - It's About Time, October 26-28, 2016, Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts, San Francisco, California.

She analyzes her campaign onstage at TEDWomen 2016. Photo: Marla Aufmuth / TED</p></div>
<p><strong>A living emoji of sincerity.</strong> “Are you going to quit?” That was the first question the media asked <strong>Halla Tómasdóttir</strong>, who ran for president of Iceland in 2016, at her first televised debate. Polling at 1 percent at the time, it didn’t look like Tómasdóttir had a chance at winning the election — or making an impact at all on the political debate. Sharing her journey from watching Iceland’s first female president, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, assume leadership, to deciding to run for Iceland’s highest office herself, Tómasdóttir narrates her motivations, struggles and achievements with wit and warmth. “It’s possible to run a different type of campaign,” she says, explaining how she insisted that her campaign take the high road and stay positive throughout the election, eventually earning her the description of “a living emoji of sincerity” in a <em>New Yorker</em> article. Despite a lack of resources and media attention, and against overwhelming odds, Tómasdóttir finished second in the election. “What we see, we can be. So screw fear and challenges. It matters that women run. And it’s time for women to run — whether it’s for CEO or president.”</p>
<p><strong>Know your own power.</strong> US Representative <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> has represented San Francisco’s 12th district for 29 years, is currently the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, and made history by becoming the first woman Speaker of the House. But she never felt that she was on a course for public office. In a revealing interview with TEDWomen co-founder <strong>Pat Mitchell</strong>, Pelosi reflects on her career and offers advice to other women seeking leadership positions, urging them to know their power and be their authentic selves. “Nothing is more wholesome to a government than the increased participation of women in leadership,” she says. Read more about the interview <a href="http://blog.ted.com/know-your-power-be-sure-of-your-convictions-and-act-upon-them-nancy-pelosi-speaks-at-tedwomen-2016/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Religious life, reinvented.</strong> “Religion today has failed to capture the imagination of a generation that is repelled by the viciousness of extremism and alienated by the dullness of routine-ism,” says <strong>Rabbi Sharon Brous</strong>. As a Jewish leader at the forefront of a movement for multi-faith justice work — which includes women’s mosques, Jewish indie startups, black churches in North Carolina, and a holy bus loaded with nuns — Brous wants to rethink and reinvent religious life, to imagine how religious communities might serve us collectively and how faith might provide a hopeful counter-narrative to the numbing realities of violence, pessimism and radical individualism that are present in all of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>A vision for 2045.</strong> “Today’s nuclear weapons are hundreds of times more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” says <strong>Erika Gregory</strong>, director of nuclear nonproliferation initiative N Square. Whether you live in a city (which an enemy nation would likely target) or in a rural area (where many weapons are stored), there’s a decent chance that a nuclear weapon is pointed at you right now. Even with the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons — the most widely adopted arms control treaty in history, with 190 signatories — there’s still no specific date by which the world’s nuclear countries will abandon their weapons. “Why is there no deadline — and no vision — for nonproliferation?” Gregory asks. One major issue: today’s generation of rising leaders were born after the Cold War, so they don’t remember a time when the nuclear threat was an everyday reality. To get rid of nuclear weapons and to eliminate the materials that can be used to produce them, Gregory says we need to engage this new generation and set a firm deadline for nonproliferation. She’s set her target on 2045. “Let’s close the chapter on nuclear weapons on the 100th anniversary of their invention,” she says. “If there was ever a global ‘moonshot’ worth supporting, this is it.”</p>
<p><strong>Tell your daughters about this year.</strong> In a world where women are told to be silent, and to wait beyond all reasonable patience of time, <strong>Chinaka Hodge</strong> asks mothers to take a stand not just for themselves but for the futures that their daughters have yet to inhabit. In a powerful spoken piece, she admits that “even in the year we leased freedom, we didn’t own it outright,” and she implores women to let their lives confirm the truth of their beliefs, teaching their daughters to demand more than the immediacy of what they are offered. “Tell her you were brave and always, always in the company of courage,” Hodge says. Because when it’s all said and done, the question invariably remains for all of us: “What did you do for women in the year that it was time?”</p>

<p><strong>How two Olympians became their own leaders.</strong> In order to become a leader, you have to learn to lead yourself. This is the lesson that led two Olympians down their path of glory. For American shot putter <strong>Michelle Carter</strong>, the current Olympic champion, learning to become her own leader meant stepping out of the shadow of her father and lifelong coach Michael Carter, an Olympic medalist himself. By making hard decisions in the face of high expectations, she realized that she had to take charge of her own direction. As she says, “I became the CEO of me!” For <strong>Alana Nichols</strong>, a Paralympics gold medalist in  wheelchair basketball, alpine skiing and sprint kayaking, learning to become a leader meant learning to think of her disability in a new light. At 17, Nichols was paralyzed in a snowboarding incident. As an athlete, she was devastated and thought she’d never be able to play again — until she watched a wheelchair basketball game while in college. “I started looking at what I could do, as opposed to what I couldn’t do,” she says. For both of these inspiring athletes, the ability to lead their athletic communities meant gaining leadership of themselves first.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi has represented San Francisco’s 12th district for 29 years, is currently the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, and made history by becoming the first woman Speaker of the House. But before all that happened, she never felt that she was on a course for public office. When the opportunity to run came along, she was a young mom; while she was heavily involved in the community, the thought of running for office had never crossed her mind.</p>
<p>Pelosi’s predecessor, Sala Burton, encouraged her to run when she became ill. Pelosi, feeling confident that she had a clear purpose, decided to go for it. “I knew my purpose and my call to service was to children,” she says. She wanted to make sure that all children had the same opportunities that her own children had. She won the election and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Asked by interviewer and TEDWomen co-founder Pat Mitchell what makes women’s leadership different and beneficial, Pelosi reflects how, when she ran meetings as Speaker of the House, people sometimes remarked on how different the meeting would have been if it was led by a man. Women are intuitive and respectful of other views, she says. They listen, learn and are ready to use their time well — and those differences make a difference. In fact, Pelosi believes that nothing is more wholesome to government than the increased participation of women.</p>
<p>Reflecting back on her long career, Pelosi offers advice to other women seeking leadership positions. When setting out on a course, she urges women to know their purpose, know their subject, act strategically and use their intuition. “When people know that you are going to act, your leadership will be very, very respected, and people will not try to destroy your options while you take your time,” she says.</p>
<p>Most important, she encourages women to be sincere. “It’s wonderful to have mentors and to have role models, but you must be your authentic self,” she urges, remarking that people want to see sincere and authentic candidates.</p>

<p>When she attended her first meeting at the White House, Pelosi was aware that this was unlike any White House meeting that any other woman had attended. As she sat down at the table with President Bush and the other leaders, she suddenly felt that the chair she was sitting on was very crowded. “It was weird, it was so tight, and I realized that on that chair were Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth,” she says. “I could hear them say, ‘At last we have a seat at the table.'”</p>
<p>In that moment, she was standing on the shoulders of all the women who had come before her. “Women fought for the right to vote — it was not given,” she says, correcting the headlines that came after women’s suffrage in 1920. She realizes that one day, other women will stand on her shoulders, too.</p>
<p>Pelosi believes that the issues that face the United States are part of something bigger — and it all boils down to respect. “It’s about creating a government and society that are respectful of the voices of the people in their country,” she says. That future, she believes, is on the horizon.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103334/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103334/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103334&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

<p>In December 1968, the crew of the Apollo 8 space mission captured a historic photo: “<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-releases-new-earthrise-simulation-video">Earthrise</a>,” an image of our home planet as seen from lunar orbit. Astronaut Jim Lovell was on that mission, and here’s what he said: “Everything that you’ve ever known, your loved ones, your business, the problems of the Earth itself … is all behind your thumb.” It was a poetic reflection on the frailty of life contained within that planet, and it echoed the observations of poets past and present that nature exists as an interconnected web of experiences between people and their environments.</p>
<p>Ian McCallum, a poet and psychiatrist, counts himself as just one of many voices who highlight this relationship, suggesting that so much of what makes up the natural world is also shared by living mammals like us.</p>
<p>His message is, in part, one of warning, of human development that’s created devastating effects on elephants, rhinoceroses, forests, and other keystone species vital to the Earth’s ecosystem. In the nearly 50 years since James Lovell and the other members of Apollo 8 gazed at our planet from the shelter of space, Earth has seen its ecological balance become more and more precarious through the actions of poachers and other human agents.</p>
<p>Ironically, while humans create so much environmental change, we are ourselves not a keystone species, McCallum says, not essential to any larger ecosystem. “Were we to disappear tomorrow,” he says, “nothing would miss us.”</p>
<p>But despite the best efforts of scientists to call us humans to account, people still exhibit apathy toward “the ecological warning calls of science.” In the absence of such reactions, he says, “the only voice left that can awaken us belongs to the poets.” Poetry is as much “a language of protest” as it is “a language of hope,” and it pushes us to be bold in how we address problems and ideas. It challenges us to be “keystone individuals” even if we aren’t a keystone species: to be “someone who can make a difference to the lives of others, to the animals, and to the Earth; someone who is willing to be disturbed” and willing “to stand firm in the knowledge that there are some things that are simply not for sale.”</p>
<p>It is, at its core, a process of self-examination, as poetry reminds us to consider what McCallum stresses we seem to have forgotten:</p>
<p>“that wilderness is not a place,<br />
but a pattern of soul<br />
where every tree, every bird and beast<br />
is a soul maker[.]”                               — <em>Wilderness</em>, Ian McCallum, 1998</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103355/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103355/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103355&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

<p>“TED is about challenging convention and deepening our understanding of the world around us by considering, even for just a few moments, a radically different way to look at things,” says Dalia Mogahed, host of Session 5 of TEDWomen 2016 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In the conference’s penultimate session, thought leaders, activists and scientists challenge us to reimagine how we learn, work and build. Through explorations of some topics we’d rather not discuss — and discussions of innovative ways to solve old problems — each of the session’s seven speakers leave us with a sense of hope for a better way to engage in our global community.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture 101: think about humans before construction.</strong> “People think architects design buildings — and cities — but what we really design are relationships,” says <strong>Jeanne Gang</strong>, a renowned architect and MacArthur fellow. When relationships are at the core of structural design, the lighting and the distribution of space can help instill trust, communication and harmony in communities. Gang describes design choices for projects she led to reinvigorate a student population, bring together a racially segregated city and foster community in a high-rise apartment in the heart of Chicago. She’s adamant about the role of architecture in solving social problems, like climate change, and the responsibility of designers to create timeless and impactful spaces. “The act of making,” she says “is a social activity.”</p>

<p><strong>Asking for help is a strength, not a weakness.</strong> Caterpillar Foundation president <strong>Michele L. Sullivan</strong> started learning difficult, eye-opening lessons on her very first day of kindergarten, when her classmates asked her: “Why do you look different?” Her confidence shattered, Sullivan hated being in public for years after, feeling every stare and pointed finger. “As a child, you can’t understand another child’s curiosity — or adult’s ignorance,” she says. Sullivan excelled in the classroom, and she made school a priority, eventually going on to earn an MBA. There were difficulties along the way. At her first job interview, Sullivan says, the biggest challenge of the day wasn’t the interview — it was finding a way to get into the building, which wasn’t handicap accessible. (She got the job anyway.) In her life, she chooses to focus on her experiences with gracious strangers who help her with small acts of kindness each day. “The only shoes you truly can walk in are your own,” she says. “But with compassion, courage and understanding, we can walk together, side by side.”</p>

<p><strong>A peaceful place to say goodbye.</strong> Death is common and inevitable — but for the youngest among us, untimely death is tragedy like no other. Terminally ill children deserve to enjoy the time they have left, says pediatric psychologist <strong>Kathy Hull</strong>, rather than waste it surrounded by the morose beeps and harsh fluorescent lights of a hospital’s pallid walls. To honor and celebrate these young lives cut short, Hull founded a palliative care home for children where they can be gently and warmly guided toward peaceful rest. “Ultimately, life is too short, whether you live 85 years or just 8,” she says. “How long any of us lives is out of our control. What we can control is what we do with our days, the spaces we create, the joy and meaning we make. We cannot change the outcome, but we can change the journey.”</p>

<p><strong>The cost of silence.</strong> On February 10, 2015, <strong>Suzanne Barakat</strong>‘s brother Deah, her sister-in-law Yusor and her sister Razan were murdered by their neighbor — who then claimed he killed them because of a parking dispute. The perpetrator’s story went unquestioned by the media and local police, until Barakat spoke out to call the crime what it really was: a hate crime. The help of their neighbor Neal, a journalist, allowed the Barakat family to regain control of the narrative around their family members’ deaths and raise awareness of the mainstreaming of anti-Muslim hatred. “We can all agree that bigotry is unacceptable, but when we see it we’re silent, because it makes us uncomfortable,” she says, but that silence comes with devastating consequences. She asks us all to consider what resources and expertise we can use to speak up and actively express our allyship with those who face hate and discrimination. “When we raise our collective voices, that is when we stop the hate,” she says.</p>

Photo: Marla Aufmuth / TED</p></div>
<p><strong>Unlocking the poet in all of us.</strong> When astronauts from the Apollo 8 mission traveled to the moon in December 1968, they reflected on the perspective created by the distance between themselves and the planet they had just departed, documenting their journey in an iconic photograph of the Earth rising above the moon’s horizon. But in the almost 50 years since the date of that original photograph, many of the forests, wetlands, peat beds and arctic sea-ice has vanished from the Earth’s landscape, a statistic that <strong>Ian McCallum</strong> identifies as an alarming consequence of our “ecological amnesia.” “Simply put,” he says, “we have forgotten where we come from,” as many of the Earth’s natural habitats and wild animals continue to disappear in the wake of human population growth and development. McCallum argues that scientists, and indeed all people, must adopt the power of poetry in order to change the way we interact with our environments, harnessing those “voices that speak of anger, outrage, beauty and care in the same breath.” Indeed, we must all strive to be keystone individuals, creatures that play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of ecosystems and who promise of a consciousness capable of redefining our sense of history, our sense of nature and our sense of stewardship.</p>

<p><strong>Clean water for all.</strong> Deepika Kurup determined to solve the global water crisis at the age of 13, after she witnessed children outside of her grandparents’ home in India drinking water she felt was too dirty to even touch. Her research began in her family’s kitchen without any high-tech equipment and then expanded … into the garage. In 2015 she won the National Geographic Explorer Award in the Google Science Fair. Kurup’s water purification system combines cement and photocatalysts, materials that speed up chemical reactions, to harness both UV and visible light to kill bacteria and make water safe to drink. Best of all, the young scientist’s design is fast, safe, sustainable and cost-effective.</p>

Photo: Marla Aufmuth / TED</p></div>
<p><strong>We need to talk to girls about pleasure.</strong> In America, the conversation with young girls about sex ends at consent. Journalist and author <strong>Peggy Orenstein</strong> challenges us to extend this conversation and talk to young people about women’s capacity and entitlement for sexual pleasure. For three years, Orenstein talked to girls ages 15-20 about their attitudes towards and experiences of sex. She found that girls measured their own pleasure by their partner’s pleasure and expressed shame around their genitals, which underscores the popularity of pubic hair removal and growing prevalence of labiaplasty surgery. Girls are taught of the risks and dangers of sex without learning the pleasure and joy of sex. Borrowing from Sara McClelland, Orenstein uses the phrase “intimate justice” to explain this situation — the idea that sex has political and personal implications. She encourages us to recontextualize sex by normalizing the discussion of sex. “We have raised a generation of girls to have a voice,” she says. “Now it’s time to demand ‘intimate justice’ in their personal lives as well.”</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103301/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103301/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103301&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            <p class="text-muted">by <a href="http://brainblogger.com">Brain Blogger</a> on October 28, 2016 12:08 PM.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>The number of overweight and obese people (those with BMI above 25) around the world is approaching the two billion mark. This is more than 20% of estimated 7.4 billion people currently populating the planet. The connection between obesity and various chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some types of cancer is well established. Not much, however, is known about how the excess body weight influences the structure and function of brain.</p>
<p><strong>Does IQ level determines body weight?</strong></p>
<p>Statistically significant correlation between excess body weight and lower IQ level has been demonstrated in multiple studies. What was not clear for very long time is the direction of causality. Does the excess body weight cause the decline in intellectual capabilities? Or maybe people with lower IQ level are more prone to become overweight?</p>
<p>Although some earlier studies concluded that lower IQ level might be caused by obesity, the most recent prospectively longitudinal studies show that this is not correct. These studies demonstrate that one of the risk factors for obesity is lower IQ level.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in 2010 summarized 26 different studies on this topic. The main conclusion of this analysis was that there is a strong link between lower IQ level in childhood and the development of obesity in adulthood.</p>
<p>In one Swedish study involving 5286 males the IQ level was tested at the age of 18 and again at the age of 40. At each testing, the BMI of participants was also evaluated. The results clearly show that individuals with lower IQ level have higher BMI.</p>
<p>Another study performed in New Zealand included 913 participants. Their IQ levels were measured at the ages of 3, 7, 9, 11 and finally at the age of 38. This study also concluded that lower IQ level in childhood leads to obesity. People with lower IQ level at the age of 38 were more obese than people with higher IQ level.</p>
<p>Over 3000 people were participating in a study conducted in the Great Britain. The subjects were followed for more than 50 years. Their IQ levels were measured at the age of 7, 11 and 16. At the age of 51, their BMI was measured. Their results show without any doubt that IQ level at the age of 7 can predict higher BMI at the age of 51. Also, the results show that BMI grows faster after the age of 16 among people with lower IQ level.</p>
<p>Another study conducted in the Great Britain involved 17,414 individuals. The IQ level was assessed at the age of 11. BMI was evaluated at the ages of 16, 23, 33 and 42. The results of this study also confirm that lower childhood IQ level leads to obesity in adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Obesity leads to faster aging of brain</strong></p>
<p>Our <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/20/obesity-food-takes-over-the-brain/">brain</a> changes during the natural aging process. As we become older, the brain loses white matter and shrinks. But the rate of aging process is not the same for every person. Individual factors may lead to faster or slower age-related brain changes. One of these factors that affects our brain structure is excess body weight. Obesity alters the normal aging process by speeding it up.</p>
<p>Research study conducted at the University of Cambridge concluded that obese people have less white matter in their brain compared to normal weight individuals. The brain structure of 473 individuals was investigated in this study. The data showed that the brain of obese people appears to be up to ten years anatomically older in comparison with the normal weight counterparts.</p>
<p>Another study conducted on 733 middle aged individuals showed that obesity is strongly linked with the loss of brain mass. Scientists measured body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of participants and used brain MRI to find and identify the signs of brain degeneration.  The results demonstrated that brain degeneration is more extensive in people with higher BMI, WC, WHR than in normal weight persons. The scientists hypothesize that this loss of brain tissue <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/21/weighing-on-your-mind-obesity-cognition-and-dementia/">may lead to dementia</a>, although there are no hard proofs at present.</p>
<p><strong>Obesity changes the way we feel</strong></p>
<p>Apart from structural changes, obesity can also change the way our brain works. Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters which is involved in reward circuits and motivation. One study concluded that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/05/05/is-obesity-linked-to-adhd/">concentration</a> of available dopamine receptors in the brain is in correlates with BMI. Individuals with higher BMI have a lower concentration of available dopamine receptors that may lead to a lack of pleasure after eating normal size portions and the urge to eat more to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>This view was confirmed by another study which analyzed the response of obese people to milkshakes during a period of time. Their response was analyzed using functional MRI. The measurements were repeated half a year later and showed that brain response was a lot weaker in people who gained excess body weight between two measurements. The researchers concluded that obese individuals feel less satisfaction when eating in comparison to lean individuals, due to a lower concentration of dopamine receptors in the brain.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/06/obesity-the-brain-as-a-new-research-focus/">research</a> on the effects of obesity on brain functions are still in infancy but the findings described above are already alarming enough. I think it is important to raise the public awareness about this issue. The negative impact of obesity on general health is well publicized, but hardly anyone ever mentions how bad the excess body weight can be for our cognitive functions.</p>

            <img alt="7289704868_410d314fdc_o" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/10/7289704868_410d314fdc_o-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Reasons for physical activity</strong></h3>
<p>The evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on the human body is indisputable. Physical activity is a key factor in preserving and restoring health. However, physical activity is more complex than movement of the body. Physical activity is a behavior contingent on motivation influenced by societal structures and cultural values.</p>
<p>Think for one minute why you (if motivated) choose to be physically active. Are you physically active <em>simply</em> to avoid disease and for the prospect of living 6-8 years longer? If you are, you may be characterized as an extremely rational person. However, if you’re like most people in the western world, whose basic needs are fulfilled, your choice to be physically active has to do also with fulfillment of more subtle intrinsic values (i.e. competence, autonomy and relatedness).</p>
<p>If you exercise regularly, you probably choose so for the excitement of achieving a personal goal, to look good, to feel good and/or to be around friends – and movement of your body is merely a means. From engagement in numerous studies of exercise behavior in different patient populations (primarily cancer and arthritis), I will argue, that this is also the case if you’re confronted with a serious disease.</p>
<h3><strong>Physical activity for individuals with a serious disease</strong></h3>
<p>Individuals who have been diagnosed with a serious disease, and who know that they have an elevated risk of dying, may choose to become more physically active as a consequence of a more conscious way of living and as a way of coping; they ride the crest of the diagnosis as a teachable moment. However, in terms of <em>adoption</em> of physical activity, patients are not that different from the average healthy person. Therefore, simple exercise recommendations, let alone warnings against sedentary behavior, are most likely to be insufficient in the long run.</p>
<p>Patients may experience more barriers towards physical activity (e.g. fatigue, pain, deteriorated body image and lack of self-efficacy); but at the same time strive for normality and distraction from their illness. Therefore, promotion of physical activity in health care including prevention of co-morbidity and development of secondary diseases, requires interventions, that will ensure safety and physiological efficacy without compromising the intrinsic values imperative for sustainment of the behavior. Moreover, the intervention must be easily accessible and possible to implement at low costs.</p>
<h3><strong>Community based football</strong></h3>
<p>One such novel intervention could be community-based football (soccer), which is currently being examined in the context of prostate cancer survivorship care in Denmark. The FC Prostate Community trial is an ongoing randomized multicenter study aiming to examine the effectiveness of community-based football in men with prostate cancer – regardless of treatment status and potential previous experience with football.</p>
<p>The study protocol recently published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> describes how the study as well as the intervention is pragmatically designed to improve generalization and implementation. Changes in bone health and body composition are secondary to changes in quality of life based on the idea that sustainment of the football training (and thus the expected health effects) is associated with a subjective improvement in quality of life.</p>
<p>In Denmark, as in many other countries around the world, football is the sport that arouses the most passion. Our previous qualitative research suggests that prostate cancer survivors’ perception of football is pivotal for their enrolment and sustainment. Football connotes male values, and is therefore especially attractive for men whose masculinity has be threatened by the prostate cancer diagnosis and anti-hormone treatment. In the context of community-based football, men with prostate cancer can exchange their worries and express mutual understanding without taking on the role as patients. As participants in the FC Prostate Community trial, they can feel safe knowing that their coach has undergone special training and employs an evidence-based training manual intended to prevent injuries.</p>
<p>While men with prostate cancer may be motivated to enrol in community-based football because they wish to achieve or maintain their physical health, they s<em>tay</em> motivated because of the positive relations to peers and because of the excitement of scoring a goal; they stay motivated because of what the activity enables them to feel and become. As such, their continued motivation towards physical activity may not be that different from yours or mine – although I doubt that I personally will ever feel competent playing football. Football will not be for everyone, but everyone deserves to be engaged in physical activity for other reasons than mere protection from disease.</p>

<p>In all of its formats, in all the ways we listen and watch, the media is extremely powerful in how it represents — or underrepresents or misrepresents — women. Unless we’re prepared to change the way women are portrayed in the stories we tell, we’re not prepared for real change.</p>
<p>In Session 4 of TEDWomen 2016 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, seven speakers (and a ballet company!) asked us to rethink how we tell each other stories, to empower us all.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_103274" style="width: 910px;"><img alt="Stacy Smith at TEDWomen 2016 - It's About Time, October 26-28, 2016, Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts, San Francisco, California.

<p><strong>The epidemic of invisibility.</strong> Filmmaking has the powerful capacity to transform and transport ideas. It shows us about the world — and ourselves. But the reality is that many of us are grossly underrepresented, if represented at all, in film. Media researcher and activist <strong>Stacy Smith</strong> studies inequality in film. Each year, Smith and her team study 100 popular Hollywood films, and they’ve found that women are largely invisible — on and off camera — to the point that women represent less than a third of speaking parts. Why is this? Perhaps thanks to this fact: Only 4.1 percent of films are directed by women. The numbers get smaller when factoring in race, age, sexuality and disability. Smith describes this situation as an “epidemic of invisibility.” Even in these grim circumstances, she offers practical solutions, like “just add five”: If, starting today, each filmmaker was to add five female speaking characters to their film, we would fill the gender gap in a mere three years. Ultimately, viewers have the power to address these problems by supporting women filmmakers and insisting that more women voices are heard.</p>
<p><strong>Teach girls to be brave:</strong> Writer <strong>Caroline Paul</strong> has lived a high-risk life. She has paddled unexplored rivers in Borneo, sea kayaked the dangerous waters of Alaska, and flown experimental planes around the California coast; adventure and danger are part of her DNA. So it came as a surprise to her that both men and womenwere baffled by her exploits. And then she realized: they were operating under the misconception that women weren’t brave. Where does this frame of thinking come from? It begins in infanthood, she says. Parents spend so much time protecting young girls from falling down and making mistakes that they grow up to be women who see and use fear as a barrier instead of a propeller to power our most courageous and ambitious endeavors. The message of this talk is simple: encourage young girls to get outside of their comfort zones, to build confidence by letting them try and fail for themselves, and shape their destinies based on their capabilities and not their limitations. “I’m not against fear,” Paul says. “I’m just pro-bravery.”</p>

<p><strong>The power of story to control time</strong>. “Time for me has always been an adversary,” says documentary filmmaker <strong>Nanfu Wang</strong>. “In my work and in my life, I’ve seen how moments can squeeze and dilate, and how in a moment the entire course of a life can change.” For Wang, those moments span from the interrogation room faced by three Chinese national security agents during the filming of her documentary, <em>Hooligan Sparrow,</em> to the sudden death of her father at age 33. These experiences shaped her determination to live every minute as if it were two. When she encountered documentary film, she recognized its power as a way to take control of time by allowing her to live multiple lives and experiences, manipulate time in the editing and storytelling process, and share it with an audience so that they could time travel, too. Storytelling, she says, loosens the grip that time holds on us.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_103273" style="width: 910px;"><img alt="Sisonke Msimang at TEDWomen 2016 - It's About Time, October 26-28, 2016, Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts, San Francisco, California.

<p><strong>Stories are not as magical as they seem.</strong> Stories are everywhere. From documentaries to podcasts, media offers us an unprecedented opportunity to hear stories from around the world, stories that make us fall in love and push us to imagine beyond what we already know. <strong>Sisonke Msimang</strong> explains that it’s not uncommon to hear people say that stories help make the world a better place, but she also cautions that stories can create an illusion of solidarity. An activist and social critic, Msimang explores the ways audiences react and engage with the content of nonfiction stories, arguing that such members must push beyond the simple act of listening into the reality which surrounds those highlighted stories. Storytelling alone cannot effect social justice without the credibility of facts and the intellectual curiosity of listeners who dare to ask questions about their content, she says. Instead, action requires a meaningful commitment to the storytellers, rather than their platforms, understanding that “sometimes it’s the messages that we don’t want to hear … that we need to hear the most.”</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_103277" style="width: 910px;"><img alt="Jack Myers at TEDWomen 2016 - It's About Time, October 26-28, 2016, Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts, San Francisco, California.

<p><strong>The future of men.</strong> Author <strong>Jack Myers</strong> is concerned about young men today. “We need a movement,” he says, “a simple movement with clear purpose, led by both men and women, LGBTQ and straight, that gives young men the confidence to discover their purpose and their place in the future.” He wants us to do away with prescriptive notions of masculinity and embrace non-conventional role models for our men and boys through positive media portrayals, mentorship programs and education. Because none of us should feel limited by the binary expectations of our gender.</p>
<p><strong>When we curb abuse, we’ll expand freedom.</strong> “Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy, and it’s imperative that it ends,” says actress <strong>Ashley Judd</strong>. In an electrifying, spirited talk that shines a light into the darkest corners of social media, Judd shares a glimpse of the vitriolic, hateful and threatening speech she encounters online every day. As a public figure, Judd sees a concentrated form of online abuse, but her experience of online harassment is one that’s shared with many others each day. After a particularly abusive experience following a tweet she sent after a University of Kentucky basketball game, Judd started to write. The resulting op-ed, published against the wishes of her publicist, went viral, encouraging her to start <a href="http://wmcspeechproject.com/">The Women’s Media Center Speech Project</a> with a goal of expanding protections against online abuse. She offers some practical solutions, too: we need digital media literacy; we need to end the sexism in the workplaces of tech companies (tech platforms built from the ground up by diverse teams, instead of a room of dudes, will set better priorities); law enforcement needs to know how online platforms work, and how threats escalate from the internet to the real world. “We must have the courage and urgency to disrupt online gender violence as it’s happening,” Judd says.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of female storytellers.</strong> “Why do we think that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance and stories by women are thought to be merely about women?” asks theater director <strong>Jude Kelly</strong>. We’re taught that divine knowledge and creative genius come through the masculine, but that impacts whether we believe that women’s stories, and consequently women’s rights, matter. “Without that, change can’t really come,” she says. We need to go back through our stories and see that so many are written from a male perspective, and we need to give women the chance to speak on behalf of the world. “All civilizations, all of humanity, have relied upon artists to tell the human story,” Kelly explains, but if that story is told by men, it will be about men.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Michelle Cusseaux. Aura Rosser. Tanisha Anderson. Mya Hall. Natasha McKenna. These are the names of but a few African-American women who were victims of police brutality in the past two years. Why are most people unfamiliar with these names? Activist and law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw urges us to ask this question. Through her theory of intersectionality, she explains the overwhelming underrepresentation of violence against African-American women in activism, politics and media.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The problem is, in part, a framing problem,” Crenshaw says. “Without frames that are capacious enough to address all the ways that disadvantages and burdens play out for all members of a particular group, the efforts to mobilize resources to address a social problem will be  partial and exclusionary.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Crenshaw, this meant developing a language as a method of understanding this problem, she says: “When there’s no name for a problem, you can’t see a problem. When you can’t see a problem, you can’t solve it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Inspiration struck as a law student, when she came across the case of Emma DeGraffenreid, an African-American woman who sued a manufacturing company for not hiring her on the basis of race and gender. The judge dismissed her claim, noting that the company had hired people of her color, and hired people of her gender. It just didn’t happen to hire people who were <em>both</em>. Crenshaw seeing this obvious injustice (or “injustice squared,” as she puts it) imagined DeGraffenreid standing at the intersection of being both a woman and an African-American. This intersection is at the heart of the theory of intersectionality, a theory Crenshaw has developed to describe how our overlapping social identities relate to structures of racism and oppression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reality is that African-American women face discrimination through both their race and gender. Spheres of social identities — from race to gender to sexuality to disability — operate on multiple levels, creating multidimensional experiences. This casts a shadow on the African-American women who have lost their lives to systemic racism in the past few years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Why don’t we know these stories? Why is it that their lost lives don’t generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry of the lost lives of their fallen brothers?” she demands. Frustrated by this situation, Crenshaw launched the #SayHerName campaign, a social media movement that seeks to shed light on forgotten women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Let’s create a cacophony of sound to represent our intention. To hold these women up. To bring them into the light,” Crenshaw proclaims. Accompanied onstage by singer Abby Dobson to close out this powerful talk, she encourages us to bring these women to light and finally say their names: Michelle Cusseaux. Aura Rosser. Tanisha Anderson. Mya Hall. Natasha McKenna.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103250/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103250/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103250&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to equality across race, class and gender: “None of us has time to sleep — we need to be woke as hell,” says <strong>Mia Birdsong</strong>, host of Session 3 of TEDWomen 2016. In an emotional, pointed session, seven speakers and one performer explored the painful realities of the present and offered hopeful views of the future.</span></p>

<p><strong>“I’m not passing a torch; I’m helping you light the fire.”</strong> Kicking off session 3, <strong>Mia Birdsong</strong> sat down with the three founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, <strong>Alicia Garza</strong>, <strong>Patrisse Cullors</strong> and <strong>Opal Tometi</strong>, for an in-depth conversation about the movement, how it’s rocked public consciousness across the world and where the future lies for Black lives. Sharing personal experiences of being Black in America and statistics about the abhorrent state of racism worldwide, Garza, Cullors and Tometi made it clear that this systemic problem must be addressed at the root for the progress of all. “Our work is not just about our own visibility, but how we make the whole visible,” they say. Their advice on how to participate? Lead, join something and “sharpen each other so we can rise.”</p>
<p><strong>Attacking discrimination through prenatal care.</strong> When activists discuss the effects of racism on marginalized populations, they tend to focus on the challenges that occur during one’s lifetime. But what about before you’re even born? According to stats shared by birthing rights activist and doula <strong>Miriam Zoila Pérez</strong>, pregnant women of color experience far poorer health outcomes than their white counterparts. Though poverty and access-to-care are partially responsible for this statistic, Pérez identifies discrimination as the root cause of this disparity. Pregnant women of color who receive the recommended prenatal care still suffer from higher rates of illness and death during pregnancy and childbirth, and immigrants of color actually have worse health outcomes the longer that they stay in the United States. “Racism is actually making us sick,” Pérez says. She illustrates a new way to counteract these effects, known as “<a href="http://www.commonsensechildbirth.org/jjway/">the JJ Way</a>.” This model of unconditional support from healthcare providers emphasizes a compassionate rather than punitive environment for all women. “While we can’t eradicate racism and the stress that results from it overnight, we might be able to create environments that provide a buffer to what people of color experience on a daily basis. And during pregnancy, that buffer can be an incredible tool towards shifting the impact of racism on generations to come.”</p>
<p><strong>The urgency of intersectionality.</strong> As a law student, professor <strong>Kimberlé Crenshaw</strong> came across the case of <a href="http://openjurist.org/558/f2d/480/emma-degraffenreid-et-al-v-general-motors-assembly-division-st-louis">Emma DeGraffenreid</a>, an African-American woman who had sued a manufacturing company for not hiring her on the basis of her race and gender. The judge dismissed her claim, noting that the company had hired people of her color, and hired people of her gender. It just didn’t happen to hire people who were <em>both</em>. Crenshaw saw an overwhelming lack of language to describe this injustice at the intersection of race and gender, and developed a theory she called “intersectionality” to describe how our overlapping social identities can relate to structures of racism and oppression. “When there’s no name for a problem, you can’t see a problem,” the law professor and activist says. “When you can’t see a problem, you can’t solve it.” Intersectionality theory also helps explain the current misrepresentation of violence against African-American women in politics and media, spurring Crenshaw to launch the #SayHerName campaign to bring awareness to the forgotten female victims of police brutality. Joined by singer Abby Dobson, Crenshaw encourages us to bring these women to light and finally say their names.</p>

<p><b>The gift of being difficult.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Have you ever felt like you were being a pain in the ass, or have you ever been called ‘difficult’?” asks <strong>C. Nicole Mason</strong>. The author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born Bright: A Young Girl’s Journey from Nothing to Something in America</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mason says she has been “difficult” her whole life, but only after writing her memoir did she start to wonder if that was really such a bad thing. “I decided that being difficult means to disrupt the expectations of others,” she says, “to ask for more than what was being offered and to take the road said to be closed to me.” Born a brown-skinned girl to a teenaged mother in Los Angeles, the expectations for Mason’s life were carved out before she could begin to imagine what she might want for herself. But she had a different vision for herself — one that would require the disruption of stereotypes and the stigma placed upon poor people, girls and blacks in our society. Mason outlines three kinds of disruption that shaped who she is: (1) disrupt dominant narratives; (2) disrupt the rules of how things are supposed to be done and who should be doing them; and (3) disrupt the expectations and limitations that are put upon you by society and others. “Let’s all go out and be difficult,” she says.</span></p>

<p><strong>Getting equality on the ballot.</strong> The night before <strong>Sandi Toksvig</strong>‘s talk at TEDWomen 2016, the World Economic Forum updated its estimate of when women around the world can expect equal pay as men. It had been originally estimated as the year 2133. Now …. it’s 2186. “We can’t wait that long!” says Toksvig. Earlier this year, Toksvig — Britain’s first openly gay female media personality — decided to bring the issue of equality to the here-and-now by founding a new political party, <a href="http://www.womensequality.org.uk/">The Women’s Equality Party</a>. Their platform is simple: let’s create equality in every aspect of our lives. (“And then close down, go home and get the rest of the chores done.”) Toskvig hopes other women in other countries will copy her party’s model and mobilize for equality around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Born to sing.</strong> “My voice — my greatest gift, my greatest salvation,” says <strong>Taylor Dayne</strong>, as she reflects on the role of music in giving her purpose and helping her counter the chaos of her childhood home. “If my parents couldn’t protect me, my voice would,” she says in a talk laced with musical quotations from the perfect song, as she explores why a woman who loves love (“All of my singles, did you ever notice?, have the word ‘Love’ or ‘Heart’ in the title) is still searching for connection. She closes with a soulful rendition of her new song “Born to Sing.”</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103215/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103215/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103215&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

<p dir="ltr">3,000 Facebook messages in three days, that ended in marriage 3 months later.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the start, Tiq and Kim Katrin Milan’s relationship was a whirlwind romance — a unique union rooted in a deep love, respect and mutual admiration that came across warmly as they stood hand in hand on the TEDWomen stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tiq is a transman; Kim a queer, cis woman, “God was never supposed to bless a union for folks like us, and the law was never supposed to recognize it,” says Tiq.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both poets, writers, and creatives with a long history of community work, their relationship stems from a beautiful balancing act of two complementary, opposite spirits that dance and flicker in tandem. With Kim as a lifelong traveler and Tiq born into a large family, they’ve promised each other a life as vibrant, uncompromisingly bright as their authentic selves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Keep me safe, and I’ll keep you wild,” is Kim’s promise to Tiq. “Our relationship has always been about setting each other free.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their marriage stands as testament to something bigger than themselves, as a representation and pure reflection of the love, worth and respect that all members of the LGBTQIA+ community deserve, but are often denied — especially by their own families — betrayed by those they trust the most. Their love is about creating new ways of existing, of accepting people as they are by dropping preconceived notions of how somebody should be in their body, in their gender and in their skin. By unlearning these deep-seated biases, says Tiq, people can embrace who they truly are and create a new language of love.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We open up little windows into our relationship for our community to bear witness,” shares Kim. “We do this because we want to make maps to the future, and not monuments to ourselves.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tiq and Kim ask us to imagine a world where the self is truly self-determined — where, as Tiq says, “Who we are is a kaleidoscope of possibility, without the narrow-minded limitations masquerading as science or justice.”</p>

            <p>We depend on each other, and we can accomplish very little if we can’t work together. What better way is there to spend our time than with each other?</p>
<p>Hosted by journalists (and married couple) Courtney E. Martin and John Cary, Session 2 of TEDWomen 2016 featured five pairs of speakers and one performer exploring the time we share together. The pairs discovered that transcendence begins with a bond — and no small amount of humility.</p>
<p><strong>Keep me safe, and I’ll keep you wild.</strong> <strong>Tiq Milan </strong>and<strong> Kim Katrin Milan</strong> married three months after meeting on Facebook, and they fall more in love with each other every day. As members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Tiq and Kim identify their relationship as one built upon a new language of love that transcends rigid traditional institutions and the gender binary. Through their activism and living life out loud, Tiq and Kim’s vision of love and inclusion as revolutionary change has created a space for others to grow into their authentic selves. “We want to make maps to the future, not monuments to ourselves,” says Kim. “Creating a world where love belongs to us all.”</p>

<p><strong>Finding alternative energy through … chicken feathers?</strong> As demand for energy and concerns about pollution continue to rise, scientists have struggled with the problem of how to address our energy needs in an environmentally conscious way. For scientists in countries with smaller economies — such as <strong>Anela Arifi</strong> and <strong>Ilda Ismaili</strong>, who hail from from Bosnia and Herzegovina — cost-effectiveness is a huge issue as well. Bosnia and Herzegovina discards approximately 4 billion pounds of poultry waste annually, so, Arifi and Ismaili thought, why not use chicken feathers and chicken fat for fuel? Creating a two-stage reactor with an afterburner chamber designed from the basic structure of a flute, the two scientists, students at the International High School of Tuzla and Secondary Music School in Tuzla, produced a biodiesel and hydrogen storage material far superior to samples from other systems. As a result of their efforts, both were chosen to be among 20 global finalists for the 2015 Google Science Fair. “Coming from such a small country and having all these struggles just to be given an opportunity to invent and show it to the world was the best award Google Science Fair could have given us,” Arifi says.</p>
<p><strong>“We can’t walk in each other’s shoes, but we can walk together.”</strong> How did <strong>Kennedy Odede</strong> and <strong>Jessica Posner Odede,</strong> two individuals who grew up in vastly different parts of the world and under dramatically different circumstances, find each other and partner to fight poverty and sexual violence in Kibera, Nairobi’s largest slum? Their answer: forgiveness. Narrating their journey from strangers to a married couple with humor, sweetness and wisdom, the duo walks us through the three stages of forgiveness: tolerance, forgetting and release. “Forgiveness doesn’t erase the past, it enriches the future,” Kennedy says as the couple reflect on how forgiveness creates space for new worldviews and opportunities. In their case, that space led them to walk together in building Shining Hope for Communities, a youth-empowerment group dedicated to fighting poverty.</p>
<p><strong>We are two of a kind.</strong> Inspired by her activism and work with teenagers in conflict zones, singer-songwriter <strong>Morley</strong> uses the transcending power of music for social justice. Protest and social justice music, Morley says, allows one to understand the condition people are coming from — an idea drawn from Morley’s mentor Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon. Alongside cellist Marika Hughes, Morley performs “Two of a Kind: at TEDWomen, a wistful song about the global addiction to ‘othering’ each other and the ability of love to help us rise above our differences.</p>

<p><strong>Transformation through preservation.</strong> <strong>Chief Tashka Yawanawá</strong>, of the Yawanawá people from the Acre region of Brazil, stands up for the self-determination of all indigenous peoples. His wife, <strong>Laura Soriano Yawanawá</strong>, a Mixteca-Zapoteca activist from Oaxaca, Mexico, has always had an uncompromising belief in equality and inclusion. Together, the two are working to strengthen indigenous traditions at home and around the globe, while rejecting firmly rooted patriarchal systems. They’re developing programs that empower women, children and elders — like a fashion line that uses traditional Yawanawá designs on clothes and provides female artisans with a stable income.</p>

<p><strong>Forgiveness doesn’t change the past, but it does enlarge the future</strong>. When <strong>Tom Stranger</strong> was 18 years old, he went on an international exchange program from his native Australia to Iceland. There he met <strong>Thordis Elva</strong>, and the two soon were engaged in a teenage romance. A month into their relationship, Elva tried drinking rum for the first time at their school’s Christmas Ball and became ill. What happened next changed her life forever. “Tom acted as my knight in shining armor and told the security guards he’d take me home,” Elva recounts. “It was like a fairy tale, his strong arms around me, laying me in the safety of my bed. But the gratitude I felt soon turned to horror, as he proceeded to take my clothes off and get on top of me.” Despite limping for days and crying for weeks, the incident didn’t fit Elva’s ideas about rape, and by the time she could identify what had happened to her <em>as</em> rape, Stranger had completed his exchange program and left for Australia. Nine years later, her self-worth buried under a soul-crushing load of silence and nearing a nervous breakdown, Elva watched in wonder as words streamed out of her pen into her notebook, forming the most pivotal letter she’d ever written, addressed to Stranger. “Regardless of whether he deserved my forgiveness, I deserved peace. My era of shame was over.” This marked the start of an eight-year-long correspondence — in which Elva relieved the burden she’d wrongfully shouldered and Stranger, in turn, owned up to what he’d done — that culminated in a face-to-face meeting in South Africa. “Saying to Thordis that I raped her changed my accord with myself,” Stranger says. “Most importantly, the blame transferred from Thordis, to me.” Elva and Stranger have co-authored a book, <em>South of Forgiveness</em>, due out next year, which they hope can be useful to people from both ends of the perpetrator-survivor scale. “We owe it to each other to join our efforts in curing the epidemic that is sexual violence,” Elva says. “Just imagine all the suffering we could eliminate if we dared to face this issue — together.”</p>

She spoke at TEDWomen 2016 on October 27 in San Francisco.</p></div>
<p>“Time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate what we need or want to put into it,” says author Laura Vanderkam.</p>
<p>Vanderkam studies how very busy women spend their lives. For her recent book, <em>I Know How She Does It</em>, Vanderkam asked 143 women to meticulously log their days, hour by hour, for a week and, in doing so, discovered an important trend: We have plenty of time, but we’re not spending it well.</p>
<p>According to Vanderkam, to spend our time well, we need to prioritize what matters and skip what doesn’t. Sounds simple … but how to decide? She suggests taking a step back from the daily scramble and thinking long term. Imagine writing your year-end performance review — but for the upcoming year. What are the things you want to accomplish next year?</p>
<p>Second, Vanderkam suggests doing a simple exercise every Friday afternoon, during the time you’re staring at the clock anyway: Write down two or three priorities in the categories of career, relationships, and self, then look to the week ahead and figure out how you can schedule in each priority.</p>
<p>“We are smart people,” Vanderkam says. “We have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there.”</p>
<p>Vanderkam also recommends taking advantage of the small moments that cushion our daily commitments, whether you use the 10 minutes after you wake up to meditate or pray, or your hour-long commute to read. A few minutes here and there add up. So choose what matters and spend your time, and your life, wherever you may find it, accordingly.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103245/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/103245/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&amp;blog=14795620&amp;post=103245&amp;subd=tedconfblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            I just came across a remarkable new paper on the science of salt-passing behavior: Expected Results Show that a Longer Nose Means Slower Times for Passing the Salt and Pepper: A Second Report



The article, which I have no doubt is entirely serious in nature, lists as its authors Canadian researchers Minér Patrick, Léon Le Néz and Pat Minér.

Here's how Patrick et al. describe their work:
Eighty female student subjects were tested by being asked to pass salt or pepper by another stud

            <p>New research shows that the drug makes cells in the retina more sensitive to light</p><p>25 years ago, pharmacologist M. E. West of the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica, noted that local fisherman who smoke cannabis or drink rum made with the leaves and stems of the plant had “an uncanny ability to see in the dark,” which enabled them to navigate their boats through coral reefs. “It was impossible to believe that anyone could navigate a boat without compass and without light in such treacherous surroundings,” he <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w0qvkVGO0sgC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Cannabis+and+night+vision+west&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Do0fXMEKQy&amp;sig=Qy3q2DtB3dgnfsYdkku3iDQKgdw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTnrmbjvjPAhUEB8AKHfquBtEQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Cannabis%20and%20night%20vision%20west&amp;f=false">wrote</a> after accompanying the crew of a fishing boat one dark night, “[but] I was then convinced that the man who had taken the rum extract of cannabis had far better night vision than I had, and that a subjective effect was not responsible.”</p><p>Some of these crew members told West that Moroccan fishermen and mountain dwellers experience a similar improvement after smoking hashish, and in 2002, another research team travelled to the Rif mountains in Morocco to investigate further. They gave a synthetic cannabinoid to one volunteer, and hashish to three more, then used a newly developed <a href="http://www.lkc.com/downloads/Brochures/SST-1%20Brochure%20060328%20P.pdf">piece of kit</a> to measure the sensitivity of their night vision before and after. Confirming West’s earlier report, they found that <a href="http://files.iowamedicalmarijuana.org/science/misc/Russo%20et%20al.%20Cannabis%20Night%20Vision%20JEP%202004.pdf">cannabis improved night vision</a> in all three of their test subjects. </p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2012/mar/02/how-marijuana-impairs-memory">How marijuana impairs memory</a> </p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/sep/02/psychedelic-psychiatry">A brief history of psychedelic psychiatry | Mo Costandi</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/oct/27/cannabis-many-enhance-night-vision">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be
possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and short
positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using this
principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived.
Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations
of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also
applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate
bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive
the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the
possibility of default.</p>

These efforts span the range of ways we are accelerating access to discovery of not just the final publication but the <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/innovation/#loc-our-progress" target="_blank">entire research life cycle</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Stake a Claim</strong></p>
<p>An additional strategy – early posting of articles before formal peer review through the use of preprints – can also advance science faster, more openly and with broader participation. In posting preprints, authors are able to make their findings immediately available to the scientific community and to <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563" target="_blank">receive feedback on draft manuscripts</a></strong> before they are submitted to journals. The benefit extends beyond making early work openly and freely available prior to or during consideration at a journal; in posting a preprint, an author or author group stakes an intellectual claim to methods, results and ideas contained within that paper. This can be especially important for scientists looking to change the focus of their research and connect with engaged colleagues in new fields; for those on the job market needing to show the status of their current research, their collaborative nature and their ability to embrace change for a more open way of doing science; and for early career researchers who may find opportunity to interact with new contacts interested in their work.</p>
<p>PLOS supports authors who wish to share early versions of their research manuscripts to receive feedback before – or in parallel to – formal peer review, and <strong><a href="http://www.ascb.org/consensus-grows-preprints-biology-2/" target="_blank">encourages researchers to share via preprint servers</a></strong> either before or after submission to a PLOS journal. Preprints are an excellent way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish intellectual precedence for ideas, methods, results</li>
<li>Receive early feedback from engaged colleagues</li>
<li>Obtain and document citations to a work before publication in a peer-reviewed journal</li>
<li>Contribute to accelerating scientific discovery and increasing research efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>PLOS has a long-standing policy of accepting manuscripts previously posted to preprint servers, however we recently collaborated with bioRxiv to ease the process as a reflection of the importance we assign to this rapid dissemination vehicle for authors that also brings transparency to the review process. Authors can now use bioRxiv’s <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript" target="_blank">direct transfer to journal service drop-down menu</a></strong> to submit directly to PLOS. While authors posting to bioRxiv can choose the reuse options under which to make their article available (various CC BY options or no reuse), licensing terms of PLOS content <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/open-access" target="_blank">has not changed</a></strong>. To inform authors and the public of the current and more seamless arrangement with bioRxiv we have updated our preprint policy on all journal <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/ethical-publishing-practice#loc-preprint-servers" target="_blank">ethical publishing practice</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines" target="_blank">related manuscript</a></strong> sections as well as the Wikipedia page that describes the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy" target="_blank">landscape of publisher’s preprint policies</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers First</strong></p>
<p>With preprints, authors – not publishers – are in control of when they publicly timestamp their intellectual property as well as when they want it to go for review. They <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/science/asap-bio-biologists-published-to-the-internet.html" target="_blank">decide when their research paper is ready to post</a></strong> and when they’re ready to submit their paper for formal peer review. In an open environment, the community can evaluate what any individual scientist’s standards are for their work and their online interaction with colleagues. By posting work and commenting on the posted work of others, authors are more in control of their own reputations. In essence, the use of preprints is analogous, in a very public and large-scale version, to the more intimate practice of sending a complete manuscript draft to a colleague to get their opinion with potential to improve the manuscript before submitting to a journal. Some have likened it to going public with a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleo/2015/09/07/on-preprints-in-paleontology/" target="_blank">conference abstract or presentation</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>In the same way that not all Open Access is created equal, not all preprint servers work the same way. Launched in 2013 by <strong><a href="http://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a></strong>, bioRxiv is now in its third year with more than 5,000 preprints posted to the site and more than 1 million article views each month. At bioRxiv, all posted research papers receive a digital object identifier (DOI) that remains associated with the original preprint. When a manuscript is transferred to PLOS from bioRxiv, PLOS stores the preprint DOI; if that manuscript is accepted for publication it then receives a PLOS DOI and we deposit both the preprint and the final article DOI to CrossRef so the <strong><a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2016/05/members-will-soon-be-able-to-assign-crossref-dois-to-preprints.html" target="_blank">two works can be associated with each other</a></strong>.</p>
<h4>Importantly, whether posting a preprint or submitting to a journal, authors can help themselves ensure full recognition for both the preprint and the final article by <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">including their ORCID iD</a></strong> at all times.</h4>
<p>At PLOS, preprints are acceptable resources for inclusion in the reference section of an article. Should anyone follow a link from an article citation to a preprint that has subsequently been peer reviewed and published, they would be directed from the preprint to the article on the PLOS journal website.</p>

<p><strong>Value Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Preprints <strong><a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Zika-Moves-Quickly-and/237419/" target="_blank">do not diminish the need for reputable peer-reviewed journals</a></strong>. In fact, the combination provides scientists the best of both worlds; preprints accelerate making work public and provide an opportunity for early feedback for those willing to share their work whereas journals provide a mechanism for formal assessment, curation and dissemination. Journals reinforce standards for ethical and reporting guidelines, plagiarism checks, conflicts of interest and work with organizations such as CrossRef to ensure seamless and complete metadata transfer. Publishing in journals has the added benefits of validating the quality of work through rigorous peer review; placing work in context through perspectives, editorials and incorporation into collections; providing opportunities for online dialogue with authors through <strong><a href="http://plos.io/1Jz2DfN" target="_blank">PLOS Science Wednesday AMAs</a></strong> and tracking article influence through <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/09/19/understanding-altmetrics-an-interview-with-stacy-konkiel/" target="_blank">Article-Level Metrics</a></strong>. Our current work with bioRxiv is one more example of how we are putting researchers at the center of science communication and placing authors in control of their manuscripts. In the future, expansion of Aperta to the full suite of PLOS journals and <strong><a href="http://plos.io/2dreNOY" target="_blank">incorporating aspects of community review</a></strong> to our processes will place PLOS in the space necessary to <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/placing-authors-at-the-center-of-the-scientific-endeavor/" target="_blank">accelerate dissemination</a> </strong>of research results and conversation surrounding a scholarly work.</p>
<p>Those wanting an objective look at the value of preprints might find <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/absolutely-maybe/2016/05/01/breaking-down-pros-and-cons-of-preprints-in-biomedicine/" target="_blank">Breaking Down Pros and Cons of Preprints in Biomedicine</a></strong> of interest; for a detailed discussion of preprints by one active participant listen to the <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/2016/10/24/the-power-of-preprints-an-interview-with-james-fraser/" target="_blank">PLOScast with James Fraser</a></strong>, Associate Professor at UCSF and a founding member of <strong><a href="http://asapbio.org/" target="_blank">ASAPbio</a>,</strong> an initiative of the biology community to encourage use of preprints. When you’re ready, go ahead, post that paper, place your results and ideas in the mix and we’ll advance science forward faster, together.</p>
