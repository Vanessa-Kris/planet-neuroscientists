<p>How do you get people to act in a climate friendly manner? The received wisdom is to push the basic message that climate change is real, humans have a hand in it, and we must mitigate it through action. But this approach hits a wall when people are disposed against that goal ideologically or because they simply don’t care enough. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/102/1/88/">New research</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em> suggests another strategy: encourage environmental behaviours by linking them to goals that are already personally important.</p>
<p><span id="more-19098"></span></p>
<p>Kerrie Unsworth from the University of Leeds and Ilona McNeill from the University of Melbourne contacted 183 working adults who commuted in private vehicles, and asked them to imagine that their company was closing their car park to extend their premises, offering as compensation a public transport subsidy. In one condition, the decision was justified exclusively on environmental grounds, pointing out the benefits of reducing traffic density and jams, as well as increasing the proportion of energy-efficient vehicles on the road. Asked how they would react to the proposal, these participants responded much like those in a control condition where no justifications were given at all: with muted enthusiasm, and by saying they planned to persist with a car commute despite the obstacles.</p>
<p>But other participants responded much more positively. They’d read a justification for the car park closure that was not exclusively focused on the environment, but was also tied to a range of personal goals like saving cash, encouraging more exercise, and having more time to read. The same beneficial effect of linking to personal goals was found when looking at other environmental behaviours such as energy efficiency and waste reduction: participants shown links between these green behaviours and a range of personal goals were more likely to say they’d be willing to adopt the green behaviours. The more the linked goals mattered to an individual, the more enthusiastic they became about the environmental behaviour.</p>
<p>In a third study the researchers showed this approach can also predict broader pro-environment behaviours: participants who felt a green behaviour (in this case, sustainable energy use) supported their own goals were more likely to sign a petition supporting government policy in that area, even after controlling for their political views and their identification with being “environmental”.</p>
<p>Looking at this study reminds us to be humble when it comes to other people’s beliefs: it’s presumptuous to expect that people will care about your priorities because you tell them to. But it reminds us to be optimistic, because everyone cares about something – we are all pursuing what we believe to be good, as Socrates pointed out – meaning that we don’t need to wear people down from their own position, but build from where they are instead. Even motivated climate skeptics may care about nice holidays on cleaner beaches, or reducing societal atomisation by shifting from car-centred societies. Rather than dig in to ideological battles, we can find mutual benefits together.</p>

            <img alt="An N. lecontei larva" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Lecontei-Larva-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Plant-feeding insects stand out from all other organisms on the planet in two ways. First, they are unusually diverse: one out of every four species is an herbivorous insect. Second, most insect species specialize on particular types of plants to the exclusion of all other plants in their habitat.</p>
<p>One explanation for the pronounced diversity and specialization in herbivorous insects is that adaptation to new host plants frequently drives the formation of new species. To test this hypothesis, we must establish a direct link between traits that contribute to host adaptation and traits that prevent successful reproduction between species.</p>
<p>To investigate the link between host adaptation and speciation, we focused on a pair of closely related pine sawfly species (common pests of pine trees in North America) that differ in the pine species that they attack. While <em>Neodiprion pinetum </em>(the white pine sawfly) only attacks white pine, <em>Neodiprion lecontei </em>(the redheaded pine sawfly) attacks several other pine species, but generally avoids white pine.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8552" style="width: 5194px;"><img alt="A hybrid larvae eating a pine needle " class="size-full wp-image-8552" height="3456" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Hybrid-Larvae.jpg" width="5184" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A hybrid larvae eating a pine needle</div><div class="attachment-image--source">R.K. Bagley</div></figure>
<p>We know that these two species can—and occasionally do—mate with one another. We have found them at the same collecting sites at the same time, and we have even collected hybrid larvae in the field. We have also crossed them in the lab and produced viable, fertile hybrid offspring. However, despite occasional hybridization, these species remain genetically, behaviorally, and morphologically distinct in the wild.</p>
<p>Together, our observations tell us that something is preventing <em>N. pinetum </em>and <em>N. lecontei </em>from merging into a single species. Some of our early crosses between these species in the lab hinted at one possible explanation. We noticed that when hybrid females laid their eggs on pines other than white pine, they hatched just fine. However, when hybrid females laid their eggs on white pine, the needles dried out and the eggs failed to hatch. In other words, something about the egg-laying behaviors of hybrid females was “off”.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8551" style="width: 256px;"><img alt="N. lecontei female uses her saw-like ovipositor to carve an egg pocket into a pine needle " class="size-full wp-image-8551" height="222" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Female-Ovipositing.png" width="246" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>N. lecontei</em> female uses her saw-like ovipositor to carve an egg pocket into a pine needle</div><div class="attachment-image--source">R.K. Bagley</div></figure>
<p>To lay their eggs, <em>Neodiprion </em>females carve individual egg-bearing pockets into the host needle, using a saw-like structure (ovipositor). In doing so, they face two challenges: circumventing the resins that protect the pine needles (which can drown eggs) and avoiding needle desiccation (which can also kill the eggs). Notably, the needles of white pine are considerably thinner and less resinous than those of the hosts typically preferred by <em>N. lecontei </em>females. We therefore predicted that <em>N. pinetum </em>females should have traits that minimize desiccation risk (e.g., fewer or smaller needle cuts), while <em>N. lecontei </em>females should have traits that circumvent host resins (e.g., deeper cuts that effectively drain resin).</p>
<p>Consistent with our predictions, we found the <em>N. pinetum </em>females laid fewer eggs per needle than <em>N. lecontei </em>females. <em>N. pinetum </em>females also never cut a resin-draining “preslit” (a non-egg bearing cut) at the base of the needle, while <em>N. lecontei </em>females always did. We also found that <em>N. pinetum </em>females had smaller, straighter “saws” than <em>N. lecontei </em>females, suggesting that these females make shallower needle cuts. Together these traits match our prediction that <em>N. pinetum </em>traits should minimize desiccation risk, while <em>N. lecontei </em>traits are expected to reduce resin flow to eggs (but increase desiccation risk).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8553" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="An ovipositor, the morphological structure that cuts egg-bearing pockets, from an N. lecontei female. " class="wp-image-8553 size-medium" height="202" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/ovipositor-300x202.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">An ovipositor, the morphological structure that cuts egg-bearing pockets, from an <em>N. lecontei</em> female.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Bendall et al. 2017</div></figure>
<p>But what do these traits look like in the hybrids? We found that hybrid females have a strong preference for white pine (like <em>N. pinetum </em>females), but have larger saws, lay more eggs per needle, and cut more preslits than <em>N. pinetum</em> females. This unfortunate combination of traits leads to needle desiccation and hatching failure, drastically reducing the ability of hybrid females to reproduce successfully. The poor egg-laying performance of hybrid females may explain, in part, how <em>N. lecontei </em>and <em>N. pinetum </em>remain distinct species despite occasional hybridization in the wild.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8548" style="width: 2477px;"><img alt="N. lecontei (top-left) females lay many closely spaced eggs per needle. N. pinetum (top-right) females lay few widely spaced eggs. Hybrid (top-middle) females have an intermediate egg laying pattern. Bottom image shows a single developing N. lecontei egg on white pine. The rest of the eggs on the needle have dried out and died " class="size-full wp-image-8548" height="1024" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Egg-collage.jpg" width="2467" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>N. lecontei</em> (top-left) females lay many closely spaced eggs per needle. <em>N. pinetum</em> (top-right) females lay few widely spaced eggs.

The rest of the eggs on the needle have dried out and died</div><div class="attachment-image--source">R.K. Bagley</div></figure>
<p>Our work demonstrates how maladaptive combinations of parental host-use traits can lead to reductions in fitness in hybrid individuals, which in turn limit gene flow between the parental species. This provides direct evidence that host adaptation contributes to the formation of new species. Additionally, our work suggests that adaptations for laying eggs on different hosts may be an especially important (but currently underappreciated) driver of speciation.</p>

While some relationships cause harm to a species — e.g. mosquitoes feeding on organisms — others are necessary for organisms to survive. As one of the more pervasive insect groups, ants are engaged in a vast range of symbiotic relationships. Army ants in particular serve as hosts to a diverse set of myrmecophiles (ant-loving species). It is believed that this is largely due to the army ant’s ability to gather large amounts of quality food, which attracts organisms to associate with the ant.</p>
<p>Army ants are a nomadic species that alternate between stages of traveling every night, and remaining at one nest site. Their nomadic lifestyle forces myrmecophiles to follow the ant colonies between sites. Beetles are among the organisms to associate with these army ant populations. They utilize various mechanisms that enable them to coexist with the army ants, including the release of chemical compounds and the display of protective body features among many. A <a href="https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-016-0010-x">new article published in <em>BMC Zoology</em></a> describes a new beetle species that travels on the backs of army ants, and investigates the mechanism by which this is accomplished.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8543" style="width: 1016px;"><img alt="beetle morphology" class="wp-image-8543 size-full" height="184" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Figure-2-beetle.png" width="1006" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Views of the body structure of <em>Nymphister kronaueri</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source">C. von Beeren and A. Tishechkin 2017, BMC Zoology</div></figure>
<p><strong>The unique attachment mechanism</strong></p>
<p>This new species, <em>Nymphister kronaueri </em>(pictured above)<em>, </em>was discovered in the rainforest at La Selva Biological Station (LSBS) in Costa Rica. The researchers for this study collected samples of the beetles along with the ants to which they were attached, and studied them further through morphological and genetic analysis. Through their analyses, these researchers were able to describe the unique method employed by these beetles that enables them to “hitchhike” with the nomadic army ants.</p>
<p>To attach to the host ant, the beetle tightly grips the ant’s body between the thorax and the abdomen (the two petiolar nodes) using its long, unique mandible. They are very particular about which part of the body they attach to, and display a clear preference to attach to those that are medium-sized. They also take their trips with the army ants at night, when the ants are traveling to their next nesting site during the emigration phase.</p>
<p><strong><em>N. kronaueri</em> morphology</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8541" style="width: 295px;"><img alt="Beetle traveling with ant" class="wp-image-8541 " height="205" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Fig-2-300x216.png" width="285" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Dorsal view of N. kronaueri traveling on the back of an army ant</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Munetoshi Maruyama</div></figure>
<p>The bodies of <em>N. kronaueri</em>  look quite similar to the stomach of army ants, making them difficult to spot when they are traveling on the ants’ backs (as seen in the picture to the right). It isn’t known why this resemblance is significant, but one possibility is to disguise the beetles from the ants themselves. This would allow the beetles to travel undetected. While there are other organisms that follow these traveling ant colonies on foot, it is believed that the unique attachment method used by <em>N. kronaueri</em>  is more advanced and saves energy.</p>
<p>Army ants have been known to associate with a great diversity of arthropods, however the <em>N. kronaueri</em> beetle has been investigated just recently. Therefore, it’s safe to assume that there is a multitude of other species waiting to be discovered. This study identified a unique mode of phoresy used by a new beetle species, so it would be beneficial to continue to research these communities. By continuing research into different army ant and arthropod species, we can provide more knowledge about the symbiotic relationships present in these communities.</p>

            <p><em>by Leyla Loued-Khenissi</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/431/1*3TSqYocpiufRyh1DLy3lMg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Controversy in scientific research is a necessary feature of scientific advancement. Less common are controversies that spill out into the public domain, replete with glib, unconditional headlines that are neither written by scientists nor intended for a discerning public. In early 2016, such a controversy boiled over from a staid scientific journal to general media outlets. The story stemmed from a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/28/7900.full">paper in <em>PNAS</em></a> that scrutinized commonly used statistical methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). that yield an increased rate of false positives. fMRI is a method based on magnetic resonance that measures blood oxygenation (BOLD) levels in the brain with the use of a very powerful magnet. The BOLD signal is a proxy for brain activity — the more oxygen is recruited, the more the brain is working. This PNAS paper promptly bolstered many scientists’ suspicions about fMRI. The findings therein provided a necessary and valuable critique of MRI analysis methods and was thus an objective plus to the field, but the most galvanizing result was a collective meltdown in the neuroimaging community over our particular method of choice. It was the <a href="http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf">zombie fish scan(dal)</a> all over again, albeit with better statistics and without the comedic element to soften the blow.</p><p>Thankfully, since (and even prior) to the <em>PNAS</em> article, several suggestions have been outlined to address fMRI’s shortcomings. Notably, the <a href="http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1">Organization for Human Brain Mapping</a> (OHBM) committee advised fMRI researchers to <a href="http://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/keep-calm-and-scan-on">‘keep calm and scan on’</a>, providing a much needed dampening to the unbridled alarm the <em>PNAS</em> article triggered.</p><p>fMRI studies suffer from small sample sizes and costs associated with scanning time in addition to limited access and time constraints, as well as, in some cases, limited recruitment possibilities from a given population, all of which currently conspire to keep sample sizes low relative to what is needed to measure a meaningful effect size. One solution to low statistical power, which has been mentioned before, is to pool resources. Given limited resources, sharing has become part of the zeitgeist in other aspects of society, but it would seem especially well suited to scientific efforts, given their sources of funding (public) and universal mandate (collective progress). That is, we ought to share data while we wait for costs to go down and access to grow; costs will go down as time goes on. Not so long ago, data storage alone was a headache whereas now it is just a nuisance. Thankfully, the state of technology is like Southern California weather; if you don’t like it right now, just wait a minute.</p><p>While discussion has been rife within the neuroimaging community since the findings of the <em>PNAS</em> article rippled out to the general public, we must consider a loss of confidence in the fMRI method that cannot be explained away with more neuroimaging jargon. The imaging community’s response to colleagues that employ other methods, as well as to the layperson, has been muted though no less necessary. We must address the doubt that exists beyond neuroimagers to avoid needlessly relegating this incredible tool to the junkyard heap of pseudoscientific methods. A first point to outline is that, plausible deniability notwithstanding, fMRI is, as far as scientific methods go, a sexy method with an even sexier output. For years it has been emblematic of cutting edge technology and the potential of the future. Slap a high- or even low-resolution image of a brain scan on a product or promotional item and one’s tech cred (at least relative to non brain researchers) soars. Few technological advances have elicited such unabashed wonder in the eyes of the general public, who are often excluded from the less visually accessible wonders of scientific advances; nobody needs a degree to understand what a lit-up brain implies. Researchers that employ other methods, which yield just as galvanizing results albeit in a less visually appealing form, may have felt a nagging feeling that fMRI was unfairly stealing their thunder. Thus, just like the beautiful starlet, MRI has always been regarded with suspicion and its shortcomings more readily vulnerable to scrutiny. In a first instance then, it is of no surprise that the method’s (deserved) criticisms be highlighted as they have been.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/839/1*CpgX4cXx-6d4Zb0eHqnmwA.png" /></figure><p><em>Figure 1: What would you rather? a) Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)+ cells in rat Ventral Tegmental Area (Courtesy I. Zalachoras, Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics, EPFL). b) EEG recording in the rat (Courtesy S. Astori, Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics, EPFL) c) 36 year old male listening to instructions, fMRI (FWE = .05) (L. Loued-Khenissi, EPFL).</em></p><p>That MRI is less valid or reliable than other tools is, however, up for debate. Most other tools of the trade measure indirect indices, assess a quantity by its proxy, investigate a hidden phenomenon by its outward observation, and all this with various sources of noise and error. Therefore we must be cautious in castigating MRI as being especially suspect relative to other methods.</p><p>In support of the continued use and confidence in MRI is the reminder that most neuro-imagers have been aware of the statistical liabilities related to the method and have been working to address known sources of statistical error with the development of different <em>a priori </em>assumptions on the brain and MR technology, as well as the application of different tests to account for trade-offs in assessing imaging output. The degree of failure uncovered highlights the increased need for caution, more data, more extensive consultation with other sub-fields of neuroscience, and further development of acquisition and analytical tools. This last route in particular provides us with an opportunity to go beyond protocol in our methodology and toy with creative solutions. Using new tools or introducing new assumptions necessarily introduces new potential sources of failure, but this is a cost that must be assumed for the sake of progress. Interestingly, the opposite has been offered as a solution as well: that is, fMRI researchers should use set, standardized methods for analyses. However, that relegates scientists to the safety zone, or to the role of technician as defined by Carl Sagan.</p><p>Another general point to make about fMRI or any other scientific endeavor is that it is difficult, it is iterative, and thus failure should be expected. All these features relate to the novelty inherent to research. The hunch and some luck can go a way towards minimizing the time it takes to answer a research question, but deadlines do not serve scientific success. Because we cannot force luck or accelerate the research process to meet contractual, academic, professional or funding deadlines, the pressure to cut corners exists. Papers and results are published, as the profession requires, but the demand for quantity outstrips their quality. This point has also been raised in the past. Here’s a thought experiment: what if there were no time constraints on research? What if, upon obtaining degrees, scientists could simply work for a salary and be provided with operating costs to perform research during their professional lives? The point above touches on a potential shift in how we view work, time and compensation in general — but that particular argument is beyond the scope of this piece. What we can call on here is for senior researchers to alter the hierarchical system of research and consider that raising the bar for scientific quality while not lowering it for quantity is unsustainable.</p><p>In the end, fMRI is an amazing piece of technology. A painless, non-invasive method capable of tracking (albeit with some drag) neural activity on <em>and in</em> human brains, while the latter are awake and well, with near immediate results. Hopefully, it will be replaced with faster, better, cheaper technology, in the near future but for now the method is peerless. The onus falls on 1) fMRI researchers to challenge themselves on how best to deploy it; to refrain from viewing it as a few-click solution and accept that there is no free lunch — we have to keep developing tools to increase signal-to-noise, control for artifacts, lower false positives. Our tasks, assumptions and analytical designs must be prepared with more thought, time and input from other research areas, and we must share data to output high quality results. 2) We must simultaneously seek solidarity within the wider community — first from our very own senior researchers, the latter whom may admonish junior scientists on data analysis methods today, but have perhaps benefitted from formerly lax thresholds for publication and who currently have more scientific capital than younger scientists to challenge the status quo. 3) We must also entreat funding agencies to provide us with more time: behavioral scientists are aware of a speed-accuracy trade-off in tasks — why would it be different in research? 4) We can and should challenge the current paradigm of science as an individual competitive sport; research questions abound, especially in the neurosciences, thus there is plenty of work for generations of inquiring minds. 5) Finally, accepting that any method of choice in neuroscientific study is just a tool would go a long way in untangling our willful misunderstanding of each other’s languages. In the end we are all studying brains and their functions; to remain monolingual, so-to-speak, is a parochial pigeonholing whose end result is creative poverty. Making use of findings obtained in other fields — not just in a cursory manner to support our data but also with the aim of sharpening our initial hypotheses — would contribute to the field as well as support a sense of inclusiveness necessary for the field to advance.</p><p><em>Leyla Loued-Khenissi is a doctoral student at EPFL’s Brain Mind Institute in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the winner of the Science Writing Competiton at the 2016 Human Brain Project Summit.

<p>If you’re in need of some renewed faith in human nature, the research literature on altruism by toddlers is a great place to look. Charming studies have shown that little children will readily <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/03/16/chimps-and-toddlers-lend-a-helping-hand/">go out of their way to help you</a>, such as picking up things you’ve dropped, or passing you stuff you can’t reach. They can even do “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/03/12/its-possible-to-be-patronised-by-a-helpful-three-year-old/">paternalistic helping</a>” which is when they ignore your specific request to help you in a way that you’ll find even more beneficial.</p>
<p>There are some evolutionarily tinged theoretical explanations for why children have these instincts: we’re a highly social species so it makes sense that we’re naturally inclined to help each other as a way to gain status and receive reciprocal favours later. A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/53/1/100/">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Psychology</em> has taken a slightly different approach, asking: what is it, in the moment, that motivates toddlers to help others? Robert Hepach and his colleagues, including Michael Tomasello who’s conducted a lot of the landmark work on the development of altruism, report that toddlers are helpful, at least in part, because, well, they enjoy it. In fact, based on a new body-language measure of their emotion, they seem to find helping someone else about as pleasurable as they find helping themselves.</p>
<p><span id="more-18946"></span></p>
<p>The researchers conducted two similar studies that involved testing nearly 100 two-year-olds (their median age was 30 months), one at a time. The basic setting was that there was some fun apparatus for rolling wooden marbles down a tube. When the toddlers ran out of marbles, a researcher who had been hanging washing, got a box down from the windowsill and struggled with another adult to get the lid off. The toddler was asked to help, and when he or she lifted the lid off the box, she found either a piece of plastic that was good for nothing (a control condition), another wooden marble (helpful for them), or a clothes peg (helpful for the clothes-hanging researcher). This was repeated a few times with the contents of the box varying on each trial.</p>
<p>Whenever the toddlers went over to the researcher to show them what they’d found, their posture was filmed via Microsoft’s Kinetic body-motion capture system (the same one used for playing video games), and later other researchers also coded footage of the toddlers based on how smiley they were and their general emotional display.</p>
<p>The main heart-warming finding is that, in terms of body language, the toddlers showed a similar elevation of their posture (chest raised, a bit like an adult display of pride) whether they’d obtained an item that was helpful for themselves or helpful for the researcher, and much more so than when they found the useless piece of plastic. Their all round emotional display, as rated by independent observers, was also similarly more positive whether they’d found an item helpful to themselves or to the researcher (as compared with the control condition), except in one of the studies they did smile more when they found a marble than when they found a clothes peg.</p>
<p>The kind of positive emotions experienced by the children might have been different when helping themselves compared with helping others. But ultimately, the researchers said the “results suggest that for young children, working for themselves and helping others are similarly rewarding,” adding “positive emotions likely provide intrinsic rewards that reinforce prosocial behaviour toward those who are dependent on our help.”</p>
<p>The results are all the more impressive if you consider that when the toddlers discovered a clothes peg, they had to deal with the disappointment of knowing that they hadn’t found a marble to drop down the tube. But based on their raised posture and all-round emotional display, the pleasure of finding something useful for someone else seemed to easily outweigh this disappointment.</p>
<p>One caveat to bear in mind is that the children hadn’t decided to help another person, rather they came upon an item that was helpful to another, so their pleasure was at this discovery. We need more research to see if they exhibit similar pleasure in choosing to help others, as compared with choosing to help themselves. For now though, let’s just turn off the daily news for a minute and bask in this study’s warm message – it seems humans are born kind.</p>

<p>The luxury microwave meal was delicious, the house is warm, work’s going OK, but you’re just not feeling very happy. Some positive psychologists believe this is because many of us in rich, Western countries spend too much of our free time on passive activities, like bingeing on Netflix and browsing Twitter, rather than on active, psychologically demanding activities, like cooking, sports or playing music, that allow the opportunity to experience “flow” – that magic juncture where your abilities only just meet the demands of the challenge. A new <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2017.1279209?journalCode=rpos20">paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em> examines this dilemma. Do we realise that pursuing more active, challenging activities will make us happier in the long-run? If so, why then do we opt to spend so much more time lazing around engaged in activities that are pleasant in the moment, but unlikely to bring any lasting fulfilment?</p>
<p><span id="more-18870"></span></p>
<p>Across two studies, L. Parker Schiffer and Tomi-Ann Roberts at the Claremont Graduate University and Colorado College, surveyed nearly 300 people (presumably US citizens, average age 33/34 years) via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website about what they thought of dozens of different activities: some passive like listening to music or watching movies, others more active and potentially flow-inducing, such as making art or meditating. Specifically, the participants rated how enjoyable, effortful, and daunting they considered the activities to be, as well as how often they engaged in each of them in a typical week. The participants also identified which activities they considered the most and least conducive to lasting happiness.</p>
<p>There was a clear pattern in the participants’ answers: they identified more effortful activities as being more associated with lasting happiness, yet they said they spent much more time on passive, relaxation-based activities, like watching TV. Looking at their other judgments, the key factor that seemed to deter participants from engaging in more active, flow-inducing activities is that they tended to be seen as particularly daunting and less enjoyable, even while being associated with lasting happiness. The more daunting an activity was deemed to be, the less frequently it was undertaken (by contrast, and to the researchers’ surprise, the perceived effort involved in the activity did not seem to be a deterrent).</p>
<p>Schiffer and Roberts consider this to be a paradox of happiness: we know which kind of activities will bring us lasting happiness, but because we see them as daunting and less enjoyable in the moment, we choose to spend much more of our time doing passive, more immediately pleasant things with our free time. Their advice is to plan ahead “to try to ease the physical transition into flow activities” to make them feel less daunting. For example, they suggest getting your gym clothes and bag ready the night before, and choosing a gym that’s close and convenient; or getting your journal and pen, or easel and paintbrushes, ready in advance.</p>
<p>The other thing they suggest is using mindfulness, meditation or some other “controlled consciousness” technique to help yourself to disregard the initial “transition costs” of a flow activity, such as the early pain of a run, and to focus instead on its pleasurable aspects and the long-term rewards.</p>
<p>“Future research is needed in order to empirically back our proposal that preplanning, prearranging, and, and controlled consciousness may aid overcoming the activation energy and transition costs that stand in the way of our true happiness,” the researchers said.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">by <a href="https://xcorr.net">xcorr.net</a> on February 08, 2017 02:00 PM.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2017/02/01/building-the-haptic-glove/">In the last post</a>, Dr. Marissé Masis and I built a vestibular sensory substitution system to help people with equilibrium problems. Our idea was to measure head tilt via a headpiece; to relay tilt information to a receiver via RF; and to communicate head tilt information on the palm via haptics embedded in a glove. You nudge your head to the right, and you get a jolt on the right side of your palm; tilt your head forward, and you receive a jolt at the front of the palm, near the fingers; etc. This kind of sensory substitution has been shown to radically improve equilibrium in people with bilateral vestibular damage (BVD).</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>We got the sensors working, as well as the calibration, RF communication, and actuation. But when it came to actually feel the head orientation through the glove, the system fell short. All you felt was a dull vibration whose location was very hard to determine.</p>
<p>We messed around haphazardly to try and improve the system, experimenting with different stimulation protocols, and increasing the strength of vibration. Eventually, we realized that the glove was vibrating sympathetically with the haptic motors, and communicated the vibration all over the palm.</p>
<h1>A faster feedback loop</h1>
<p>We had a hypothesis for why the haptics weren’t working, and we had a couple of ideas about how we might reduce the sympathetic vibrations; but what we really needed was some <em>hard data</em>. Without hard data, it’s easy to make some tweaks and fool yourself into thinking the tweaks are better. <em>With</em> hard data, we can instead iterate assuredly, picking up a 10% improvement in performance here and another 5% there, until we reach a much better design than the original. For the data scientists reading this blog, this should sound very familiar: A/B testing.</p>
<p><span id="more-6285"></span></p>
<p>I had originally intended to evaluate the system end-to-end; try the system on real people with vestibular problems, and measure the improvement as we vary a handful of design parameters. Putting your design in front of people is a great idea, but it requires a lot of resources. We therefore looked for much cheaper experiments we could run on ourselves to test and improve isolated parts of the design. That way, we could iterate faster and cheaper.</p>
<h1>Psychophysics, qu’est-ce que c’est?</h1>
<p>We turned to psychophysics. What is it?</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Psychophysics quantitatively investigates the relationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics">Source: wikipedia</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>To make the correct compensatory head movements in response to the physical sensations in the palm, you have to correctly tell which part of the palm is vibrating. Thus, we systematically mapped how difficult it is to tell apart two feedback directions under different conditions.</p>
<p>On a given trial, one motor in the glove is activated for a short period, say, the one on the left; there’s a one second wait, then another motor on the glove is turned on, say, at the front. The subject must determine whether the stimuli are the same or different. For a good haptics device, it should be easy to tell apart two well-separated stimuli.</p>
<p>How do you set it so that people can’t cheat, and always say, “yes, it’s different”? On half the trials, the stimuli were indeed the same. Therefore, to perform optimally, the subject’s responses should be split equally between “same” and “different”.</p>
<h1>Different enclosures</h1>
<p>There were a few factors we wanted to test that we knew they could influence accuracy. First, there was the issue of sympathetic vibrations. ERM motors vibrate along the x and y (axial) directions; therefore, any sort of enclosure that is rigid in the x and y directions should exacerbate sympathetic vibrations.</p>
<p>We therefore designed and 3d printed two enclosures that were designed to better isolate vibrations. First, an enclosure with the coin ERMs rotated on their side, to rotate the vibration from the x/y plane to the z plane:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Secondly, we tested an enclosure with the 4 motors in their natural orientation joined by four spring-like segments to absorb the vibration in the x/y plane:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>We secured the enclosures with 4 pieces of double-sided tape underneath the motors, and ran 256 trials in a factorial design. Marissé patiently judged whether the stimuli were the same or different, answers which I duly transcribed in the Arduino serial monitor — the psychophysics took about 3 hours, half of which was cutting the double-sided tape. We analyzed the results in R in about 10 minutes: <code>stat_summary()</code> does quick work of this kind of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/psycho-haptics">Here’s the repo with the experiment code, the csv files, and the analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Because we suspected that the enclosures might have a bit of leftover sympathetic vibration, after running each experiment, we cut the plastic segments joining the motors, and ran the psychophysics protocol again.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6314" style="width: 310px;"><img />Before cutting the segments</figure>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6316" style="width: 310px;"><img />After cutting the segments</figure>
<p>Cutting the segments turned out to be quite important for the flat enclosure:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Indeed, we found a large increase in performance (about 6% in absolute terms) after cutting the arms connecting the flat enclosure, which means we had still not fully resolved the issue of sympathetic vibrations. By contrast, for the rotated enclosure, there was no significant change in performance after removing the adjoining arms.</p>
<p>Of all the variants we tried, the best performing one was also the one with the simplest geometry: disconnected motors lying flat within the palm held with adhesive. In the next iteration of our prototype, we’ll stick with the flat configuration; we’ll use very thin connecting segments  between the pads to confer it the minimal amount of structural integrity to be easy to handle.</p>
<h1>Location on the palm</h1>
<p>We then looked at how the direction of the reference stimulus (0 degrees corresponding to the right of the hand, 90 degrees to the top of the hand, etc.) influenced accuracy:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Here, the 45 deg, 135 deg, etc. positions correspond to driving two motors simultaneously at a lower voltage, to simulate an intermediate direction between two motors. These intermediate positions turned out to be a bottleneck in our design; it’s a lot easier to tell apart stimuli when one is located in a cardinal direction. If we extrapolate the performance along cardinal directions with a sine wave, we get a prediction of what the performance might be like with 8 motors instead of 4:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>I estimate that we could get a sizable 6% absolute increase in discrimination with 8 motors instead of 4. Another thing to notice is that out of all the cardinal directions, 0 degrees, on the right side of the left palm, is noticeably less sensitive. By moving this motor a bit to the left, it might be possible to squeeze more performance out of the system.</p>
<h1>Strength of the vibration</h1>
<p>You might recall that I built a boosting circuit on the receiver to increase the strength of the drive to the motors from 3.3V all the way to 5V. Was it worth it?</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>The results unambiguously say <em>no</em>. In fact, the discriminability goes does <em>down</em> slightly as we increase the strength of the vibration. I must admit, when I saw this, I was floored.</p>
<p>The vibration receptors in the palm — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellar_corpuscle">Pacinian corpuscules</a> — are most sensitive to frequencies in the <a href="http://neurobiography.info/teaching.php?lectureid=105&amp;mode=handout">200-300Hz </a>range. Driven at high voltages (5V), ERMs can vibrate at frequencies past this optimum. By bringing the voltage down, ERMs vibrate less, but at frequencies the skin is more sensitive to. <a href="https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/application-notes/ab-029-vibration-motors-voltage-vs-frequency-vs-amplitude">Precision Microdrives</a> has excellent whitepapers on the subject of haptics actuators.</p>
<p>The whole boosting circuit, which took ages to solder, was pretty useless. As Donald Knuth famously quipped, premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>
<h1>Single vibrations versus motion vectors</h1>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00221-015-4346-1">There’s some evidence in the literature</a> that it’s easier to tell apart spatiotemporal sequences of vibrations — a sweep from bottom to top vs. a sweep from right to left — than it is to tell apart single vibrations, or taps.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6780" style="width: 1486px;"><img />In the Eagleman paper, spatiotemporal patterns were easier to identity than spatial or single motor patterns.</figure>
<p>We tested this in our setup and found that, in our setup, performance was worse with sweeps than with taps:<br />
<img /></p>
<p>How do we square this with the previous literature? In the Eagleman paper, the vibration motors were very close compared to the size of receptive fields at the stimulation location (lower back). Furthermore, they compared the performance of these sweeps to complex patterns actuated by several motors simultaneously. Given that the motors were so close together that they likely drove the same afferents, it’s not surprising that patterns underperformed compared to sweeps: the separation in the temporal dimension could compensate for the lack of separation in the spatial dimension.</p>
<p>Another potential reason is that our coin-cell ERMs have sluggish temporal responses, which make them ill-suited for communicating fine-grained temporal information. While we have nice, monotonic psychometric functions for the single tap experiments, in the sweep experiments, the performance at 180 degrees is similar to 90 degrees apart:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>That means it’s hard to tell apart an upward sweep from a downward sweep. If a person makes a compensatory movement that is 180 degrees away from the correct direction, they’ll end up in a worse position than they started; performance at 180 degree should be close to 100% for the design to work.</p>
<p>When I tested the impulse response function of these coin ERMs, and found that they really get going after ~50 ms, with some jitter; given that the haptic pulses here are only 100ms, it’s not surprising that the direction of the felt motion could be misestimated because at that jitter.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>We learned a lot from this simple series of experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a flat enclosure can work well as long as it deals with sympathetic vibrations propery</li>
<li>some parts of the palm are more sensitive than others</li>
<li>8 motors should work better than 4 motors</li>
<li>stimulation voltage is a minor parameter; a 3V drive is sufficient</li>
<li>undirected stimulation works better than directed sweeps</li>
</ul>
<p>In our baseline condition — a flat, connected enclosure, directed stimulation, strong vibration — which was most similar to the stimulation within the glove, accuracy was at about 63%. With the various tweaks that we found — as well as the addition of another 4 motors — we expect to increase the accuracy to about 83%. While A/B testing and psychophysics can feel an awful lot like bean counting when you’re doing it, the cumulative effect of small tweaks can lift a design from clunky to polished.</p>
<p>There is one parameter of the design that we didn’t try to tweak: changing the actuator type. <a href="https://blog.somaticlabs.io/how-it-works-linear-resonant-actuators/">Linear resonant actuators (LRAs)</a> are more temporally precise than ERMs, and they vibrate in the z direction rather than in the x-y direction, so they don’t have as many issues of sympathetic vibrations. On the other hand, they require dedicated drivers and are quite a bit more expensive.</p>
<p>For now, we think that simply packing more ERMs in the glove is a more promising direction than switching to LRAs, but we don’t know yet. In the next installment, we’ll pitch an LRA-based prototype against an improved, ERM-based one.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder that affects <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16713924">1% of the population over the age of 60</a>. PD is considered to be a movement disorder; the cardinal signs of the disease – tremor, rigidity and Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) – result from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and a loss of voluntary movement. Yet the non-motor symptoms of PD, often under-recognized and under-treated, severely impact the quality of patients’ lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One pathological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies, protein clumps which are comprised mainly of the aggregated protein α-synuclein, in the brain. The presence of Lewy bodies is used to confirm a PD diagnosis, but this can only be done post-mortem. However, disease pathology is also present in peripheral tissues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One prime site of peripheral pathology in PD seems to be the skin; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862733">patients with PD often present with dermatological symptoms</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089386">α-synuclein deposition in peripheral nerve terminals</a> in the skin has been reported and a higher rate of skin cancer is observed in the PD population. So, could a peripheral biomarker in the skin be used to provide a definitive diagnosis of PD and monitor progression of the disease in patients?</p>

<p>A study <a href="http://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-016-0784-z">recently published</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Neurology</a></em> sort to address this question. The researchers, led by Anu Planken, used whole transcriptomic profiling to investigate whether molecular changes observed in the nervous system in PD are also present in the skin. Skin biopsies from 12 patients with PD and 12 healthy matched controls were analyzed. RNA sequencing revealed 1074 genes that were differentially regulated between control and PD skin samples; most of the altered genes (82%) showed decreased expression in the PD samples.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, using functional pathway analysis, the researchers discovered that the genes altered in patients skin can be grouped into six broad functional categories: impaired cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, defective protein metabolism, disturbed skin homeostasis, dysfunctional nuclear processes, altered signaling and tumor pathways, and disordered immune regulation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interestingly, the largest group of genes altered in PD skin are those involved in mitochondrial function and protein metabolism; impairment of both of these biological systems are key in the central nervous system pathophysiology of PD. Changes in genes involved in skin homeostasis may also shed light on the apparent increased incidence of skin cancer in patients with PD.</p>

            <p>I am writing a <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-book-on-the-theory-of-action-potentials/">book on the theory of action potentials</a>. As I haven't published any new chapter for about 6 months, I will give a brief update on the progress of the book.</p>
<p>It turns out that writing a book is difficult (!). As I write the book, I get to question some aspects I take for granted and I realize they are actually not that simple. That I have learned a lot about biophysics. In turn, this tends to make the book more complicated, and so it requires some additional digestion work. I also realize that some important questions are just unresolved and require some research work. Finally, it is quite difficult to write a book while continuing the normal course of research. I started with a one hour per day habit, but this may not be optimal; I tend to spend the first half-hour trying to get back to the matter of the book. I am starting a new routine with two mornings twice a week. We will see how it goes!</p>
<p>These last months I have been working on the 4th chapter, on excitability of an isopotential membrane. This will contain in particular some of the material in <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850">Platkiewicz &amp; Brette (2010)</a> on the relation between biophysical parameters and threshold. I wanted to use the same theoretical approach to apply it to other aspects of the action potential (speed, peak etc), so that needed some more work. I realized that some approximations we had done could be enhanced, but the math is slightly more complicated. It is a challenge to keep this chapter simple. I also wanted to apply the theory to the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, but unfortunately it works moderately well. One reason is that the model was fitted to the full action potential and not to initiation (as in fact essentially all empirical neuron models). So in particular, H&amp;H experiments show that the Na+ conductance depends exponentially on voltage at low voltage, but their model doesn't (or approximately does with a different factor). Another reason is the K+ channel has less delay than in the actual squid axon (which they acknowledge), so there is some interaction with the initial Na+ current. So I will go with a simpler approach, using a simplified excitability model. Neurons are not isopotential anyway.</p>
<p>I am also planning to reorganize and partly rewrite chapters 2 and 3. I find the current chapter 3 (action potential of an isopotential membrane) a bit too technical. I also want to change chapter 2 (membrane polarization) to talk about alternative theories of the membrane potential (Tasaki, Ling, etc). Then I want to insert a chapter on the ionic channel theory of action potentials, which explains the theory and discusses empirical evidence, before the chapter on the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Generally, I want to simplify the exposition. But given my rather slow progress on the book so far, I will probably postpone this and first write drafts of the following chapters.</p>
<p>Finally, I have worked a bit on energy consumption and pumps, and I found out that the current treatment in the literature is not entirely satisfactory (see for example <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598490">my comments on a classical paper</a> on the subject). It turns out that it is a pretty complicated problem (especially systems of pumps).</p>
<p>In brief, I am trying to finish a first version of the chapter on excitability of an isopotential membrane, hopefully within one month.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?juliagottwald">Julia Gottwald</a></p>
<p>Coming up with the perfect recipe for crisps or the ideal marketing strategy for a soft drink used to depend on explicit measures. In focus groups and surveys, consumers were asked which product tasted best or which commercial was most appealing. But these measures are imperfect: consumers may choose to hide their true opinions or they might not be fully aware of their own preferences. Food and drinks companies need more objective measures. Currently their best hope is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p>
<p>The idea is that somewhere in the brain, a “buy button” is hidden away: a region (or combination of regions) that influence your purchase decision. The promise of neuromarketing is that one day, we will be able to find this region, record its activity when you watch an ad or sample a product, and then predict how well this product will sell. So far, the success has been limited. But in a recent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916301410">study</a> in <em>NeuroImage</em>, Simone Kühn from the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf and her colleagues claim to have found “multiple ‘buy buttons’ in the brain”.</p>
<p><span id="more-18846"></span></p>
<p>The researchers showed six different ads for the chocolate bar “Duplo” to 18 healthy women while they underwent fMRI. In these ads, the chocolate bar was presented either next to the face of a woman; a couple; a group of people; in two hands; in two hands and with an additional slogan; or next to a toothbrush (the toothbrush was meant to serve as a control condition).</p>
<p>The researchers measured brain activity during the adverts in eight brain regions thought to be involved in making purchase decisions. Then they entered these measures into a formula that weighed key areas such as the nucleus accumbens and medial orbitofrontal cortex more strongly than others, which were expected to have less influence. Some areas, such as dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, were even weighed negatively, assuming that higher activity in these regions would make a purchase less likely. The team then used this “fMRI sales forecast value” to predict the sales of the chocolate bar. After the scan, the women were also asked which ad they liked most.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers ranked the six ads in different ways: according to the fMRI forecast; according to the women’s explicit preferences; and according to actual sales in a real German supermarket where the chocolate bar was sold in a display showing one of the six different ads, with a different advert used each week. In total, more than 63,000 customers were recorded, of whom 317 bought the chocolate bars. The six weeks were not consecutive and were carefully chosen to be uninfluenced by holidays and promotional periods.</p>
<p>The fMRI-based forecast was a surprisingly accurate predictor of sales, while self-reports performed poorly. The two ads which did best in the supermarket (chocolate bar in front of a group and next to a woman) were also predicted to be most successful by the fMRI sales forecast value. In contrast, the two most-liked ads from the self-reports (hands without text and, somewhat surprisingly, the toothbrush) were actually the least and third to least successful ones.</p>
<p>These seem like impressive results for the field of neuromarketing, but I had a number of reservations. For instance, while the authors tried to justify their selection of brain areas, arguing that these regions had previously been implicated in neuromarketing research, it is not entirely clear how they came up with their specific formula to calculate the “fMRI sales forecast value”. A clearer rationale would have been helpful.</p>
<p>The new results also contradict <a href="http://journals.ama.org/doi/10.1509/jmr.13.0593?code=amma-site">earlier studies</a>, which found that asking people directly about their preferences was far superior over modern measures such as fMRI. Note though that in this study, people were asked which ad they <em>liked</em> best. But <em>liking</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2756052/">does not equal</a> <em>wanting</em>. You might not like an ad very much, but it could still increase your desire for a product. A more useful question for the self-report part of this study would have been: “How much does this ad make you want to buy the chocolate?”</p>
<p>Also, there was a potential effect of the order in which the ads were displayed in the shops. The most successful ad, which was also predicted to be most successful by the fMRI based forecast, was the one that was used first in the German supermarket. The authors argue that most customers would have bought and eaten Duplo before, since it is a very popular sweet in Germany. However, it is easy to see how a new display in your local supermarket could encourage you to buy this product, regardless of the ad attached to it. Future studies should take this effect into account and maybe start with a shop display without any ads in the first week.</p>
<p>But perhaps most concerning is that one of the study authors, Enrique Strelow, is only listed in the paper as a member of the Justus-Liebig University of Gießen, even though he is also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-strelow-41826a126">Head of Shopper Communication at Ferrero</a>, the company that makes the chocolate bar Duplo. This is a clear conflict of interest, which was not disclosed in the paper. From reading the article, it is clear that the authors had cooperated with Ferrero, since they had early access to the advertisements which would later be placed in the supermarket. However, one of the authors being an employee of this company is a different thing altogether. Since these conflicts of interests can implicitly or explicitly influence study design, analysis, and result presentation, it is common practice to disclose any links to industry. Why this information was not made publicly available for this paper is unclear.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the study highlights how neuroimaging-based market research in relatively small groups could one day reliably predict product sales on a large scale. Giving companies access to such sensitive data holds the potential for abuse and should therefore be carefully regulated. While there are strict regulations for fMRI based research in academic settings, such rules are lacking for industry applications. A public debate about the merits and dangers of neuromarketing is therefore more and more <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sex-Lies-Brain-Scans-reveals/dp/0198752881">pressing</a>.</p>

 The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system.

 Metabolic pathways that contribute to adiposity and ageing are activated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) axis. However, known mTORC1–S6K1 targets do not account for observed loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that there are additional downstream effectors of this pathway. Here we identify glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) as an mTORC1–S6K1 target that contributes to adiposity and ageing. Phosphorylation of EPRS at Ser999 by mTORC1–S6K1 induces its release from the aminoacyl tRNA multisynthetase complex, which is required for execution of noncanonical functions of EPRS beyond protein synthesis. To investigate the physiological function of EPRS phosphorylation, we generated Eprs knock-in mice bearing phospho-deficient Ser999-to-Ala (S999A) and phospho-mimetic (S999D) mutations. Homozygous S999A mice exhibited low body weight, reduced adipose tissue mass, and increased lifespan, similar to S6K1-deficient mice and mice with adipocyte-specific deficiency of raptor, an mTORC1 constituent. Substitution of the EprsS999D allele in S6K1-deficient mice normalized body mass and adiposity, indicating that EPRS phosphorylation mediates S6K1-dependent metabolic responses. In adipocytes, insulin stimulated S6K1-dependent EPRS phosphorylation and release from the multisynthetase complex. Interaction screening revealed that phospho-EPRS binds SLC27A1 (that is, fatty acid transport protein 1, FATP1), inducing its translocation to the plasma membrane and long-chain fatty acid uptake. Thus, EPRS and FATP1 are terminal mTORC1–S6K1 axis effectors that are critical for metabolic phenotypes.

 Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa) is a highly nutritious grain identified as an important crop to improve world food security. Unfortunately, few resources are available to facilitate its genetic improvement. Here we report the assembly of a high-quality, chromosome-scale reference genome sequence for quinoa, which was produced using single-molecule real-time sequencing in combination with optical, chromosome-contact and genetic maps. We also report the sequencing of two diploids from the ancestral gene pools of quinoa, which enables the identification of sub-genomes in quinoa, and reduced-coverage genome sequences for 22 other samples of the allotetraploid goosefoot complex. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of the transcription factor likely to control the production of anti-nutritional triterpenoid saponins found in quinoa seeds, including a mutation that appears to cause alternative splicing and a premature stop codon in sweet quinoa strains. These genomic resources are an important first step towards the genetic improvement of quinoa.

 Proper regulation and management of energy, substrate diversity and quantity, as well as macromolecular synthesis and breakdown processes, are fundamental to cellular and organismal survival and are paramount to health. Cellular and multicellular organization are defended by the immune response, a robust and critical system through which self is distinguished from non-self, pathogenic signals are recognized and eliminated, and tissue homeostasis is safeguarded. Many layers of evolutionarily conserved interactions occur between immune response and metabolism. Proper maintenance of this delicate balance is crucial for health and has important implications for many pathological states such as obesity, diabetes, and other chronic non-communicable diseases.

 The toxicity of misfolded proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction are pivotal factors that promote age-associated functional neuronal decline and neurodegenerative disease. Accordingly, neurons invest considerable cellular resources in chaperones, protein degradation, autophagy and mitophagy to maintain proteostasis and mitochondrial quality. Complicating the challenges of neuroprotection, misfolded human disease proteins and mitochondria can move into neighbouring cells via unknown mechanisms, which may promote pathological spread. Here we show that adult neurons from Caenorhabditis elegans extrude large (approximately 4 μm) membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that can contain protein aggregates and organelles. Inhibition of chaperone expression, autophagy or the proteasome, in addition to compromising mitochondrial quality, enhances the production of exophers. Proteotoxically stressed neurons that generate exophers subsequently function better than similarly stressed neurons that did not produce exophers. The extruded exopher transits through surrounding tissue in which some contents appear degraded, but some non-degradable materials can subsequently be found in more remote cells, suggesting secondary release. Our observations suggest that exopher-genesis is a potential response to rid cells of neurotoxic components when proteostasis and organelle function are challenged. We propose that exophers are components of a conserved mechanism that constitutes a fundamental, but formerly unrecognized, branch of neuronal proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control, which, when dysfunctional or diminished with age, might actively contribute to pathogenesis in human neurodegenerative disease and brain ageing.
