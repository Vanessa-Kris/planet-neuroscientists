              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/denisovan-girl-fossil-tooth-hominid-laos-anthropology">A Denisovan girl’s fossil tooth may have been unearthed in Laos</a></h4>

              
                <p>A molar tooth from Southeast Asia probably belonged to a member of a cryptic group of Stone Age hominids called Denisovans, researchers say.</p>



<p>If so, this relatively large tooth joins only a handful of fossils from Denisovans, who are known from ancient DNA pegging them as close Neandertal relatives.</p>



<p>Analyses of the tooth’s internal structure and protein makeup indicate that the molar came from a girl in the <em>Homo</em> genus. She died between the ages of 3½ and 8½, paleoanthropologist Fabrice Demeter of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues say.</p>





<p>A Denisovan molar that dates to at least 160,000 years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-denisovan-hominid-fossils-dna-top-science-stories-2019-yir">was previously found on the Tibetan Plateau</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29923-z">newly discovered tooth</a> strongly resembles that other molar, indicating that the new find is probably Denisovan too, the team reports May 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Before the Tibetan Plateau tooth, all known fossils from the mysterious hominids had been found in Siberia.</p>



<p>Estimated ages of sediment and fossil animal bones in Tam Ngu Hao 2, or Cobra Cave, in Laos place the tooth found there between 164,000 and 131,000 years old.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that the Cobra Cave tooth represents a Neandertal or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-first-known-child-neandertal-and-denisovan">someone with Denisovan and Neandertal ancestry</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/18</em>), Demeter says. His group hopes to extract DNA from the fossil, which could clarify its evolutionary status.</p>



<p>It now appears that at least five <em>Homo</em> species, including Denisovans, inhabited Southeast Asia between roughly 150,000 and 40,000 years ago, Demeter says. Others include <em>Homo sapiens</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>Homo erectus</em></a> (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines"><em>Homo luzonensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought"><em>Homo floresiensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>), also known as hobbits, he contends.</p>



<p>Still, some researchers regard Denisovans as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals">one of several closely related, ancient <em>Homo</em> populations</a> rather than a distinct species (<em>SN: 6/25/21</em>). Whatever evolutionary ID Denisovans actually held, the Cobra Cave tooth adds to suspicions that the hominids inhabited Southeast Asia’s tropical forests as well as Central Asia’s cold mountain ranges and Siberia.</p>

<p>In my opinion, patient education plays a vital role in planning for dialysis options in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).  It involves more than just having a 5-minute discussion during an office visit or providing patients with handouts.  It requires an in-depth discussion about what the different dialysis options are, how patients can manage their symptoms, what patients can do to improve their outcomes, and how they can be engaged in their healthcare.  Patients who are progressing to ESKD and looking at dialysis or conservative care are vulnerable to numerous complications of their disease and poor outcomes can occur.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-022-02800-z"> Wang’s article</a>, they examine the impact of a MDPC on the risks of post-dialysis peritonitis, technique failure and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.  The MDPC team consisted of nephrologists, dietitians and nurses.  They provided standardized pre-dialysis education according to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.07.015">Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines</a>.  They did not demonstrate any significance between the MDPC group and non-MDPC group in rates for development of the first episode of peritonitis, technique failure, or mortality.  But PD patients with diabetes, who received MDPC, were found to have a lower risk of mortality.</p>
<p>The impact of pre-dialysis education has been studied by other groups.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01860-9">Chou et al.</a> found that pre-ESKD care education for those with CKD stage G3-5 was associated with improved patient outcomes, including the incidence of hemodialysis and hospitalization events and a higher overall survival rate.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.02.334">Koch-Weser et al.</a> examined multiple patient education practices on content and accessibility or whether they support shared-decision making for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.  The study highlighted the great variability in education delivery, follow-up, and outcomes reported.  Additionally, the education programs were not consistently following best practices related to health literacy or supporting shared-decision making.</p>
<p>Nephrology guidelines, such as Kidney Disease:  Improving Global Outcomes (<a href="https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KDIGO_2012_CKD_GL.pdf">KDIGO</a>) and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), recommend education for patients but there is no guidance on the format or structure of how to provide this education.  There is probably not a single optimal format and providers will need to gauge the learning styles of patients and tailor programs.  The study by Wang et al. brings up two areas that are worth studying further.  First, the long-term impact of pre-dialysis education on mortality benefits continued post-dialysis initiation.  Second, those factors specifically related to the dialysis procedure may not be retained long-term and perhaps ensuring there is a multidisciplinary approach to training would be important to reinforce this additional knowledge.</p>
<p>As long as education is provided to patients, I do not believe there is a specific format needed.   A program should offer many forms of education since adult patients have different learning styles.  Furthermore, ensuring that the same level of education is provided not only in pre-dialysis education but also once a patient has started dialysis.</p>
<p>What are you doing to educate your patients?</p>

<p>It was a privilege to attend PAS 2022 this year. It was invaluable to be able to connect with our community face to face and meet our esteemed</p>
<p>Editorial Board Members throughout the weekend. The caliber of research presented was truly staggering and I was very pleased to see and meet several of our authors whom presented their work at PAS. A personal highlight was listening to our author Prof. Samir Gupta present his latest Randomized Clinical Trial for which their Study Protocol was published with us at BMC Pediatrics entitled “<a class="is-external" href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-021-02558-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baby-OSCAR trial: Outcome after Selective early treatment for Closure of patent ductus ARteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial</a>&#8220;. It is well known that randomized clinical trials in any field are notoriously difficult to plan, fund and conduct and so it was a pleasure to have the opportunity to consider their excellent study protocol at the journal and hear about their subsequent results at PAS 2022.</p>

<p><em>“Contribution of Immature Control to the respiratory morbidity of Preemies was one of the highlights of PAS 2022 that deserves to be commented on.  </em></p>
<p><em>In the last years the incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) has been progressively high, and it may be due in part to immature ventilatory control, contributing to hypoxemia. The Prematurity Related Ventilatory Control (PreVent Study) aim to elucidate individualized cardiopulmonary phenotypes and mechanisms of ventilatory control contributing to adverse respiratory outcomes in premature infants using different biomarkers to predict respiratory outcomes: Physiologic providing results from the PreVent Study focused on the natural history of disordered respiratory control in preterms  and long term morbidities; clinical characterizing the relationship between apnea, bradycardia and hypoxemic episodes as predictive parameters for later respiratory morbidities in this cohort study. The longitudinal disease burden to that time point were: 7, 14, 28 days and 32 wPMA. IH (desaturation threshold Sp02 &lt; 90%; IH &lt;90) average duration of each episode is a major physiologic predictor at all evaluated time points; AUC of 0.74 at day 7; increasing to 0.81 by day 28 and 0.84 by 32SW PMA. So, respiratory morbidity in former premies is not just BPD and clinical and physiological parameters, as periodic breathing, desaturations episodes, bradycardia, apnea, are early predictors. Clinicians need to pay attention to bedside data: Continuous ECG, heart rate, respiratory, and oxygen saturation.”</em></p>

He provides care to critically ill children within the pediatric intensive care unit at Mott Children’s Hospital and his research interests focus on the optimization of health care delivery to critically ill and injured children through bridging the gap between evidence and practice, in-depth evaluation of the processes of care, and rigorous assessment of patient outcomes.</p>
<p><em>“The highlight for me during the recently concluded PAS 2022 meetings was a workshop entitled: Critical Race Theory in Medicine: Origins, Applications, &amp; Future Translation to Education, Clinical Practice, &amp; Research</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop was eye-opening and highly informative. I learnt how the incorporation of critical race theory – a framework for enhanced understanding of the origin of, and processes that, propagate racism, injustice, and inequities in society – into the realm of medical education would be a profoundly robust and immutable boon to efforts to address the causes of health inequities, racism, and injustice in medicine.</em></p>
<p><em>It was great to learn how critical race theory could address the shortcomings observed in the time-honored biomedical and social determinants of health models currently used to explain the aforementioned deeply rooted problems of racial disparities in healthcare delivery and outcomes.”</em></p>

<p>Professor of neonatology and experienced clinical trial researcher. She is currently a Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, where she is the Director of Clinical Research for Neonatology.</p>
<p><em>“A presentation that really piqued my interest was presented by Dr. Colm Travers of the University of Alabama. This was a study of permissive hypercapnia in preterm infants &gt;7days of age but as young as 22 weeks&#8217; gestation.  Infants were randomized to PCO2 of  40-55 vs 60-75.  Infants in the higher PCO2 group had more alive ventilator-free days with no apparent increase in morbidity.  The study was relatively small and many questions remain, but the concept is intriguing and definitely requires further study.”</em></p>

<p><em>“1) A presentation by Rachana Singh “Short term Outcomes of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) – A Comparison of Two Approaches”    This Massachusetts QI initiative found that Eat, Sleep, and Console and Modified Finnegan Scoring produced the same length of stay, opioid replacement use, or length of treatment.  The major factors impacting short-term outcomes were rooming-in, skin-to-skin care, and provision of mother’s milk.</em></p>
<p><em>2) The presentation by Dr. Katz from Amsterdam, “Validation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia definitions in long term neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes in preterm infants”, was important and noteworthy.   The 3 definitions, 2001 NIH, 2018 NIH, and 2019 Jensen proposed guidelines had similar discriminative power for neurodevelopmental/death and respiratory outcomes at 2 and 5 years in this Dutch cohort.”</em></p>

<p><em>“The PAS Meeting is always a great opportunity to update knowledge and to meet International peers that over the years have become friends. In this context, this year was especially nice. With a lot of green buttons around my identification tag and as a good Brazilian, I could hug and kiss a lot of friends that I was “zooming” for the last two years.  On the “meeting” side, it is much better to be personally in the conference and to listen and look at the presenters instead of being at home and keep being distracted by thousands of daily problems that have nothing to do with the conference.  As one of the highlights, I would like to point out Dr. Heresh Kirpalani’s conference, when he received the Avery Award. His conference was an excellent argument for the benefits of Evidence Based Medicine and the importance of optimal methodologic design of clinical trials. Wherever is the result of the trial (whether it confirms or not our hypothesis) they help to advance knowledge in the field. Also, the emotional ending of Dr Kirpalani’s conference is an eloquent sign that advances in knowledge are never made by one individual alone, but rather, they are the result of building strong relationships throughout our professional life.</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-norms-covid-masks-risk-conformity-normal">Pressure to conform to social norms may explain risky COVID-19 decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The pandemic has entered a murky stage, and social norms are quickly shifting, something I’ve thought a lot about lately. Many people are testing at home, or not at all. Here in Vermont, where I live, you can pick up a type of PCR test that can be taken at home. But state officials both here and elsewhere are no longer carefully monitoring the results of these tests, which means that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">actual spread of&nbsp;coronavirus</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. population remains unclear (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a few weeks, rumors of a stealth COVID-19 wave have been circulating both in the media and on my Twitter feed. Now cases and hospitalizations are rising, as are the levels of&nbsp;<a href="https://biobot.io/data">coronavirus&nbsp;in wastewater</a>.&nbsp;That suggests that more cases, and ultimately deaths, could follow.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Even with rising caseloads and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-tracker">vaccination rate that has flatlined</a>&nbsp;at about 66 percent of the eligible population, the American public has largely begun to move on from the COVID-19 crisis. People are shedding their masks, eating out, attending concerts, traveling to far-flung locations, having large, indoor weddings and doing all the social things that people tend to do when left to their own devices.<br><br>The 2,600-person&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/05/covid-white-house-correspondents-dinner-guests-positive/">White House Correspondents’ Association dinner</a>&nbsp;late last month is a case in point. Just as host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqfnHU9i38E">Trevor Noah prophesied</a>,&nbsp;many of those in attendance have since tested positive for COVID-19, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and reporters from NBC, ABC, the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post,&nbsp;</em>Politico and other media outlets. And those who almost certainly knew better — cue White House&nbsp;Coronavirus&nbsp;Response Coordinator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/06/fauci-correspondents-dinner-covid-message-00030767?">Ashish Jha</a>&nbsp;— nonetheless made an appearance.<br><br>Myriad quirks related to human behavior undoubtedly underpin these arguably poor choices. The Decision Lab website has a list of the&nbsp;<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases">biases and mental shortcuts</a>&nbsp;people use to make decisions. The one that caught my eye is social norms. This particular quirk outlines what behaviors people deem appropriate in a given situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I started thinking about social norms while writing a feature on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-diet-western-norm-change-food-preferences">how to get people in the United States to eat less meat</a>&nbsp;when the practice is so, well, normal (<em>SN: 5/11/22</em>). Social norms, my research informed me, vary with the group one is hanging out with and one’s environs. “We&nbsp;<a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/society/how-social-norms-complicate-behavioral-research">rapidly switch our perspective</a> depending on the context of the situation we find ourselves in,” writes marketing expert John Laurence on the Decision Lab site.</p>



<p>I might have found this idea of rapid switching suspect had I not recently experienced the phenomenon. My husband’s Disney-phile brother and his wife had been planning a family reunion in Disney World in Florida since the start of the pandemic. And I, a curmudgeonly sort not prone to feeling the magic, long ago agreed to go on the condition that other people do all the planning. And so it was, after multiple COVID-related postponements, that my kids, my husband and I landed in Orlando on a blisteringly hot April day.&nbsp;<br><br>Disney normal, I soon learned, bore little resemblance to Vermont normal. This was obvious immediately from people’s attire. All around me parents and kids dressed in coordinated outfits and matching Mickey Mouse ears. (Apologies to my kids — your mom missed the fashion memo.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social norms almost certainly arose to foster cohesion among our earliest ancestors, who needed solidarity to hunt large prey, share limited resources and ward off predators and enemy tribes. In-group norms also provide humans with a sense of belonging, which research suggests is vital for our overall health. A meta-analysis of more than 3.4 million people followed for an average of seven years showed that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing-psychological-fallout">likelihood of dying</a>&nbsp;during the study period increased by 26 percent for participants who reported feeling alone (<em>SN: 3/29/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, then, one of the strongest drivers of human behavior is to seek out belonging. At Disney, that quest means blocking out the reality that exists just outside the fiefdom. Wars, climate crises, political fighting and the like have no place within those magical walls. Nor do reminders of a global health crisis that, according to the latest World Health Organization estimates, has thus far&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic">killed nearly 15 million people</a> worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within Disney’s walls, throngs of&nbsp;<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/experience-updates/">mostly maskless tourists</a>&nbsp;packed onto iconic rides and into restaurants. When halfway through our trip, a Florida judge ruled that masks could not be mandated on public transit, nary a mask was to be seen on buses shuttling people to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center. And everywhere, all the time, people seemed to be coughing, sniffling or blowing their noses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a science reporter covering COVID-19, I certainly knew that I should keep my mask on. And yet, my resolve soon faltered. My kids pointed out that no one else was masking, not even my typically rule-following relatives. Donning my mask meant confessing that I was not reveling in the sparkle and glitz and magic and making all too obvious to my beloved extended family that I did not, in fact, belong. I kept my face covering in my pocket. &nbsp;<br><br>Humans’ tendency toward conformity is not all bad. In a now classic study from the 1980s, researchers investigated how to reduce water consumption in drought-prone California. Signs at the University of California, Santa Cruz asking students to turn off the shower while soaping up led to only 6 percent compliance. So researchers recruited male students to serve as norm-setting role models. These role models would hang out in the communal shower until they heard another student come in, and then soap up with the water off. When one role model soaped with the shower off, roughly&nbsp;<a href="http://triggered.stanford.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http://baywood.stanford.clockss.org/BWES/BAWOOD_BWES_12_3/UBD54Y9B61EFWUM6.pdf&amp;">half of the unwitting students</a>&nbsp;also began turning off their faucets at soaping time. Compliance&nbsp;jumped to 67 percent when two role models followed the sign.</p>



<p>But conformity can also distort how we make decisions. For instance, in the summer of 2020, when the pandemic was still new, researchers asked 23,000 people in Mexico to predict how a fictional woman named Mariana would decide whether or not to attend a birthday party. Most participants believed Mariana should not attend. But when they read a sentence suggesting her friends would attend or that others approved of the party, their predictions that&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247454">Mariana would also go</a>&nbsp;increased by 25 percent, researchers reported in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My decision to conform to Disney normal ended predictably — with a positive COVID-19 test. After weeks of coughing and sleepless nights, though, my frustration is less directed at myself than at political leaders who so blithely ignore both epidemiology and human behavior research and tell us to live like it’s 2019. It’s not. Nor is it 2020 or 2021. It’s the murky year known as 2022. And the rules of behavior that bolster our social norms — such as role models who refrain from large, indoor, unmasked gatherings, and leaders who uphold mask mandates on public transit to protect the most vulnerable — should reflect this liminal space.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>If we have strong political leanings, it’s likely that we’ll have similarly strong feelings about our opponents. We might think they’re misguided or stupid; we might consider them self-serving and selfish; or, worst of all, we may believe they’re actually evil.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221089451">new study</a> published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> explores this question: do we think our opponents are evil or just stupid? While the common understanding is that liberals see conservatives as evil and conservatives see liberals as stupid, the team finds that whatever our political affiliation, we’re more likely to see each other as unintelligent than immoral.</p>



<span id="more-46228"></span>



<p>In the first study, 481 American participants indicated where they would place themselves on a political scale running from very liberal to very conservative. They then thought about conservatives and liberals as a group, and indicated how many people in the group could be described using 12 different adjectives. Six of the adjectives were related to stupidity (e.g. illogical, unreasonable) and six to immorality (e.g. bad moral character, willing to harm others).</p>



<p>The results showed that, unsurprisingly, people were more likely to rate those with different political ideologies to their own as more unintelligent and more immoral than those with the same ideology. Ratings of unintelligence were also significantly higher than ratings of immorality, suggesting people see their opponents as stupid rather than evil. This was replicated in a second study, which took place after a midterm election in North Carolina.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants were instead asked to what extent they felt the average Democrat of Republican was stupid or evil, rating them on the same adjectives as in the previous studies. The framing of the question was therefore about identity rather than ideology. Again, participants rated members of their political ingroup as less stupid and less evil than members of their political outgroup. And again, participants rated political opponents as more stupid than evil.</p>



<p>The final study took a different tack, asking what people <em>think</em> Democrats and Republicans think of one another. Participants indicated how they believed their own ingroup sees the outgroup and vice versa, how their ingroup sees themselves, and how the outgroup sees themselves as well — regardless of their own perceptions. They then provided their own ratings of the in- and outgroup’s unintelligence and immorality.</p>



<p>Both Democrats and Republican participants believed — correctly — that Republicans would see Democrats as more stupid than evil, though they overestimated how negative their views would be. Democrats also accurately believed fellow Democrats would see Republicans as more unintelligent than immoral — but Republicans felt Democrats saw them as equally stupid and evil. Again, this group overestimated how negative Democrats saw them.</p>



<p>So, overall, the idea that liberals see conservatives as evil while conservatives see liberals as stupid did not bear out — participants of all political ideologies tended to see each other as stupid rather than evil.</p>



<p>The studies also found that we overestimate how negatively our political opponents view us. This misunderstanding, the team suggests, could provide a way of crossing divides or reducing conflict, offering some potential to reconcile with those with different ideologies by moving past assumptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">High-energy neutrinos may come from black holes ripping apart stars</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a star gets too close to a black hole, sparks fly. And, potentially, so do subatomic particles called neutrinos.</p>



<p>A dramatic light show results when a supermassive black hole rips apart a wayward star. Now, for the second time, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2a075Y64Ze91ba71d60a829359ac583e5abb498d8">a high-energy neutrino has been spotted</a> that may have come from one of these “tidal disruption events,” researchers report in a study accepted in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>These lightweight particles, which have no electric charge, careen across the cosmos and can be detected upon their arrival at Earth. The origins of such zippy neutrinos are a big mystery in physics. To create them, conditions must be just right to drastically accelerate charged particles, which would then produce neutrinos. Scientists have begun lining up likely candidates for cosmic particle accelerators. In 2020, researchers reported the first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-black-hole-high-energy-neutrino">neutrino linked to a tidal disruption event</a> (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>). Other neutrinos have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-blazar-icecube">tied to active galactic nuclei</a>, bright regions at the centers of some galaxies (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>





<p>Discovered in 2019, the tidal disruption event reported in the new study stood out. “It was extraordinarily bright; it’s really one of the brightest transients ever seen,” says astroparticle physicist Marek Kowalski of Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, or DESY, in Zeuthen, Germany.</p>



<p>Transients are short-lived flares in the sky, such as tidal disruption events and exploding stars called supernovas. Further observations of the brilliant outburst revealed that it shone in infrared, X-rays and other wavelengths of light.</p>



<p>Roughly a year after the flare’s discovery, the Antarctic neutrino observatory IceCube spotted a high-energy neutrino. By tracing the particle’s path backward, researchers determined that the neutrino came from the flare’s vicinity.</p>



<p>The matchup between the two events could be a coincidence. But when combined with the previous neutrino that was tied to a tidal disruption event, the case gets stronger. The probability of finding two such associations by chance is only about 0.034 percent, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s still not clear how tidal disruption events would produce high-energy neutrinos. In one proposed scenario, a jet of particles flung away from the black hole could accelerate protons, which could interact with surrounding radiation to produce the speedy neutrinos.</p>



<p>‘We need more data … in order to say that these are real neutrino sources or not,” says astrophysicist Kohta Murase of Penn State University, a coauthor of the new study. If the link between the neutrinos and tidal disruption events is real, he’s optimistic that researchers won’t have to wait too long. “If this is the case, we will see more.”</p>



<p>But scientists don’t all agree that the flare was a tidal disruption event. Instead, it could have been an <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac5ab1">especially bright type of supernova</a>, astrophysicist Irene Tamborra and colleagues suggest in the April 20 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>In such a supernova, it’s clear how energetic neutrinos could be produced, says Tamborra, of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. Protons accelerated by the supernova’s shock wave could collide with protons in the medium that surrounds the star, producing other particles that could decay to make neutrinos.</p>



<p>It’s only recently that observations of high-energy neutrinos and transients have improved enough to enable scientists to find potential links between the two. “It’s exciting,” Tamborra says. But as the debate over the newly detected neutrino’s origin shows, “at the same time, it’s uncovering many things that we don’t know.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-monkey-hybrid-borneo-habitat">A ‘mystery monkey’ in Borneo may be a rare hybrid. That has scientists worried</a></h4>

              
                <p>Six years ago, tour guide Brenden Miles was traveling down the Kinabatangan River in the Malaysian part of Borneo, when he spotted an odd-looking primate he had never seen before. He snapped a few pictures of the strange monkey and, on reaching home, checked his images.</p>



<p>“At first, I thought it could be a morph of the silvered leaf monkey,” meaning a member of the species with rare color variation, Miles says. But then he noticed other little details. “Its nose was long like that of a proboscis monkey, and its tail was thicker than that of a silvered leaf [monkey],” he says. He posted a picture of the animal on Facebook and forgot all about it.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of that photo and others suggests that the “mystery monkey” is a hybrid of two distantly related primate species that share the same fragmented habitat.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10764-022-00293-z">putative offspring</a> was produced when a male proboscis monkey (<em>Nasalis larvatus)</em> mated with a female silvered leaf monkey (<em>Trachypithecus cristatus)</em>, researchers suggest April 26 in the <em>International Journal of Primatology</em>. And that conclusion has the scientists worried about the creature’s parent species.</p>



<p>Hybridization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chinese-mountain-cats-dna-domestic-genetics">between closely related organisms</a> has been observed in captivity and occasionally in the wild (<em>SN: 7/23/21)</em>. “But hybridization across genera, that’s very rare,” says conservation practitioner Ramesh Boonratana, the regional vice-chair for Southeast Asia for the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s primate specialist group.</p>





<p>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation caused by expanding palm oil plantations along the Kinabatangan River could explain how the possible hybrid came to be, says primatologist Nadine Ruppert.</p>



<p>“Different species — even from the same genus — when they share a habitat, they may interact with each other, but they may usually not mate. This kind of cross-genera hybridization happens only when there is some ecological pressure,” says Ruppert, of the Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang Island.</p>



<p>The state of Sabah, where Kinabatangan River is located, lost about <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101654">40 percent of its forest cover from 1973 to 2010</a>, with logging and palm oil plantations being the main drivers of deforestation, a study in 2014 found.</p>





<p>“In certain areas, both [monkey] species are confined to small forest fragments along the river,” Ruppert says. This leads to competition for food, mates and other resources. “The animals cannot disperse and, in this case, the male of the larger species — the proboscis monkey — can easily displace the male silvered leaf monkey.”</p>



<p>Since 2016, there have been some more documented sightings of the mystery monkey, though these have been sporadic. The infrequent sightings and the COVID-19 pandemic has, for now, prevented researchers from gathering fecal samples for genetic analysis to reveal the monkey’s identity. Instead, Ruppert and colleagues compared images of the possible hybrid with those of the parent species, both visually as well as by using limb ratios. “If the individual was from one of the two parent species, all its measurements would be similar to that of one species,” Ruppert says. “But that is not the case with this animal.”</p>



<p>A photograph of a male proboscis monkey mating with a female silvered leaf monkey, along with anecdotes from boat operators and tour guides about a single male proboscis monkey hanging around a troop of female silvered leaf monkeys, has added further weight to the researchers’ conclusion.</p>



<p>The mystery monkey is generating a lot of excitement in the area, but Ruppert is concerned for the welfare of both proposed parent species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies proboscis monkeys as endangered and silvered leaf monkeys as vulnerable. “The hybrid is gorgeous, but we don’t want to see more of them,” Ruppert says. “Both species should have a large enough habitat, dispersal opportunities and enough food to conduct their natural behaviors in the long term.”</p>



<p>Increasing habitat loss or fragmentation in Borneo and elsewhere as a result of changing land uses or climate change could lead to more instances of mating — or at least, attempts at mating — between species or even genera, Boonratana says.</p>



<p>The mystery monkey was last photographed in September of 2020 with swollen breasts and holding a baby, suggesting that the animal is a fertile female. That’s another surprising development, the researchers say, because most hybrids tend to be sterile.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/16/top-performers-dont-always-provide-the-best-advice/">Top performers don’t always provide the best advice</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you want to learn a new skill, who are you going to ask for advice? Someone with a track record as a top performer would seem an obvious choice. Indeed, as the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976211054089?journalCode=pssa">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> point out, Americans alone pay hundreds of millions of dollars each year “to connect them to ‘icons, experts and industry rock stars’ who will teach them to write novels, start businesses, play chess or barbecue brisket, and they pay these premiums because they naturally believe that the best advice comes from the best performers.” However, this new work, led by David E. Levari at Harvard Business School, suggests that it does not.</p>



<span id="more-46216"></span>



<p>In an initial study, over 1,000 online participants played a game called Word Scramble. They had 60 seconds to find as many words as possible in a 4&#215;4 board of 16 letters. There were a few rules: the words had to be formed from contiguous letter tiles; no square could be used more than once in each word; any English word of three letters or more was allowed, except for proper nouns.</p>



<p>After they’d played three rounds (with the letter board changing each time), participants were told that 100 previous participants, who’d each played six rounds, had written advice for future players. They were then asked which of these players’ advice they’d like to see, or which they expected to be most helpful.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, most participants wanted to receive advice from the top performers, because they believed top performers would give the best quality advice. This study affirmed the existence of a belief that many people clearly already have. But it was an important first step in the team’s investigation.</p>



<p>Next, a fresh group of participants played six rounds of Word Scramble. The team noticed that the players did get better over time. This certainly suggests that performing well on this game requires some skill, which might in theory be trained by good advice. The players then wrote down some advice for future participants, and also rated the quality of their own advice, and how helpful they expected it to be.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that the best performers believed that they had given the best advice. However, when pieces of advice were then given to a fresh group of players, this turned out not to be the case: players who were given advice from the best performers didn’t improve at the game any more than players given advice from from other performers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also report a fascinating extra finding from this study: the second group of players rated advice that had come from the top performers as being the best — even though they had no knowledge of these people’s performance.</p>



<p>In a fresh study, the team considered some possible explanations for this. Perhaps the top performers gave more articulate or more authoritative advice, for example. In fact, they found that it was the number of independent suggestions that mattered — and top performers offered more. “In short, advice from the best performers was not better. It just sounded better because there was more of it.”</p>



<p>Why might top performers not offer more useful advice? A person’s performance level and their communication skills do not necessarily tally, the team points out. They also suggest another possibility: a greater number of suggestions might have been more valuable, if only the recipients had been able to absorb and act on all of them. Perhaps they were only able to follow one good suggestion at a time, making less extensive advice just as helpful. “Do our results, then, suggest that people are wasting their time and money when they seek advice from the best performers? Yes, sometimes. But not always.”</p>



<p>Of course, their study focused on &#8220;how to do&#8221; something, whereas, as they point out, sometimes we just want advice on &#8220;what to do&#8221;. For example, even if a billionaire stock market investor can’t teach other people how to invest, their tips on what to invest in may still be worth heeding.</p>



<p>It’s also worth pointing out that while the recipients of the Word Scramble advice didn’t benefit from more extensive advice in the short term, over a longer term, it might have been a different story. Given more time to absorb and implement lots of good suggestions, recipients of that advice might have done better. This research did not explore this.</p>



<p>The team does stress, however, that their results shouldn’t be taken to mean that an advisor’s performance is never a useful indicator of the quality of their advice. “Rather, they simply suggest that in at least some ordinary situations in which ordinary people expect the best-performing advisors to provide the best performance advice, those ordinary people are likely to be mistaken. Tips from the top are not always worth top dollar.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbon-footprint-farming-india-solar-power-agroforestry">Farmers in India cut their carbon footprint with trees and solar power</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In 2007, 22-year-old P. Ramesh’s groundnut farm was losing money. As was the norm in most of India (and still is), Ramesh was using a cocktail of pesticides and fertilizers across his 2.4 hectares in the Anantapur district of southern India. In this desert-like area, which gets less than 600 millimeters of rainfall most years, farming is a challenge.</p>



<p>“I lost a lot of money growing groundnuts through chemical farming methods,” says Ramesh, who goes by the first letter of his father’s name followed by his first name, as is common in many parts of southern India. The chemicals were expensive and his yields low.</p>





<p>Then in 2017, he dropped the chemicals. “Ever since I took up regenerative agricultural practices like agroforestry and natural farming, both my yield and income have increased,” he says.</p>



<p>Agroforestry involves planting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trees-crops-agroforestry-climate-biodiversity">woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) alongside agricultural crops</a> <em>(SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 30)</em>. One natural farming method calls for replacing all chemical fertilizers and pesticides with organic matter such as cow dung, cow urine and jaggery, a type of solid dark sugar made from sugarcane, to boost soil nutrient levels. Ramesh also expanded his crops, originally groundnuts and some tomatoes, by adding papaya, millets, okra, eggplant (called brinjal locally) and other crops.</p>

<p>With help from the nonprofit Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre in Anantapur, which works with farmers who want to try sustainable farming, Ramesh increased his profits enough to buy more land, expanding his parcel to about four hectares. Like the thousands of other farmers practicing regenerative farming across India, Ramesh has managed to nourish his depleted soil, while his new trees help keep carbon out of the atmosphere, thus playing a small but important role in reducing India’s carbon footprint. Recent studies have shown that the carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry is as much as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-017-0147-9">34 percent higher than standard forms of agriculture</a>.</p>



<p>In western India, more than 1,000 kilometers from Anantapur, in Dhundi village in Gujarat, 36-year-old Pravinbhai Parmar is using his rice farm for climate change mitigation. By installing solar panels, he no longer uses diesel to power his groundwater pumps. And he has an incentive to pump only the water he needs because he can sell the electricity he doesn’t use.</p>



<p>If all farmers like Parmar shifted to solar, India’s carbon emissions, which are 2.88 billion metric tons per year, could <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17583004.2020.1750265">drop by between 45 million and 62 million tons annually</a>, according to a 2020 report in <em>Carbon Management</em>. So far, the country has about 250,000 solar irrigation pumps out of an estimated 20 million to 25 million total groundwater pumps.</p>



<p>For a nation that has to provide for what will soon be the world’s largest population, growing food while trying to bring down already high greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural practices is difficult. Today, agriculture and livestock account for 14 percent of India’s gross national greenhouse gas emissions. Adding in the electricity used by the agriculture sector brings this figure up to 22 percent.</p>



<p>Ramesh and Parmar are part of a small but growing group of farmers getting assistance from government and nongovernmental programs to change how they farm. There’s still a ways to go to reach the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/revealing-indias-actual-farmer-population-7550159/">estimated 146 million others</a> who cultivate 160 million hectares of arable land in India. But these farmers’ success stories are testimony that one of India’s largest emitting sectors can change.</p>

<h4>Feeding the soil, sustaining farmers</h4>



<p>India’s farmers are already deeply feeling the effects of climate change, coping with dry spells, erratic rainfall and increasingly frequent heat waves and tropical cyclones. “When we talk about climate-smart agriculture, we are largely talking about how it has reduced emissions,” says Indu Murthy, sector head for climate, environment and sustainability at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, a think tank in Bengaluru. But such a system should also help farmers “cope with unexpected changes and weather patterns,” she says.</p>



<p>This, in many ways, is the philosophy driving a variety of sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices under the agroecology umbrella. <a href="https://www.niti.gov.in/natural-farming-niti-initiative">Natural farming</a> and agroforestry are two components of this system that are finding more and more takers across India’s varied landscapes, says Y.V. Malla Reddy, director of Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre.</p>



<p>“For me, the important change is the change in attitude of people towards trees and vegetation in the last few decades,” Reddy says. “In the ’70s and ’80s, people were not really conscious of the value of the trees, but now they consider trees, especially fruit and utilitarian trees, as also a source of income.” Reddy has advocated for sustainable farming in India for close to 50 years. Certain types of trees, such as pongamia, subabul and avisa, have economic benefits apart from their fruits; they provide fodder for livestock and biomass for fuel.</p>



<p>Reddy’s organization has provided assistance to more than 60,000 Indian farming families to practice natural farming and agroforestry on almost 165,000 hectares. Calculation of the soil carbon sequestration potential of their work is ongoing. But a 2020 report by India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notes that <a href="http://webline.co.in/fsi-result/technical-information-series-vol2-no1-2020.pdf">these farming practices can help India reach its goal of having 33 percent forest and tree cover</a> to meet its carbon sequestration commitments under the Paris climate agreement by 2030.</p>



<p>Regenerative agriculture is a relatively inexpensive way to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as compared with other solutions. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0491-z">Regenerative farming costs $10 to $100 per</a> ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere, compared with $100 to $1,000 per ton of carbon dioxide for technologies that mechanically remove carbon from the air, according to a 2020 analysis in <em>Nature Sustainability</em>. Such farming not only makes sense for the environment, but chances are the farmers’ earnings will also increase as they shift to regenerative agriculture, Reddy says.</p>

<h4>Growing solar</h4>



<p>Establishing agroecology practices to see an effect on carbon sequestration can take years or decades. But using renewable energy in farming can quickly reduce emissions. For this reason, the nonprofit International Water Management Institute, IWMI, launched the program Solar Power as Remunerative Crop in Dhundi village in 2016.</p>



<p>“The biggest threat climate change presents, specifically to farmers, is the uncertainty that it brings,” says Shilp Verma, an IWMI researcher of water, energy and food policies based in Anand. “Any agricultural practice that will help farmers cope with uncertainty will improve resilience to climate change.” Farmers have more funds to deal with insecure conditions when they can pump groundwater in a climate-friendly way that also provides incentives for keeping some water in the ground. “If you pump less, then you can sell the surplus energy to the grid,” he says. Solar power becomes an income source.</p>



<p>Growing rice, especially lowland rice, which is grown on flooded land, requires a lot of water. On average it takes about 1,432 liters of water to produce one kilogram of rice, according to the International Rice Research Institute. The organization says that irrigated rice receives an estimated 34 to 43 percent of the world’s total irrigation water. India is the largest extractor of groundwater in the world, accounting for 25 percent of global extraction. When diesel pumps do the extracting, carbon is emitted into the atmosphere. Parmar and his fellow farmers used to have to buy that fuel to keep their pumps going.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>High groundwater use</h4>



<p>Starting in the 1960s, India’s ground-water extraction began rising sharply, at a rate higher than in other places. This was primarily driven by the Green Revolution, a water- intensive agricultural policy to make the country food secure in the 1970s and ’80s and continues in some form even today.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>“We used to spend 25,000 rupees [about $330] a year for running our diesel-powered water pumps. This used to really cut into our profits,” Parmar says. When IWMI asked him in 2015 to participate in a pilot solar-powered irrigation project with zero carbon emissions, Parmar was all ears.</p>



<p>Since then, Parmar and six fellow farmers in Dhundi have sold more than 240,000 kilowatt-hours to the state and earned more than 1.5 million rupees ($20,000). Parmar’s annual income has doubled from 100,000–150,000 rupees on average to 200,000–250,000 rupees.</p>



<p>The boost is helping him educate his children, one of whom is pursuing a degree in agriculture — an encouraging sign in a country where farming is out of vogue with the younger generation. As Parmar says, “Solar power is timely, less polluting and also provides us an additional income. What is not to like about it?”</p>

<p>Parmar has learned to maintain and fix the panels and the pumps himself. Neighboring villages now ask for his help when they want to set up solar-powered pumps or need pump repairs. “I am happy that others are also following our lead. Honestly, I feel quite proud that they call me to help them with their solar pump systems.”</p>



<p>IWMI’s project in Dhundi has been so successful that the state of Gujarat started replicating the scheme in 2018 for all interested farmers under an initiative called Suryashakti Kisan Yojana, which translates to solar power project for farmers. And India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy now subsidizes and provides low-interest loans for solar-powered irrigation among farmers.</p>



<p>“The main thing about climate-smart agriculture is that everything we do has to have less carbon footprint,” says Aditi Mukherji, Verma’s colleague and an author of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-united-nations-ipcc-report-people-nature">February’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 7</em>). “That is the biggest challenge. How do you make something with a low carbon footprint, without having a negative impact on income and productivity?” Mukherji is the regional project leader for <a href="https://solar.iwmi.org/">Solar Irrigation for Agricultural Resilience in South Asia</a>, an IWMI project looking at various solar irrigation solutions in South Asia.</p>



<p>Back in Anantapur, “there is also a visible change in the vegetation in our district,” Reddy says. “Earlier, there might not be any trees till the eye can see in many parts of the district. Now there is no place which doesn’t have at least 20 trees in your line of sight. It’s a small change, but extremely significant for our dry region.” And Ramesh and other farmers now enjoy a stable, sustainable income from farming.</p>

<p>“When I was growing groundnuts, I used to sell it to the local markets,” Ramesh says. He now sells directly to city dwellers through WhatsApp groups. And one of India’s largest online grocery stores, bigbasket.com, and others have started purchasing directly from him to meet a growing demand for organic and “clean” fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p>“I’m confident now that my children too can take up farming and make a good living if they want to,” Ramesh says. “I didn’t feel the same way before discovering these nonchemical farming practices.”</p>

<p>This week in <em>Research Highlights</em>, our new post series highlighting recent noteworthy studies from across PLOS journals, <em>PLOS Genetics</em> authors Natasha Barrios at the Universidad Austral de Chile, Chile, Elaine Ostrander at the National Institutes of Health, US, and colleagues have found that Modern day Patagonian sheepdogs are the closest living relative to now-extinct varieties of herding dogs of Victorian-era Britain. Learn more about the study design and the authors&rsquo; findings below or jump to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full study</a> on our journal site.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>In the article, the authors explain that European settlers colonizing new lands often took their working dogs with them, and this shared history is reflected in the genome of modern dog breeds. The Patagonian sheepdog is a distinct variety from southern Chile and Argentina, thought to have been introduced by European colonists in the late 1800s. But it is not recognized as a formal breed and its relationship to modern herding dogs is poorly understood.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Study design and findings</strong></p>



<p>The researchers genotyped 159 Patagonian sheepdogs from Chile and the Chubut province in Argentina and used published data for 175 recognized domestic dog breeds and two wild dog species to create a phylogenetic tree. They found that Patagonian sheepdogs are most closely related to Border collies and Australian kelpies and share a common ancestor with modern herding breeds from the UK around 150 years ago. They identified distinct populations in the north and south of Patagonia, separated by the Patagonian ice fields. Northern populations are more genetically similar to Border collies, while southern populations are more closely related to the Australian kelpie.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>This population structure mirrors the pattern and timing of European colonization of the region, in which Scottish settlers first migrated from the Falkland Islands to southern Chile in 1877, before later moving north into the Ays&eacute;n region and Argentina. The first sheepdogs were likely introduced to Patagonia before the formalization of dog breeds in the late 1800s, suggesting that modern Patagonian sheepdogs are the closest living representatives of the foundational sheepdog &ndash; the ancestor of modern herding breeds from the UK &ndash; and probably look and behave quite similarly, the authors say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers add, &ldquo;Using a variety of genomic approaches, we ascertain the relationship between this dog population and modern herding breeds. We propose that the Patagonian sheepdog is the closest living representative of the common ancestor of modern UK herding breeds. These findings, in turn, increase our understanding of human migratory events at the time.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/inca-children-sacrifice-ayahuasca-chemical">A special brew may have calmed Inca children headed for sacrifice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Two Inca children slated for ritual sacrifice more than 500 years ago quaffed a special soothing concoction that has gone undetected until now.</p>



<p>Those young victims, most likely a girl and a boy roughly 4 to 8 years old, drank a liquid that may have lightened their moods and calmed their nerves in the days or weeks before they were ceremonially killed and buried on Peru’s Ampato mountain, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>The youngsters’ bodies contained chemical remnants from one of the primary ingredients of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-pouch-reveals-hallucinogen-stash-andes-shaman">ayahuasca, a liquid concoction known for its hallucinogenic effects</a>, say bioarchaeologist Dagmara Socha of the University of Warsaw, Poland, and her colleagues (<em>SN: 5/6/19</em>). Analyses focused on hair from the girl’s naturally mummified body and fingernails from the boy’s partially mummified remains.</p>





<p>While no molecular signs of ayahuasca’s strong hallucinogens appeared in those remains, the team did find <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103415">traces of harmine and harmaline</a>, chemical products of <em>Banisteriopsis</em> <em>caapi</em> vines, Socha’s group reports in the June <em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>. In ayahuasca, <em>B. caapi</em> amplifies the strength of other more hallucinogenic ingredients.</p>



<p>Recent investigations with rodents suggest that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05407-9">solutions containing harmine affect the brain much like some antidepressant drugs do</a>. “This is the first [evidence] that <em>B. caapi</em> could have been used in the past for its antidepressant properties,” Socha says.</p>



<p>While research on whether harmine can lessen depression or anxiety in people is in its infancy, archaeologist Christine VanPool of the University of Missouri, Columbia, thinks it’s possible that the ingredient was used on purpose. Spanish documents written after the fall of the Inca empire say that alcohol was used to calm those about to be sacrificed, so other brews may have been used too, speculates VanPool, who was not part of Socha’s team.</p>



<p>“I tentatively say yes, the Inca understood that <em>B. caapi</em> reduced anxiety in sacrificial victims,” she says.</p>



<p>Spanish chroniclers may have mistakenly assumed that Inca sacrifice victims drank a popular corn beer known as chicha rather than a <em>B. caapi</em> beverage, Socha suspects. No evidence of alcohol appeared in molecular analyses of the Ampato mountain children. But alcohol consumed just before being sacrificed would have gone undetected in the researchers’ tests.</p>



<p>Trace evidence did also indicate that both children had chewed coca leaves in the weeks leading up to their deaths. Spanish written accounts described the widespread use of coca leaves during Inca rites of passage. Those events included ritual sacrifices of children and young women, who were believed to become envoys to various local gods after death.</p>

<p>The sacrificed children <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/archaeology-13">were found during a 1995 expedition</a> near the summit of Ampato (<em>SN: 11/11/95</em>). It would have taken at least two weeks and possibly several months for the pair of Inca children to complete a pilgrimage from wherever their homes were located to the capital city of Cuzco for official ceremonies and then to Ampato mountain, Socha says.</p>



<p>Giving those kids a calming <em>B. caapi</em> drink as well as coca leaves to chew doesn’t surprise archaeologist Lidio Valdez of the University of Calgary, who did not participate in the new study. Children may not have understood that they were going to die, but they had to endure the rigors and loneliness of a long trip while separated from their families, he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Valdez suspects Ampato mountain was originally called Qampato, a word meaning <em>toad</em> in the Inca language. Andean societies such as the Inca associated toads with water or rain. “The mountain was also likely linked with water or rain and the children perhaps sacrificed to ask the mountain gods to send water,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">NASA’s InSight lander has recorded the largest Marsquake yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>Any Martians out there should learn to duck and cover.</p>



<p>On May 4, the Red Planet was rocked by a roughly magnitude 5 temblor, <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-records-monster-quake-on-mars">the largest Marsquake detected to date</a>, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., reports. The shaking lasted for more than six hours and released more than 10 times the energy of the previous record-holding quake.</p>



<p>The U.S. space agency’s InSight lander, which has been studying Mars’ deep interior since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">touching down on the planet in 2018</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/18</em>), recorded the event. The quake probably originated near the Cerberus Fossae region, which is more than 1,000 kilometers from the lander.</p>





<p>Cerberus Fossae is known for its fractured surface and frequent rockfalls. It makes sense that the ground would be shifting there, says geophysicist Philippe Lognonné, principal investigator of the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, InSight’s seismometer. “It’s an ancient volcanic bulge.”</p>



<p>Just like earthquakes reveal information about our planet’s interior structure, Marsquakes can be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">probe what lies beneath Mars’ surface</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>). And a lot can be learned from studying this whopper of a quake, says Lognonné, of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris. “The signal is so good, we’ll be able to work on the details.”</p>

<p><strong>From carefully avoiding cracks in the pavement to saluting every magpie that you meet, superstitious behaviour is really common.</strong> But why do we have superstitions? Where do they come from? And are they helpful or harmful?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/">Ginny Smith</a> talks to <a href="https://stuartvyse.com/">Stuart Vyse</a>, former professor of psychology at Connecticut College and author of <em>Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition</em>. Ginny also chats to <a href="https://communication.ucdavis.edu/people/ldt">Laramie Taylor</a>, professor of communication at the University of California Davis, who explains how superstition and magical thinking is linked to being a fan of both fiction and sports.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-nest-sturdy-physics">Experiments hint at why bird nests are so sturdy</a></h4>

              
                <p>To build its nest, a bird won’t go for any old twig. Somehow, birds pick and choose material that will create a cozy, sturdy nest.</p>



<p>“That’s just totally mystifying to me,” says physicist Hunter King of the University of Akron in Ohio. Birds seem to have a sense for how the properties of an individual stick will translate to the characteristics of the nest. That relationship “is something we don’t know the first thing about predicting,” King says.</p>





<p>A bird’s nest is a special version of a granular material: a substance, such as sand, made up of many smaller objects (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). King and colleagues combined laboratory experiments and computer simulations to better understand the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/8e074Y5fZ6d1a27c828d1768a5ab18a512f96b9b9">quirks of nestlike granular materials</a>, the researchers report in a study to appear in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>In the experiments, a piston repeatedly compressed 460 bamboo rods scattered inside a cylinder. The computer simulations let researchers analyze the points where sticks touched, which is key to understanding the material, the team says.</p>



<p>The more force the piston applied to the pile, the stiffer the pile became, meaning it resisted further deformation. As the piston bore down, sticks slid against one another, and the contact points between them rearranged. That stiffened the pile by allowing additional contact points to form between sticks, which prevented them from flexing further, the simulations showed.</p>



<p>Changes in the pile&#8217;s stiffness seemed to lag behind the piston’s motion, a phenomenon called hysteresis. That effect caused the pile to be stiffer when the piston pushed in than when the material bounced back as the piston retracted. Simulations suggest that the hysteresis arose because the initial friction between sticks needed to be overcome before the contact points started to rearrange.</p>



<p>Beyond bird nests, this research could be applied to other materials made of disordered arrangements of long fibers, such as felt. With a better understanding of the physical qualities of such materials, engineers could use them to create new structures designed to protect not only bird eggs, but other cargo that humans consider precious.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prehistoric-people-fire-light-dynamic-art">Prehistoric people may have used light from fires to create dynamic art</a></h4>

              
                <p>Prehistoric people may have used firelight to create the illusion of movement in their art.</p>



<p>An analysis of 50 engraved stones excavated in France suggests that when the stones were placed near a fire, the flickering light made the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266146#sec005">engraved animal</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266146#sec005">s</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266146#sec005"> seem to move</a>, researchers report April 20 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>These stones, or “plaquettes,” were found in the 1860s in a rock-shelter called Montastruc, and are engraved with animals such as horses, ibex and deer. The site was used by Magdalenian people, hunter-gatherers who inhabited the area between 23,000 and 14,000 years ago.</p>





<p>The researchers analyzed heat damage on the stones, which was indicative of them being directly exposed to high temperatures for a prolonged period, and created 3-D models of the plaquettes. Those models were imported to a virtual reality software where they were placed next to a virtual hearth so that the areas of heat damage were closest to the flames, mimicking how the stones may have been placed in real life. The researchers then observed the visual effects of the virtual reality light.</p>



<p>It was surprising to see how dynamic the art was and “how changed your experience of the art was by a simple thing, just putting it close to a fire,” says Andy Needham, an archaeologist at the University of York in England. The work suggests that the artists purposely engraved along the contours of the rock to influence viewers to see meaningful movement through the random pattern of firelight, he says.</p>



<p>The finding adds to archaeologists’ understandings of the relationship between early people’s artwork and fire. Another recent study found that Stone Age humans created “hidden” art in dark caves which could be illuminated and made visible only with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-cave-art-lighting-torch-lamp">help of the right lighting</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-milky-way-first-image-event-horizon-telescope">We finally have an image of the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a new addition to astronomers’ portrait gallery of black holes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Astronomers announced May 12 that they have finally assembled an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This image shows a bright ring surrounding the darkness, the telltale sign of the shadow of the black hole,” astrophysicist Feryal Özel of the University of Arizona in Tucson said at a news conference announcing the result.</p>



<p>The black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, appears as a faint silhouette amidst the glowing material that surrounds it. The image reveals the turbulent, twisting region immediately surrounding the black hole in new detail. The findings also were published May 12 in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_First_Sgr_A_Results">6 studies</a> in the<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>





<p>A planet-spanning network of radio telescopes, known as the Event Horizon Telescope, worked together to create this much-anticipated look at the Milky Way’s giant. Three years ago, the same team released the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first-ever image of a supermassive black hole</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That object sits at the center of the galaxy M87, about 55 million light-years from Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* for short, is “humanity&#8217;s black hole,” says astrophysicist Sera Markoff of the University of Amsterdam, and a member of the EHT collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At 27,000 light-years away, the behemoth is the closest giant black hole to Earth. That proximity means that Sgr A* is the most-studied supermassive black hole in the universe. Yet Sgr A* and others like it remain some of the most mysterious objects ever found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because, like all black holes, Sgr A* is an object so dense that its gravitational pull won’t let light escape. Black holes are “natural keepers of their own secrets,” says physicist Lena Murchikova of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who is not part of the EHT team. Their gravity traps light that falls within a border called the event horizon. EHT’s images of Sgr A* and the M87 black hole skirt up to that inescapable edge.</p>

</div><figcaption>This sonification is a translation into sound of the Event Horizon Telescope’s image of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The sonification sweeps clockwise around the black hole image. Material closer to the black hole orbits faster than material farther away. Here, the faster-moving material is heard at higher frequencies. Very low tones represent material outside the black hole’s main ring. Louder volume indicates brighter spots in the image.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sgr A* feeds on hot material pushed off of massive stars at the galactic center. That gas, drawn toward Sgr A* by its gravitational pull, flows into a surrounding disk of glowing material, called an accretion disk. The disk, the stars and an outer bubble of X-ray light “are like an ecosystem,” says astrophysicist Daryl Haggard of McGill University in Montreal and a member of the EHT collaboration. “They&#8217;re completely tied together.”</p>



<p>That accretion disk is where the action is — as the gas moves within immensely strong magnetic fields — so astronomers want to know more about how the disk works.</p>



<p>Like the majority of supermassive black holes,&nbsp; Sgr A* is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/accretion-disk-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole">quiet and faint</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/19 </em>). The black hole eats only a few morsels fed to it by its accretion disk. Still, “it&#8217;s always been a little bit of a puzzle why it&#8217;s so, so faint,” says astrophysicist Meg Urry of Yale University, who is not part of the EHT collaboration. M87’s black hole, in comparison, is a monster gorging on nearby material and shooting out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-m87-galaxy-jets-plasma-simulation">enormous, powerful jets</a> (<em>SN: 11/10/21</em>). But that doesn’t mean Sgr A* isn’t producing light. Astrophysicists have seen its region feebly glowing in radio waves,<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf71f"> jittering in infrared and burping in X-rays</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, the accretion disk around Sgr A* seems to constantly flicker and simmer. This variability, the constant flickering, is like a froth on top of ocean waves, Markoff says. “​​And so we&#8217;re seeing this froth that is coming up from all this activity, and we&#8217;re trying to understand the waves underneath the froth.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The big question, she adds, has been if astronomers would be able to see something changing in those waves with EHT.&nbsp;In the new work, they’ve seen <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac6675">hints of those changes</a> below the froth, but the full analysis is still ongoing.</p>



<p>By combining about 3.5 petabytes of data, or the equivalent of about 100 million TikTok videos, captured in April 2017, researchers could begin to piece together the picture. To tease out an image from the initial massive jumble of data, the EHT team needed years of work, complicated computer simulations and observations in various types of light from other telescopes.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Scientists created a vast library of computer simulations of Sagittarius A* (one shown) to explore the turbulent flow of hot gas that rings the black hole. That rapid flow causes the ring’s appearance to vary in brightness on timescales of minutes. Scientists compared these simulations with the newly released observations of the black hole to better understand its true properties.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Those “multiwavelength” data from the other telescopes were crucial to assembling the image. “By looking at these things simultaneously and all together, we&#8217;re able to come up with a complete picture,” says theorist Gibwa Musoke of the University of Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sgr A*’s variability, the constant simmering, complicated the analysis because the black hole changes on timescales of just a few minutes, changing as the researchers were imaging it. “It was like trying to take a clear picture of a running child at night,” astronomer José L. Gómez of Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía in Granada, Spain, said at a news conference announcing the result. M87 was easier to analyze because it changed over the course of weeks.</p>



<p>Ultimately, a better understanding of what is happening in the disk so close to Sgr A* could help scientists learn how many other similar supermassive black holes work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new EHT observations also confirm the mass of Sgr A* at 4 million times that of the sun. If the black hole replaced our sun, the shadow EHT imaged would sit within Mercury’s orbit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also used the image of Sgr A* to put <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">general relativity</a> to the test (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). Einstein’s steadfast theory of gravity passed: The size of the shadow matched the predictions of general relativity. By testing the theory in extreme conditions — like those around black holes — scientists hope to pinpoint any hidden weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Black hole history</h3>

<p>Scientists have previously <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-orbiting-black-hole-einstein-gravity-general-relativity">tested general relativity</a> by following the motions of stars that orbit very close to Sgr A* — work that also helped confirm that the object truly is a black hole (<em>SN: 7/26/18</em>). For<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-prize-2020-black-hole-roger-penrose-reinhard-genzel-andrea-ghez"> that discovery</a>, researchers Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel won a share of the Nobel Prize in physics in 2020 (<em>SN: 10/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>The two types of tests of general relativity are complementary,&nbsp; says astrophysicist Tuan Do of UCLA. “With these big physics tests, you don’t want to use just one method.” If one test appears to contradict general relativity, scientists can check for a corresponding discrepancy in the other.</p>



<p>The Event Horizon Telescope, however, tests general relativity much nearer to the black hole’s edge, which could highlight subtle effects of physics beyond general relativity. “The closer you get, the better you are in terms of being able to look for these effects,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>



<p>However, some researchers<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.024023"> have criticized</a> a similar test of general relativity made using the EHT image of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-image-einstein-general-relativity">M87’s black hole</a> (<em>SN: 10/1/20</em>). That’s because the test relies on relatively shaky assumptions about the physics of how material swirls around a black hole, says physicist Sam Gralla of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Testing general relativity in this way “would only make sense if general relativity were the weakest link,” but scientists’ confidence in general relativity is stronger than the assumptions that went into the test, he says.</p>



<p>The observations of Sgr A* provide more evidence that the object is in fact a black hole, says physicist Nicolas Yunes of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “It’s really exciting to have the first image of a black hole that is in our own Milky Way. It’s fantastic.” It sparks the imagination, like early pictures astronauts took of Earth from the moon, he says.</p>



<p>This won’t be the last eye-catching image of Sgr A* from EHT.&nbsp;Additional observations, made in 2018,&nbsp;2021 and 2022, are still waiting to be analyzed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is our closest supermassive black hole,” Haggard says. “It is like our closest friend and neighbor. And we&#8217;ve been studying it for years as a community. [This image is a] really profound addition to this exciting black hole we&#8217;ve all kind of fallen in love with in our careers.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Children are exposed to all kinds of stories, fact and fiction. Books about figures such as <a href="https://littlepeoplebigdreams.com/book/rosa-parks/">Rosa Parks</a> or <a href="https://littlepeoplebigdreams.com/book/jesse-owens/">Jesse Owens</a> teach young people about history, while novels are populated with colourful characters like Harry Potter or Bilbo Baggins. Religious figures often represent a middle ground, both real and fantastical. So how do children differentiate between fantasy and real life figures — and how does religious teaching affect the way they make these kinds of distinctions?</p>



<p>A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-021-01270-2">new study</a>, published in <em>Memory &amp; Cognition,</em> finds that a religious upbringing leads kids to judge religious stories as real. But, interestingly, this doesn’t seem to make non-religious magical stories seem real.</p>



<span id="more-46193"></span>



<p>Participants were 85 children in Tehran; half were aged between 5 and 6, and half 9 to 10. The children were presented with twelve stories: three realistic, three magical, three religious and three unusual.</p>



<p>In the realistic stories, only physically possible events occurred (e.g. a character feeds a hungry town by buying bread from a far-away city). In the magical condition, magical powers or fairies resolved the story (e.g. the character conjures bread from thin air). In the religious versions, the story was resolved through divine intervention (e.g. a character makes bread with powers given by God); and in the unusual condition, the story was resolved through implausible events (e.g. a character finds bread in a forest). After reading the stories the children were asked to categorise them, indicating whether they thought either the event or the character in the story was &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;pretend&#8221;, and then explaining why they had made their decision.</p>



<p>Older children were more likely than younger children to judge stories as real — except when stories were magical, which younger children were more likely to judge as real. Older children were also more likely to judge religious stories specifically as real compared to younger children. That is, they differentiated between religious and magical stories in a way that younger children did not.</p>



<p>Older children referred to causal mechanisms more than younger children when it came to justifying why they had categorised the story as real or pretend. For instance, they might say religious stories were real because God is able to help anyone in any way.  But this reference to causality was particularly common when older children justified their &#8220;pretend&#8221; judgements for magical stories, denying that things could be caused by magic. This suggests that “religious exposure does not commit children to an unconstrained conception of causality where causal violations are generally possible”, say the authors.</p>



<p>The team suggest that as children get older and are more exposed to religion, they are more likely to accept causally impossible occurrences in religious contexts compared to magical or unusual contexts. This strengthens previous research that suggests that religious education can change children’s reasoning about what is and is not possible in a way that does not happen in other domains.</p>



<p>Future research could look at different cultural settings — the participants in this study were Muslim and living in a country where religious values are part of everyday life, so studies that look at Christianity, Judaism or other religions in different, perhaps secular, countries would also be interesting. Overall, however, the study shows the impact of religious education, how it can affirm the possibility of divine causation, and how this differs from ideas about magic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machine-learning-gravity-earthquake-ai">Machine learning and gravity signals could rapidly detect big earthquakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Massive earthquakes don’t just move the ground — they make speed-of-light adjustments to Earth’s gravitational field. Now, researchers have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04724-y">trained computers to identify these tiny gravitational signals</a>, demonstrating how the signals can be used to mark the location and size of a strong quake almost instantaneously.</p>



<p>It’s a first step to creating a very early warning system for the planet’s most powerful quakes, scientists report May 11 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Such a system could help solve a thorny problem in seismology: how to quickly pin down the true magnitude of a massive quake immediately after it happens, says Andrea Licciardi, a geophysicist at the Université Côte d’Azur in Nice, France. Without that ability, it’s much harder to swiftly and effectively issue hazard warnings that could save lives.</p>





<p>As large earthquakes rupture, the shaking and shuddering sends seismic waves through the ground that appear as large wiggles on seismometers. But current seismic wave–based detection methods notoriously have difficulty distinguishing between, say, a magnitude 7.5 and magnitude 9 quake in the few seconds following such an event.</p>



<p>That’s because the initial estimations of magnitude are based on the height of seismic waves called P waves, which are the first to arrive at monitoring stations. Yet for the strongest quakes, those initial P wave amplitudes max out, making quakes of different magnitudes hard to tell apart.</p>



<p>But seismic waves aren’t the earliest signs of a quake. All of that mass moving around in a big earthquake also changes the density of the rocks at different locations. Those shifts in density translate to tiny changes in Earth’s gravitational field, producing “elastogravity” waves that travel through the ground at the speed of light — even faster than seismic waves.</p>



<p>Such signals were once thought to be too tiny to detect, says seismologist Martin Vallée of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, who was not involved in the new study. Then in 2017, Vallée and his colleagues were <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aao0746">the first to report seeing these elastogravity signals</a> in seismic station data. Those findings proved that “you have a window in between the start of the earthquake and the time at which you receive the [seismic] waves,” Vallée says.</p>



<p>But researchers still pondered over how to turn these elastogravity signals into an effective early warning system. Because gravity wiggles are tiny, they are difficult to distinguish from background noise in seismic data. When scientists looked retroactively, they found that only six mega-earthquakes in the last 30 years have generated identifiable elastogravity signals, including the magnitude 9 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-quake-location-surprise">Tohoku-Oki earthquake</a> in 2011 that produced a devastating tsunami that flooded two nuclear power plants in Fukushima, Japan (<em>SN: 3/16/11</em>). (A P wave–based initial estimate of that quake’s magnitude was 7.9.)</p>



<p>That’s where computers can come in, Licciardi says. He and his colleagues created PEGSNet, a machine learning network designed to identify “Prompt ElastoGravity Signals.” The researchers trained the machines on a combination of real seismic data collected in Japan and 500,000 simulated gravity signals for earthquakes in the same region. The synthetic gravity data are essential for the training, Licciardi says, because the real data are so scarce, and the machine learning model requires enough input to be able to find patterns in the data.</p>



<p>Once trained, the computers were then given a test: Track the origin and evolution of the 2011 Tohoku quake as though it were happening in real time. The result was promising, Licciardi says. The algorithm was able to accurately identify both the magnitude and location of the quake five to 10 seconds earlier than other methods.</p>



<p>This study is a proof of concept and hopefully the basis for a prototype of an early warning system, Licciardi says. “Right now, it’s tailored to work … in Japan. We want to build something that can work in other areas” known for powerful quakes, including Chile and Alaska. Eventually, the hope is to build one system that can work globally.</p>



<p>The results show that PEGSNet has the potential to be a powerful tool for early earthquake warnings, particularly when used alongside other earthquake-detection tools, Vallée says.</p>



<p>Still, more work needs to be done. For one thing, the algorithm was trained to look for a single point for an earthquake’s origin, which is a reasonable approximation if you’re far away. But close-up, the origin of a quake no longer looks like a point, it’s actually a larger region that has ruptured. If scientists want an accurate estimate of where a rupture happened in the future, the machines need to look for regions, not points, Vallée adds.</p>



<p>Bigger advances could come in the future as researchers develop much more sensitive instruments that can detect even tinier quake-caused perturbations to Earth’s gravitational field while filtering out other sources of background noise that might obscure the signals. Earth, Vallée says, is a very noisy environment, from its oceans to its atmosphere.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit the same as the challenge that physicists face when they try to observe gravitational waves,” Vallée says. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">ripples in spacetime, triggered by colossal cosmic collisions</a>, are a very different type of gravity-driven wave (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). But gravitational wave signals are also dwarfed by Earth’s noisiness — in this case, microtremors in the ground.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-drugs-treatments-latest-news">Here’s the latest good and bad news about COVID-19 drugs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maybe you’ve heard that the pandemic is over in the United States. (It’s not.) Masks are no longer required in most places and large gatherings are becoming commonplace again. Most of the country is in the green, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view">tracking site</a>, which monitors COVID-19 transmission and hospitalization rates. Many people have been relying on vaccines to control outbreaks, and there is renewed attention on getting newly available treatments to sick people.</p>



<p>But coronavirus cases are on the rise again with <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=Risk&amp;null=Risk">more than a quarter of counties </a>reporting high levels of transmission. And those are official numbers. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/covid-ba2-omicron-invisible-wave/629708/">No one really knows</a> how many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">at-home tests come back positive</a> and are never reported (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). Those cases are driving hospitalization rates up, with pockets of yellow and orange popping up on the CDC’s map, indicating that hospitals are entering the danger zone for being overwhelmed. Deaths have remained fairly low. That could change if another wave of infection sweeps the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe we think we’re on the edge of the woods, but we’re not out of it yet,” says Mark Denison, a coronavirus researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Preventing hospitalizations and deaths is what vaccines were designed to do, but even the very good COVID-19 vaccines aren’t perfect. And with new immune-evasive variants of the coronavirus, even vaccinated people and those who previously had COVID-19 &nbsp;— particularly the elderly or people with weakened immune systems or other health concerns — can wind up in the hospital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next line of defense against that bad outcome are three antiviral drugs and a monoclonal antibody that may keep people newly diagnosed with COVID-19 from becoming severely ill and dying.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>The test-to-treat initiative</h4>



<p>About 20,000 pharmacies, hospitals, urgent care centers and other places have the antiviral pills Paxlovid (a combo of two medications), made by Pfizer. The federal government plans to extend that number to<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/26/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-white-house-covid-19-response-coordinator-dr-ashish-jha/"> 40,000 in the coming weeks</a>, Ashish Jha, the White House COVID Response director, said April 26 during a news briefing. Many of those sites also have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda">molnupiravir</a> (Logevrio) antiviral pills, made by Merck (<em>SN:12/2/21</em>). The expansion is part of the federal government’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2022/04/29/additional-support-arrives-for-the-covid-19-test-to-treat-program/?sh=129c309b12b9">test-to-treat initiative</a> to make testing and treatment widely available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In much more limited supply are intravenous doses of monoclonal antibodies and the antiviral drug remdesivir — the only antiviral drug fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One preventative treatment is a monoclonal antibody called Evusheld. It is for people with weakened immune systems who may not respond to vaccines or who can’t be vaccinated. In a clinical trial, it <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116620">reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infections by 82 percent</a> compared with a placebo, researchers reported April 20 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That treatment is plentiful but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/evusheld-covid-treatment.html">isn’t being used much</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">Remdesivir</a>, or Veklury as its maker Gilead Sciences calls it, was approved by the FDA in 2020 for treating hospitalized patients (<em>SN:4/29/20</em>). A recent clinical trial showed that the drug <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116846">reduced the chance of hospitalization by 87 percent</a> in nonhospitalized people at high risk of severe disease, researchers reported in the January 27 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Such positive results prompted the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-actions-expand-use-treatment-outpatients-mild-moderate-covid-19">FDA to expand its approval to outpatient use</a> in people 12 and older. Then on April 25, the FDA authorized the drug to be<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-approves-first-covid-19-treatment-young-children"> used in children 12 and younger</a>, making it the first antiviral COVID-19 treatment available for young kids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main downside to remdesivir is that it has to be administered intravenously. “There’s nothing convenient about that,” says Abraar Karan, an infectious diseases physician at Stanford University. Researchers are working on an oral form of remdesivir. Early experiments suggest it’s <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abm3410">effective at protecting mice</a> against severe illness. Tests still have to be done to see if it works for people, too.</p>



<p>Two other drugs, Paxlovid and molnupiravir, come in pill form. They are theoretically more readily available, but many people don’t know about them or how to get them. And some <a href="https://twitter.com/dianaberrent/status/1520920108801175552">social media posts</a> suggest that it’s not as easy as it sounds for everyone to lay their hands on the drugs after a positive COVID-19 test, even when they do know about them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not as simple as, ‘We have a pill, now everything is solved,’” Karan says.</p>



<p>That’s partly because some doctors aren’t aware that they can or should prescribe the drugs for their high-risk patients who get infected with the coronavirus, says Jason Gallagher, a pharmacist and infectious diseases doctor at Temple University in Philadelphia. “There’s a lot of education that needs to occur on the medical side, also,” he says.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Ideally, people would talk to their doctors about whether they are candidates for the drugs before they get infected, Karan says. And people who don’t have a doctor need to know their options, because timing is important: The pills need to be started within three to five days of symptoms appearing.</p>



<p>Access to the drugs is getting better, but it’s still patchy. In the interest of being prepared, I went to <a href="https://www.covid.gov/">COVID.gov</a> to learn about where I could get the drugs in case I catch the coronavirus. I’m relatively lucky. There are seven <a href="https://covid-19-test-to-treat-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/">test-to-treat sites </a>within five miles of my house just outside of Washington, D.C., though one is a military hospital not open to the general public.&nbsp;And I spoke to my doctor to ask if I should take Paxlovid if I get COVID-19. He said I should and that if I do a home test, I can call with the result, and he will call a prescription in to my pharmacy.</p>



<p>My mom in rural Nebraska is in a different situation. She would have to drive more than 25 miles to the nearest test-to-treat site. Many other rural areas have pharmacies that can fill prescriptions, but people would have to go elsewhere to be tested and get a doctor to prescribe the medication. For instance, residents of Gypsum, Colo., would have to get tested somewhere, get a prescription from a doctor, drive about six miles to get the prescription filled, or travel nearly 100 miles to the Denver suburbs for a test-to-treat site.</p>



<h4>Drawbacks to these drugs</h4>



<p>There are other wrinkles besides access to using the drugs. “For all of the therapeutics, they have been studied primarily in unvaccinated people who are at risk of going on to develop severe disease,” says Gallagher. “So we basically end up projecting that data onto the population we have now, which is largely vaccinated.” It’s not clear that every person who has health conditions that put them at risk needs the drugs, especially if they have gotten a vaccine booster shot. The drugs might decrease symptoms, but there’s no real evidence to show they’re effective in making people feel better faster, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drugs are good at keeping people out of the hospital, though. Paxlovid reduced the relative risk of hospitalization and death by <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2118542">about 89 percent</a>, researchers reported in the April 14 <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Its side effects included a distorted sense of taste, and a small number of people developed diarrhea.&nbsp;</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>A bigger drawback is one of the drugs in the Paxlovid combo. Paxlovid’s main drug, nirmatrelvir, works by inhibiting an enzyme that the virus needs to replicate. It is taken with a drug called ritonavir, which keeps nirmatrelvir from being broken down by enzymes in the body. Ritonavir can react with other medications, like cholesterol-lowering statins, making levels of those medications in the body dangerously high. There are ways to work around that, though, Gallagher says. For instance, cholesterol-lowering medications could be halted for a short time. “I can’t think of a single person who can’t stop taking those for a week or two” while being treated for COVID-19, he says.</p>



<p>Another wrinkle is relapse. One <a href="https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1588371/v1/48342d2c-b3ea-4228-b600-168fca1fded7.pdf?c=1650977883">preprint</a> and other <a href="https://blogs.jwatch.org/hiv-id-observations/index.php/yes-relapses-after-paxlovid-happen-now-what/2022/04/25/">anecdotal accounts</a> have reported that some people have relapses of the virus a few days after stopping Paxlovid. No one really knows how common that is or why it happens. The U.S. National Institutes of Health are collaborating with the CDC and the FDA to better understand the phenomenon, according to a statement the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sent to me. But the agencies have no formal studies underway.</p>



<p>Experts I talked to had some ideas about what might be happening. It could be that the immune system “chills out” while people are taking the drug, giving the virus the opportunity to rebound once the drug is stopped, Gallagher speculates. Or the virus might hide in certain places in the body that the drug has trouble reaching, Denison says. Both of those situations might be solved by giving people the drug for longer, they say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-updates-paxlovid-health-care-providers">FDA rejected that suggestion</a> in a post citing John Farley, director of the agency’s Office of Infectious Diseases. Similar relapses happened to people taking placebo pills in Pfizer’s clinical trial of the drug, so the viral rebound may not be related to taking the drug, Farley stressed. And there has been no indication that people get sicker and are hospitalized after a relapse. There’s also no data to say whether people would benefit from taking Paxlovid longer or getting another round of the pills if they have a relapse, he said.</p>



<p>Resistance to the drug is another reason infections might relapse. “I think drug resistance is the least likely explanation,” says Denison. For resistance to develop, the virus has to replicate, which it can’t do when the drug is around. Still, researchers should watch for mutations in viruses taken from relapsed patients that might indicate resistance, he says.</p>



<p>None of the drugs are likely to prevent waves of infection. For instance, Paxlovid <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-shares-top-line-results-phase-23-epic-pep-study">slightly reduced the chance of contracting COVID-19</a> in people who were exposed to infected household members, but the result wasn’t statistically meaningful, Pfizer reported April 29 in a news release. That means it’s not great as a preventative and won’t affect case counts.</p>



<p>“What [the drugs] could flatten is a surge in hospitalizations and deaths,” Gallagher says. But, he notes, people at high risk of severe disease should not rely on the drugs alone to save them. “I don’t think that any of these therapeutics is as good as a booster.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Manal Helal will talk about a paper &quot;Tensor
Decomposition with Relational Constraints for Predicting Multiple Types of
microRNA-disease Associations&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in multifarious biological processes
associated with human diseases. Identifying potential miRNA-disease
associations contributes to understanding the molecular mechanisms of
miRNA-related diseases. Most of the existing computational methods mainly focus
on predicting whether a miRNA-disease association exists or not. However, the
roles of miRNAs in diseases are prominently diverged, for instance, Genetic
variants of microRNA (mir-15) may affect expression level of miRNAs leading to
B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while circulating miRNAs (including
mir-1246, mir-1307-3p, etc.) have potentials to detecting breast cancer in the
early stage. In this paper, we aim to predict multi-type miRNA-disease
associations instead of taking them as binary. To this end, we innovatively
represent miRNA-disease-type triplets as a tensor and introduce Tensor
Decomposition methods to solve the prediction task. Experimental results on two
widely-adopted miRNA-disease datasets: HMDD v2.0 and HMDD v3.2 show that tensor
decomposition methods improve a recent baseline in a large scale (up to 38% in
top-1 F1). We further propose a novel method, Tensor Decomposition with
Relational Constraints (TDRC), which incorporates biological features as
relational constraints to further the existing tensor decomposition methods.
Compared with two existing tensor decomposition methods, TDRC can produce
better performance while being more efficient.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How is it that some people can slip into another character so perfectly that they win acting plaudits, while the rest of us struggle to act at all?</p>



<p>Good actors have to convincingly convey a range of emotions. And one way that we feel and control our own emotions is by tuning into bodily signals — such as the more rapid heartbeat that comes with excitement, joy or fear. So, reasoned Peter Sokol-Hessner at the University of Denver and colleagues, perhaps actors are better at sensing these signals — a process known as interoception.</p>



<span id="more-46177"></span>



<p>For <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53427-001">their study</a>, published in <em>Emotion</em>, the team recruited a total of 26 current and former graduates of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts Graduate Acting Program plus a group of 11 other people with extensive acting experience. The control group consisted of 29 people with none or very little acting experience.</p>



<p>The participants were fitted with ECG electrodes, to monitor their heartbeats. In each trial, they were played 10 tones. The researchers controlled the timing of the tones, so that they were either in-sync with the participant’s heartbeat, or out of sync. The participants were not allowed to feel for their pulse during this time; instead they had to try to sense or guess whether the tones were in or out of sync. This task measured their &#8220;interoceptive accuracy&#8221;. They also had to report on how confident they were in their answer. This assessed their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051114002294">metacognitive awareness </a>of their accuracy. Each participant completed 160 trials.</p>



<p>The results were clear: non-actors were just as good at actors at judging whether the tones were in or out of sync with their heartbeat — they had very similar levels of interoceptive accuracy. But actors scored better on metacognitive awareness: on trials when they indicated not being confident in their answer, they were indeed more likely to be wrong, but when they were confident, they were more likely to be right. This result fits with earlier research finding that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZigEDvbsGb8">interoceptive accuracy and metacognitive awareness of this are separate constructs</a>. Earlier studies have also found that people who are better judges of their inner sensing accuracy have richer emotional experiences, feel more empathy and are better at regulating their emotions. So actors’ better metacognitive awareness might indeed help them to better create, express and convey emotion.</p>



<p>The team also looked at the Tisch actors’ academic scores on various aspects of acting. And they found that those who’d got better scores for Mimicry (copying a posture) and Movement (navigating obstacles without knocking them over) had better metacognitive scores. This suggests that perhaps, among actors, better awareness of inner sensing accuracy aids better acting (or at least aspects of acting; the team did not find a link between metacognitive ability and scores on Audition, an overall evaluation of their acting performance). However, the sample size in this analysis was only 19. As the researchers note, this should be considered a preliminary result.</p>



<p>A bigger question is: what explains the difference in metacognitive awareness of interoception between actors and non-actors? Is this the result of their acting training — or were they like that to start with?</p>



<p>To try to address this, the team explored whether there was a link between the duration each individual Tisch actor had studied at the school and their metacognitive ability. There wasn’t. This suggests that acting training did not explain their better scores — but, rather, superior metacognitive awareness helped them into acting. However, time spent at grad school didn’t capture participants’ lifetime experience of acting training and practice, so these results should be considered tentative. It would certainly be worth exploring this further, though — if elements of acting training can in fact enhance metacognitive awareness, perhaps this training could help to improve the emotional lives of other people.</p>



<p>For now, though, when it comes to the interoceptive abilities of actors vs no-actors, “these data establish for the first time that there is a quantitative, objective difference in the first place,” the team writes. And that’s certainly an interesting finding in itself.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-diet-western-norm-change-food-preferences">Eating meat is the Western norm. But norms can change</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">When my friend Julie Babulski was a freshman in high school in the mid-1990s, she decided to stop eating meat. “I loved animals. I couldn’t see them suffering,” Babulski says. “The fact that it pissed off my mom was an added, happy bonus.”</p>



<p>For her meat-loving family of Polish immigrants, meals frequently featured kielbasa or bacon, Babulski says. Even the sauerkraut had meat. With such limited food options at home, teenage Babulski initially subsisted on starches and salads. Her mom, she says, thought she “was going to straight up die.”</p>



<p>Babulski, now a biologist at Monroe Community College in Rochester, N.Y., eventually learned to eat a more balanced vegetarian diet, including beans, whole grains and the occasional neon orange veggie dog. But, Babulski remembers, her mom still wished she’d give up the madness.</p>





<p>Mom was probably reacting to the fact that eating is a social activity, uniting family, friends and even strangers. Her daughter could no longer enjoy the turkey at Thanksgiving, the traditional Polish meal of fish on Christmas Eve or even the family’s “lazy pierogies” — dumplings filled with noodles, mushrooms and, of course, bits of bacon.</p>



<p>On a societal level, the decision by Babulski and others to go vegetarian can feel threatening to those who view eating animals as quintessentially American. Eating meat is the norm in the United States, says social psychologist Gregg Sparkman of Princeton University. “It’s literally the center of that Norman Rockwell painting.”</p>

<p>Yet Rockwell’s vision of meat as the star of the American meal has big drawbacks. Besides concerns about animal welfare, medical experts have long encouraged people to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eating-meat-officially-raises-cancer-risk">eat less processed and red meat</a> for health reasons (<em>SN: 11/28/15, p. 9</em>). What is becoming crystal clear is that a meat-heavy diet is also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plant-based-diets-greenhouse-gases-environment">terrible for the planet</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/18, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>Shifting demand from meat to beans, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds could have substantial benefits for the climate. In 2018, total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide were almost 49 billion metric tons. That same year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, estimated that if everyone in the world went vegan, eating only plant-based foods, global emissions could drop by roughly 16 percent in a year, or 8 billion tons.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, going vegetarian, a plant-based diet that includes dairy, eggs and the very occasional meat or seafood allowed in IPCC’s definition, resulted in a 6-billion-ton drop. For those reluctant to give up the bacon entirely, the IPCC says a less absolutist approach could still reap big benefits. The panel estimates that a flexitarian diet — reducing meat and dairy consumption by 75 percent — could cut emissions by 5 billion tons.</p>



<p>Individual behavior changes alone cannot fix a supply chain built around the mass production of meat and animal products. But a more recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">April report from the IPCC</a> suggests that the world’s wealthiest individuals could substantially decrease emissions through lifestyle changes, such as driving and flying less and eating less meat. That’s because households with incomes in the top 10 percent generate roughly 36 to 45 percent of global emissions, while households with incomes in the bottom 50 percent contribute just 13 to 15 percent. Moreover, wealthier individuals serve as role models. So those who adopt a low-carbon lifestyle can help establish new, more sustainable social norms.</p>





<p>Social norms are unwritten rules for how to behave in a given group. Norms encourage conformity. If everyone in a group wears clothes, a single member is unlikely to wander outside naked. But if people think that shedding one’s clothing is becoming the new norm, can this encourage others to follow suit? Yes, Sparkman says. “Actions you do … ripple outward and can change others.”</p>



<p>The challenge, he and others say, is sorting out how to encourage that snowball effect to transform really strong social norms, such as eating meat. These scientists are, in a sense, trying to understand how to make the abnormal appear normal. What would it take, for instance, for people to mentally swap Rockwell’s Thanksgiving turkey for something greener?</p>



<h4>Changing normal</h4>



<p>Social norms, which by design remain relatively stable across time, typically hinder social change. But research shows that people conform not just to present norms but also to perceived future norms, what Sparkman calls “preconformity.” That suggests that reframing the Julie Babulskis among us as trendsetters rather than social <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/success-fail-why-outliers-people-communities-nudges">deviants</a> could encourage others to conform to their plant-based vision of the future (<em>SN: 2/26/22, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>In that vein, Sparkman and colleagues have been testing whether giving information on changing, or “dynamic,” norms can shift people’s food choices. In a pilot study, the team surveyed café-goers at Stanford University. When the 304 mostly faculty, staff and graduate students were waiting to order, researchers handed them one of three written statements.</p>



<p>Some participants received a static norm message: “Recent research has shown that 30 percent of Americans make an effort to limit their meat consumption.” Some participants got a dynamic norm statement: “Recent research has shown that, over the last five years, 30 percent of Americans have started to make an effort to limit their meat consumption.” Participants in a control group read that people are starting to limit the time they spend on Facebook. While the static statement emphasizes change in the present, the dynamic statement emphasizes changes happening over time and theoretically into the future, Sparkman says.</p>



<p>Roughly 20 percent of participants in the control and static norm groups went on to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617719950">order a meatless lunch</a> in the café compared with 34 percent of participants in the dynamic norm condition, the team reported in 2017 in <em>Psychological Science</em>. The results suggest people’s values can shift, Sparkman says.</p>

<h3>Eye to the future</h3>



<p>Café-goers who read that meat-eating is decreasing over time, the dynamic norm group, were more likely to order a vegetarian meal than those who read that some Americans limit their meat intake, a static norm, and the controls, who got an irrelevant message.</p>

<h4>Group dynamics</h4>



<p>As Babulski grew older, she learned about the health and environmental impacts of meat production. Her resolve to stay vegetarian solidified, and a once-impulsive decision became a way of life.</p>



<p>Babulski now shares her personal journey with students in her environmental science course. There’s always that student who treats her dietary choices as a personal affront, Babulski says. One student told her: “I’m going to eat three more chickens because you’re vegetarian to make up for the difference.”</p>



<p>People have long used food restrictions as a proxy for group membership. Hindu and Muslim people live side by side in South Asia, for instance, but can identify members of their own group just by noting who eats pork and who eats beef. “Food taboos are to do with establishing both in and out groups,” says Harriet Ritvo, an environmental historian at MIT.</p>



<p>Divisions around food can encourage tribal identities. For instance, Jewish people in Chicago who avoid leavened food during Passover often feel disconnected from their non-Jewish peers, Kaitlin Woolley, a behavioral scientist at Cornell University, and colleagues reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. But that sense of alienation helps them forge stronger connections with their Jewish peers. In a way, the Passover tribe grows stronger.</p>

<p>“In the West … to become a vegetarian is a very conscious choice to deviate from what is socially normal,” says social psychologist Daniel Rosenfeld of UCLA. “To form a community is often a way to buffer against that feeling of social alienation.”</p>



<p>Strong food-based communities help those within the group, but can repel those outside the group, such as Babulski’s chicken-eating student. Research shows that when people identify a certain diet, such as kosher or vegan, with an out-group, they can develop negative attitudes about the diet or avoid those “specialty” foods.</p>



<p>For instance, setting apart vegetarian items and labeling them “vegetarian” on a menu <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419308011?via%3Dihub">decreased the percentage of nonvegetarians who chose those entrées</a> versus when the options were incorporated into the main menu, researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>But there are ways to thwart that us-versus-them mentality, says Michael Schmitt, a social psychologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. One option is for researchers and policy makers to promote more inclusive labels. For instance, highlighting movement toward a more flexitarian diet does not seem to trigger the same sort of backlash as highlighting movement toward a vegetarian diet, Schmitt says. “That offers people an identity that might be closer to existing norms.”</p>



<p>Subtly changing the food environment to make veggie options, rather than meat, the default is another idea. For instance, simply increasing the availability of vegetarian meals in a university cafeteria from a quarter of the choices to half the choices increased sales of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1907207116">vegetarian entrées</a> by almost 8 percent, researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Labeling decisions</h3>



<p>Three groups of online participants who were meat eaters saw different menus: One menu set vegetarian choices apart and called them “vegetarian,” one labeled them as good for the environment and a third listed vegetarian and nonvegetarian items together.

<p>Then there’s the grocery store. Researchers reported in March in <em>PLOS Medicine</em> that moving Easter chocolates away from prominent locations, like the store entrance and end of aisles, in a chain of U.K. grocery stores caused sales of those items to plummet. Compared with 151 stores that stuck with business as usual, 34 stores that moved the candy sold, on average, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003951">21 kilograms less chocolate</a> per week. Assuming the average chocolate Easter bunny weighs about 100 grams, that equals roughly 200 fewer bunnies sold per store each week.</p>



<p>Imagine if U.S. grocery store operators shunted meat to hard-to-find locations, Schmitt says. Changing perceptions of normal requires first envisioning a new normal.</p>



<h4>Ripple effects</h4>



<p>Given the sheer scope of climate change, how can one person’s actions make a difference?</p>



<p>Using dynamic norms to change behavior hinges on the simple premise that individual actions do, in fact, matter. Research from the sustainability field bears this out. From 2012 to 2015, officials in Connecticut sought to get more people to install solar panels through a program called Solarize Connecticut. At that time, only 0.4 percent of U.S. homeowners had solar panels, making their use outside the ordinary. So volunteers traveled to 58 towns to encourage residents to make the energy switch. Researchers reported in 2018 in <em>Nature</em> that volunteers who had invested in solar panels themselves <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0647-4#citeas">convinced almost 63 percent more residents</a> to go solar than volunteers who had made no such investment.</p>

<p>Conversely, individual inaction also matters. In a now classic study from the 1960s appearing in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, male undergraduate students sat in a room that slowly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1969-03938-001">filled with smoke</a>. When the students were alone, 75 percent of them reported the situation. But when others were in the room and failed to act, only 10 percent of students reported the problem. Doing nothing had become socially acceptable.</p>



<p>In essence, we live in a world filling with smoke and must choose between inaction and action. Why not choose action?</p>



<p>Babulski applies this philosophy to her own teaching. Minus a naysayer or two, many of her students come to realize the power of their individual choices. “You can actually see students over the course of the semester going, ‘Wow, the little things I do actually do add up and make a difference,’ ” Babulski says.</p>



<p>Eventually, perhaps, a future Norman Rockwell will paint a less meat-heavy meal on that American dinner platter: beans, crickets or a plant-based turkey. Imagine that.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/11/women-candidates-are-seen-as-less-electable-which-makes-voters-less-likely-to-support-them/">Women candidates are seen as less electable — which makes voters less likely to support them</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Politics in the UK is becoming increasingly diverse. But there is still a way to go. When it comes to gender, the proportion of women in the House of Commons is at an <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01250/">all time high</a> — but at 35%, is still far from representative of the population. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/6/e2112616119">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, looks at the barriers to women being elected. And the Stanford University team finds even voters who would prefer a female candidate show a level of &#8220;pragmatic bias&#8221;: if they believe that women candidates face barriers that make them less electable, they are less likely to vote for them. </p>



<span id="more-46171"></span>



<p>Participants in the first study were Democrat voters. First, they were asked whether they felt it would be easier or harder for a woman to win the 2020 election against Trump compared to a man, and how ready they felt the US population was for a woman president. Next, they assessed the electability of specific candidates: Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. They were also asked about their personal preference for presidential candidate and who they would actually vote for in the Democratic primary. </p>



<p>Across the measures, participants consistently felt that women candidates were less electable: 76% believed it would be harder for a woman to win the 2020 election than a man, while only 18% believed Americans were extremely ready for a woman president. Half of the participants also believed that Harris and Warren were less electable than Biden and Sanders, while just 27% felt they were more electable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, participants whose preferred candidate was a woman were more likely to say they’d vote for a woman candidate. But if they believed that male candidates were more likely to be elected, then many of these participants indicated that they’d shift their actual vote to a man. That is, concerns that women were less electable seemed to lead people to vote for men even when they really wanted to vote for a woman. A second study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>A third study found that simply giving people information about women’s electability was not enough to counteract this effect. Democratic primary voters were assigned to one of three conditions. In the true information condition, participants saw a correct figure showing that 52.5% of voters are very or extremely ready for a woman president; in the misperception condition, participants saw a figure showing only 15.7% are ready; and in the control condition, participants read general information about the election. They were then asked their likelihood of voting for a woman candidate. However, providing candidates with true information about the electorate’s willingness to elect a woman was not enough to overcome their pragmatic bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the final studies, the team instead gave participants evidence that women are actually as successful as men in elections. They read that women are just as likely to win general elections as men, that they receive slightly more support than men, and that they are as successful as men at primaries. This time, the intervention increased their likelihood of intending to vote for a woman presidential candidate. And in a follow-up study, those who had seen this evidence were still more likely to say they’d vote for women candidates a month later, suggesting that sharing information about electability can increase voting intentions over a longer period of time. </p>



<p>Overall, the study suggests that a belief that women candidates are not electable ironically makes people less likely to vote for them — even voters who they profess to support these candidates. Future research could look at different levels of politics — does this stand for council elections, for example, or non-governmental elections, or was the executive level position explored here relevant? And would it apply to Republicans or those outside of the United States? </p>



<p>The team notes that in order to overcome pragmatic bias, it is not enough to believe others are simply ready for a female president but that “others will act on that readiness and vote accordingly”. Thinking and acting collectively could, then, shift attitudes and change representation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-marmoset-cry-vocalization-womb-practice-ultrasound">Baby marmosets may practice their first distinctive cries in the womb</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cradled inside the hushed world of the womb, fetuses might be preparing to come out howling.</p>



<p>In the same way newborn humans can cry as soon as they’re born, common marmoset monkeys (<em>Callithrix jacchus</em>) produce contact calls to seek attention from their caregivers. Those vocalizations are not improv, researchers report in a preprint posted April 14 at bioRxiv. Ultrasound imaging of marmoset fetuses <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.13.488158v1.abstract">reveals that their mouths are already mimicking</a> the distinctive pattern of movements used to emit their first calls, long before the production of sound.</p>



<p>Early behaviors in infants are commonly described as “innate” or “hard-wired,” but a team at Princeton University wondered how exactly those behaviors develop. How does a baby know how to cry as soon as it’s born?</p>





<p>The secret may lie in what’s happening before birth. “People tend to ignore the fetal period,” says Darshana Narayanan, a behavioral neuroscientist who did the research while at Princeton University. “They just think that it&#8217;s like the baby&#8217;s just vegetating and waiting to be born…. [But] that&#8217;s where many things begin.”</p>





<p>Research shows, for instance, that chicks inside their eggs are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-learn-recognize-calls-mom-eggs-nest-sound-song">already learning to identify their species’ call</a> (<em>SN: 9/16/21</em>). “So much is developing so much earlier in development than we previously thought,” says developmental psychobiologist Samantha Carouso-Peck, executive director of Grassland Bird Trust in Fort Edward, N.Y., who was not involved in the research. But, she says, “we really haven&#8217;t looked much at all at the production side of this. Most of what we know is the auditory side.” Carouso-Peck studies vocal learning in songbirds and how it applies to how humans acquire language.</p>



<p>Narayanan and colleagues turned to marmosets because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-marmosets-imitate-parents-sounds">vocalization development in the monkeys is similar to that of humans</a> (<em>SN: 8/13/15</em>). Two-person teams performed noninvasive ultrasounds on two marmosets nearly every day during four different pregnancies. The effort involved a lot of marshmallow fluff, Narayanan says. “They would do anything for marshmallows.”</p>



<p>Around 95 days into the pregnancy, a fetus’s face comes into view for the first time. The researchers observed that each young fetus moved its mouth and other parts of its face in tandem with its head. As the pregnancy progressed, the facial features and head began to move independently. The decoupling of these different motor regions presumably prepares the fetus for tasks like feeding or vocalizing.</p>

</div><figcaption>Ultrasounds of a marmoset in the womb show that fetal face and mouth movements (left) are similar to an infant’s contact call (right), suggesting that the fetus develops the motor skills to make its cries before it’s born and can produce sound.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then it was a matter of reading lips. Was the fetus just moving its mouth, or were the movements mimicking particular sounds? It was clear to the researchers early on that the mouth movements were similar to the motions a marmoset makes during a contact call, distinct for its long duration and multiple syllables.</p>



<p>“The contact call is so unique that you really can&#8217;t mistake it for any of the other calls,” says Princeton biologist Asif Ghazanfar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But to confirm, Ghazanfar, Narayanan and their team tracked the fetal jaw movements frame-by-frame to determine their duration. They also measured the number of “syllables” a fetus makes by calculating the number of movements separated by less than 500 milliseconds. The researchers then compared the fetal movements to the contact calls produced by the infant marmosets after birth. As the fetus approaches birth, its facial and mouth movements became increasingly similar to those of the infant contact calls —&nbsp;evidence, the team says, that the fetus is developing the ability to make this call after birth.</p>



<p>This supports the idea that early cries aren’t “magically appearing,” Narayanan says. “They have a long period of development — but in utero.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/music-one-hit-wonder-pop-songs-lasting-career">Why it’s so hard for a one-hit wonder to have a lasting music career</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s hard to predict which songs will become hits. It’s even more difficult to predict which artists topping today’s charts will go on to record more hits and who will see their fame fizzle out.</p>



<p>Now an extensive study of the pop charts provides some tips about how to avoid being a one-hit wonder. Artists with more variety in their catalog have a better chance to land repeat hits, says Justin Berg, a social scientist who researches creativity and innovation at Stanford University’s business school. But there’s a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00018392221083650">dilemma for artists who want to be popular</a> over the long-term. Variety isn’t what helps artists land that first hit, Berg reports March 24 in <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em>. &nbsp;It’s the similarity of a new song to recent hits.</p>



<p>&#8220;There actually isn&#8217;t a way to thread the needle,” Berg says. “You face a … trade-off as a new creator, between a likelihood of initial [or] sustained success based on the novelty of your portfolio.”</p>





<p>The new insights could help artists from a variety of fields better understand the public impact of novelty in art — in music, visual art, books and beyond.</p>



<p>To figure out if there’s some kind of formula that can help explain who becomes a flash in the pan and who becomes a musical staple, Berg focused on the pop charts, with their rich collection of data. “I figured I&#8217;d start with the industry … where the term one-hit wonder was coined,” he says.</p>



<p>Berg used a database of about 3 million songs from 1959–2010 released by record labels that had produced at least one hit in the United States over that time. Of those songs, nearly 25,000 landed on the weekly Billboard Hot 100, which tracks the most popular songs based on sales data, radio play and now online streaming. That provided Berg with a list of nearly 4,900 artists who had one or more songs that made the list, his yardstick for defining a hit.</p>



<p>Berg then turned to a Spotify system that rates songs on 11 variables, including danceability, energy and key. This system provided metrics on most of the hits and nonhits from the 1959–2010 time window. Berg then noted how closely related hit songs were to the hits from the previous calendar year. He also compiled portfolios for most of the artists who had at least one song on the Hot 100, so he could quantify the variety and novelty of the songs they had released at the time of their first hit. These portfolios also allowed him to compare one-hit wonders to mega-hitmakers and to those who never made it big. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Hits are rare, the data show. Of the 69,000 artists in the original database, 93 percent never had a hit, 3 percent had one and 1 percent had two hits. The success rate for additional hits drops from there.</p>



<p>Berg found that musical artists with what he termed low-novelty portfolios that closely resembled other already existing music were about twice as likely to have initial success. But those who built a more innovative and varied catalog before fame hit were more likely to generate a series of hits.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a music nerd’s dream to read something like this,” says Storm Gloor, a music industry researcher at the University of Colorado Denver. He says it puts some heft behind a lot of the intuition that artists and record executives have developed over the years.</p>



<p>Since the data end in 2010, the research may not fully capture the current state of popular music. Musicians are changing how they write songs to make them more appealing on Spotify or TikTok, says Noah Askin, a computational social scientist at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France. “So much of it now is: How memorable is a given song? How much can you put it out as like a soundtrack to a short video clip?”</p>



<p>Berg doesn’t want his research to diminish the accomplishments of one-hit wonders such as Los Del Rio, who recorded the 1990s smash “Macarena.” “A lot of them in their time were quite famous and successful,” he says. “You go out and try to make a song that catchy. It’s not an easy challenge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-radiation-solar-system-planet-orbit-astronomy">The sun’s searing radiation led to the shuffling of the solar system’s planets</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the solar system’s early years, the still-forming giant planets sidestepped, did a do-si-do and then swung one of their partners away from the sun’s gravitational grasp. Things settled, and our planetary system was in its final configuration.</p>



<p>What triggered that planetary shuffle has been unknown. Now, computer simulations suggest that the hot radiation of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04535-1">young sun evaporating its planet-forming disk of gas and dust</a> led to the scrambling of the giant planets’ orbits, researchers report in the April 28 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>As a result, the four largest planets may have been in their final configuration within 10 million years of the solar system’s birth about 4.6 billion years ago. That’s much quicker than the 500 million years that previous work had suggested.</p>





<p>The planetary-shuffling mechanism that the team uncovered in the computer simulations is very innovative, says Nelson Ndugu, an astrophysicist who studies forming planetary systems at North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa, and Muni University in Arua, Uganda. “It has huge potential.”</p>



<p>Heaps of evidence, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-snap-first-baby-pictures-planet">observations</a> of extrasolar planetary systems forming (<em>SN: 7/2/18</em>), had already indicated that something in our solar system’s early history jumbled the giant planets’ orbits, which scientists call the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roaming-giants-did-migrating-planets-shape-solar-system">giant-planet instability</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/05</em>).</p>



<p>“The evidence for the giant-planet instability is really robust,” says Seth Jacobson, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing. “It explains many features of the outer solar system,” he says, like the large number of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fringe">rocky objects</a> beyond Neptune that make up the Kuiper Belt (<em>SN: 12/31/09</em>).</p>



<p>To figure out what triggered that instability, Jacobson and colleagues ran computer simulations of the thousands of ways that the early solar system could have developed. All started with a young star and a planet-forming disk of gas and dust surrounding the star. The team then altered the disk parameters, such as its mass, density and how fast it evolved.</p>



<p>The simulations also included the still-forming giant planets — five of them, in fact. Astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rock-rattle-and-roll">think a third ice giant</a>, in addition to Uranus and Neptune, was originally a solar system member (<em>SN: 4/20/12</em>). Jupiter and Saturn round out the final tally of these massive planets.</p>



<p>When the sun officially became a star, that is, the moment it began burning hydrogen at its core — roughly 4.6 billion years ago — its ultraviolet emission would have hit the disk’s gas, ionizing it and heating it to tens of thousands of degrees. “This is a very well-documented process,” Jacobson says. As the gas heats, it expands and flows away from the star, beginning with the inner portion of the disk.</p>



<p>“The disk disperses its gas from inside out,” says Beibei Liu, an astrophysicist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. He and Jacobson collaborated with astronomer Sean Raymond of Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux in France in the new research.</p>



<p>In the team’s simulations, as the inner part of the disk dissolves, that area loses mass, so the embedded, still-forming planets feel less gravity from that region, Jacobson says. But the planets still feel the same amount of pull from the disk’s outer region. This gravitational torquing, as the team calls it, can trigger a rebound effect: “Originally, the planets migrate in, and they reach the [inner] edge of this disk, and they reverse their migration,” Liu says.</p>



<p>Because of Jupiter’s large mass, it’s mostly unaffected. Saturn, though, moves outward and into the region, which, in the simulations, holds the three ice giant planets. That area becomes crowded, Liu says, and close planetary interactions follow. One ice giant gets kicked out of the solar system entirely, Uranus and Neptune shift a bit farther from the sun, and “they gradually form the orbits close to our solar system’s configuration,” Liu says.</p>



<p>In their computer simulations, the researchers found that as the sun’s radiation evaporates the disk, a planetary reshuffle nearly always ensues. “We can’t avoid this instability,” Jacobson says.</p>



<p>Now that the researchers have an idea of what may have caused this solar system shuffle, the next step is to simulate how the evaporation of the disk could affect other objects.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve focused really heavily on the giant planets, because their orbits were the original motivation,” Jacobson says. “But now, we have to do the follow-up work to show how this trigger mechanism relates to the small bodies.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-buzz-sounds-mimick-wasps-bees-owls">These bats buzz like wasps and bees. The sound may deter hungry owls</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some bats buzz like wasps and bees when grasped, and the sound seems to deter predatory owls.</p>



<p>The findings reveal what may be the first known case <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00486-9?utm_source=EA">of a mammal mimicking an insect</a>, researchers report May 9 in <em>Current Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 1998 to 2001, animal ecologist Danilo Russo was conducting field studies on greater mouse-eared bats (<em>Myotis myotis</em>) in Italy, which involved capturing the live animals in mist nets. When he and his colleagues removed the bats, they made a buzzing noise in the scientists’ hands that was reminiscent of wasps or bees.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“When you hear them, that’s what comes to your mind immediately,” says Russo, of the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, Russo and his team decided to test the idea that the uncanny buzzing wasn’t mere coincidence, but instead a type of defense mechanism called Batesian mimicry. Batesian mimics are themselves harmless, but have a resemblance — visually, acoustically or chemically — to a different species that is distasteful or dangerous. When wary predators can’t distinguish harmless mimics from the noxious originals that the predators typically avoid, the mimics are protected.</p>



<p>The researchers caught more of the bats, recording their buzzing cries as they were being handled. The team also recorded the buzzing sounds of four stinging insect species (two wasps and two bees) commonly found in European forests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Russo and his team compared the audio profiles of the insect and bat buzzing in the laboratory, the researchers found that their analyses could distinguish between the two sound sources most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But audience matters. Tawny owls (<em>Strix aluco</em>) and barn owls (<em>Tyto alba</em>) commonly hunt bats, so Russo’s team wondered if the birds could be the target for the buzzing performance. When the researchers limited their sound analysis to just the frequencies that an owl hears, the buzzes became much harder to tell apart — particularly for comparisons involving the buzzing of European hornets (<em>Vespa crabro</em>).</p>

<p>The team then played recordings of bat and insect buzzes — and bat social calls — to eight birds from each owl species in captivity at a wildlife rehabilitation center. The owls reacted to the insect and bat buzzing the same way — by moving away from the speaker. In contrast, they approached the speaker when it played the social calls, potentially associating them with prey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Birds tend to avoid stinging insects, Russo says. “When nest boxes or tree cavities are colonized by hornets, birds do not even attempt to explore them, not to mention nest there.” Russo and his team think that this negative association may be evoked in nature if an owl grasps a bat and receives an indignant buzz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This scenario may be the first known example of Batesian mimicry — acoustic or otherwise — where a mammal copies an insect, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, most examples of Batesian mimicry involve visual signals, so finding potential acoustic mimicry is exciting, says David Pfennig, an evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfennig, who was not involved with the research, points to a few examples of acoustic mimicry, such as burrowing owls <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1986.tb00605.x">imitating a rattlesnake rattle</a> or Congolese giant toads <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/congolese-giant-toads-may-mimic-venomous-snakes-trick-predators">hissing like Gaboon vipers</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 10/25/19</em>). But these don’t involve a mammal and insect pairing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new study makes behavioral ecologist Anastasia Dalziell think of other birds besides owls. Songbirds are fairly regular acoustic mimics, says Dalziell, of the University of Wollongong in Australia who was also not involved with the research. “I&#8217;ve been waiting for a study like this because bats are a lot alike, in many ways, to songbirds,” she says. “They learn their vocalizations like songbirds — at least in some cases — and they can even sing, so it makes sense to me that they would mimic as well.”</p>



<p>But behavioral ecologist Matthew Bulbert of Oxford Brookes University in England isn’t convinced this is a case of mimicry. The owls are encountering stinging insects and bats in totally different contexts (resting vs. hunting), which doesn’t make it probable that the owls are fooled, he says. Instead, the buzzing could be generally startling to an owl, increasing the chance the bat is released.</p>



<p>“That in itself is still pretty cool,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/raw-chicken-wash-safety-physics-kitchen-germs">How to wash chicken in the kitchen more safely, according to physics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Health experts recommend against washing chicken before cooking it because that can spread harmful bacteria. But if you’re among the nearly <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/jfp/article/78/1/180/174434/Consumer-Reported-Handling-of-Raw-Poultry-Products">70 percent of people</a> who do, according to a survey of U.S. grocery shoppers, there are ways to make it safer.</p>



<p>Instead of admonishing people not to wash chicken, says mathematician Scott McCalla of Montana State University in Bozeman, the goal of a study published in the March <em>Physics of Fluids</em> was to “recommend <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0083979">how to do it safely</a>, or more carefully.”</p>



<p>The researchers placed raw chicken under running faucets and monitored the spray of water and bacteria to nearby surfaces. The outcomes changed dramatically depending on a few factors.</p>





<p>The height of the faucet above the chicken had the largest effect. If the water fell 40 centimeters (about 16 inches) before hitting a chicken breast or thigh, the germs traveled farther than for faucets just 15 centimeters (about 6 inches) above the chicken.</p>



<p>In tests involving the higher faucets, droplets of water splashed more than 22 centimeters in the air, contaminating much of the surrounding area. For lower faucets, droplets splashed only about 5 centimeters high, and there was comparatively little sign of contamination making it to nearby surfaces. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also found that if they flicked on a faucet, the initial burst of water sent contaminated spray flying. Turning it on gradually reduced the spray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pliability of chicken was also important. Water hitting the chicken creates a small divot in the soft surface, which shoots the splatter farther than it would if the chicken didn&#8217;t deform. Keeping the water pressure turned down reduces the dimpling and resulting germ spread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Raw chicken can be fouled by <em>Salmonella</em> and other bacteria that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/chicken-poses-significant-drug-resistant-salmonella-threat">can cause foodborne illnesses</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/10</em>). Even minor splashing will contaminate sinks with germs that can spread through contact with other foods and hands, says food safety researcher Ellen Shumaker of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who wasn’t part of the study.</p>



<p>Reducing splashing, though, can still be part of what Shumaker describes as a multipronged approach to keeping germs in check in the kitchen. “We do know that there are always going to be people who always wash” poultry, she says.</p>

<h5>Tips to minimize contamination from washing raw chicken</h5>



<p>To prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause foodborne illnesses, experts recommend not washing chicken before cooking it. But if you do, here are some ways to make it safer, according to a new study:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/05/09/heres-why-phrases-like-rowdy-bowels-and-moose-ooze-seem-funny/">Here’s why phrases like “rowdy bowels” and “moose ooze” seem funny</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Which is funnier:</p>



<p><em>Sell bargain</em> — or <em>nymph piss</em>?</p>



<p><em>Roof darkness</em> — or <em>gravy orgy</em>?</p>



<p><em>Large small</em> — or <em>moose ooze</em>?</p>



<p>If you went for the second each time, you’d be in good company. In a new study, participants gave word pairs in the second set the highest humour ratings, while those in the first languished near the bottom. One very obvious difference is that those in the second set reference sex or bodily excretions, while the others don’t. But Cynthia S. Q. Siew at the National University of Singapore, along with Tomas Engelthaler and Thomas T. Hills at the University of Warwick, also identified broader factors at play. In <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-51465-001">their paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em>, they argue that these factors explain why <em>gangster pasta</em>, for example, is funnier than <em>insult nickname</em>.</p>



<span id="more-46159"></span>



<p>In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-27729-018">2018 study on 4,977 individual English words</a>, Engelthaler and Hills found that words that are encountered less frequently in English, such as <em>humbug </em>or <em>czar</em>, tended to be rated as funnier. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-52097-001">Work published the following year</a> by a separate group built on this finding. It revealed that words with a less common structure (with relatively rare letter sequences, for example — think <em>talc </em>vs <em>code</em>) tended to be deemed funnier than those with more familiar, predictable structures.</p>



<p>The findings from both these earlier studies on single words are consistent with a popular theory of humour that holds that the more something violates our expectations — but at the same time is not threatening — the funnier it is.</p>



<p>In the new paper, Siew and her colleagues looked instead at how humorous people find <em>pairs</em> of words. “Now,” the team writes, “instead of facing our participants with the task of rating individual words, like <em>cage</em> (which is not particularly funny on its own) or <em>cabbage</em> (only mildly funnier), our participants are faced with rating the humour of <em>cabbage cage</em>, which is arguably funnier than either word alone. But why?&#8221;.</p>



<p>The first online study was open to anyone who accessed the researchers’ web app. These participants were presented with a series of word pairs made up from individual words used in the 2018 study. Each time, they had to choose whether the word pair was &#8220;humorous&#8221; or &#8220;humourless&#8221;.</p>



<p>Participants rated as many pairs as they wanted. After about two and a half years, the team had gathered a total of 55,100 ratings from 597 unique sessions. (In theory, the same person could access the app multiple times, so they don’t know the number of unique participants).</p>



<p>They found that word pairs participants considered funny tended to contain individual words that were emotionally arousing; that were concrete (referring to something easily visualised, like <em>gravy</em>, vs something abstract, like <em>nifty</em>); that were less dominating (less threatening); and that were less frequently encountered in English. But relationships between the two words were also important in determining how funny the phrase was.</p>



<p>Pairs made up of individual words with completely unrelated meanings were more likely to be found funny (<em>crab ghetto</em> vs <em>insult nickname</em>, for example). The results also showed that pairs of more similar-<em>sounding</em> words (like <em>moose ooze</em>) were also more likely to be deemed funny.  But overall, when the 2018 data and the new data were compared, the meaning was more important in determining whether a word <em>pair</em> was funny, while other factors (such as how frequently the word is encountered in English and the presence of particular sounds or letters) was more important in determining whether a single word was funny.</p>



<p>The team then ran a second study using 732 fresh word pairs. A total of 32 online participants viewed each of these pairs in sets of four. Each time, they had to pick the funniest and the least funny.                          </p>



<p>The top ten most humorous were:</p>



<ul><li><em>Polka hooker</em></li><li><em>Playboy parrot </em></li><li><em>Penis weasel</em></li><li><em>Turnip tramp</em></li><li><em>Funk fungus</em></li><li><em>Spam scrotum</em></li><li><em>Gnome bone</em></li><li><em>Stripper hippo</em></li><li><em>Rowdy bowels</em></li><li><em>Pansy panties</em></li></ul>



<p>while the least humorous were:</p>



<ul><li><em>Sell bargain                                                       </em></li><li><em>Conserve health                                              </em></li><li><em>Power influence                                             </em></li><li><em>Will stay                                                              </em></li><li><em>Schedule year                                                  </em></li><li><em>Insult nickname                                               </em></li><li><em>Life friend                                                          </em></li><li><em>Trouble mention                                             </em></li><li><em>Workman call                                                    </em></li><li><em>Large small     </em></li></ul>



<p>Clearly, pairs containing sex- and excretion-related words scored highly. Again, though, the analysis showed that other meaning-related variables, including concreteness, dominance and level of induced emotional arousal had an effect. As in the first study, words that sounded similar also tended to be rated as funnier, though this time the team did not find a significant link between the relatedness of the meaning of the individual words and humour ratings.</p>



<p>What does all of this mean for our understanding of what makes something funny?</p>



<p>The team thinks that the findings fit with the expectation-violation theory of humour. “Given our prior experience of language, word pairs that contain semantic leaps (such as ‘knapsack rapist’) as well as word pairs that are phonological tongue twisters (such as ‘moose ooze’) are surprising and (benignly) violate our own experience with language and multiword phrases,” the team explains. However, there’s nothing surprising (in terms of meaning) about the single word <em>backpack</em>, for example — and this explains why meaning is less important for the humorousness, or otherwise, of single words.  </p>



<p>The team also point to the &#8220;rule of three&#8221; in comedy writing, in which the first two items set up context and expectations, which are then violated by a humorous punchline. Perhaps, they write, the funniest comedy writers are those who are best at exploiting and integrating both general language-based and context-specific violations “to create multiple pathways to humour.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/food-climate-future-nutrition-millet-seaweed-cassava-mussels">These six foods may become more popular as the planet warms</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">No matter how you slice it, climate change will alter what we eat in the future. Today, just 13 crops provide 80 percent of people’s energy intake worldwide, and about half of our calories come from wheat, maize and rice. Yet some of these crops may not grow well in the higher temperatures, unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events caused by climate change. Already, drought, heat waves and flash floods are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">damaging crops</a> around the world<em>.</em></p>



<p>“We must diversify our food basket,” says Festo Massawe. He’s executive director of Future Food Beacon Malaysia, a group at the University of Nottingham Malaysia campus in Semenyih that studies the impact of climate change on food security.</p>



<p>That goes beyond what we eat to how we grow it. The trick will be investing in every possible solution: breeding crops so they’re more climate resilient, genetically engineering foods in the lab and studying crops that we just don’t know enough about, says ecologist Samuel Pironon of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London. To feed a growing population in a rapidly changing world, food scientists are exploring many possible avenues, while thinking about how to be environmentally friendly.</p>





<p>Consumer preferences are part of the equation as well. “It does have to be that right combination of: It looks good, it tastes good and it’s the right price point,” says Halley Froehlich, an aquaculture and fisheries scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>



<p>Here are six foods that could check all those boxes and feature more prominently on menus and grocery shelves in the future.</p>



<h4>1. Millet</h4>

<p>The United Nations has declared 2023 the International Year of Millets (a handful of varieties exist). Quinoa earned the same honor in 2013, and its sales skyrocketed. First cultivated in Asia some 10,000 years ago, millet is a staple grain in parts of Asia and Africa. Compared with wheat, maize and rice, millet is much <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0958166922000039">more climate resilient</a>; the crop needs little water and thrives in warmer, drier environments. Some more good news: Millet is one of many ancient grains — including teff, amaranth and sorghum — that are similarly sustainable and resilient (not to mention capable of being turned into beer).</p>



<h4>2. Bambara groundnut</h4>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Protein, fiber, minerals (potassium, magnesium and iron)<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Roasted or boiled; gluten-free flour; dairy-free milk</p>



<p>You’ve heard of almond milk and soy milk. The next alternative at your coffee shop could be made from Bambara groundnuts, a drought-tolerant legume native to sub-Saharan Africa. Like other legumes, the Bambara groundnut is packed with protein. And bacteria on the plant convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia so the groundnut grows well in nutrient-poor soil without chemical fertilizers. A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00425-019-03191-6">better understanding of the plant</a>, says Festo Massawe of Future Food Beacon Malaysia, could pave the way for breeding programs to help the Bambara groundnut become as popular as the soybean, a legume that produces high yields but is less drought tolerant.</p>



<h4>3. Mussels</h4>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Protein, omega-3, vitamin B12, minerals (iron, manganese and zinc)<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Steamed; added to pasta dishes, stews, soups</p>



<p>A delicious mussel linguine might someday become a weeknight regular on the family menu. Mussels and other bivalves, including oysters, clams and scallops, could make up about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2616-y">40 percent of seafood by 2050</a>, according to a 2020 report in <em>Nature</em>. With no need to be watered or fertilized, bivalve farms are prime for scaling up, which would lower prices for consumers. All bivalves have merit, but Halley Froehlich of UC Santa Barbara singles out mussels as “super hardy,” “super nutritious” and underhyped. One downside: Shell-forming creatures are threatened as rising carbon levels boost ocean acidification. Kelp might be able to help.</p>



<h4>4. Kelp</h4>

<p>Kelp has a few cool climate-friendly tricks. For one, by taking in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, it can <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2017.00100/full">lower the acidity</a> of its watery surroundings. Farmers in Maine and Alaska grow kelp and bivalves together so that the shelled critters can benefit from the less acidic water. Kelp also sequesters carbon, like underwater trees. That means growing and eating more kelp could be good for the environment. While kelp and other seaweeds have been widely consumed in Asia for thousands of years, they’re still an acquired taste in many Western countries.</p>

<p>The drought-tolerant enset, cultivated in Ethiopia, is nicknamed the “false banana” because the plant resembles a banana tree, though its fruit is inedible. It’s also called “the tree against hunger” because its starchy stems can be harvested at any time of year, making it a reliable buffer food crop during dry periods. A 2021 report in <em>Environmental Research Letters</em> suggests that the enset’s range could be expanded to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac40b2/meta">other parts of Africa</a>, and possibly beyond. The processing required to make enset edible is complex, says study author James Borrell of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. So any expansion would have to be led by the communities who hold that Indigenous knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Source of:</strong> Carbohydrates, potassium, vitamin C<br><strong>Uses:</strong> Whole cooked root; gluten-free flour; tapioca pearls in bubble tea</p>



<p>Cassava, a starchy root vegetable from South America, checks the boxes for climate resilience, sustainability and nutrition. Now grown in over 100 countries, cassava can withstand temperatures of up to 40° Celsius and is salt and drought tolerant. An added plus: Higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels enhance the plant’s tolerance to stress and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12042-020-09255-2">can lead to higher yields</a>. Raw cassava can contain toxic levels of cyanide, but the chemical can be removed by peeling, soaking and cooking the root.</p>

<p><strong>Cometary evidence of a planet beyond Pluto </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cometary-evidence-planet-beyond-pluto"><em>Science News</em></a>, May 6, 1972</p>



<p>There have been suggestions that our solar system might have a tenth planet…. In the April <em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific</em>, a mathematician … presents what he says is “some very interesting evidence of a planet beyond Pluto.” The evidence comes from calculations of the orbit of Halley’s comet.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The 1972 evidence never yielded a planet, but astronomers haven’t stopped looking — though it became a search for Planet 9 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">with Pluto’s 2006 switch to dwarf status</a>. In the mid-2010s, scientists hypothesized that the tug of a large planet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-clues-search-planet-nine">500&nbsp;to 600 times as far from the sun as Earth</a> could explain the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-may-lurk-far-beyond-neptune">peculiar orbits of some objects</a> in the solar system’s debris-filled Kuiper Belt (<em>SN: 7/23/16, p. 7</em>). But that evidence <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hidden-planet-nine-solar-system-evidence-may-not-hold-up">might not stand up to further scrutiny</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 9</em>). Researchers using the Atacama C­osmology Telescope in Chile to scan nearly 90 percent of the Southern Hemisphere’s sky <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2307">had no luck finding the planet</a>, the team reported in December 2021.</p>
