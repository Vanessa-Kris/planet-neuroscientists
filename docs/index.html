<p>Do students take notes in an optimal fashion, in line with what psychology research identifies as best practice? It’s an important question given that modern surveys suggest that most students’ preferred approach to exam preparation is to memorise their notes. To find out, a team led by Kayla Morehead at Kent State University has quizzed hundreds of university students about their note-taking methods and preferences, and they’ve <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2019.1569694">reported their findings</a> in the journal <em>Memory</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-36825"></span></p>
<p>According to Morehead’s team, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11251-018-9458-0">the</a> <a href="https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf">evidence</a>, though complex and mixed, suggests overall that it is better to take notes with pen and paper rather than typing on a laptop (laptops can distract the note-taker and those sat near them, and note-book notes tend to be more varied and less verbatim). Yet nearly half the sample reported that they took lectures notes on a laptop. However, around a third were flexible in their approach – for instance, they resorted to a laptop only when the lecturer spoke quickly. Whether the students’ flexible strategies were effective has not yet been tested by research, the authors said.</p>
<p>Another key finding in the psychology literature is that it’s better to use your notes to organise the information you’re learning about, rather than to simply record what you hear verbatim. Nearly 60 per cent of the sample said they organised their notes, meaning a sizeable minority were following a sub-optimal strategy.</p>
<p>When it comes to learning from one’s notes, passively re-reading is an extremely popular strategy, even though it’s more effective to use the notes to test yourself. Over 90 per cent of the current sample said they spent time re-reading while about half tested themselves.</p>
<p>An increasing proportion of students are today enrolled in online courses where they can, in theory, revisit recorded lectures as many times as they like. Perhaps it is this sense of constant availability that explains why only around half of the online-course students in the sample said that they took notes. This is a concerning finding, the researchers said, since the ability to revisit online lectures does not negate the benefit of taking organised notes from them, nor using those notes for self-testing.</p>
<p>This is just one sample, based in the US, and the findings could be different in other cultures and settings. Nonetheless, there no obvious reason to suppose the findings would be radically different elsewhere: the mundanity and apparent simplicity of taking notes belies the importance of this activity for learning, and anecdotally, it’s rare for students to receive formal advice or tuition on how to take notes.  Among the current sample, fewer than half of participants said they’d received any formal training and nearly 60 per cent said they would like to take better notes.</p>
<p>“Given the importance of effective note-taking to memory for and learning of course content, continuing to examine student note-taking behaviour as technologies change will be an important avenue for future research,” Morehead and her colleagues said.</p>

(As outlined in </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2011/03/plos-one-open-access-and-future-of.html"><span>this article</span></a><span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Until recently, I had assumed that <i>eLife </i>at least was fully committed to openness. In 2016, for instance, it </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication"><span>posted details</span></a><span> of its publishing costs. But now I am not so sure.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I will preface my further remarks by saying that <i>eLife</i> is a frequent publisher of </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press"><span>press releases</span></a><span>, and routinely emails me copies of them. In response, I am assiduous in posting details of these releases on social media. As I see it, the relationship between <i>eLife</i> and reporters like me is a two-way thing: I publicise their press releases; they answer my questions. Simples!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>However, it would seem <i>eLife</i> may not see it in the same way. Let me explain. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /><a name="more"></a><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Signalling something important?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Last month, I was invited to take part in a press briefing webinar with the new <i>eLife</i> Editor-in-Chief </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisen"><span>Mike Eisen</span></a><span>, who has replaced the founding EiC </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman"><span>Randy Schekman</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>During the briefing, practically all the questions posed by journalists were about business models and APCs. These did not seem to me to be questions best directed at an EiC, and in fact, Eisen had little to say in response other than that he believes APCs to be problematic and in any case the focus should be on achieving open access, not worrying about the details of business models. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In subsequently reflecting on the event it occurred to me that the appointment of Eisen is not simply the replacement of one EiC with another Rather, <i>eLife</i> is surely signalling something important about its future. So far as I am aware this point has not been made by <i>eLife</i> however, and it was not something explored in the press briefing, or indeed in subsequent reporting of the appointment (so far as I am aware).  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Maybe I am wrong, but that seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion to reach if one considers that Eisen’s OA advocacy in recent years has been almost exclusively focused on the need to move beyond the journal in favour of preprint archives and post-publication peer review, which is not what <i>eLife</i> is about. As Eisen </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/"><span>put it</span></a><span> in a recent Reddit Q&amp;A, “I would advocate doing away with ALL journals – not just for profit journals. The issue is that the idea of a journal as an entity that accepts or rejects papers and ‘publishes’ them is antiquated.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Eisen outlined his ideas on this in a post last year where he </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise"><span>described</span></a><span> what he calls an APPRAISE system.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>By contrast, <i>eLife</i> has (so far as I am aware) always positioned itself as a high-quality OA competitor to <i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>. (I.e. a kind of OA mirror image of those journals). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Moreover, when pressed by its funders to become sustainable, <i>eLife </i>chose not to try something new and different, but simply emulated other publishers by introducing APCs (</span><span>$2,500 per article). It has yet to achieve sustainability, but in February the outgoing EiC <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">appeared to indicate</a> that the objective and approach remained the same, with sustainability expected to be achieved (in the next two or three years) by a doubling of the number of submissions to <i>eLife</i>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As I say, this seems very different to Eisen’s view of the world. And that is why I am inclined to conclude that his appointment suggests that <i>eLife</i> is planning to reinvent itself. Either that or there is some kind of misalignment between <i>eLife’s</i> world view and that of its new EiC. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This is just speculation because, as far I am aware, <i>eLife</i> has not stated that it is planning to reinvent itself. Anyway, I was by now sufficiently intrigued that </span><span>when <i>eLife’s</i> press officer contacted me after the briefing, I responded with some questions. And when it seemed that I was not making much progress that way, I suggested doing a formal Q&amp;A with <i>eLife’s</i> Executive Director Mark Patterson. I was told that he was happy to do this and so emailed over the list of questions below. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Unfortunately, in a strange echo of my experience with PLOS, a week later I received an email saying, “We’ve reviewed the questions that you sent over, and there’s not much more that we’re able to add in response at this stage.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In a subsequent email I was told, “The answers to the questions we have not already addressed will become clear in time, and we’ll be happy to share more information as it’s available. Having seen all your questions, it’s simply that we’re not prepared to answer them all right now.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Out of sync?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I get that if <i>eLife</i> is in the middle of a strategic review it might not want to provide detailed answers to one or two of my questions, but for Patterson not to answer any of the questions I sent below seems out of sync both with <i>eLife’s</i> claimed commitment to openness and transparency, and with the unspoken contract I believe should exist between organisations and those like me who report on them: I publicise their news and developments; they answer my questions. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Either way, I have to wonder why <i>eLife</i> was not willing to answer some of the questions. Why, for instance, was it not prepared to say whether Eisen has ever had an EiC position before.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Likewise, why seven months after the initiative was announced was <i>eLife </i>not prepared to share with me its views on Plan S, why was it not prepared to say how many APC waivers it is granting, and why was it not prepared to rehearse for me the results of the peer review trial it held last year? Why also was it not prepared to say whether it believes Read-and-Publish agreements will prove cheaper than the traditional Big Deal, and what impact these agreements might have on small publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>More puzzlingly, why if he was unwilling to answer any of the questions I sent him did Patterson agree to do an interview in the first place?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This is all the more baffling to me given that the day before <i>eLife</i> emailed to say it was not prepared to answer my questions, Eisen was introducing himself on Reddit by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b5cwm2/i_am_michael_eisen_scientist_advocate_for/"><span>saying</span></a><span> that his objective is “to build a new ecosystem of scholarly publishing based not on journals, but on immediate, author-driven publication coupled with post-publication peer review and curation, and the role I envision <i>eLife</i> will play in this new ecosystem”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In that Q&amp;A he also said, “F1000Research isn’t, at least not yet, interested in doing anything beyond technical peer review of papers. They do an excellent job of this, but it’s a different problem than what I was thinking with APPRAISE, and now what I want to do at <i>eLife</i>, which is to help organize the literature, to help people find what’s interesting and important to them, and to help contextualize works for readers, and to help authors and people potentially interested in hiring, promoting or funding them to know what the community thinks of the quality and impact of their work.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Could not <i>eLife</i> have responded to my questions about its future strategy by at least saying something similar to that?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Financial models?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is worth noting that the very </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise#comment-155"><span>first question</span></a><span> posted in response to Eisen’s outline of his APPRAISE idea was, “Fascinating stuff, but what’s the financial model here?” – a question to which Eisen did not respond. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Certainly, if the new strategy of <i>eLife</i> involves making APPRAISE a reality some kind of a financial modelling will be necessary, not least because if the publisher is still not sustainable and its funders expect it to become so in the next few years, it will presumably need to find additional resources from somewhere. In other words, while business models may not be something Eisen is concerned about, someone at <i>eLife</i> needs to take an interest in them. It was partly in order to gain some understanding of this that I invited Patterson to do a formal Q&amp;A. And I asked him specifically because as <i>eLife’s</i> Executive Director I assume that is his bag. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Doubtless the open source </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/33e4127f/elife-introduces-libero-a-new-open-source-tool-for-publishing"><span>Libero</span></a><span> products that <i>eLife</i> is co-developing are relevant here too. And I was again puzzled that <i>eLife</i> was not prepared to answer my question about its open source activities even though it has been giving webinars on the topic (e.g. </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/f8226477/in-publishing-the-latest-on-the-open-source-publishing-platform-libero"><span>here</span></a><span>). I can only conclude that while <i>eLife</i> is happy to broadcast press releases and organise managed events, it is reluctant to answer specific questions from reporters outside of these managed events. A cynic might think that this is because reporters tend to ask probing questions – questions like, “Was that a wise decision you made?” and “Where is the business model here?”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is also worth pointing out that in the webinar linked above <i>eLife</i> <u>was</u> asked about business models. The reply was that business models are not relevant to non-profits, which have only to achieve sustainability. This seems to me to miss the point that in order to achieve sustainability some kind of financial model is necessary – as Knowledge Unlatched </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html"><span>discovered</span></a><span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The fact is that regardless of any new development work Eisen might be hoping to see at <i>eLife</i>, 30% of its expenditures are already going towards “technology and innovation”. Moreover, <i>eLife</i> has made it clear that Libero Publisher is being developed as a post-peer-review publishing platform, not some kind of preprint APPRAISE solution. If those authors (and/or their institutions) who are now having to pay <i>eLife</i> APCs find themselves having to subsidise a growing number of technology projects, they might start to feel a little aggrieved.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Presumably, <i>eLife</i> hopes that at some point it will be able to earn revenue from providing software-as-a-service solutions around Libero – much as </span><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/"><span>Public Knowledge Project</span></a><span> does with its </span><a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/"><span>Open Journal Systems</span></a><span> platform. The challenge, of course, is that developing new publishing workflow systems is neither easy nor cheap, as PLOS <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/12/ceo-letter-to-the-community-mudditt/">discovered</a>. True <i>eLife</i> is sharing the load with third parties – but even so. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This post is about my personal disappointment with <i>eLife</i>, but I believe there is a wider issue here: what I perceive to be a decreasing level of openness in the OA movement – an issue I have previously raised </span><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/12/open-access-slips-into-closed-mode.html"><span>here</span></a><span>. I think we can see the same trend evident in the way in which Plan S was developed and proposed. But do not those who advocate for open access and greater transparency (which, we could note, they consistently demand of legacy publishers) have a responsibility to walk the talk themselves, not least by answering reporters’ questions? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Be that as it may, I await with interest to learn more about the future <i>eLife</i> sees for itself in the developing new world of scholarly communication, the role that its new EiC will play in this, and whether the task it set itself in 2012 is about to be recalibrated in a significant way.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is just a shame that after appointing a new EiC <i>eLife</i> seems unwilling to answer questions about the significance of its choice, or even answer questions about current OA developments like Plan S and Read-and-Publish agreements. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Anyway, for the record, I am posting below the questions I sent to Patterson.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Questions for Mark Patterson </span></h3><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>Mike Eisen’s appointment as <i>eLife</i>’s new Editor-in-Chief is an interesting development. As I understand it, <i>eLife</i> was founded in 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust as a high-quality open-access journal intended to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/infographic-how-is-elife-measuring-up">compete with</a> </span><span>prestigious subscription journals like <i>Nature</i>, <i>Science</i> and <i>Cell</i>. Its first Editor-in-Chief was the besuited, suave Nobel prize winner Randy Schekman. Eisen is the rumbustious T-short wearing co-founder of PLOS. It was PLOS that in 2003 pioneered use of the article-processing charge (APC) and it was PLOS that in 2006 launched PLOS ONE, which is committed to publishing any paper deemed to be <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/reviewer-guidelines">technically rigorous and worthy of inclusion in the published scientific record</a>.  </span><span>The PLOS ONE </span><span>model has been characterised by some as <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454011a.html">bulk-publishing</a></span><span>. Eisen is also a firm <a href="https://asapbio.org/eisen-appraise">advocate for preprints</a></span><span> and in 2017 <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2017/10/q-with-plos-co-founder-michael-eisen.html">said to me</a>,</span><span> “We should all publish in bioRxiv and review papers outside of journals. It’s the only way forward.”</span><span> This would seem to be a very different view of scholarly publishing to the one that has been espoused by <i>eLife</i> to date, and so must signal a change of direction for <i>eLife</i>. How would you characterise that new direction?</span><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="border: none; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>Has Mike Eisen ever worked as an Editor-in-Chief before?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> was wholly subsidised by funders for the first five years, but in 2017 it introduced an APC of $2,500. It has, however, yet to become sustainable. Doubtless, that is why during the press call that Eisen gave on March 5<sup>th</sup> all bar one of the questions asked by journalists were about business models and APCs. Responsibility for business models and financial matters at <i>eLife</i> is not in fact part of Eisen’s job description. Who is responsible to the <i>eLife</i> Board for business models, financial sustainability and strategy? You as Executive Director perhaps?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>When pushed on APCs during the press call Eisen said that he views them as problematic. He did not, however, propose </span><span>any alternative way of funding <i>eLife</i>. Instead, he said that since there is enough money in the current subscription system the research community should simply focus on achieving OA rather than worrying over the details of business models. All that is needed, he said, is to reallocate subscription money to pay for OA. Leaving aside the problem of how one does that, I am wondering if the claim holds up. One of the primary reasons why librarians have been calling for open access over the past 20-odd years is that they say they cannot afford the subscription model, which they believe to be unsustainable. Their assumption has always been that open access will be cheaper and so can solve their affordability problem. It has, however, yet to be demonstrated that OA is cheaper. Nevertheless, librarians continue to insist that they should pay publishers less money. One of the reasons UC gave for walking away from its negotiations with Elsevier recently, for instance, was that the publisher was not prepared to reduce what it charges the university. As Jeff MacKie-Mason <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/02/28/why-uc-split-with-publishing-giant-elsevier/">has explained</a>,</span><span> UC set two goals when it began the negotiation: “a reduction in costs and default open access publication for UC authors”. At the same time, we could note that the <a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-release/all-corporate-news/wiley-and-projekt-deal-partner-enhance-future-scholarly-research-an">Wiley/Project DEAL Read-and-Publish agreement</a></span><span> is not expected to be any cheaper than a traditional Big Deal. Do <i>you</i> think open access will reduce the costs of scholarly publishing? If not, will there not continue to be an unresolved problem in an OA world?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>As noted, despite introducing an APC, <i>eLife</i> is still not sustainable. The funders supporting the publisher say they want it to do so in the near future. In an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">interview</a></span><span> he gave to <i>Nature</i> in February, Randy Schekman said, “The journal still receives income from charitable funders, as well as from article-processing charges. But we hope for <i>eLife</i> to be self-sustaining within two or three years. The financial models we have drawn show that it can be done.” He added, “We believe that <i>eLife</i> has the bandwidth to grow maybe two-fold in submissions — and if we do this, we can sustain ourselves without charitable funding.” Eisen seemed unaware of this financial modelling at the time of the press call. Can you say more about it? Is it </span><span>enough (and even possible) to double submissions in the next two or three years? <i>eLife’s </i><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/50d52087/annual-report-looking-back-on-2017">2017 annual report</a></span><span> indicated that submissions fell after the introduction of an APC. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>In that same report, <i>eLife</i> said that around half of its submissions did not attract a fee. </span><span>I think this was partly because APCs were <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication">introduced during the reporting period</a>. </span><span>However, <i>eLife</i> does also offer <a href="https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#waiver">waivers</a></span><span> for “labs under financial pressure – whether because of local economy, career stage, or a lack of funding.” What percentage of the papers <i>eLife </i>is currently publishing are attracting a waiver, and how do you see this changing over time?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><i><span>eLife</span></i><span> operates a novel open and consultative peer review system. Last year it </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/2905802e/peer-review-elife-trials-a-new-approach"><span>announced a trial</span></a><span> to test the feasibility of what it called “a radical form of peer review” in which “once an editor has invited a manuscript for full peer review, the journal is committed to publishing the work along with the reviewer reports, the decision letter, and the author response.” Some initial results of that trial have been published </span><a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/262c4c71/peer-review-first-results-from-a-trial-at-elife"><span>here</span></a><span>. But how would you summarise these results and how do you envisage peer review developing in future, both at <i>eLife</i> and generally in scholarly publishing, particularly in light of the growing preprint movement and Eisen’s view that peer review ought to take place “outside of journals”?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>I may have missed it, but I do not believe <i>eLife</i> has published a response to Plan S. I do know that when Schekman was </span><span>asked about Plan S in February, he <a class="" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00595-y">commented</a></span><span>, “I’m very supportive of this. Open access is the future. Commercial journals have been fighting against this very hard because it poses a clear danger to their profit margin … There will be a shakedown in the business. Some journals will lose out.” Is that <i>eLife’s </i>official position? If not, what is its position?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>●<span>        </span></span><span>In light of the Project DEAL/ Wiley agreement, I am thinking that this model (and/or the Read-and-Publish </span><span>one) is likely to become the norm going forward, and I assume such deals will eventually be done with Elsevier. The problem for <i>eLife</i> I would think is that these are essentially new-style Big Deals, a model that inevitably favours large commercial legacy publishers and by its very nature tends to elbow aside small publishers like <i>eLife</i>. Unable to cut such deals with libraries, funders and/or consortia might it be that <i>eLife </i>will be one of the journals to lose out (as Schekman puts it)?

<p>In the era of social media and rolling news there’s a constant pressure to be in the know, always on hand with an aperçus or two. Today <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/23/something-we-could-use-a-little-more-of-studies-link-intellectual-humility-with-openness-to-other-viewpoints/">intellectual humility</a> therefore feels more important than ever – having the insight and honesty to hold your hands up and say you’re ignorant or inexpert about an issue.</p>
<p>Psychologists are responding by taking an increasing interest in intellectual humility, including investigating its consequences for learning and the thinking styles that support it. For a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2019.1579359">new paper</a> in <em>The Journal of Positive Psychology</em> a team led by Elizabeth Krumrei-Mancuso have continued this endeavour, showing, among other things, that intellectual humility correlates with superior general knowledge. This is a logical outcome because, as the researchers write, “simply put, learning requires the humility to realise one has something to learn.”</p>
<p><span id="more-36821"></span></p>
<p>Krumrei-Mancuso and her colleagues conducted five studies in all, attempting to find out more about the links between intellectual humility and knowledge acquisition; between intellectual humility and meta-knowledge (insight into one’s own knowledge); and lastly between intellectual humility and other thinking styles.</p>
<p>A strength and a weakness of the research is the use of two different measures of intellectual humility. Some studies involved a shorter questionnaire assessing being a “know-it-all” (through agreement or not with statements like “I know just about everything there is to know”) and intellectual openness (through agreement or not with statements like “I can learn from other people”); whereas other studies used a more recently developed, more comprehensive 22-item measure incorporating questions about cognitions, emotions and behaviours representative of intellectual humility (such as, being accepting of criticism of one’s important beliefs; being ready to change one’s mind; and respect for others’ viewpoints). This use of different measures makes for a more comprehensive, varied assessment of intellectual humility, but also impedes comparison between the studies.</p>
<p>The findings in relation to knowledge acquisition were mixed. While an online study involving 604 adults (and using the more comprehensive measure of intellectual humility) found the aforementioned link between greater intellectual humility and superior general knowledge, another involving college students (and the briefer intellectual humility questionnaire) found that those higher in intellectual humility achieved poorer grades. Perhaps the latter result arose because the higher-achieving students used their objectively higher grades to judge their intellectual ability as higher, not having had the chance yet in life to confront their intellectual fallibility (but as mentioned, the use of different measures across the studies complicates any interpretation of the mixed results).</p>
<p>In terms of insight, higher scorers in intellectual humility were less likely to claim knowledge they didn’t have (the researchers tested this by assessing participants’ willingness to claim familiarity with entirely fictitious facts that they couldn’t possibly know), and they also tended to underestimate their performance on a cognitive ability test.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other thinking styles and constructs that correlated with greater intellectual humility included being more inclined to reflective thinking, having more “need for cognition” (enjoying thinking hard and problem solving), greater curiosity, and open-minded thinking. More intellectual humility was also associated with less “social vigilantism”, defined as seeing other people’s beliefs as inferior.</p>
<p>While the new findings “replicate and extend previous studies using different measures of intellectual humility”, it’s fair to say there remains a great deal we don’t yet know about intellectual humility. Perhaps most important is the lack of longitudinal research to establish causality – for instance, we don’t yet know if greater general knowledge and open-mindedness fosters intellectual humility, or if intellectual humility comes first, and promotes knowledge and curiosity. Most likely the causal associations between these constructs are complex and two-way, but at the moment, if we’re honest, we just don’t know.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-datasets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to thedensity-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional’ clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/04/02/the-business-of-bystanding/">The Business of Bystanding</a></h4>

<p>For many centuries, corporations and academia have been working to fulfill those goals I just listed above. But we are not anywhere as successful today as we should be, considering our collective knowledge and competence. #MeTooSTEM, #MeToo, and #UsToo have shown that. So how come we don’t have it all figured out?</p>
<p>An easy answer is that the rules and players on our teams are changing. Televised news and movie watching changed our rules for how we treat each other over the course of the last century. Where before we would jump in to assist in an impending tragedy or intervene to de-escalate a fight that was about something of value to us, now we sometimes sit back (or tally points) while we watch because our screens have trained us to be hostages to our feelings and trauma.</p>
<p>A more difficult answer lies in how differentiated our roles and group missions have become. Over the last several decades, more solo pioneers are advancing across the vast, multidimensional landscape that is corporate and academic America. I am excited for us because I know we can be competent at the work. And I am frustrated for us, because the solo pioneering feels unsafe although it is taking place in our own homes, towns, communities, and country… where we should ostensibly feel and be safe.</p>
<p>The issue of safety – felt and actual – is one that will take many posts to cover. What I want to discuss today and in my next post is how we can adapt to our changed rules and teammates. Change is difficult for everyone, even when it’s toward a common goal. For most of our history, we have known that change can be difficult and that certain types of dynamics tend to creep into our groups and structures over time. The difficulty arises when we become too fractured or unequal. I think this is a real danger in the community generally and even in such ostensibly cohesive communities like many U.S. universities. I would venture to say that R01-intensive research universities can almost intentionally perpetuate this fractious existence, with their extreme specialization in academia and large inequalities in training and experience of the different roles that make up a university.</p>
<p>In short, I don’t know how to adapt, it’s just something I do, something we all do somehow. I think healthy communities can enable people to adapt in their own way by painting a clear picture of the goal, the target towards which we are adapting. And that is done by setting expectations and constructively communicating our satisfaction in instances where community members meet those expectations.</p>
<p>But here, I have ventured into abstract territory when I really wanted to provide some examples of bystanding gone right or wrong, from my point of view. First, an example of bystanding gone wrong. Remember that odd character associated with my church from a few posts ago, E. Robinson? Well that person made me feel uncomfortable, sort of creeped-out occasionally, even before I came to the conclusion that they had pawned me. But did I say anything to call attention to it or warn other people about their creepiness? Not quite. And why not? Mostly because I could never quite put my finger on what exactly was wrong. It was mostly an odd feeling, almost an aura surrounding Esteban or Elaine or whatever name they were going by at the time. It felt stupid and uncharitable to say to the people around me, “This person, E. Robinson, seems somehow sort of fake or  inconsistent or unconcerned with other people’s feelings and safety.” I couldn’t think of concrete, objective observations that were likely to convince me or others of what exactly felt wrong about this person.</p>
<p>There were a few small things that seemed petty or trivial to bring up, and so I didn’t. But should I have? How much would it really have helped to complain to the people around me, “E. Robinson was mad that my friend didn’t want to break up with her long-term boyfriend (and future husband) to date them,” or “E. Robinson complained within earshot of our mutual friend upon discovering that our friend’s girlfriend was not the type that E. Robinson would have wanted to date,” or “E. Robinson was upset that I didn’t want to eat a large box of veggie burgers which they had purchased just for me,” or “E. Robinson seemed angry at another church member who had asked E. Robinson not to gossip about her,” or “E. Robinson got annoyed with me for asking them to drive one extra block to drop me off right at my car after carpooling to dinner.” In retrospect, now that I have written this, it occurs to me that I could have contributed more to E. Robinson’s gas money and veggie burger fund. Perhaps that was part of the source of the drama. And E. Robinson was generally good company to be around, usually happy and witty and knowledgeable about fun places to go around town or good music to listen to. But I digress. The point I wanted to make here is that I didn’t know how to constructively set expectations for my social circle, which probably contributed to me feeling as though I had gotten pawned by this E. Robinson character. If I had been able to do that constructively, I could have helped myself and been a better bystander to my community.</p>
<p>Here’s another example of bystanding gone wrong, involving a guy I had a crush on in school. I once saw him acting a bit oddly, really goofy in fact. We were at a social event in a public place, and I took a picture of him because he was acting so funny – he was really in my face when normally he was a calm, gentle person. I gave him the picture a few days later, assuming he would find his goofy grin as funny as I had. But he didn’t. In fact, the opposite happened. He had no idea how he had come to look like that picture of himself. And he got upset as he searched the picture for clues to understand how, when, where this had happened. He started asking questions, “When was this? Was I drunk?” At first I laughed a bit because I was so surprised by his confusion and it seemed funny. But I really didn’t like to see him that distressed, and as I realized his discomfort was serious, I calmed down and tried to start figuring out with him just when I had taken the picture and why he seemed to have no memory of it. But just then, someone else walked by and took the picture away and indicated that it was move on with whatever project we had been in the middle of. So we never did get to the bottom of his confusion and I felt bad that I had not been able to help him.</p>
<p>And now here’s an example of bystanding that went … not fully right. It happened at church, of all places, and it involved the E. Robinson character, of all people. I had been chatting with someone else from my church, a guy with whom I had gone to the movies once and had a bad experience. I still talked to him at church though, because he was a member of that community and I considered it important to be hospitable to people in my church community. Anyway, as our conversation drew to a close, I was going to excuse myself and walk home. My friend offered to walk me home and I declined because I still felt a bit uncomfortable around him. And in general, I didn’t need to be walked home, a walk I took every day, multiple times a day, 99.9% of the time without incident. So I appreciated that he didn’t force his walking services on me, respecting me enough to respect my answer. But then, E. Robinson got really mad that my friend had respected my “no.” E. Robinson tried to shame my friend by making a point of walking me home, so that the next week after church my friend felt compelled to walk me home without asking. He pointed out this odd dynamic to me, which was vaguely helpful, saying “I feel like I owe it to E. Robinson to walk you home.” So this little mini-drama eventually became an example of constructive bystanding by my friend, who modeled the dynamic of trying to balance my request (of not being walked home) with his own conscience about meeting expectations of other members of the community (in this case, E. Robinson, who had shamed him and who had walked me home previously without asking) while explaining to me the social dynamics that were causing him to interact in a way that was motivated by E. Robinson’s preferences rather than by mine.</p>
<p>It may seem odd that I would spend so many words detailing what seems like a minor drama. I decided to write about it because it helps illuminate, for me, how unequipped I was to deal with the likes of E. Robinson when I was a college student. I didn’t know how to clearly state my observations of their behavior back to them and then share my feelings, needs, and requests. If I had had more experience with constructive communication, giving feedback, and the like, perhaps I would have said something like the following to E. Robinson:</p>
<p>“I just heard you make an example of yourself intending to walk me home when I declined a walking partner. It looked to me as though you were motivated by discomfort or anger. I feel uncomfortable with how you let me know that you intend to walk me home. I feel unsafe and unheard. I need you to let me walk home by myself or to share with me what about that idea makes you uncomfortable. Would you be willing to tell me what prompted you to decide to walk me home so abruptly?”</p>
<p>It is a somewhat foreign way of talking for me and, I suspect, for many people. However, it is also a way to diffuse a difficult situation and have a conversation that can be meaningful and helpful for others. This sample conversation blurb was modeled after Marshall Rosenberg’s principle of nonviolent conversation. I have yet to try it in real life, but eventually I hope to put all my reading to use.</p>
<p>And, to close out this post, let me finish with a story of helpful bystanding that was fun! At least, it was fun for me because I was the beneficiary of it. My senior year of college, I moved into an upstairs studio apartment that was unfurnished. But no bother, I had my own furniture as well as all my clothes, luggage, and usual apartment essentials. As I struggled up the stairs with my mattress, I realized that I had vastly, incredibly underestimated the strength and time that would be required for me to move all my stuff into the apartment. At that auspicious moment, my downstairs neighbor appeared and began helping me move all my stuff upstairs. I was grateful for the assistance, as it would have taken me likely close to 20 hours to move all the furniture in, assuming I didn’t fall and break something going up and down the stairs. I had never had help moving furniture from someone who didn’t live with me before, and it felt like a treat to have a neighbor offer to help me out of their own good will without expecting anything in return. This case worked out for me because it was clear that I needed help, the type of help I needed was also clear, and it was something that could be done with good, hard, work and no judgment. And after the move was complete, I took him out for dinner as a thank you and we had a fun evening hanging out and eating pizza downtown.</p>
<p>In a future post, I’ll explore ideas for making more ambiguous situations clear, so that the type of help one can safely and effectively render to a person in need is likely to be clear to both the person in need and their helper.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no simple explanation for why psychology has been hit so hard by the </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replication crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – it’s the result of a complicated mix of professional incentives, </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionable research practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other factors, including the sheer popularity of the sorts of sexy, counterintuitive findings that make for great TED Talk fodder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that might not be the entire story. Some have also posited a more sociological explanation: political bias. After all, psychology is overwhelmingly liberal. Estimates vary and depend on the methodology used to generate them, but among professional psychologists the </span><a href="http://yoelinbar.net/papers/political_diversity.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ratio of liberals to conservatives is something like 14:1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A new PsyArXiv </span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6k3j5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first-authored by Diego Reinero at New York University – and involving an “adversarial collaboration” in which “ two sets of authors were simultaneously testing the same question with different theoretical commitments” – has looked for evidence to support this explanation, and found that while liberal bias per se is not associated with research replicability, highly politically biased findings of either slant (liberal or conservative) are less robust.  </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36811"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crisis-spurred-by-bias theory goes something like this: Because psychology is so dominated by liberals, a certain groupthink sets in. Findings that appeal to liberal sensibilities aren’t viewed as critically – they’re ushered through the scientific gatekeeping process rather than carefully evaluated. For proponents of this theory, it’s  easy to come up with examples: The Implicit Association Test, for example, posits a very liberal-friendly theory – “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbud8rLejLM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">[almost] everyone’s a little bit racist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – and has been </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hobbled, lately, by serious questions about what, exactly, it measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that sort of theorising only gets one so far: If there’s an actual bias helping to determine which questionable findings get published, it should show up at a more zoomed-out level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For the new research, consisting of two studies, nearly 200 psychology findings described in published research abstracts (chosen because they have all been subject to subsequent replication attempts in the literature) were rated on a 1-5 scale from liberal to conservative – or put in a separate, no-political-valence category – by coders not otherwise affiliated with the study. In the first study the coders were a “politically balanced sample of six psychology doctoral students (including self-identified liberals, moderates, and conservatives)”, and in the other they were “a larger, politically diverse sample of American residents (using an online Mechanical Turk sample).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a research finding showing that the perceived threat of appearing racist caused whites to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">distance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> themselves from blacks in an experiment was coded as liberal; a study in which people burdened with secrets perceived hills to be steeper and weights to be heavier was coded as moderate; and a study which showed that exposure to centerfold erotica caused students to rate photos of opposite-sex nude people as less attractive, relative to the ratings of students in a control condition exposed to abstract art, was coded as conservative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the majority of findings were rated as being centrist or politically neutral; among those with a bias, there were more findings rated liberal than conservative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a liberal political bias really has been fueling the replication crisis, it would be through allowing methodologically weaker papers to be published when they had a liberal message, and these papers would then be less likely to replicate later on (replication efforts tend to be conducted carefully enough that they would be unlikely to fall victim to simple political bias).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the authors found no evidence to support this idea. In the first study, “less than 1%” and “less than 2%,” respectively, “of the variance in replicability could be explained by the ideological slant of the original research alone,” and in the second study the variance explained was less than 2 per cent. This would seem like a serious strike against any straightforward idea of a connection between liberal bias and psychology’s replication woes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the researchers also tested for whether the ideological extremity of findings, liberal </span><i>or</i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conservative, was correlated with a lack of replicability. That is, they ignored whether each abstract was coded as liberal or conservative and focused instead on its “distance” from being apolitical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s where the “no liberal bias” takeaway becomes slightly more complicated. With this technique, the researchers found that the more highly ideological a paper was, whether to the left or the right, the less likely it was to replicate – what they called an “ideological extremity effect”. For instance, a strongly liberal-rated study, which showed how subtle cues could make African-American professionals feel unwelcome, failed to replicate, as did the aforementioned, conservative-rated study on centerfold erotica. Overall, “more ideologically slanted research (regardless of liberal vs. conservative ideological slant) was between 34% (Study 1) and 6% (Study 2) less likely to replicate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taken together our results are a starting point for a richer conversation about the role and influence of politics in science,” the researchers concluded. “Our work suggests that politics may play a role in scientific replicability but not in the way many scholars have thought, as we did not find evidence of a liberal bias and instead found preliminary evidence of an ideological extremity effect.” It suggests that yes, there’s a link between ideology and replication-woes, but one that operates in a significantly more complicated way than some replication-crisis-theorists have posited.</span></p>

<p>Recently popularized by a certain populist political figure the phrase ‘Fake News’ has entered the global public lexicon and is routinely weaponized in the arenas of internet debate.</p>
<p>Hoffman presents a debate examining how, for controversial topics, some researchers can be biased towards publishing only positive conclusions whilst others only publish negative conclusions, even when these conclusions use the same data.</p>
<p>The controversial topic for this debate is the efficacy of mammography screening in the detection of breast cancer.   The debate identified 8 manuscripts which studied mammography accuracy and then, through consultation with experts in polarized research, ranked the attitudes of the corresponding authors towards screening.</p>
<p>It was found that the efficacy of the screening reported in the manuscripts correlated with the ranked attitudes of the corresponding authors, suggesting that personal views were influencing the scientific record.</p>
<p>Advice on how Editors, Reviewers and Researchers can handle conflicts of interest are found within the article’s conclusion.  For instance Editors should take into account the personal biases of researchers when inviting them for peer-review.</p>
<p>And, with no conflicts of interest whatsoever to declare, it is the position of Liam and Lingling that this is probably the best article on how personal views can influence research published ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0257-6"><u>Difficulties in administering Euthanasia to patients with Intellectual disabilities</u></a></p>
<p>Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) has been legally possible in the Netherlands since 2001 provided the following criteria are met</p>
<ol>
<li>The request is voluntary;</li>
<li>The patient’s suffering is unbearable, with no prospect for improvement;</li>
<li>The patient is fully informed of the prospect of euthanasia;</li>
<li>There is no, reasonable, alternative treatment available</li>
<li>At least one other physician, independent of the one assisting, provides an opinion concurring with the decision</li>
</ol>
<p>Discussions on EAS legislation for vulnerable people, especially for those with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, are sparse.</p>
<p>The authors analyzed 9 case summaries, published between 2012-2016, concerning either intellectual disability or autism and EAS. The authors conclude that the above criteria are not easily applied to people with intellectual disabilities or autism.</p>
<p>A specialist intellectual disability physician is suggested to be involved in all cases where someone with an intellectual disability requests EAS, and that all physicians involved in capacity assessments of patients with intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum disorder (including those offering a second opinion) must have enhanced training in this area.</p>
<p>Globally, sufficient measures to protect vulnerable patients should be carefully considered while planning to introduce or adapt EAS legislation.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0260-y"><u>Is it ethical to include patients in research?</u></a></p>
<p>Traditionally, research is conducted <em>on</em> patients, however increasingly research is being performed with patients collaborating with the investigators.  This phenomenon is termed Patient Engaged Research (PER). At present the ethical issues involved with PER have been largely unexplored.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a three-round Delphi survey with a panel of early-career researchers (ECRs) from various backgrounds, ranging from general practitioners to postgraduate students to identify ethical issues.</p>
<p>Experienced ECRs were more worried about the applied aspects of PER, such as patient remuneration, recognition of patient contributions and confidentiality. In contrast, junior researchers were concerned with theoretical issues, such as power dynamics between researchers and patients and the exploitation of vulnerable persons. However, both junior and senior ECRs felt inadequately prepared to address the ethical issues despite their overall readiness to conduct PER.</p>
<p>Without the establishment of clear ethical standards for PER, the authors fear that the credibility of PER will suffer and its adoption of as a research practice may be inhibited.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0268-3"><u>Conscientious objection to abortion by midwives and nurses</u></a></p>
<p>Abortion remains a morally contentious issue, and some midwives and nurses might decline to recommend it on the grounds that it conflicts with their personally held religious or ethical beliefs. Fleming <em>et al</em> conducted a systematic review to identify the views of midwives and nurses on the right to object to the provision of an abortion.</p>
<p>Nurses’ and midwives’ views were classified as ‘Moral’, ‘Legal’, ‘Practical or ‘Religious’.  Interestingly all of the manuscripts included in the review, despite being focused on the views of nurses and midwives were written exclusively by physicians, philosophers, legal scholars and lawyers.</p>
<p>81 reasons for midwives and nurses to consciously object to abortion provision were identified.  The most common reason for objection was that one’s conscience is an ‘inner voice that [needs] to be listened to’ and that ‘Religious law should be followed’.</p>
<p>Reasons against conscientious objection were also highlighted with the most popular being that health care providers must separate ‘moral belief from [their] professional life’ and that women have a right to access abortions.</p>
<p>A plurality of reasons both for and against the ability of midwives and nurses to refuse to recommend abortions was unearthed but also, and perhaps more importantly, was the dearth of written work directly from these very professions on the topic.</p>

<p>Time is finite and it is rarely possible to clear one’s inbox let alone address the myriad of health issues which ravage the globe.  As a result the prioritization of which research questions should be tackled first is of upmost importance to policy makers, researchers and ethicists.</p>
<p>The act of prioritizing, itself, is an ethical consideration; for instance should the world’s governments, charities and philanthropists focus more on infectious disease research than on, say, curtailing obesity?</p>
<p>Pratt <em>et al</em>, report on the outcomes of an International Workshop entitled ‘<a href="https://www.healthsystemsglobal.org/web/5/Ethics-of-Global-Health-Research-Priority-Setting-Workshop.html">Ethics of Global Health Research Priority</a>’ held in Oxford.  Global health and ethics experts gathered to discuss the ethical considerations of prioritizing global health research.</p>
<p>The attendees’ reflections have been summarized as 8 research questions such as; “which groups should initiate and lead global health research priority settings?” and “what is the right process for making decisions at this wide world level?”</p>
<p>This report serves as a guide and as a source of impetus for ethicists, researchers and policymakers to develop ethically sound and robust approaches to setting priorities</p>

<p>Of the main personality traits, Neuroticism (characterised by emotional instability and lack of resilience) is probably the one with the least going for it. High scorers on this trait are impulsive, tend to worry a lot, and they struggle with low moods and short tempers. Thanks to personality research, we know a lot about what lies in store for people who score high on Neuroticism, such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/02/your-personality-may-affect-your-vulnerability-to-mental-health-problems/">increased risk of mental health problems</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161205-how-break-ups-change-your-personality">relationship turmoil</a>. But as Robert Klein and Michael Robinson note in their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12469">new paper</a> in <em>Journal of Personality</em> we know a lot less about the psychological processes that underlie the trait. From an emotional perspective, neurotic people are said to be more sensitive to threat and punishment, but what about the cognitive side? Across four studies, Klein and Robinson present evidence consistent with what they call the <em>mental noise hypothesis</em> – “neurotic people have noisier, more chaotic mental control systems”, they write.</p>
<p><span id="more-36790"></span></p>
<p>The four studies involved hundreds of undergrad students, who filled out personality questionnaires and then took part in a simple tracking task, in which they had to use a computer mouse or joystick to track a horizontally moving on-screen target with their cursor as accurately as possible. Each tracking trial, of which there were up to 60 per person, lasted between 30 seconds or as little as 5 seconds.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to examine participants’ tracking accuracy with high temporal precision, using the task to assess “micro-momentary disconnections between the mind and its control of the external environment”. Given the shortness of the trials, plus the fact the task did not require storing or manipulating information in working memory, and that there was no need to adjust to different instructions, Klein and Robinson said it was too simple and easy to be considered an “executive function” task (involving more complex mental processes) and was instead best characterised as a “form of mindfulness task that requires intention, attention and awareness concerning a simple activity”.</p>
<p>Notably, previous research has found an inverse correlation between trait Neuroticism and trait Mindfulness – neurotic folk are often so fretful and distracted with worry about the past and future that they find it difficult to be in the present. However, according to past findings, this distracted state doesn’t manifest in lower IQ or worse job performance. This paradox may be explained by neurotic people compensating by investing more effort than average, the researchers suggested (after all, anxiety-prone people would hate to fail or underperform). Part of the rationale for the tracking task, then, was that it would be so simple that performance would not vary with greater effort – in a sense providing the researchers with a pure measure of their participants’ mental control, or what you could think of as their levels of mental noise.</p>
<p>True to their predictions, the researchers found that across all the studies, higher scorers in Neuroticism were less accurate at tracking the on-screen targets. Also, the link between Neuroticism and poorer performance was consistent, being no greater during earlier or later trials (discounting the influence of factors like fatigue).  “A task with excellent temporal resolution appears to possess considerable value in documenting the sorts of lapses and slips thought to be somewhat endemic to neurotic forms of self-regulation”, the researchers said. In contrast, the other main personality traits, such as Extraversion and Conscientiousness, were not associated with performance.</p>
<p>The researchers also blasted the participants with annoying loud white noise at periodic intervals, to see if this had a greater adverse effect on more neurotic participants. Although the noise blasts impaired performance (affecting accuracy for about a second), the degree of impairment wasn’t any greater for more neurotic people. This may be because the distraction of the noise was so immediate and unavoidable that personality differences were not relevant.</p>
<p>In the final study, after completing the tracking task, participants were also asked to keep a two-week daily diary of their feelings of distress and nervousness, as well as any daily stressors, such as feeling like they had too much to do. Poorer performance on the tracking task correlated with more frequent daily experiences of negative emotional states, regardless of any actual stressors. Klein and Robinson said this was consistent with their task being a kind of implicit personality measure: “even brief lapses of attention can reflect the sorts of processes that give rise to longer term affective consequences,” they said.</p>
<p>If the researchers are correct in their characterisation of Neuroticism – and we need more studies with more diverse participant samples to test their theory – it could open up avenues for interventions to increase emotional stability, for example through <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/01/working-memory-training-could-help-beat-anxiety/">training to increase mental control</a> and so reduce mental noise.</p>

Some people will say, “well, now THAT wasn't very controversial.” But as I mentioned <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/03/cns2019.html">last time</a>, one highlight of the 2019 <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/annual-meeting/">Cognitive Neuroscience Society Annual Meeting</a> was a Symposium organized by <a href="https://www.psych.nyu.edu/poeppel/" target="_blank">Dr. David Poeppel</a>.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span><br /><br /><b>Special Session -</b> <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience">The Relation Between Psychology and Neuroscience</a>, David Poeppel, Organizer, <i>Grand Ballroom</i><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Whether we study single cells, measure populations of neurons,  characterize anatomical structure, or quantify BOLD, whether we collect  reaction times or construct computational models, it is a presupposition  of our field that we strive to bridge the neurosciences and the  psychological/cognitive sciences.

Are we improving society in some way? Adding to a collective body of knowledge that may (or may not) be the key to explaining behavior and curing disease? Although still difficult, Dr. Davachi posed an easier question, “what are your goals?” To describe behavior, predict behavior (correlation), explain behavior (causation), change behavior (manipulation)? But “what counts as an explanation?” I don't think anyone really answered that question. Instead she mentioned the recurring themes of <i><b>levels of analysis </b></i>(without invoking Marr by name), <i><b>emergent properties</b></i> (the flock of birds analogy), and <b><i>bridging laws</i></b> (that link levels of analysis). The correct level of analysis is/are the one(s) that advance your goals. But what to do about “level chauvinism” in contemporary neuroscience? This question was raised again and again.<br /><br /><b>(2) <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/" target="_blank">Dr. Jennifer Groh</a></b> jumped right out of the gate with this motif. There are competing narratives in neuroscience we can call the electrode level (recording from neurons) vs. the neuroimaging level (recording large-scale brain activations or “network” interactions based on an indirect measure of neural activity). They make different assumptions about what is significant or worth studying. I found this interesting, since her lab is the only one that records from actual neurons. But there are ever more reductionist scientists who always throw stones at those above them. Neurobiologists (at the electrode level and below) are operating at ever more granular levels of detail, walking away from cognitive neuroscience entirely (who wants to be a dualist, anyway?). I knew exactly where she was going with this: the field is being driven by techniques, doing experiments merely because you can (cough — <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/optogenetics" target="_blank" title="HOW TO PUBLISH IN NATURE">OPTOGENETICS</a> — cough). Speaking for myself, however, the fact that neurobiologists can control mouse behavior by manipulating highly specific populations of cells raises the specter of insecurity... certain areas of research might not be considered “neuroscience” any more by a bulk of practitioners in the field (just attend the <a href="http://www.sfn.org/Meetings/Neuroscience-2019" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience</a> annual meeting).<br /><br /><b>(3) <a href="http://as.nyu.edu/psychology/people/faculty.catherine-alexandra-hartley.html" target="_blank">Dr. Catherine Hartley</a></b> continued with the recurring theme that we need both <i><b>prediction</b></i> and <i><b>explanation</b></i> to reach our ultimate goal of understanding behavior. Is a prediction system enough? No, we must know how the black box functions by studying “latent processes” such as representation and computation. But what if we're wrong about representations, I thought? The view of <a href="https://twitter.com/PsychScientists" target="_blank">@PsychScientists</a> immediately came to mind. Sorry to interrupt Dr. Hartley, but here's Golonka and Wilson in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/058925v3" target="_blank">Ecological Representations</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Mainstream cognitive science and neuroscience both rely heavily on the notion of representation in order to explain the full range of our behavioral repertoire. The relevant feature of representation is its ability to designate (stand in for) spatially or temporally distant properties ... While representational theories are a potentially a powerful foundation for a good cognitive theory, problems such as grounding and system-detectable error remain unsolved. For these and other reasons, <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>ecological explanations reject the need for representations and do not treat the nervous system as doing any mediating work</b></span>. However, this has left us without a straight-forward vocabulary to engage with so-called 'representation-hungry' problems or the role of the nervous system in cognition.</blockquote><br />They go on to invoke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology#Gibson" target="_blank">James J Gibson's</a> ecological information functions. But I can already hear Dr. Poeppel's colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/GregoryHickok">@GregoryHickok</a>  and <a href="https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/568899227822252033" target="_blank">others on Twitter</a> debating with <a href="https://twitter.com/PsychScientists/status/733190148930850816" target="_blank">@PsychScientists</a>. Oh. Wait. Debate.<br /><br />Returning to <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/the-relation-between-psychology-and-neuroscience/" target="_blank">The Conversation</a> that I so rudely interrupted, Dr. Hartley gave some excellent examples of theories that link psychology and neuroscience. The <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/eye/trichrom.htm" target="_blank">trichromatic theory of color vision</a> — the finding that three independent channels convey color information — was based on psychophysics in the early-mid 1800s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Helmholtz_theory" target="_blank">Young–Helmholtz theory</a>). This was over a century before the discovery of cones in the retina, which are sensitive to three different wavelengths. She also mentioned the more frequently used examples of <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Tolman/Maps/maps" target="_blank">Tolman's cognitive maps</a> (which predated <i><a href="http://www.cognitivemap.net/" target="_blank" title="by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel">The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map</a></i> by 30 years) and error-driven reinforcement learning (Bush–Mosteller [<a class="xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip" data-hasqtip="6" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-23" id="xref-ref-23-2">23</a>, <a class="xref-bibr article-ref-popup hasTooltip" data-hasqtip="7" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647#ref-24" id="xref-ref-24-2">24</a>] and Rescorla–Wagner, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15647" target="_blank">both of which predate</a> knowledge of dopamine neurons). To generate good linking hypotheses in the present, we need to construct formal models that make quantitative predictions (<i><b>generative models</b></i>).<br /><br /><b>(4) <a href="https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/sharon-thompson-schill" target="_blank">Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill</a></b> gave a brief introduction with no slides, which is good because this post has gotten very long. For this reason, I won't cover the panel discussion and the Q&amp;A period, which continued the same themes outlined above and expanded on “predictivism” (<i><b>predictive chauvinism</b></i> and data-driven neuroscience) and raised new points like the value (or not) of introspection in science. When the Cognitive Neuroscience Society updates their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1PLEjbzpCeqJ39xD2BaxXg/videos">YouTube channel</a>, I'll let you know. Another source is the excellent live tweeting of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%40vukovicnikola%20%23cns2019&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">@VukovicNikola</a>. But to wrap up, Dr. Thompson-Schill asked members of the audience whether they consider themselves psychologists or neuroscientists. Most identified as neuroscientists (which is a relative term, I think). Although more people will talk to you on a plane if you say you're a psychologist, “neuroscience is easy, psychology is hard,” a surprising take-home message.<br /><br /><br /><u><b>Debating Debates</b></u><br /><br />I've actually wanted to see more debating at the CNS meeting.

On one side is Nancy Kanwisher of MIT, who first proposed that the fusiform gyrus was specifically designed to recognize faces–and faces alone–based on her findings using a magnetic resonance imaging device. Then, Isabel Gauthier, a neuroscientist at Vanderbilt, talked about her research, showing that the fusiform gyrus lights up when looking at many different kinds of objects people are skilled at recognizing.</blockquote>Kudos to <a href="https://www.newsday.com/" target="_blank"><i>Newsday</i></a> for keeping this article on their site after all these years.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> This is the color-word Stroop task: name the font color, rather than read the word.  <span><span style="color: red;"><b>BLUE</b></span></span> elicits conflict between the overlearned response ("read the word <i>blue</i>") and the task requirment (say "<i>red</i>").<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup> 2</sup></b></span> aka the  the now-obligatory David Poeppel session on BIG STUFF.

Once the requisition for the PO has been approved by your existing approval workflows and Science Exchange receives the PO, we will activate the order and the status will change to “Active.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to confirm that the requisition has been requested in your ERP procurement system, you should check with the researcher that it is in the requisition queue awaiting internal approvals if you feel that it has been Pending PO for an extended time period. </span></p></div>

All PO generations, change orders, payments, and invoicing will be streamlined and automated via the Science Exchange platform and with the client’s existing approval workflows in place. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SSO integration with Science Exchange allows researchers to seamlessly access their Science Exchange account and offers all of the benefits of SSO on productivity, strong password security, and quick adoption of new company adopted tools. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers currently need to manage a separate process: set up folders with each new project, give access to external vendors, and manage keeping files up to date. File storage integration with Science Exchange removes this process and automatically copies all files uploaded to a Science Exchange order to a cloud file storage location of the client’s choosing. This allows researchers to eliminate a manual process and ensures that external project files are maintained in a compliant manner.</span></p></div>

<p>The age of social media has opened up exciting opportunities for researchers to investigate people’s emotional states on a massive scale. For example, one study found that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6051/1878">tweets contain more positive emotional words in the morning</a>, which was interpreted as showing that most people are in a better mood at that time of day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The premise of this line of research is that our word choices reflect our psychological states – that if someone uses more positive or negative emotional words, this is a good indication that they are actually experiencing those emotions. But now a new study has thrown a spanner in the works, finding that – for spoken language at least – this assumption might not hold up. In their <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8fpjn/">preprint posted recently on <em>PsyArxiv</em></a>, Jessie Sun and colleagues found that emotion-related words do not in fact provide a good indication of a person’s mood, although there may be other sets of words that do.</p>
<p><span id="more-36796"></span></p>
<p>Sun’s team asked 185 American university students to wear a recording device for a week, which recorded a 30 second snippet of sound every 9.5 minutes. Four times per day, the participants also completed a survey via text message measuring the positive and negative emotions they had experienced over the previous hour.</p>
<p>The team ended up with a whopping 150,000 recordings, which research assistants transcribed over the course of two years, weeding out clips which contained no speech or just a few words. They then scored each recording according to how many positive and negative emotion words it contained (like “sweet” or “hurt”), by running the text through an analysis programme called the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count , which contains dictionaries of words associated with different topics. Finally, the team averaged the scores for all clips from the same three-hour period surrounding each questionnaire, ending up with 1,579 language-based emotion measurements that they could directly compare to participants’ self-reported mood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that – contrary to the assumptions of some past studies – the number of positive and negative emotional words was not associated with participants’ actual mood. “Our findings suggest that researchers should not assume that fluctuations in … [the use of emotional words] … can be used as a proxy for subjective emotion experience, at least for spoken language”, the authors write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But the recordings did contain some emotional information: the research assistants’ assessment of the speaker’s emotions, based on listening to the recordings, <i>was</i> associated with participants’ rating of their own mood. The authors suggest that the human raters were picking up on non-verbal cues relating to emotion – things like intonation and volume – that the programme itself was missing.</p>
<p>In an exploratory analysis, the authors also examined whether any other sets of words unrelated to emotion could predict participants’ mood. They found that greater use of words related to socialising, like “you” or “we”, was associated with experiencing more positive emotion, while use of maths words, like “minus” and “number”, was related to less positive emotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, these associations were weak, so may not be useful measures of emotion, say the authors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are other possible explanations for the null results in the study, which the authors acknowledge. It could be that a person’s use of emotion-related words taps into an aspect of emotion that also isn’t captured by self-report questionnaires<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– perhaps one that participants themselves aren’t consciously aware of. Alternatively, the dictionaries themselves may not always reflect how people use words: for example, the word “pretty” appears in the positive dictionary, but could be used in a negative context (e.g. “it was pretty terrible”). But even taking into account these limitations, the new study demonstrates the importance of checking the validity of tools in psychology research, to make sure that they are actually measuring what we think they are measuring. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.mariannebezaire.com/2019/03/28/the-compatibility-of-stem-and-spirituality/">The compatibility of STEM and spirituality</a></h4>

<p>Having been raised Catholic, I have a confession to make: I have found it difficult to make room for spirituality and religion in a STEM-focused society. Not in my personal life exactly, but in my community and conversations. I think it’s partly because people have such varying conceptions of spiritual life, God, or gods. And because we don’t talk about it freely, when someone does bring up anything related to this subject, it’s easy to become immediately wary: is this person trying to convert me or take my money?</p>
<p>How about a third option: what if that person is trying to tell you about a powerful experience they had, which they cannot fully explain using known, familiar concepts or which seems to be at least partly outside of human control?</p>
<p>I think, for a lot of people, it’s actually something closer to this third idea that motivates us to talk about spirituality and God. And that may be the key to why it’s hard to discuss these things in certain STEM communities. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are about curiosity, innovation, achievement – rewarding for sure – but they are also often about control and precision, human definitions and limitations.</p>
<p>In my view, if you need to know that something is conceptually possible with a certain regard for grace and beauty, you may be a mathematician. If you need to know something well enough to be confident that it will work reliably and consistently – and that you can fix it when it goes wrong – you might be an engineer or doctor. If you need to examine every little detail, control every factor and condition, and measure everything precisely and then report your findings in a strictly structured format, you are probably a hard scientist. Given each of these approaches to inquiry and the effect they may have on your world view, your conception of God is likely to be quite different.</p>
<p>You might also still feel that sense of wonder and awe that some folks ascribe to religion and spirituality. Except, instead of feeling that sense when you enter a religious venue or contemplate a starry sky, perhaps you feel that sense in the infinite combinations of factors that your experimental setup can produce. And I’m not speaking cynically of electrical noise or undetermined behavioral influences that plague experimental scientists. I mean the vast space of possibility associated with randomness, Brownian motion, genetic mutations and the like.</p>
<p>I believe that one acceptable definition of God to say God is in the things we don’t understand, in the concepts and people that we value but have not figured out. In this way, the concept of God is compatible with a fully formed and intricate understanding of biology, astronomy, natural history, and human relations. Being a generally warm-hearted and optimistic person, I also think of God as a force for love, growth, and connection between persons, nature, and other living things.</p>
<p>Beyond the concept of God or spirituality, there is also the concept of religion: the specific ways in which we worship or view God. Sometimes it may seem that science and religion are incompatible, or are less compatible than science and spirituality. However, the domains of each are largely separate. To the extent that they overlap, it is worth exploring how each can benefit the other. For example, can science or medicine instruct us as to how to safely heal spiritual injuries? Or can religious traditions and rituals point us to some fundamental biological truth or natural observation? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/sunday/science-religion.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Perhaps so</a>.</p>
<p>I have actually experienced the healing of a spiritual injury in myself by someone with a scientific background. It had not been an experience I was expecting, nor one that I had even considered possible. But it happened and was a remarkable experience that felt very intense and difficult to describe to most people. After it happened, I felt quite strongly that something about my spiritual state had been altered. I have often contemplated the scientific basis for the sensations and feelings that occurred in me during this healing process. I do believe there are some, although I am unsure whether it is wise and necessary to delve far into the intricate details of my brain state, or whether that endeavor would be akin to chasing the biological basis for free will.</p>
<p>As I write this post, I am becoming aware of just how little I discuss anything religious or spiritual. I feel that it is an awkward conversation to have, mostly because I assume everyone rushes to judgment about a religious speaker, as I do sometimes. I think the problem is also because I am out of practice discussing religion and spirituality. It is not a conversation that I hear or participate in often. I find myself hesitant to bring it up, not knowing where other people stand. And I feel uncomfortable to bring up a topic that almost no one else in my current environment discusses.</p>
<p>It would be easy – and wrong – to pin my dilemma on my STEM community. This was difficult for me even among some members of my church community growing up, during university, and after university, people with whom I supposedly share a similar worldview, spiritual outlook, and religious foundation. In an article noting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/opinion/sunday/talk-god-sprituality-christian.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the difficulty of talking about God</a> in this modern and busy world, author Jonathan Merritt observed that the decline in our spiritual vocabulary and proficiency has real consequences for the spiritual life of the community. Those consequences are negative and undesirable for the community, whether or not you believe in spiritual power or religion. And so, out of respect for the humanity and potential of our communities, I believe it is worth exploring how we can include a vocabulary of spirituality and religion in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/sunday/vocation-college-higher-ed.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">academia generally and STEM fields specifically</a>.</p>

<p>Think about the concepts of “red” and “justice” and you’ll notice a key difference. If you’re sighted, you’ll associate “red” most strongly with the sensory experience, which relates to signals from cone cells in your eyes. “Justice”, in contrast, doesn’t have any associated sensory qualities – as an abstract concept, you’ll think about its meaning, which you learnt via language, understanding it to be related to other abstract concepts like “fairness” or “accountability”, perhaps. But what about blind people – how do they think about “red”?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07574-3">A brain-imaging study</a> of 12 people who had been blind from birth, and 14 sighted people, published recently in <i>Nature Communications</i>, shows that while for sighted people, sensory and abstract concepts like “red” and “justice” are represented in different brain regions, for blind people, they’re represented in the same “abstract concept” region.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36784"></span></p>
<p>“You could be talking to a blind person, and if you didn’t know they were blind, you would never suspect that their experience of red is different from yours, because in fact they do know what red means,” argues Alfonso Caramazza at Harvard University, US, senior author on the paper. “They know what it means in the same way that you know what justice means.” That is, by hearing and reading about “red”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This idea, that for blind people colour concepts are treated more like abstract concepts, was backed up by the new findings. Lead author Ella Striem-Amit at Harvard University, together with Caramazza and other colleagues, used fMRI to look at their participants’ brain activity while they listened to words pertaining to different types of concept: concrete concepts that are familiar to both sighted and blind people, and which can be perceived in some way by both groups (like “cup”); visual concepts that are imperceptible only to blind people, such as “red” and “rainbow”; and abstract concepts without any sensory features, such as “freedom” and “justice”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results suggest that, for all of us, the medial anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is the brain area most responsible for the representation of concrete concepts with any kind of sensory perceptibility, while abstract concepts that are understood based on the meaning of the word, and which have no associated sensory information, are processed by the dorsolateral ATL. This led to a group difference for colour words, which were associated with increased activity in the anterior ATL in sighted participants, and increased activity in the dorsolateral ATL in the blind participants. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Though blind people lack the sensory experience of colour, they can nonetheless – thanks to language – form rich and accurate colour concepts, Caramazza notes. Not only do they learn that it’s a property of objects or scenes that’s unlike other sensory properties that they experience, but they can learn about differences between colours. Earlier work has shown, for example, that they know that orange is more similar to yellow and red than to green or blue, Caramazza says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Studies of colour knowledge in blind individuals have confirmed this aspect of their understanding of colour terms. However, our study has shown that this type of colour knowledge is represented in a region of the brain that is typically associated with knowledge of words that do not have sensory referents, like justice or virtue,” he says. “This reflects the important role of this region in acquiring meaning through language.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/Fotolia_61915592_Subscription_Yearly_XXL-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Do you drink one small glass of wine a day? Maybe you even have one day off a week? That’s just under the UK low risk drinking guidelines of 14 units a week. You know cigarettes increase your risk of cancer but what about a glass of wine each night? Isn’t that supposed to be good for you?</p>
<blockquote><p>Survey data suggests only 13% of people are aware of a link between alcohol and cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, unfortunately while moderate drinking is considerably less dangerous than heavy drinking it is certainly not without its risks, particularly for women. Alcohol causes at least <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/alcohol-and-cancer/does-alcohol-cause-cancer">seven types of cancer</a> (breast, liver, gullet, mouth, throat and bowel), and while the risk increases the more you drink, all levels of consumption carry a cancer risk. Furthermore, there is now <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext">robust evidence</a> that low levels of alcohol do not provide any protective health benefits.</p>
<p>The cancer risk associated with alcohol is worse for women because for moderate levels of consumption, for example one bottle of wine per week, the alcohol-associated cancer risk is higher for breast cancer than other cancers related to drinking. Breast cancer is now the leading cause of cancer in women, 1 in 7 UK women will be diagnosed within their lifetime and 1 in 13 cases can be linked to alcohol. You would not be alone if this was news to you. <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3855-6">Survey data</a> suggests only 13% of people are aware of a link between alcohol and cancer.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks need to be better communicated</strong></h3>
<p>Several large studies have described the links between moderate levels of alcohol and breast cancer. The first was published over 15 years ago. Public Health England have <a href="https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/press/women-encouraged-to-have-more-drink-free-days-to-reduce-their-risk-of-developing-breast-cancer/">released statements</a> encouraging women to have more alcohol-free days to reduce their cancer risk and <a href="http://www.reducemyrisk.tv">local awareness campaigns</a> are running. However these are failing to address long held beliefs that moderate drinking is beneficial, and many people simply think cancer is caused by ‘something else’. This issue is <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6701145/Deadly-link-alcohol-breast-cancer-ignored-middle-aged-women.html">not limited to the UK</a>.</p>
<p>On a daily basis women are exposed to alcohol advertising which is self-regulated and uses images which link alcohol with glamour, celebrity, having large groups of friends and starting new relationships. Drinks companies can advertise on TV, at the cinema, on social media, in magazines and newspapers and sponsor most high-profile sporting events. Previous <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/51/6/747/2374095">research</a> suggests that this is effective. The annual global marketing spend for the drinks industry is estimated at 1 trillion US dollars. Alcohol promotion helps establish alcohol as a normal commodity <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.13591">among consumers from an early age</a> and ensures drinking remains firmly entrenched in the British culture, rather than being understood to be a Class 1 carcinogen.</p>
<p>Compare this to smoking. Over 70% of the population understand smoking to be a major cause of cancer. Heavy taxes, advertising bans, plain packaging containing explicit health warnings, and a ban on smoking in public places has led to a decrease in smoking levels from <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-smoking/statistics-on-smoking-england-2016">46% of the UK population (1974) to 19% (2014)</a>. These are all tried and tested effective public health strategies aimed at informing the public and thereby reducing harmful behaviour. Smoking kills up to two thirds of its users, is the single largest preventable cause of cancer worldwide, and is responsible for 3 in 20 cases of cancer in the UK, but how does alcohol compare?</p>
<h3><strong>How many cigarettes in a bottle of wine?</strong></h3>
<p>Using information already published on alcohol and tobacco <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6576-9">we calculate</a> that on average for women, drinking 10 units of alcohol (about a bottle of wine) a week carries the equivalent cancer risk to 10 cigarettes. For men the figures are lower (10 units is equivalent to 5 cigarettes) but still substantial. This gender gap results from the fact that low levels of alcohol consumption increase the risk of breast cancer to a greater extent compared to the other alcohol-related cancers, and the increase in cancer risks due to smoking are slightly greater for men for most other cancers.</p>
<img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-10936" height="418" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/wine-cigarettes-300x228.png" width="550" />
<p>This study by no means detracts from the substantive risks of smoking, but simply uses well established public knowledge on smoking and cancer to try to improve understanding of the cancer risks associated with alcohol. It is not a comparison of the overall disease burden of smoking versus drinking.</p>
<p>While tobacco-related cancer messages are typically supported by the media, the links between moderate alcohol consumption and cancer have been less well communicated. Often the only messages people routinely hear about alcohol are the ones promoted by the drinks industry.</p>
<p>We hope our simple message expressing alcohol-related cancer risks in terms of cigarettes will help tackle the lack of public awareness of the relationship between alcohol and cancer, and better inform people to make judgments about the risks they wish to take with their own health.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/newly-discovered-role-for-climbing-fibers-conveying-a-sensory-snapshot-to-the-cerebellum/">Newly Discovered Role for Climbing Fibers: Conveying a Sensory Snapshot to the Cerebellum</a></h4>

<h4>Researchers at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have revealed a special input pathway that holds the key to coding sensory information in the Cerebellum</h4>
<p>As we go about our daily lives, we are constantly bombarded by a steady stream of sensory information. Take a typical morning routine for example- roused from sleep by a shrill alarm, the strong aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the brake lights and traffic horns of rush hour. In the course of a single day, we experience thousands of different cues across all senses.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous chaotic cues we encounter, our brains do a remarkable job assembling and processing them; allowing us to make sense of the world around us. This processing can take shape in very noticeable ways, such as our vision and hearing, but also occurs more subtly and unexpectedly. For instance, when learning a new movement, our brain is constantly keeping track of the sensory cues around us. This sensory snapshot helps to instruct and guide motor learning so that when we encounter the same context again, we’ll be more likely to perform the movement in a better way.</p>
<p>Though there is a wealth knowledge supporting the idea that sensory cues benefit motor learning, the precise brain circuitry and mechanisms tying these two together has been debated in recent years. Shedding new light on this topic, a recently published paper in Neuron from the lab of Dr. Jason Christie, Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI), has revealed that a special input pathway into the cerebellum seems to hold the key to coding sensory information.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is a unique structure within the brain that plays a critically important role in motor coordination and learning that improves movements. By receiving many inputs from various regions of the brain, the cerebellum integrates and sends refined information out through a single neuron type called a Purkinje cell. One significant input to the Purkinje cells, are long-range projections called climbing fibers.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright imgCaption margin20right" id="attachment_5698" style="width: 310px;"><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5698" height="350" src="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/figure-press-release-2.jpg" width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Sensory enhancement is encoded in the presynaptic activity level of Climbing Fibers.</strong> Comparison of the sensory enhancement of calcium event amplitudes in Climbing Fibers compared to observations in Purkinje cells, measured in separate experiments. The change in Purkinje cell response size closely parallels that of Climbing Fibers across modalities.</p></div>
<p>“Climbing fibers are very well-known and extensively studied in the field.” describes Dr. Michael Gaffield, Research Fellow in the Christie Lab and first author of the publication. “These fibers form long-range connections with the cerebellum and are thought to deliver instructive motor signals and relay sensory information. But in the past few years it’s been suggested that local circuits within the cerebellum, such as parallel fibers or molecular layer interneurons, may also play a part in coding of sensory information.”</p>
<p>To investigate, the team used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of Purkinje cells within the cerebellum of mice while presenting various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual and somatosensory). They then isolated and assessed changes in Purkinje cell activity that directly corresponded to the timing of each individual stimulus and climbing fiber input.</p>
<p>“Within each Purkinje cell, we saw a consistent enhancement of activity whenever a sensory stimulus was presented. But the enhancement wasn’t the exact same across all three sensory types, it varied depending on the type of stimulus presented” explains Gaffield.</p>
<p>Next MPFI scientists examined if other cell types besides climbing fibers, contributed directly to the sensory enhanced activity seen in the Purkinje cells. Using the techniques of optogenetic inactivation (suppression of neural activity using light) and chemogenetic inhibition (suppression of neural activity using drugs), the team was able to inhibit individual cell types in the local cerebellar circuitry. Despite altering the local activity, no change occurred to the sensory enhanced activity of the Purkinje cells. However, by inhibiting climbing fiber activity directly, the enhancement was abolished; indicating that climbing fibers alone are responsible for conveying sensory information to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Taking their investigation a step further, the Christie lab pioneered a novel technique allowing them to monitor the activity of climbing fiber axonal projections themselves. They discovered that when presenting sensory stimuli, the graded changes in the presynaptic activity of climbing fibers was accurately represented in the Purkinje cells; stronger activity in the climbing fiber was precisely mirrored by stronger activity in the Purkinje cells they connect with.</p>
<p>“Our results actually came as a bit of a surprise” notes Dr. Christie. “Traditionally it was thought that sensory signals arriving in the cerebellum were integrated and processed by Purkinje cells using local connections. Our findings demonstrate that Purkinje cells are merely reflecting what the climbing fiber is doing. This means that a more distal region of the brain is doing the actual processing of sensory information and simply relaying it to the cerebellum. “</p>
<p>“Since Purkinje cell activity is critically important for motor learning, we are now in the process looking at sensory-derived activity during more complex motor behaviors” describes Dr. Christie. “Hopefully we will be able to uncover the neural mechanisms that underlie the climbing fiber’s unique ability to convey sensory information and how learning benefits from this coding scheme.”</p>

<p>Heather Holman is a member of the 2018-2019 Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. Before coming to MPFI, Heather graduated from the University of Central Florida (UCF) with a double major in Biomedical Sciences and Sport &amp; Exercise Science. She will be attending the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) where she will pursue both an MD and PhD with a focus in neuroscience.</p>
<h4>Why was the Post-Baccalaureate Research Experience (PRE) program right for you?</h4>
<p>I chose to apply to the PRE program since I was looking for a post-baccalaureate program with a focus on basic neuroscience research and career development. Max Planck was a perfect fit since I not only got the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge research, but I also learned coding and professional skills through the PRE meetings.</p>
<h4>How has taking a year between undergrad and grad school helped your career focus?</h4>
<p>Having the opportunity to pursue research full-time solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD and conduct research throughout my career. The experiences I have gained through the PRE program have further developed my critical thinking skills and broadened my research knowledge which will certainly be beneficial during graduate school.</p>
<h4>What experiences did you have in the PRE program that stand out to you?</h4>
<p>My year at Max Planck has far exceeded my expectations. I have learned much more than I would have ever imagined. The equipment and resources available at Max Planck are phenomenal, giving students the opportunity to utilize technology they probably would never be able to access anywhere else. The PRE meetings are led by researchers at the institute which gives students the ability to learn first-hand about what it is like to pursue a career in science and obtain useful advice about career development. Additionally, we were able to attend the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting which exposed us to the latest neuroscience research and provided an awesome networking experience. We were also given the opportunity to take a course in Matlab coding which was not only useful for our projects in the lab, but will also be helpful throughout our careers.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to someone who is getting ready to complete their undergraduate degree but isn’t sure exactly what they want to do next?</h4>
<p>I would recommend taking a gap year to truly figure out what you are passionate about and want to pursue as a career. The PRE program is a fantastic opportunity if you are considering research as a career. It definitely solidified my decision to pursue an MD/PhD as well as boosted my application since it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience where I was fortunate to learn about high-profile research being conducted throughout the Max Planck Institute.</p>

<p>Psychology’s replication crisis receives a lot of airtime, with plenty of examples of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/30/its-getting-increasingly-difficult-for-replication-crisis-sceptics-to-explain-away-failed-replications/">failed replications</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/18/widely-used-neuroimaging-analyses-allow-almost-any-result-to-be-presented-as-a-successful-replication-paper-claims/">methodological issues</a> that cast doubt on past research findings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But there is also good news: several key results in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/">cognitive psychology</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/06/theres-another-area-of-psychology-where-most-of-the-results-do-replicate-personality-research/">personality research</a>, for example, have been successfully replicated.</p>
<p>Now researchers have reproduced the results of another highly-cited study. Back in 2002, Emily Pronin and colleagues first described the “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202286008">bias blind spot</a>”, the finding that people believe they are less biased in their judgments and behaviour than the general population – that is, they are “blind” to their own cognitive biases. And while that study kick-started a whole line of related research, no one had attempted to directly replicate the original experiments.</p>
<p>But in a preregistered preprint <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331431431_Agency_and_self-other_asymmetries_in_perceived_bias_and_shortcomings_Replications_of_the_Bias_Blind_Spot_and_extensions_linking_to_free_will_beliefs">published recently to ResearchGate</a>, Prasad Chandrashekar, Siu Kit Yeung and colleagues report reproducing the original study, first in a small group of Hong Kong undergraduates, and then in two larger samples of 303 and 621 Americans who completed online surveys.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36768"></span></p>
<p>Each group was given detailed descriptions of eight cognitive biases such as “hostile media bias” (where people view neutral media reports as hostile towards their own point of view) and “self-serving bias” (where people take responsibility for their successes but not failures). They were also given descriptions of three visible “personal shortcomings”, like procrastination and fear of public speaking.</p>
<p>The participants rated the extent to which they thought they exhibited these biases and shortcomings, before rating how much other people generally show these tendencies. Consistent with Pronin’s original result, across all three studies participants thought that their own susceptibility to biases was lower than that of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>When it came to rating personal shortcomings, the results diverged from the original study. While Pronin had found no difference in how people rated their own and others’ shortcomings, the new research found that participants rated their own shortcomings as less severe. However, this difference was small, suggesting that people are more “blind” to their cognitive biases – which remain invisible – than to personal weaknesses which may have much more obvious effects (e.g. being late to hand in an assignment due to procrastination).</p>
<p>Chandrashekar’s team also added a new spin to the original study by investigating whether participants’ blind spot bias was influenced by their belief in free will (rated by their agreement with statements like “I am in change of the decisions I make”), which is known to affect how people judge themselves and others.</p>
<p>Participants with a stronger belief in free will had a greater blind spot when it came to personal shortcomings. That is, the gap between how they rated their own and others’ shortcomings was larger than the gap for people with a weaker belief in free will. The authors suggest that this is because people who believe more strongly that someone’s behaviours and decisions are completely under their own control are less likely to see such shortcomings in themselves: for them, such an admission would imply they have some innate weakness that can’t be overcome through their own choices. Belief in free will did not have any effect on the blind spot for cognitive biases, however.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors write that their results “provide reasonable support” for the findings of the original study, suggesting that the bias blind spot is a robust phenomenon. But it’s perhaps surprising that it is reportedly the first direct replication of a piece of research that is more than 15 years old and has received nearly 1,000 citations. Hopefully, the new effort is a sign that the field is increasingly recognising the value in well-designed replication attempts – something the authors themselves acknowledge. “The study contributes to the recent call for systematic, large-scale, and preregistered replication and validation studies,” they write.</p>

<p>Often times in academia, there is a tendency to branch out on more and more tangents. This can be a good thing, in terms of intellectual freedom, boundless creativity, fresh material for the continual grant application. However, it also seems to be a way of escaping accountability, of rendering academic research one giant project in busywork.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of research if not to apply it (eventually)? Sometimes it is just fun to be curious and learn something that may someday be useful or is perhaps just interesting or fun to observe. But there are also many fields in which aimlessness is celebrated or encouraged. That is one of the beautiful parts of science, which can also allow for exciting discoveries to be made that later turn out to have highly significant effects. There are also fields in which abstraction or unapplicable revelations can stand on their own and are celebrated or mined for value: mathematics, philosophy, other arts and humanities are just as capable of producing this type of academic output.</p>
<p>If we get rather granular about the output of our field of research, the beauty and futility of it can become apparent and even coexist together. I had such an experience while working on my PhD project, a detailed computer model of a small part of the brain involved with memory. I wanted to base my model on the biology of the network as best I could. There were quite a few articles already published by anatomists, detailing the intricate studies done to count the numbers and types of neurons (brain cells) in that part of the brain. Those same scientists had also done meticulous work dying brain cells and characterizing their exact shape, size, and numbers of contacts with nearby cells. After sorting through all this published experimental data, which had taken years and years of work by dozens or hundreds of (mostly Hungarian) anatomists, I had a thought: what are we actually doing with this data? I wanted to use it to build a biologically realistic computer model, but might someone else want to use the data as well?</p>
<p>And if someone else wanted the data too, might it be worthwhile to somehow collate the data into a usable format that incorporates as much similar data as possible into a single product that can be used for reference?</p>
<p>I ended up doing just that, in a project that I now refer to as the <a href="https://www.sporadicsynapse.com/scientific-projects/quantitative-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">quantitative assessment</a>. This project then was able to form the basis for my larger research product, the detailed model and its resulting simulations. However, I also like the quantitative assessment on its own. I like how it makes use of the published literature, how it highlights and makes accessible a large body of mildly neglected facts that were gathered over years and years.</p>
<p>Much of the work in the published literature seems to lie around untouched, gathering dust, so I am always excited to hear about applications, databases, large review-type projects, and other methods to integrate or apply published data. Without such initiatives, we risk turning academia and especially science into a closed-loop system that is inaccessible to the broader public and to human-relevant progress and clinical applications.</p>
<p>With those concerns in mind, I was excited to stumble across a relatively new initiative by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) that seeks to make use of the large body of published literature in the service of human health. The NIH’s <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/dtr/adult-psychopathology-and-psychosocial-interventions-research-branch/computational-psychiatry-program.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computational Psychiatry</a> research funding initiative respects the significant amount of data available about psychiatric conditions and treatments, and it encourages scientists to apply algorithms to those information resources to multiple or exponentially increase their diagnostic and clinical value. It’s an example of a novel emphasis on existing literature that has a direct benefit to humankind in a relatively short time frame. In short, it’s an effective way of capitalizing on a large body of work already done, a smaller extra investment of time that can amplify the impact of the time already spent building the literature foundation for psychiatric conditions and treatments.</p>
<p>Our understanding of psychiatric conditions has become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/preventing-mental-illness.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more sophisticated</a> and respectful of the whole person, with the advent of concepts such as formulation (instead of diagnosis) and the greater appreciation for contribution of a person’s life experience to the state of their brain and mind. The new emphasis on computational psychiatry complements this growing interest while also harnessing the power of our expanding computational infrastructure.</p>

<p>Having more testosterone makes men more aggressive – right? It’s a popular lay belief that’s supported by animal studies, but there’s been very little relevant research in humans. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619826970">study</a>, published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, reveals a more nuanced picture: some men are more affected by raised levels of testosterone than others.</p>
<p><span id="more-36761"></span></p>
<p>Shawn Geniole at Nipissing University in Canada and colleagues studied 308 men aged 18 to 40. After completing a personality questionnaire, the participants gave a saliva sample, so their baseline testosterone level could be measured, and also a mouthwash sample, for DNA extraction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants were told they would soon be paired with a partner for an online “decision making game”. But first they received a nasal gel, which was either a placebo or contained 11 mg of testosterone, and then they were videoed answering general personal questions, which they were told would be shown to their “partner” who was currently located in another room. To add even more realism to this cover story, the men then watched a video of their partner being interviewed in the same way (actually a researcher who provided scripted answers to the questions). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next came the “decision-making game”, which the men started half an hour after receiving the gel, and which was actually the well-validated “point-subtraction aggression paradigm”, which measures aggressive behaviour in response to provocations. (Points can be stolen from the other player, with no benefit to the participant themselves other than the satisfaction of penalising their partner; the number of points stolen is taken as a measure of behavioural aggression.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After this, the participants completed a questionnaire that asked about their impressions of the game and the other player. It asked, for example, “Did it make you feel good when you stole points from your game partner?” And “To what extent did you become angry when your game partner stole points from you?”</p>
<p>Earlier studies have suggested that testosterone has bigger effects on aggression among men who rank high on a personality measure of dominance. In this study, the researchers considered men who scored higher for dominance, higher for “independent self-construal” (which involves defining yourself in terms of internal attributes, such as traits, rather than in terms of relationships with others), and lower for self-control, as having high “personality risk” for the dose of testosterone making them more aggressive – and this is what they found</p>
<p>However, this personality effect was even stronger for the more than 200 men in the sample whose DNA analysis showed that they have a variation of the androgen receptor gene (that codes for the receptor that testosterone binds to) that makes the receptor more efficient. This “provides the clearest, albeit correlational, evidence to date that testosterone’s effects on human aggression are likely AR [androgen receptor] dependent,” the researchers write. They added that this is the first time that such fast-acting effects of testosterone on human social behaviour have been observed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Further analysis revealed that for the men with the more efficient androgen receptor, testosterone didn’t enhance the anger that they felt in response to being provoked — but it did boost the pleasure they derived from being aggressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This suggests that the dopaminergic system is involved in testosterone-promoted aggression. The high-risk personality traits noted in this study have also previously been linked to increased reward-related dopaminergic function, the researchers note. “If dopamine-mediated, testosterone may more strongly promote aggression among individuals with this personality profile because the profile may be indicative of an underlying hypersensitive dopaminergic system,” Geniole and his colleagues write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are some caveats in relation to the work. One, of course, is that it shows correlations between personality and the androgen receptor gene on the one hand and testosterone-linked increases in aggression on the other,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>rather than demonstrating causal relationships between these factors. It also doesn’t look at the effects of testosterone on aggression levels in individual men, but rather across the experimental groups. As the researchers note, further work will be needed to rule out other explanations for their findings. It will also need to look at groups other than white men, who were used in this study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, potentially there could be significant real-world implications. For example: “It will also be important to determine whether these interactive personality-risk effects extends to more chronic doses of testosterone, such as those used in the treatment of hypogonadism [testosterone deficiency],” the researchers note. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Discussions between patients and clinicians to decide on goals of care can lead to fewer unwanted interventions, better patient outcomes, and lower costs, but few clinicians initiate or encourage these discussions.</p>
<p>The barriers that prevent clinicians from having goals of care discussions have not been studied, so the authors of this paper conducted a survey among physicians and nurses at one hospital. The survey asked oncology clinicians to rate the importance of possible barriers to goals of care discussions. Barriers related to the patient and their family, such as the patient (or a family member) not accepting a poor prognosis or lack of patient capacity to make decisions, rated as the highest barriers. Among other categories of barriers, lack of time also received a high rating.</p>
<p>The importance of the identified barriers highlights the need for specialized training for oncology clinicians to have goals of care discussions with patients who may need support to make decisions throughout the course of illness.</p>

<p><em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em>, one of the newest journals in the <em>BMC</em> series, has recently begun publishing articles, including an important new review on the use of renewable energy in the chemical industry. In this review, Gabriele Centi and colleagues discuss changes within the chemistry and engineering industries brought about by the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels.  They focus on the development of alternative carbon sources and the integration of renewable energy into chemical production. This review highlights the need for innovation to drive radical change in chemical production, assessment, and applied chemical engineering approaches.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10924 alignright" height="170" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/fruits-320136_1920-300x170.jpg" width="300" />Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart disease have become increasingly common globally despite recommendations for lifestyle changes to prevent these diseases. The lifestyle habits that affect the later development of these diseases are formed in early adulthood. A focus on prevention is needed in this population, but few studies have examined the association of specific lifestyle habits and disease risk factors in young adults.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper on Swedish young adults, ages 18-26, studied adherence to dietary recommendations and associations with metabolic risk markers such as insulin resistance and body fat. They found that more than half of the participants ate more sweets than recommended while approximately 85% ate less fruits and vegetables and 90% ate less whole grain or fish/seafood than recommended.</p>
<p>When they studied the association between meeting each dietary recommendation and specific risk markers, they found that eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables was associated with lower body fat in all participants. A similar association was seen in women eating the recommended amount of fish/seafood. They also saw lower insulin resistance in all participants meeting recommendations for fish/seafood, fruits and vegetables, and sweets. These results highlight the importance of helping young adults bring their dietary habits closer to recommendations in order to prevent diabetes and other diseases later in life.</p>

An analysis of salary disparities between health workers working in the Caribbean and popular destination countries</strong></a></h3>
<p>Shortages of health workers in high-income English-speaking countries such as the US, the UK, and Canada have led to recruitment of trained health workers from poorer countries, including in the Caribbean. Poor working conditions and the perception of better standards of living elsewhere have led to high migration of health workers from the Caribbean. For example, approximately half of all doctors trained in Jamaica since 1991 have migrated to find work elsewhere. Understanding in detail the financial incentive to migrate could help Caribbean governments design policies to retain health workers.</p>
<p>To build an accurate picture of the increased salaries of health workers in high-income countries, the authors of this study used purchasing power parity (PPP) to compare salaries for nurses, doctors and specialists in the US, the UK, and Canada to those in four Caribbean countries. PPP exchange rates provide a more realistic comparison of salaries between countries by equalizing the cost of living between those countries.</p>
<p>They found that salary gaps were lowest with the UK, ranging from 85% higher for nurses with little experience to 184% for doctors with over ten years experience, and highest with the US, ranging from 123% for doctors with little experience to over 500% for specialists. This evaluation highlighted the financial incentive for health workers to migrate, even those with little experience, draining the resources of Caribbean countries.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10923" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10923" height="272" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/03/microbiology-300x272.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">from Yano et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Hospital-acquired infections are a serious risk, especially for vulnerable patients. Medical staff need to be aware of the risk and know how to minimize them, but time for practical lessons is limited in nursing school curricula.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper sought to demonstrate the importance of hand hygiene to nursing students by adding two short practical sessions, totaling three hours, to a basic microbiology course at their institution. During the first session, the students touched bacterial culture plates to leave a sample of the bacteria normally found on their hands. In the second session, seven days later, the students examined the bacterial colonies that had grown on the culture plates, noting the number and characteristics of the bacterial colonies.</p>
<p>In order to measure the impact of this practical demonstration, the students were asked to fill out questionnaires before and after the pair of sessions testing their awareness of surfaces that could carry bacteria and actions that could facilitate infection. Awareness scores increased after the sessions, showing that a brief, simple addition to nursing school curricula could improve nursing students’ awareness of infection risk.</p>

Nerd Food: On Product Backlog<div id="content"><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"></td><td width="50%"><p class="verse" style="text-align: left;"><small>Would be be good to have a better bug-tracking setup? Yes. But I think it takes man-power, and it would take something *fundamentally* better than bugzilla. <i>-- <a href="http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/bug_tracking.html">Linus</a></i></small></p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Many developers in large companies tend to be exposed to a strange variation of agile which I like to call "Enterprise Grade Agile", but I've also heard it called "Fragile" and, most aptly, "Cargo-Cult Agile". However you decide to name the phenomena, the gist of it is that these setups contain nearly all of the ceremony of agile - including stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives and so on - but none of its spirit. Tweets such as this are great at capturing the essence of the problem: </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Top tip: if you need to bring a notepad to the daily stand up to tell us what you did yesterday that's too many details</p>— Fran Buontempo (@fbuontempo) <a href="https://twitter.com/fbuontempo/status/686856528696086528">January 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  <p>Once you start having that nagging feeling of doing things "because you are told to", and once your stand-ups become more of a status report to the "project manager" and/or "delivery manager" - the existence of which, in itself, is rather worrying - your Cargo Cult Agile alarm bells should start ringing. As I see it, agile is a toolbox with a number of tools, and they only start to add value once you've adapted them to your personal circumstances. The fitness function that determines if a tool should be used is how much value it adds to all (or at least most) of its users. If it does not, the tool must be further adapted or removed altogether. And, crucially, you learn about agile tools by using them and by reflecting on the lessons learned. There is no other way. </p> <p>This post is one such exercise and the tool I'd like to reflect on is the <i>Product Backlog</i>. Now, before you read through the whole rant, its probably worth saying that this post takes a slightly narrow and somewhat "advanced" view of agile, with a target audience of those already using it. If you require a more introductory approach, you are probably better off looking at other online resources such as <a href="http://zerodollarbill.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/how-to-learn-scrum-in-10-minutes-and.html">How to learn Scrum in 10 minutes and clean your house in the process</a>. Having said that, I'll try to define terms best I can to make sure we are all on the same page. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">Working Definition</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>Once your company has grokked the basics of agile and starts to move away from those lengthy specification documents - those that no one reads properly until implementation and those that never specified anything the customer wanted, but everything we thought the customer wanted and then some - you will start to use the product backlog in anger. And that's when you will realise that it is not quite as simple as memorising text books. </p> <p>So what do the "text books" say? Let's take a fairly typical definition - this one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>The agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product. When applying Scrum, it's not necessary to start a project with a lengthy, upfront effort to document all requirements. Typically, a Scrum team and its product owner begin by writing down everything they can think of for agile backlog prioritization. This agile product backlog is almost always more than enough for a first sprint. The Scrum product backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote> <p>This is a good working definition, which will suffice for the purposes of this post. It is deceptively simple. However, as always, one must remember Yogi Berra: "In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is." </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Potmenkin Product Backlogs</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>Many teams finish reading one such definition, find it amazingly inspiring, install the "agile plug-in" on their bug-tracking software of choice and then furiously start typing in those tickets. But if you look closely, you'd be hard-pressed to find any difference between the bug tickets of old versus the "stories" in the new and improved "product backlog" that apparently you are now using. </p> <p>This is a classic management disconnect, whereby a renaming exercise is applied and suddenly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village">Potemkin village-style</a>, we are now in with the kool kids and our company suddenly becomes a modern and desirable place to work. But much like Potemkin villages were not designed for real people to live in, so "Potmenkin Product Backlogs" are not designed to help you manage the lifecycle of a real product; they are there to give you the <i>appearance</i> of doing said management, for the purposes of reporting to the higher eschelons and so that you can tell stakeholders that "their story has been added to the product backlog for prioritisation". </p> <p>Alas, very soon you will find that the bulk of the "user stories" are nothing but glorified one-liners that no one seems to recall what exactly they're supposed to mean, and those few elaboratedly detailed tickets end up rotting because they keep being deprioritised and now describe a world long gone. Soon enough you will find that your sprint planning meetings will cover less and less of the product backlog - after all, who is able to prioritise this mess?  Some stories don't even make any sense! The final act is when all stories worked on are stories raised directly on the sprint backlog, and the product backlog is nothing but the dumping ground for the stories that didn't make it on a given sprint. At this stage, the product backlog is in such a terrible mess that no one looks at it, other than for the occasional historic search for valuable details on how a bug was fixed. Eventually the product backlog is zeroed - maybe a dozen or so of the most recent stories make it through the cull - and the entire process begins anew. Alas, enlightenment is never achieved, so you are condemned to repeat this cycle for all eternity. </p> <p>As expected, the Potmenkin Product Backlog adds very little value - in fact it can be argued that it detracts value - but it must be kept because "agile requires a product backlog". </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Bug-Trackers: Lessons From History</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>In order to understand the difficulties with a product backlog, we turn next to their logical predecessors: bug-tracking systems such as <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. This post starts with a quote from the kernel's Benevolent Dictator that illustrates the problem with these. Linus has long taken the approach that there is no need for a bug-tracker in kernel development, although he does not object if someone wants to use one for a subsystem. You may think this is a very primitive approach but in some ways it is also a <i>very</i> modern approach, very much in line with agile; if you have a bug-tracking system which is taking time away from developers without providing any value, you should <i>remove</i> the bug-tracking system. In kernel development, there simply is no space for ceremony - or, for that matter, for anything which slows things down<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2">2</a></sup>. </p> <p>All of which begs the question: what makes bug-tracking systems so useless? From experience, there are a few factors: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>they are a "fire and forget" capture system. Most users only care about entering new data, rather than worrying about the lifecycle of a ticket. Very few places have some kind of "ticket quality control" which ensures that the content of the ticket is vaguely sensible, and those who do suffer from another problem: </li><li>they require dedicated teams. By this I don't just mean running the bug-tracking software - which you will most likely have to do in a proprietary shop; I also mean the entire notion of Q&amp;A and Testing as separate from development, with reams of people dedicated to setting "environments" up (and keeping them up!), organising database restores and other such activities that are incompatible with current best practices of software development. </li><li>they are temples of ceremony: a glance at the myriad of fields you need to fill in - and the rules and permutations required to get them exactly right - should be sufficient to put off even the most ardent believer in process. Most developers end up memorising some safe incantation that allows them to get on with life, without understanding the majority of the data they are entering. </li><li>as the underlying product ages, you will be faced with <a href="http://tinyletter.com/programming-beyond-practices/letters/the-sad-graph-of-software-death">the sad graph of software death</a>. The main problem is that resources get taken away from systems as they get older, a phenomena that manifests itself as a growth in the delta between the number of open tickets against the number of closed tickets. This is actually a <i>really</i> useful metric but one that is often ignored.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. </li></ul> <p>And what of the newest iterations on this venerable concept such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>? Well, clearly they solve a number of the problems above - such as lowering the complexity and cost barriers - and certainly they do serve a very useful purpose: they allow the efficient management of user interactions. Every time I create an issue - such as this <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/852">one</a> - it never ceases to amaze me how easily the information flows within GitHub projects; one can initiate comms with the author(s) or other users with <i>zero setup</i> - something that previously required mailinglist membership, opening an account on a bug-tracker and so forth. We now take all of this for granted, of course, but it is important to bear in mind that many open source projects would probably not even have <i>any</i> form of user interaction support, were it not for GitHub. After all, most of them are a one-person shop with very little disposable time, and it makes no sense to spend part of that time maintaining infrastructure for the odd person or two who may drop by to chat. </p> <p>However, for all of its glory, it is also important to bear in mind that GitHub Issues is <b>not</b> a product backlog solution. What I mean by this is that the product backlog must be owned by the team that owns the product and, as we shall see, it must be carefully groomed if it is to be continually useful. This is at loggerheads with allowing free flow of information from users. Your Issues will eventually be filled up with user requests and questions which you may not want to address, or general discussions which may or may not have a story behind it. They are simply different tools for different jobs, albeit with an overlap in functionality. </p> <p>So, history tells us what does not work. But is the product backlog even worth all this hassle? </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-4"><h2 id="sec-4">Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"><p>One of the great things about agile is how much it reflects on itself; a strange loop of sorts. Presentations such as Kevlin Henney's <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/architecture-uncertainty">The Architecture of Uncertainty</a> are part of this continual process of discovery and understanding, and provide great insights about the fundamental nature of the development process. The product backlog plays - or should play - a crucial role exactly because of this uncertain nature of software development. We can explain this by way of a device. </p> <p>Imagine that you start off by admitting that you know very little about what it is that you are intending to do and that the problem domain you are about to explore is vast and complex. In this scenario, the product backlog is the sum total of the knowledge gained whilst exploring this space that has yet not been transformed into source code. Think of it like the explorer's maps in the fifteen-hundreds. In those days, "users" knew that much of it was incorrect and a great part was sketchy and ill-defined, but it was all you had. Given that the odds of success were stacked against you, you'd hold that map pretty tightly while the storms were raging about you. Those that made it back would provide corrections and amendments and, over time, the maps eventually converged with the real geography. </p> <p>The product backlog does something similar, but of course, the space you are exploring does not have a fixed geometry or topography and your knowledge of the problem domain can actively <i>change</i> the domain itself too - an unavoidable consequence of dealing with pure thought stuff. But the general principle applies. Thus, in the same way <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">a code base is precious</a> because it embodies the sum total knowledge of a domain - heck, in many ways it <i>is</i> the sum total knowledge of a domain! - so the product backlog is precious because it captures all the known knowledge of these yet-to-be-explored areas. In this light, you can understand statements such as this: </p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When your product backlog is empty, your product is dead - <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">@KevlinHenney</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/agileotb?src=hash">#agileotb</a></p>— Marc Johnson (@marcjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcjohnson/status/507522331900915712">September 4, 2014</a></blockquote> <p>So, if the backlog is this important, how should one manage it? </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-5"><h2 id="sec-5">Works For Me, Guv!</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"><p>Up to this point - whilst we were delving into the problem space - we have been dealing with a fairly general argument, likely applicable to many. Now, as we enter the solution space, I'm afraid I will have to move from the general to the particular and talk only about the specific circumstances of my one-man-project <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Dogen</a>. You can find Dogen's product backlog <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org">here</a>. </p> <p>This may sound like a bit of a cop out, you may say, and not without reason: how on earth are you supposed to extrapolate conclusions from a one-person open source project to a team of N working on a commercial product? However, it is also important to take into account what I said at the start: agile is what you make of it. I personally think of it as a) the smallest amount of processes required to make your development process work smoothly and b) and the continual improvement of those processes. Thus, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions; all one can do is to look at others for ideas. So, lets look at my findings<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. </p> <p>The first and most important thing I did to help me manage my product backlog was to use a simple text file in <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> notation. Clearly, this is not a setup that is workable for a development team much larger than a set of one, or one that doesn't use Emacs (or <a href="https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer">Vim</a>). But for my particular circumstances it has worked <i>wonders</i>: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>the product backlog is close to the code, so wherever you go, you take it with you. This means you can always search the product backlog and - most importantly - add to it <i>wherever</i> you are and <i>whenever</i> an idea happens to come by. I use this flexibility frequently. </li><li>the Org Mode interface makes it really easy to move stories up and down (order is taken to mean priority here) and to create "buckets" of stories according to whatever categorisation you decide to use, up to any level of nesting. At some point you end up converging to a reasonable level of nesting, of course. It is surprising how one can manage <b>very</b> large amounts of stories thanks to this flexible tree structure. </li><li>it's trivial to move stories in and out of a sprint, keeping track of all changes to a story - they are just text that can be copy and pasted and committed. </li><li>Org Mode provides a very capable <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html">tagging system</a>. I first started by overusing these, but when tagging got too fine grained it became unmaintainable. Now we use too few - just <code>epic</code> and <code>story</code> - so this will have to change again in the near future. For example, it should be trivial to add tags for different components in the system or to mark stories as bugs or features, etc. <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-searches.html#Tag-searches">Searching</a> then allows you to see a subset of the stories that match those labels. </li></ul> <p>A second decision which has proven to be a very good one has been to groom the product backlog <i>very often</i>. And by this I don't just mean a cursory look, but a deep inspection of <i>all</i> stories, fixing them where required. Again, the choice of format has proved very helpful: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>it is easy to mark all stories as "non-reviewed" or some other suitable tag in Org Mode, and then unmark them as one finishes the groom - thereby ensuring all stories get some attention. As the product backlog becomes larger, a full groom could take multiple sprints, but this is not an issue once you understand its value and the cost of having it rot. </li><li>because the product backlog is with the code, any downtime can be used for grooming; those idle weekends or that long wait at the airport are perfect candidates to get a few stories looked at. Time spent waiting for the build is also a good candidate. </li><li>you get an HTML representation of the Org Mode file for free in GitHub, meaning you can read your backlog from your phone. And with the new editing functionality, you can also edit stories too. </li></ul> <p>Thirdly, I decided to take a "multi-pass" approach at managing the story lifecycle. These are some of the key aspects of this lifecycle management: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li>stories can only be captured if they are aligned with the <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/vision.org">vision</a>. This filter saves me from adding all sorts of ideas which are just too "out of the left field" to be of practical use, but keeps <a href="https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/product_backlog.org#visionary">those that may sound crazy</a> are but aligned with the vision. </li><li>stories can only be captured if there is no "prior art". I always perform a number of searches in the backlog to look for anything which covers similar ground. If found, I append to that. </li><li>new stories tend to start with very little content - just the minimum required to allow resetting state back to the idea I was trying to capture. Due to this, very little gets lost. At this point, we have a "proto-story". </li><li>as time progresses, I end up having more ideas on this space, and I update the story with those ideas - mainly bullet points with one liners and links. </li><li>at some point the story begins to mature; there is enough on it that we can convert the "proto-story" to a full blown story. After a number of grooms, the story becomes fully formed and is then a candidate to be moved to a sprint backlog for implementation. It may stay in this state <i>ad-infinitum</i>, with periodic updates just to make sure it does not rot. </li><li>A candidate story can still get refined: trimmed in scope, re-targeted, or even cancelled because it no longer fits with the current architecture or even the vision. Cancelled stories are important because we may come back to them - its just very unlikely that we do. </li><li>every sprint has a "sprint mission"<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. When we start to move stories into the sprint backlog, we look for those which resonate with the sprint mission. Not all of them are fully formed, and the work on the sprint can entail the analysis required to create a full blown story. But many will be implementable directly off of the product backlog. </li><li>some times I end up finding related threads in multiple stories and decide to merge them. Merging of related stories is done by simply copying and pasting them into a single story; over time, with the multiple passes done in the grooms, we end up again with a single consistent story. </li></ul> <p>What all of this means is that a story can evolve over time in the product backlog, only to become the exact thing you need at a given sprint; at that point you benefit from the knowledge and insight gained over that long period of time. Some stories in Dogen's backlog have been there for years, and when I finally get to them, I find them extremely useful. Remember: they are a map to the unknown space you are exploring. </p> <p>With all of this machinery in place, we've ended up with a very useful product backlog for Dogen - one that certainly adds a lot of value. Don't take me wrong, the cost of maintenance is high and I'd rather be coding instead of maintaining the product backlog, especially given the limited resources. But I keep it because I can see on a daily basis how much it improves the overall quality of the development process. It is a price I find worth paying, given what I get in return. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-6"><h2 id="sec-6">Final Thoughts</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6"><p>This post was an attempt to summarise some of the thoughts I've been having on the space of product backlogs.

<p>It is not too long ago that <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/">mirror neurons</a> were touted as one of the most exciting discoveries in neuroscience (or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/brain-myths/201212/mirror-neurons-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience">most hyped</a>, depending on your perspective). First discovered in monkeys, these brain cells fire when an individual performs a movement <em>or</em> when they see someone else perform that movement. This automatic neural mirroring of other’s actions was interpreted by some scientists as the seat of human empathy. The cells’ most high-profile champion, US neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran, described them as “the neurons that shaped civilisation” and, in 2000, he (in)famously said they would do for psychology what DNA did for biology. Nearly 20 years on, what evidence do we have that mirror neurons provide the basis for human empathy? According to a new meta-analysis and systematic review <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/6bu4p/">released as a preprint at <em>PsyArXiv</em></a>, the short answer is “not a lot”.</p>
<p><span id="more-36755"></span></p>
<p>The research team, led by Soukayna Bekkali and Peter Enticott at the University of Deakin, searched the literature for all English language studies conducted in humans that had investigated whether mirror neuron activity was correlated with empathy.</p>
<p>This search led to the identification of 52 relevant papers involving over 1000 participants. These studies had used a range of methods to measure mirror neuron activity (including fMRI brain scanning, EEG recording of brain activity and TMS –  magnetic stimulation typically applied to the motor cortex, to check how much it had already been activated by witnessing movement by others). There were also various measures of empathy: mostly self-report questionnaires, but also measures of “motor empathy” (the automatic mimicry of other people’s movements) and the recognition of other’s facial emotions.</p>
<p>There was a notable lack of objective measures of empathy, such as looking at participants’ heart rate or skin conductance (the involuntary production of sweat as part of an emotional response). Overall, participant samples were small and there was great inconsistency in methods.</p>
<p>Bekkali and her colleagues broke down the literature according to whether the papers had investigated motor empathy, emotional empathy (feeling what someone else is feeling), and/or cognitive empathy (knowing what someone else is feeling or thinking).</p>
<p>Regarding motor empathy, the accumulated evidence pointed to no association with mirror neuron activity. Regarding emotional empathy, there was no evidence for a link with mirror neuron activity in one key brain region where these cells are thought to reside (the inferior parietal lobule; IPL) and only weak evidence for an association with postulated mirror neuron activity in another key brain area, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). “It remains unclear how the mirror neuron system relates to the experience of emotional empathy,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of cognitive empathy, there was no evidence for a mirror neuron link in the IPL and weak evidence of a link with activity in the IFG. “The current results suggest mirror neuron activity may play a role in cognitive empathy,” the researchers said, adding that “the mirror neuron system may potentially be one neurophysiological mechanism subserving cognitive empathy.”</p>
<p>One problem with interpreting the existing evidence base is that the results tended to vary according to the methods used, not only in terms of how mirror neuron activity and empathy were measured, but also according to the stimuli presented to participants, such as whether they viewed real images of people performing actions, or cartoons, and whether the images were dynamic or static. There is no currently accepted “gold standard” measure of mirror neuron activity in humans, the review authors also noted, and some evidence of a file-drawer problem in the literature, in which positive results are more likely to be published.</p>
<p>Finally, although this thorough investigation of the existing evidence base uncovered some modest evidence that mirror neurons may be involved in empathy – especially cognitive empathy (or understanding other people’s perspectives) – to date there is no evidence that mirror neurons play a causal role in empathy or are necessary for empathy.</p>
<p>When excitement about mirror neurons was at its peak, it was common for newspaper columnists and media commentators to reference these cells with confidence when discussing empathy. “It’s thanks to these cells that we are willing to help strangers in need”; “the best rom coms trigger our mirror neurons”; “altruists have more mirror neurons”, and so on. We were getting ahead of ourselves. After more than two decades of research, this new review provides a sober reminder that our understanding of the neural basis of empathy, and especially the role played by mirror neurons, remains far from complete.</p>

<p>Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he presents results from his Ph.D. research on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>It is now well established that the brain retains its capacity to form and remove whole synapses in adulthood.
This type of plasticity, termed structural plasticity, is capable of altering connectivity, and therefore function, of neuronal networks of the brain over periods of days and months.
Although reports of disruptive effects of structural plasticity remain scarce, a number of lesion experiments have described the time course of synaptic structures during network reorganisation by homeostatic structural plasticity in great detail.
The underlying mechanisms that drive these changes, however, are yet to be explained.
To investigate the dynamics of synaptic structures reported in these lesion studies, we replicated a peripheral lesion in a biologically plausible spiking network model that exhibits cortical asynchronous irregular firing.
Here, we present results from our computational modelling study.</p>
<p>Results from our simulations suggest that for activity to be restored to deprived neurons in the lesion projection zone (LPZ), excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic structures must exhibit opposite activity dependent growth behaviours.
Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they contribute to the maintenance of optimal activity levels in individual neurons.
Where a reduction in neuronal activity results in the sprouting of new excitatory post-synaptic structures, it is accompanied by the retraction of their inhibitory counterparts.
Extra activity is similarly countered by a retraction of excitatory post-synaptic structures and sprouting of inhibitory ones.
Our simulations also reproduce the ingrowth of excitatory axons into, and the outgrowth of inhibitory axons out from the LPZ that have been observed in lesion experiments.
We find that the ingrowth of excitatory axons requires that sprouting of excitatory pre-synaptic structures be stimulated by extra excitatory neuron activity.
The outgrowth of inhibitory axons, on the other hand, necessitates the sprouting of inhibitory pre-synaptic structures to be prompted by a loss in inhibitory neuron activity.
In conclusion, by modelling repair following deafferentation that is faithful to experimental findings, we make testable predictions on the activity dependent dynamics of synaptic structures.</p>
