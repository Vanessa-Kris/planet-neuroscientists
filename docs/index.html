<p><strong>Rats are generally Good Samaritans: they help other rats in trouble, particularly when they’re in a group. </strong>But after their companions are given drugs which make them passive, the rats seem to lose their willingness to help, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/08/888767466/to-come-to-the-rescue-or-not-rats-like-people-take-cues-from-bystanders">reports Nell Greenfieldboyce</a> at <em>NPR</em>. The findings have similarities with the bystander effect in humans, where the presence of unresponsive bystanders can make someone less likely to help.</p>

But, <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/anti-racism-training-for-children-is-cruel/">writes Tom Chivers</a> at <em>Unherd</em>, the problem is that there’s very little evidence this kind of training, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">or the tools used to measure implicit racism</a>, actually work.</p>

The team lined up ten artificial flowers, putting food in just a single one (the first flower, for instance, or the third one along). After the hummingbirds had learned which flower contained food, the researchers then shuffled the flowers around and moved the whole line to another location. But the birds still went straight for the location in the line where they expected the food to be.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cells-slow-immune-response-derailing-fight-tumors">These cells slow an immune response. Derailing them could help fight tumors</a></h4>

<p>Drugs that release brakes on the immune system have helped thousands of people with cancers that were previously untreatable. Yet these therapies, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-prod-patient-immune-system-fight-cancer-wins-nobel-prize">checkpoint blockers</a> (<em>SN: 10/1/18</em>), fail in many patients and work poorly for some cancers. That’s because the body’s defense system can stall in more than one way.</p>



<p>Checkpoint blockers traditionally target a particular set of brakes: protein interactions that disarm the body’s T cells, allowing cancer to grow unchecked. But an additional brake may be at work as well — an immune cell population called myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs. These cells reach unusually high levels in people with cancer.</p>



<p>Now, experiments in mice suggest that immune checkpoint therapies could get a boost if paired with other drugs targeting MDSCs. Researchers reported their initial findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, held virtually in late June.  </p>



<p>MDSCs are a mix of immature cells from the same family as neutrophils and macrophages, which act as general first responders in the immune system. MDSCs caught scientists’ attention decades ago, but it wasn’t until the last several years that their importance in cancer came into focus.</p>





<p>“Their normal function is to slow things down,” says William Carson III, a surgical oncologist at Ohio State University in Columbus. Disabling them, Carson thought, might allow the immune system to launch a speedier attack on cancer cells.</p>



<p>In a 2016 study of people who received <a href="https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/early/2016/10/23/1078-0432.CCR-15-3104.full.pdf">checkpoint blockers for advanced melanoma</a>, patients with lower levels of MDSCs in their blood responded better to the immune therapy and lived longer. That made Carson and his colleagues wonder if getting rid of the suppressor cells could create an environment for checkpoint blockers to work better. And they knew a class of drugs that could potentially achieve this: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01761">Brd4 inhibitors</a>. </p>



<p>In tumor cells, the protein Brd4 regulates the activity of various genes — including some that promote MDSCs. So perhaps a Brd4-inhibiting drug would give checkpoint blockers free rein to do their job.</p>



<p>To test the idea, Andrew Stiff, a physician-researcher in Carson’s lab, conducted studies in mice with implanted breast tumors — a type of human cancer that responds poorly to checkpoint blockade. Among mice treated with the checkpoint blocker anti-PDL1, tumor growth slowed in three of 11 animals. Mice treated with a placebo drug or Brd4 inhibitor alone fared worse. A third group of animals received combination therapy, anti-PDL1 and a Brd4 inhibitor, which aimed to release the brakes on T cells and curb the suppressor cells at the same time. Tumors shrank in <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9045/presentation/6905">seven of 11 of those mice</a>, Stiff reported June 24 at the AACR meeting.</p>



<p>Treated mice had fewer MDSCs in circulation and at the tumor site. Other experiments suggested Brd4 inhibitors can influence MDSCs in several ways — including killing them directly or suppressing a molecule that drives their growth and expansion.</p>



<p>The team got similar results with several different Brd4 inhibitors and in mice with breast, colon or lung tumors. Though preliminary and unpublished, the findings suggest that Brd4 inhibitors “can get rid of these immune suppressor cells that are an additional brake on the immune system, and allow immune stimulating drugs to work better,” says Carson.</p>



<p>There are other ways to target those suppressor cells. Timothy Wang, a gastroenterologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and his colleagues went after them using an anti-inflammatory peptide called trefoil factor 2, or TFF2. Previously, Wang and colleagues showed that some T cells <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26841680/">release TFF2 to tone down inflammatory responses</a>, and that giving mice TFF2 can boost the immune system and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30042499/">slow tumor growth</a>. </p>



<p>In a new study, a team led by Wang and cancer biologist Woosook Kim chemically stimulated mice to form colorectal tumors. Some animals had genetic manipulations that led them to produce a lot of MDSCs and grow tumors quickly, the team reported June 22 at the virtual AACR meeting.</p>



<p>Like human patients, these mice responded poorly to anti-PD1 immune therapy. However, <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9045/presentation/7241">combining TFF2 and anti-PD1 shrank tumors</a> in all five animals with aggressive cancer.</p>



<p>Synthesizing TFF2 for this pilot study was expensive, Wang says, so his team could test only a single dose on a small number of animals. “The fact that we could get any responses here, and that we showed some degree of synergy with anti-PD1, is very encouraging,” Wang says.</p>



<p>Li Peng, chief scientific officer at Palleon Pharmaceuticals, a Boston-area company developing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-cells-cast-sweet-spell-immune-system"> cancer immunotherapies</a> (<em>SN: 3/21/17</em>), notes that chemically induced tumor models like the mice Wang’s team used tend to mimic human cancer better than the implanted tumor models more commonly used for immune therapy studies.</p>



<p>However, a drug’s effectiveness in mice has traditionally shown little correlation with its impact in human patients. For example, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 therapies only modestly slowed tumor growth in mice — yet today they’re “the cornerstone for immuno-oncology therapy in humans … and well-tolerated,” Peng says. Another case in point: STING agonists. These drugs, which activate a slew of host defense genes, worked like gangbusters in mice yet have floundered thus far in clinical trials.</p>



<p>More than a thousand other trials are currently testing checkpoint blockers, alone or in combination with additional drugs and some, like one in people <a href="https://geneonline.news/en/2020/05/31/asco-2020-genentechs-novel-anti-tigit-therapy-shows-promise-in-phase-ii-lung-cancer-trials/?doing_wp_cron=1593638005.7755949497222900390625">targeting advanced non-small cell lung cancer</a>, are showing some promise. Yet the immune system is so sophisticated, with layers upon layers of brakes, that existing approaches may be “just scratching the surface,” says Peng.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In January, vaccine researchers lined up on the starting blocks, waiting to hear a pistol. That shot came on January 10, when scientists in China announced the complete genetic makeup of the novel coronavirus. With that information in hand, the headlong race toward a vaccine began.</p>



<p>As the virus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, began to spread like wildfire around the globe, researchers sprinted to catch up with treatments and vaccines. Now, six months later, there is still no cure and no preventative for the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, though there are glimmers of hope. Studies show that two drugs can help treat the sick: The antiviral remdesivir <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">shortens recovery times</a> (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>) and a steroid called dexamethasone <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-dexamethasone-reduce-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths">reduces deaths</a> among people hospitalized with COVID-19 who need help breathing (<em>SN: 6/16/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the finish line in this race remains a safe and effective vaccine. With nearly 180 vaccine candidates now being tested in lab dishes, animals and even already in humans, that end may be in sight. Some experts predict that a vaccine may be available for emergency use for the general public by the end of the year even before it receives expedited U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.</p>

<h3>COVID-19:<br />The first six months</h3>



<p>This story is one in a series looking at the first six months of the pandemic. </p>





<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-six-months-what-we-know">Here’s what we’ve learned in six months of COVID-19 — and what we still don’t know</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-united-states-wasted-time-lockdowns-reopening">The U.S. largely wasted time bought by COVID-19 lockdowns.

</div>



<p>Velocity might come at the expense of safety and efficacy, some experts worry. And that could stymie efforts to convince enough people to get the vaccine in order to build the herd immunity needed to end the pandemic.</p>



<p>“We’re calling for transparency of data,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. “We want things to accelerate meaningfully in a way that does not compromise safety or the science, but we need to see the data,” she says. </p>



<h4>Getting a head start</h4>



<p>Traditionally, vaccines are made from weakened or killed viruses, or virus fragments. But producing large amounts of vaccine that way can take years, because such vaccines must be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-ethical-issues">made in cells</a> (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>), which often aren’t easy to grow in large quantities.</p>



<p>Getting an early good look at the coronavirus’s genetic makeup created a shortcut. It let scientists quickly harness the virus’s genetic information to make copies of a crucial piece of SARS-CoV-2 that can be used as the basis for vaccines.</p>



<p>That piece is known as the spike protein. It studs the virus’s surface, forming its halo and allowing the virus to latch onto and enter human cells. Because the spike protein is on the outside of the virus, it’s also an easy target for antibodies to recognize.</p>



<p>Researchers have copied the SARS-CoV-2 version of instructions for making the spike protein into RNA or DNA, or synthesized the protein itself, in order to create vaccines of various types (see sidebar). Once the vaccine is delivered into the body, the immune system makes antibodies that recognize the virus and block it from getting into cells, either preventing infection or helping people avoid serious illness.</p>



<p>Using this approach, drugmakers have set speed records in devising vaccines and beginning clinical trials. FasterCures, which is part of the Milken Institute think tank, is <a href="https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org/#vaccines_intro">tracking 179 vaccine candidates</a>, most of which are still being tested in lab dishes and animals. But nearly 20 have already begun testing in people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="spike proteins illustration" class="wp-image-3089548" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070820_ti_covid_6m_vaccine_inline_1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089548">Coronaviruses use their spike proteins (shown in an illustration) to gain entry into cells where the viruses can replicate.

<h4>Going to trial</h4>



<p>Some front-runners have emerged, leading the pack in a neck-and-neck race. Some have been propelled by an effort by the U.S. federal government, called <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/06/16/fact-sheet-explaining-operation-warp-speed.html">Operation Warp Speed</a>, which has picked a handful of vaccine candidates to fast-track.</p>



<p>First out of the starting gate was one developed by Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass.–based biotech company. It inoculated the first volunteer with its candidate vaccine on March 16, just 63 days after the virus’s genetic makeup was revealed. The company has since reported preliminary safety data, and some evidence that its vaccine <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people">stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies</a> against the coronavirus (<em>SN: 5/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>That company and several others now have vaccines entering Phase III clinical trials. Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in Bethesda, Md., will <a href="https://vimeo.com/430900256">begin inoculating 30,000 volunteers</a> with either the vaccine or a placebo in July to test the vaccine’s efficacy in large numbers of people.</p>

<p>Moderna’s vaccine requires two doses; a prime and a boost. That means “it will take 28 days to get any individual person vaccinated,” NIAID director Anthony Fauci said June 26 during a Milken Institute webinar. It will take “weeks and months” to give the full set of shots to all those people. Then it will take time to determine whether more people in the placebo group get COVID-19 than those in the vaccine group — a sign that the vaccine works. Those results could come in late fall or early winter.</p>



<p>NIAID launched a clinical trials network July 8 <a href="https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/">to recruit volunteers</a> at sites across the United States for phase III testing of vaccines and antibodies to prevent COVID-19. Moderna’s vaccine will be the first in line for testing.</p>



<p>Some researchers propose accelerating clinical trials even further by trying controversial challenge trials, in which vaccinated volunteers are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-human-challenge-trial-infect-people-vaccine">intentionally exposed</a> to the coronavirus (<em>SN: 5/27/20</em>). None of those studies have gotten the green light yet.</p>



<p>Three other global drug and vaccine companies have announced plans to launch similarly sized trials this summer: Johnson &amp; Johnson; AstraZeneca, working with the University of Oxford; and Pfizer Inc., which has teamed up with the German company BioNTech. Like Moderna, all are part of Operation Warp Speed, or will be joining it.</p>

<h4>Eye on safety</h4>



<p>Usually, Phase III trials are about determining efficacy. But the rush to get through earlier stages designed to make sure a drug doesn’t cause harm means that scientists also will be keeping a keen eye on safety, Fauci said. Researchers will be watching, in particular, for any suggestion that antibodies generated by the vaccine might enhance infection.</p>



<p>That can happen when antibodies stimulated by the vaccine don’t fully neutralize the virus and can aid it getting into cells and replicating, or because the vaccine alters immune cell responses in unhelpful ways. Vaccines against MERS and SARS coronaviruses made infections with the real virus worse in some animal studies.</p>



<p>Such enhanced infections are a worry for any unproven vaccine candidate, but some experimental vaccines in the works may be more concerning than others, says Peter Pitts, president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonprofit research and education organization headquartered in New York City.</p>



<p>For instance, China-based CanSino Biologics Inc. has developed a hybrid virus vaccine: It’s made by putting the coronavirus spike protein into a common cold virus called adenovirus 5. That virus can infect humans but has been altered so that it can no longer replicate.</p>



<p>In a small study, reported June 13 in the <em>Lancet</em>, CanSino’s vaccine triggered antibody production against the spike protein. But many <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3/fulltext">volunteers already had preexisting antibodies</a> to the adenovirus, raising concerns that that could weaken their response to the vaccine. A weakened response might make an infection worse when people encounter the real coronavirus, Pitts says.</p>



<p>That’s of particular concern because CanSino said in a June 29 statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that its vaccine was approved by the Chinese government for temporary <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/0629/2020062900123.pdf">use by the Chinese military</a>. That’s essentially turning soldiers into guinea pigs, Pitts says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="coronavirus and antibodies illustration" class="wp-image-3089550" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070820_ti_covid_6m_vaccine_inline_2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089550">Vaccines can trigger the production of multiple types of antibodies (yellow, seen attaching to a coronavirus in this illustration). Some, called neutralizing antibodies, protect against disease, but others may make the disease worse. Clinical trials are under way now to determine whether vaccines against the coronavirus are safe and effective.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089550">koto_feja/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0321-6">type of antibodies</a> stimulated by the vaccine will be important in determining whether the vaccine protects against disease or makes things worse, Yale University immunologists Akiko Iwasaki and Yexin Yang, warned April 21 in <em>Nature Reviews Immunology</em>. Some types of antibodies have been associated with more severe COVID-19.</p>



<p>And it will be important to monitor the ratio of neutralizing antibodies and non-neutralizing antibodies, as well as activity of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030709X?via%3Dihub">other immune cells</a> triggered by the vaccines, an international working group of scientists recommended in a conference report in the June 26 <em>Vaccine</em>.</p>



<p>Public health officials will also be tracking side effects closely. “As big as the vaccine trials may be, <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1kvKpegQqeZGE">we can’t be sure that there aren’t rare side effects</a>,” Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said June 29 during a question-and-answer session with the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>. “That’s why even when we get enough to vaccinate large numbers, we’re going to need to be following it.”</p>



<p>In 1976 for instance, it turned out that Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition in which the immune system attacks parts of the nervous system, was a rare side effect of the “swine flu” influenza vaccine. That didn’t become obvious until the vaccine had already been rolled out to 45 million people in the United States.</p>





<h4>Measuring success</h4>



<p>Early on, it was unclear whether scientists could devise a vaccine against the coronavirus at all. It’s now a question of when rather than if we’ll have a vaccine.</p>



<p>But some researchers have expressed concern that rushing clinical trials might lead federal regulators to approve a vaccine based on its ability to trigger antibody production alone. It’s still <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">unclear how well antibodies protect</a> against reinfection with the coronavirus and how long any such immunity may last (<em>SN: 4/28/20</em>). The measure of whether the vaccine works should be its ability to protect against illness, not antibody production, Fauci said.</p>



<p>“I really want to make sure that we don’t have a vaccine that’s distributed among the American people unless we know it’s safe and we know it is effective,” he said. “Not that we think it might be effective, but that we <em>know</em> it’s effective.” </p>



<p>So far though, companies are measuring success by the antibody. For instance, INOVIO, a biotechnology company based in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., announced June 30 that <a href="http://ir.inovio.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2020/INOVIO-Announces-Positive-Interim-Phase-1-Data-For-INO-4800-Vaccine-for-COVID-19/default.aspx">94 percent of participants</a> in a small safety trial made antibodies against the coronavirus. The data, delivered via news release like that from numerous other companies rushing to show progress, had not been peer-reviewed and other details about the company’s DNA-based vaccine were sparse.</p>



<h4>Building trust</h4>



<p>Despite still having much to prove, companies are gearing up manufacturing without knowing if their product will ever reach the market. By the end of the year, companies promise they can have hundreds of millions of doses. “We keep saying, ‘Are you sure?’ And they keep saying yes,” Fauci said. “That’s pretty impressive if they can do it.”</p>



<p>For instance, if everything goes right, a vaccine in testing now from Pfizer might be available as soon as October, Pfizer chairman and chief executive Albert Bourla said during the Milken Institute session. “If we are lucky, and the product works and we do not have significant bumps on our way to manufacturing,” he said, the company expects to be able to make 1 billion doses by early next year.</p>

<p>Pfizer <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20142570v1">released preliminary data</a> on the safety of one of four vaccine candidates it is evaluating July 1 at medRxiv.org. In the small study of 45 people, no severe side effects were noted. Vaccination produced neutralizing antibodies at levels 1.8 to 2.8 times levels found in blood plasma from people who had recovered from COVID-19, researchers reported.</p>



<p>Novavax Inc., a Gaithersburg, Md.-based biotechnology company, announced July 7 that it was being award $1.6 billion from Operation Warp Speed to conduct phase III trials and to <a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed">deliver 100 million doses</a> of its vaccine as early as the end of the year.</p>



<p>If manufacturers can deliver a vaccine as promised, there could be another big hurdle: There’s no guarantee people will line up for shots. About a quarter of Americans said in recent polls that they would “definitely” or “probably not” get a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. “That’s a pending public health crisis,” Pitts says.</p>



<p>Krofah agrees. “We need to think about the post-pandemic world in the midst of all of this,” she says. “We need to … start building that public trust now.” Tackling issues of vaccine hesitancy shouldn’t be left until a vaccine is available, she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="anti-vaccine protest in California" class="wp-image-3089551" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070820_ti_covid_6m_vaccine_inline_3.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089551">A protestor in Woodland Hills, Calif., on May 16 holds a sign depicting anti-vaccine sentiment. Public health officials say campaigns aimed at urging people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus are needed even before a vaccine exists.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089551">David McNew /Getty Images News</span></figure>



<p>Whether with vaccines or treatments, “we need to expedite, but not rush,” Pitts says.  “There’s a perception that therapeutics or vaccines will be approved willy-nilly because of politics, and that’s a dangerous misperception.” The FDA laid out <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-daily-roundup-june-30-2020">guidelines, including an accelerated approval process</a>, on June 30 that should ensure any approved vaccines work, he says.</p>



<p>There is good news for those who are eagerly awaiting vaccines, Krofah and Pitts say: There won’t be just one winner in the race. Instead, there may be multiple options to choose from. That’s not a luxury; it may be a necessity. Multiple vaccines may be needed to protect different segments of the population, Krofah says. For instance, elderly people may need a vaccine that prods the immune system harder to make antibodies, and children may need different vaccines than adults do.</p>



<p>What’s more, long-term investments in development will be needed so that vaccines can be altered if the virus mutates. “We need to stay the front and not declare victory once a vaccine has been approved for emergency use,” she says.</p>



<p>For now, vaccine makers are moving both as quickly and as carefully as possible, Bourla said. “I am aware that right now that billions of people, millions of businesses, hundreds of governments are investing their hope for a solution in a handful of pharma companies.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boosting-liver-protein-may-mimic-brain-benefits-exercise">Boosting a liver protein may mimic the brain benefits of exercise</a></h4>

<p>Exercise’s power to boost the brain might require a little help from the liver.</p>



<p>A chemical signal from the liver, triggered by exercise, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6500/167">helps elderly mice keep their brains sharp</a>, suggests a study published in the July 10 <em>Science</em>. Understanding this liver-to-brain signal may help scientists develop a drug that benefits the brain the way exercise does.</p>



<p>Lots of studies have shown that exercise helps the brain, buffering the memory declines that come with old age, for instance. Scientists have long sought an “exercise pill” that could be useful for elderly people too frail to work out or for whom exercise is otherwise risky. “Can we somehow get people who can’t exercise to have the same benefits?” asks Saul Villeda, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>



<p>Villeda and colleagues took an approach similar to experiments that revealed the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-blood-proven-good-old-brain">rejuvenating effects</a> of blood from young mice (<em>SN: 5/5/14</em>).  But instead of youthfulness, the researchers focused on fitness. The researchers injected sedentary elderly mice with plasma from elderly mice that had voluntarily run on wheels over the course of six weeks. After eight injections over 24 days, the sedentary elderly mice performed better on memory tasks, such as remembering where a hidden platform was in a pool of water, than elderly mice that received injections from sedentary mice.</p>





<p>Comparing the plasma of exercised mice with that of sedentary mice showed an abundance of proteins produced by the liver in mice that ran on wheels.</p>



<p>The researchers closely studied one of these liver proteins produced in response to exercise, called GPLD1. GPLD1 is an enzyme, a type of molecular scissors. It snips other proteins off the outsides of cells, releasing those proteins to go do other jobs. Targeting these biological jobs with a molecule that behaves like GPLD1 might be a way to mimic the brain benefits of exercise, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>Old mice that were genetically engineered to make more GPLD1 in their livers performed better on the memory tasks than other old sedentary mice, the researchers found. The genetically engineered sedentary mice did about as well in the pool of water as the mice that exercised. “Getting the liver to produce this one enzyme can actually recapitulate all these beneficial effects we see in the brain with exercise,” Villeda says. </p>



<p>Blood samples from elderly people also hint that exercise raises GPLD1 levels. Elderly people who were physically active (defined as walking more than 7,100 steps a day) had more of the protein than elderly people who were more sedentary, data on step-counters showed.</p>



<p>GPLD1 seems to exert its effects from outside of the brain, perhaps by changing the composition of the blood in some way, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>But the role of GPLD1 is far from settled, cautions Irina Conboy, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley who studies aging. There’s evidence that GPLD1 levels are higher in people with diabetes, she points out, hinting that the protein may have negative effects. And different experiments suggest that GPLD1 levels might actually fall in response to certain kinds of exercise in rats with markers of diabetes.</p>



<p>“We know for sure that exercise is good for you,” Conboy says. “And we know that this protein is present in the blood.” But whether GPLD1 is good or bad, or whether it goes up or down with exercise, she says, “we don’t know yet.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>If you’re looking to find love on a dating app, there’s plenty you need to think about: what to include in your bio, the interests you list, and what you say you’re looking for. And in an age of rapid swiping, you’re probably going to need a knock-out profile picture too.</p>
<p>But don’t be too quick to assume that a picture with your pet might boost your chances — at least if you’re a male cat owner, that is. According to Lori Kogan and Shelly Volsche, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32526856/">writing in <em>Animals</em></a><em>,</em> men holding cats in photographs are seen as less masculine, more neurotic and ultimately less dateable.</p>
<p><span id="more-39896"></span>To look at the impact of cats on online dating success, the pair asked 1388 participants to complete a survey in which they saw two images of a man. In both pictures, the man was sitting in a chair against a white background, wearing a blue button-down shirt and jeans. In one picture, he was alone; in the other, he was shown with a ginger cat on his lap. The order in which participants saw these images were randomised. There were two different versions of this survey, each depicting a different man.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_39899" style="width: 1140px;"><img alt="Kogan and Volsche" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39899" data-attachment-id="39899" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Kogan and Volsche" data-large-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png?w=845" data-medium-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png" data-orig-size="1140,364" data-permalink="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/09/cat-people-beware-posing-with-your-pet-could-make-you-appear-less-dateable/kogan-and-volsche/" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/kogan-and-volsche.png?w=845" />Half of the participants saw pictures of Man 1 (A) and half saw Man 2 (B). <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/6/1007/htm">Via Kogan and Volsche (2020)</a></figure>
<p>After viewing each picture, participants rated the men on several attributes including perceived personality (how extraverted, agreeable, neurotic, conscientious and open participants believed they were), perceived masculinity and femininity, and how dateable they were. Participants were also asked directly whether or not they would consider dating the man in either the short or long term, and whether or not they considered themselves to be a cat or dog person.</p>
<p>The presence of a cat did, in fact, have an impact on how the men were perceived. When Man 1 was pictured by himself, he was seen as more extraverted; when he was with the cat, he was seen to be more agreeable, more neurotic and more open, and less traditionally masculine.</p>
<p>Overall, women were also less likely to want to date the man when he was holding a cat than when alone, and tended to see him as less desirable for a long-term relationship. Unsurprisingly, women who considered themselves to be “dog people” were less likely to favour the cat picture version than women who thought of themselves as “cat people”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when Man 2 was holding a cat, participants’ didn’t see his personality as any different from when he was alone. However, he was again seen as less masculine and less dateable in the short term  (though he was no less desirable when it came to the potential for a long-term relationship).</p>
<p>There are, fairly obviously, limitations to the study. These are big conclusions to form from small effects based on four images of two young white men, which Kogan and Volsche note themselves: the presence of cats, they write, may only be relevant to people looking to date a white male. Perceptions of masculinity are also dependent on factors like race and class, which further research may seek to explore. The strength of the findings are also somewhat undermined by the lack of effects for the second man, suggesting that other factors may also be at play.</p>
<p>It’s also uncertain whether women would show similar preferences when seeing images of men with other pets. Including images of men with dogs as well as cats may have made differences in perceptions clearer. More naturalistic images could also change the way men are viewed when holding animals — the photos used in the study were clearly staged, which may have made an impact on the women’s perceptions.</p>
<p>Limitations aside, cat lovers may be feeling disheartened by the study. But don’t worry — if the results do reflect reality, you’re probably just saving yourself the heartbreak of accidentally shacking up with a dog person.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-reform-why-little-evidence-data-body-cameras-implicit-bias">There’s little evidence showing which police reforms work</a></h4>

<p>When criminologist Robin Engel suddenly found herself leading the effort to reform a police department under fire after a white police officer killed an unarmed Black man in July 2015, she looked for some kind of road map to follow. Instead, she found herself in poorly charted territory.</p>



<p>A professor at the University of Cincinnati, Engel had been called on frequently to help police departments around the country manage their response to acts of police violence. This time, the call came from close to home. Campus Officer Ray Tensing, 25, had shot and killed 43-year-old musician Samuel DuBose during an off-campus traffic stop.</p>



<p>Engel recommended that the university hire a high-ranking official to oversee the police department and its immediate response to the crisis, and initiate longer term, comprehensive reforms to prevent future incidents.</p>



<p>Within days, Engel had become that official, reporting directly to the university president and outranking the university’s police chief, despite lacking police experience herself.</p>





<p>She sought input from various community stakeholders, many of whom had been rankled by her appointment to lead the police division. She also turned to her best-known tool — research. She began probing for studies to guide her on the sorts of reforms she could institute, ones with proven track records of changing police behavior in the field. Her search was unfruitful.</p>



<p>“I thought most certainly we would have an evidence base that I could follow,” Engel says. “I was incredibly disappointed at the lack of evidence that was available. I was really disappointed in my own field.”</p>





<h4>Evidence gap</h4>



<p>Among her efforts, Engel scoured the literature for so-called de-escalation programs with a history of success at defusing violence. Her review of that body of work, appearing in January 2020 in <em>Criminology &amp; Public Policy, </em>found 64 de-escalation programs in the United States and elsewhere — but mostly administered to nurses and psychologists. She found <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12467">no programs that had been tested among police officers</a>. Just three studies showed cause and effect and included randomized control groups, and those showed that such programs led to minimal individual and organizational improvements.</p>



<p>In a February 2020 review in <em>The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</em>, Engel and colleagues discuss de-escalation trainings and four other <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002716219889328">reforms that tend to capture the public’s attention</a> following fatal police-civilian encounters: body-worn cameras, implicit <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/views-bias-can-be-biased">bias</a> training (meant to reduce decisions and actions that arise from unconscious stereotypes) (<em>SN: 10/26/15</em>), early intervention systems that identify problematic officers before a crisis and civilian oversight of the police.</p>



<p>Engel was unable to identify a single police reform with convincing evidence of resulting behavior change among officers. Even studies on body-worn cameras, which are numerous, had mixed results. Engel cites a March 2019 review of 70 studies in <em>Criminology &amp; Public Policy</em> by a team of researchers led by Cynthia Lum of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., that gauged the link between camera use and a reduction in force. Just 16 of those studies looked directly at whether or not cameras reduced officers’ use of force; of that subset, some show that the cameras work as a deterrent to use of force whereas others reach the opposite conclusion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Minneapolis police officer wearing body camera" class="wp-image-3089497" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070820_SG_defundpolice_inline_2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089497">An officer with the Minneapolis Police Department wears a body camera as part of his gear while responding to a call in 2019.

<h4>Why no data?</h4>



<p>The dearth of evidence stems from several factors, Engel says, but chief among them is the pressure for police departments to act fast when an instance of police violence captures national attention. Consider that less than two weeks following <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-1960s-civil-rights-protests-teach-fighting-racism-today">the death of George Floyd</a> when white police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for several minutes, the majority of city councilors pledged to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department in response to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-1960s-civil-rights-protests-teach-fighting-racism-today">activists’ calls</a> to “defund the police” (<em>SN: 6/5/2020</em>).</p>



<p>Other departments around the country are likewise looking at ways to defund some police services, or reallocate to other agencies functions such as responding to mental health calls or monitoring safety in schools. Previous police brutality incidents have prompted calls for other sorts of reforms. For instance, a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/racial-bias-training-de-escalation-training-policing-in-america/">2019 CBS News Survey of 155 police agencies</a> found that almost 70 percent had implicit bias training with over half of those implemented after a white policeman shot and killed Black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Some 60 percent of those agencies said they did not have a way to measure the success or failure of such programs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Michael Brown memorial" class="wp-image-3089496" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/070820_SG_defundpolice_inline_3.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089496">A group gathers at a makeshift memorial in Ferguson, Mo., near the site where Black teenager Michael Brown was killed at the hands of a white police officer in August 2014. Brown’s death triggered a wave of police reforms, such as mandatory implicit bias training for police officers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089496">Gino’s Premium Images/Alamy</span></figure>



<p>“This year it’s defund; what is it going to be next year, five years from now?” says Renée Mitchell, a recently retired police sergeant with a Ph.D. in criminology. She’s also cofounder and president of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing. Police departments are “flinging out interventions and having no clue about the effects, positive or negative.”</p>



<p>Police research is complicated by the fact that researchers who conduct the sorts of studies needed to evaluate reforms and police officials often have different priorities. Why would a police chief work with an academic who is going to publish papers about the department’s problems that may also receive considerable press attention, asks Erin Kerrison, an empirical legal scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-research-faces-roadblocks-and-dearth-data">like some other areas of research</a> related to violence (<em>SN: 5/3/16</em>), money for policing research is relatively limited. Consider that the National Institutes of Health invested about $39 billion for medical research in 2019, while the National Institute of Justice awarded far less than 1 percent of that amount — just under $214 million — for research that same year.</p>



<p>Yet researchers and police officials largely agree that rapid response is necessary to meet the demands of the moment. What research does emerge following George Floyd’s death won’t start coming out for two years, Kerrison says. “There will have been a thousand more George Floyds at that point.”</p>



<h4>Needing to act</h4>



<p>Which is why, back at the University of Cincinnati Police Division, Engel needed to act, evidence or no evidence. So on the de-escalation front, she selected a program run by Washington, D.C.–based Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit police research and policy organization. She was familiar with the organization, and the content — which emphasized training officers to recognize and effectively communicate with civilians behaving erratically and either unarmed or armed with something other than a firearm — looked promising. Engel then used the program to begin building her own evidence to help fill gaps in the field.</p>



<p>Engel treated reforms at her small university police department of 74 sworn officers as pilot projects that she could then test at larger police departments around the country. In February 2019, she and a team of researchers were able to conduct a larger study of the de-escalation program, when the Louisville Metro Police Department in Kentucky used it to train its 1,250 officers.</p>

<p>Engel randomized the order in which officers in the nine Louisville precincts were trained. That way, officers in each untrained precinct served as a control until they too underwent training. One benefit of this setup, called a “stepped wedge trial,” is that it doesn’t relegate one block of individuals into a control group that goes without training for the duration of the study. Stepped wedge trials have been used in other settings, such as health care and education. Officers were evaluated before and immediately after the training, and again, four to six months after training. Observations will continue for up to 12 months, with the team looking for changes in police behavior, and frequency and severity around the use of force.</p>



<p>Initial results will be out later this summer, says Engel, who is conducting an analogous study of an implicit bias training program. Also piloted at the University of Cincinnati, the program was rolled out at the NYPD, New York City’s police department.</p>



<h4>Working together</h4>



<p>Engel stepped down from her role overseeing the University of Cincinnati Police Division in January 2019, but the experience changed her thinking about criminology research. Academics tend to be interested in the philosophical, such as why officers use force, she says. But arguably more important are those nitty-gritty questions about how use of force can be mitigated in real life and in real time.</p>



<p>One challenge to understanding what reforms work is convincing police departments to collaborate with researchers, says Kerrison. She and colleagues outlined <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15614263.2019.1657627?journalCode=gppr20">how academics can enter into ethical relationships with police departments</a> in an August 2019 paper in <em>Police Practice and Research</em>. Crucial to such partnerships are clearly stated goals from the get-go, or airtight memoranda of understanding. That way, all parties agree in advance on the sorts of findings that will be communicated to the public and in what fashion, and everybody commits to helping police operations throughout the study process.</p>



<p>For instance, police departments can mandate that researchers anonymize their community’s identity in publications. Kerrison herself can’t talk about her relationships with police departments she’s working with due to such agreements. “Everybody has got to have skin in the game,” she says.</p>



<p>Given the challenges with funding and creating such academic-police partnerships, sometimes the clearest path forward may be to train the police officers in how to do science, Mitchell says. At the American Society for Evidence-Based Policing, she and colleagues are launching a four-week training course in 2021 for police officers similar to one already available in the United Kingdom. “Nowhere have our police leaders been taught how to interpret data and how to interpret statistics and how to interpret a research article,” she says. With such training, police departments will be better positioned to collect and evaluate data on their own.</p>



<p>Mitchell likens the model to medicine, where, for example, it would be a breach of ethics for doctors to advise patients with cancer without knowing about relevant evidence-based treatments. “[Policing] should be held to the same standard as the medical field,” she says.</p>



<p>However such research comes about, without it, police responses to crises will default to the quickest solutions, Engel says. “That is a very dangerous position to be in.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-braided-quasi-particles-anyons">Physicists have ‘braided’ strange quasiparticles called anyons</a></h4>

<p>Physicists have captured their first clear glimpse of the tangled web woven by particles called anyons.</p>



<p>The observed effect, known as braiding, is the most striking evidence yet for the existence of anyons — a class of particle that can occur only in two dimensions. When anyons are braided, one anyon is looped around another, altering the anyons’ quantum states. That <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14115">braiding effect was spotted within a complex layer cake of materials</a>, researchers report in a paper posted June 25 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“It’s absolutely convincing,” says theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek of MIT, who coined the term “anyon” in the 1980s. Theoretical physicists have long thought that anyons exist, but “to see it in reality takes it to another level.”</p>



<p>Fundamental particles found in nature fall into one of two classes: fermions or bosons. Electrons, for example, are fermions, whereas photons, particles of light, are bosons. Anyons are a third class, but they wouldn’t appear as fundamental particles in our 3-D universe. “It’s not something you see in standard everyday life,” says physicist Michael Manfra of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., a coauthor of the study. But anyons can show up as disturbances within two-dimensional sheets of material. Technically “quasiparticles,” anyons are the result of collective movements of many electrons, which together behave like one particle.</p>





<p>A key way anyons differ from fermions and bosons is in how they braid. If you were to drag one boson or one fermion around another of its own kind, there would be no record of that looping. But for anyons, such braiding alters the particles’ wave function, the mathematical expression that describes the quantum state of the particles. The process inserts an additional factor, called a phase, into the wave function.</p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers created a device in which anyons traveled within a 2-D layer along a path that split into two. One path looped around other anyons at the device’s center — like a child playing duck, duck, goose with friends — while the other took a direct route. The  two paths were reunited, and the researchers measured the resulting electric current.</p>



<p>The extra phase acquired in the trek around the device would alter how the anyons interfere when the paths reunited and thereby affect the current. So the researchers tweaked the voltage and magnetic field on the device, which changed the number of anyons in the center of the loop — like duck, duck, goose with a larger or smaller group of playmates. As anyons were removed or added, that altered the phase, producing distinct jumps in the current.</p>



<p>Seeing the effect required a finely tuned stack of layered materials to screen out other effects that would overshadow the anyons. “It is definitely one of the more complex and complicated things that have been done in experimental physics,” says theoretical physicist Chetan Nayak of Microsoft Quantum and the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>



<p>Previous work had already revealed strong signs of anyons. For example, physicist Gwendal Fève and colleagues looked at what happened when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/collisions-reveal-new-evidence-anyon-quasiparticles-existence">quasiparticles collide with one another</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/20</em>). Together, the two studies make “a very, very robust proof of the existence of anyons,” says Fève, of the Laboratoire de Physique de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.</p>



<p>Like Fève’s work, the new study focuses on a subclass of quasiparticles called abelian anyons. While those quasiparticles have yet to find practical use, some physicists hope that related non-abelian anyons will be useful for building quantum computers that are more robust than today’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">error-prone machines</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>).</p>

<p>To estimate your dog’s age in human years, multiply the dog’s age by seven, right? Wrong.</p>



<p>A more accurate conversion isn’t so easy to do in your head: Multiply the natural logarithm of the dog’s age by 16, then add 31. Researchers report <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(20)30203-9">this new canine age formula</a> online July 2 in <em>Cell Systems</em><em>.</em></p>



<p>As animals get older, tiny chemical tags called methyl groups get added and removed from DNA. These changes track with different stages of growth and can be used to determine biological age. Scientists can even compare changes across species. In this case, the researchers compared the methylation states of 320 humans, ages 1 to 103 years, with those of 104 Labrador retrievers, ages 5 weeks to 16 years.</p>



<p>The relationship between human and dog years changes over time, the scientists found. Early in life, puppies develop much faster than humans, but as dogs get older, their aging curve begins to flatten. An 8-week-old puppy is roughly the same age as a 9-month-old human. A 1-year-old dog corresponds to around 31 human years, and a 4-year-old dog is closer to a 53-year-old human. The new equation also lines up the average life span of a Lab — 12 years — with the average 70-year human life span.</p>





<p>The study focused only on yellow Labrador retrievers. Since the life spans of other breeds vary, further studies are needed to find out the real age of every very good dog, the scientists say.</p>

<p>This graph shows how Labrador retriever ages correspond with human ones, based on a comparison between how small chemical tags on DNA change over time in both species. For example, a 1-year-old dog corresponds to around 31 human years (second dot from left), and a 4-year-old dog is closer to a 53-year-old human (third dot).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-americans-may-have-traveled-polynesia-800-years-ago">South Americans may have traveled to Polynesia 800 years ago</a></h4>

<p>More than 800 years ago, Indigenous people in South America traversed more than 7,000 kilometers of open sea to reach eastern Polynesia, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>There, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2">South Americans mated with Polynesian inhabitants</a> during the initial period of discovery and settlement of those remote islands, researchers say. Genetic analyses show that initial DNA swaps between the voyagers and people on a still-undetermined eastern Polynesian island were followed by the spread of the South American ancestry to other eastern Polynesian islands.</p>



<p>Eventually that ancestry spread as far east as Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, a team led by computational biologist Alexander Ioannidis and population geneticist Andrés Moreno-Estrada reports online July 8 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The study offers the first genetic glimpse of “a prehistoric event that left no conclusive trace, except for the one recorded in the DNA of those who had contact 800 years ago in one of the most remote places on Earth,” says Moreno-Estrada, of the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico.  </p>





<p>Ideas about how remote Polynesia came to be populated have long inspired scientific debate. Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl’s 1947 <em>Kon-Tiki</em> expedition tested his idea that South American seafarers settled the Pacific islands, including Rapa Nui, showing that it was possible to drift by wooden raft from about 129 kilometers off Peru’s coast to Polynesia. But most scholars at that time assumed Asians had voyaged east as early as around 3,500 years ago to relatively close-by western Polynesia, eventually populating eastern Polynesia by around 1,000 years ago without having any contacts with people from South America.</p>



<p>Computer simulations since have indicated that winds and currents would carry a vessel from northern South America to the Polynesian islands. But the idea of seafaring South Americans having an early role in the peopling of Polynesia hasn’t been widely accepted.</p>



<p>It’s unknown, for example, whether such groups in the Americas had seagoing vessels or the navigational skills needed to reach Polynesia, says anthropologist and population geneticist John Lindo of Emory University in Atlanta.</p>



<p>Ioannidis, of Stanford University, and Moreno-Estrada’s group searched for molecular markers of shared ancestry in DNA of 807 individuals from 17 island populations in Polynesia and 15 Indigenous groups from relatively near Central and South America’s Pacific coast. Genetic data included 166 Rapa Nui inhabitants and 188 individuals from other Pacific islands. All DNA came from present-day people except for samples from four individuals, each from a different site in the Americas. Those ancient individuals lived between around 500 and 7,400 years ago.</p>



<p>Comparisons of the length of DNA segments shared by Polynesians and Indigenous peoples from the Americas enabled calculations of when Indigenous American DNA was first introduced to Polynesian groups. Smaller DNA segments are assumed to represent older instances of mating across populations than longer segments due to the breakdown of shared segments in later generations.</p>



<p>DNA resembling that of Indigenous people now living in Colombia appeared on an island called Fatu Hiva in the southern Marquesas Islands by around 1150, probably the result of a single ancient contact, the researchers estimate. The South American ancestry reached three nearby sets of eastern Polynesian islands between roughly 1200 and 1230, followed by Rapa Nui in around 1380. The genetic data can’t establish which Polynesian islanders mated with the South Americans before spreading that ancestry elsewhere in the Pacific, only that evidence so far points to the southern Marquesas.</p>



<p>But other contact scenarios between Polynesians and South Americans exist. The new study provides genetic support for a scenario in which ancestors of Rapa Nui settlers traveled to South America and possibly returned with sweet potatoes, says archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University in New York. Those ancestors then could have carried that crop and South American DNA to a majority of eastern Polynesian islands, he says. Some scientists have previously suggested that Polynesians traveled to and from South America, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sweet-potatoes-might-have-arrived-polynesia-long-humans">bringing the sweet potato to eastern Polynesia</a> more than 800 years ago (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>) and possibly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-sea-poultry-may-have-reached-americas-polynesia">chickens to the Americas</a> more than 600 years ago (<em>SN: 6/5/07</em>).</p>



<p>Ancient Polynesians’ “tremendous navigation skills” would have made possible round trips to South America, Lindo agrees.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of archaeological remains and linguistic studies suggest that people reached Rapa Nui by around 1200, nearly 200 years before the newly estimated arrival of Polynesians with South American ancestry, archaeologist Paul Wallin writes in a commentary published with the new study. Trade and cultural exchanges may have connected Rapa Nui to South America before DNA did, suggests Wallin, of Uppsala University in Sweden.</p>



<p>Only a larger genetic study can resolve whether South Americans voyaged to Polynesia or vice versa, Moreno-Estrada says.</p>

Unsurprisingly, then, they have all kinds of strategies for deciding whom to trust — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/11/kids-like-learning-from-confident-adults-but-only-if-their-confidence-is-justified/">only learning from confident adults if that confidence has proven to be justified</a>, for example, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/08/young-children-trust-kindness-over-expertise/">showing more trust in claims made by nice people</a>.</p>
<p>However, our world is increasingly filled with technological devices designed to impart information, and<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/jeductechsoci.19.2.148.pdf?seq=1"> educational robots</a> are being used to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f3cbfada-668e-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614">teach children</a> languages, maths, science, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-08-robot-teachers-invade-chinese-kindergartens.html">and more</a>. As Kimberly Brink and Henry Wellman at the University of Michigan write in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-36380-001">new paper</a>, published in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>: “The rapid expansion of robot ‘instructors’ makes it increasingly important to investigate whether and when robots effectively transmit information to children.”</p>
<p>The pair reports on just such an investigation on pre-schoolers, with some fascinating results: to learn well from a robot, it seems that a child has to believe that it has some key human-like attributes. Without these, even a device that reliably gives accurate information is not trusted.</p>
<p><span id="more-39890"></span>For the first of two studies, Brink and Wellman recruited 60 three-year-olds. The children watched videos featuring two small humanoid ‘<a href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/nao">Nao</a>’ robots and a woman who sat between them and interacted with them. These robots have limbs, moveable heads, eyes and a nose. In this experiment, they differed physically only in colour — one was purple, and the other orange.</p>
<p>In the first video, one robot correctly answered the woman when she asked about the names of some familiar objects, including a hairbrush and a teddy bear. The other robot got all the names wrong. (The colour of the accurate vs inaccurate robot was varied across the trials.)</p>
<p>Next came a video featuring images of unfamiliar objects (including blobby plastic objects). A researcher asked the child which robot they would ask for help to learn the names of these objects, and their answers were noted. Each of the robots then provided a made-up answer (one said “gobi”, for example, while the other said “danu”), and the child indicated which name they thought was right.</p>
<p>The children were then asked about the extent to which they thought these robots had psychological agency — whether, and how much, they could choose to move and think for themselves, for example. They were also asked about perceptual experiences — how much they thought the robots could feel pain, for instance, or feel scared.</p>
<p>Brink and Wellman found that children did indeed prefer to learn from the robot that had shown itself to be accurate, over the inaccurate robot. And, interestingly, children who more strongly attributed the ability to think and make decisions to these robots were more likely to favour the accurate robot. “These findings support the hypothesis that children are increasingly likely to treat social robots similarly to human teachers and monitor the robot’s accuracy when those robots engender perceptions of agency,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>This conclusion was supported by the findings of the second study, which involved a fresh group of 47 three-year-olds. The study was the same as the first, except that instead of the two robots, the children saw two faceless blobs, described to them as “machines” (they looked a bit like plastic sea urchins), which did not interact with the woman. Instead, a hand came into view to pull a string to “activate their voice” (in fact, the same robotic voice as in the first study).</p>
<p>This time, the results were very different. While the children recognised that one machine was accurate in its initial responses, and the other was not, they did not go on consistently to trust the accurate one. And this time, whether a child inferred more or less agency made no difference to which robot they plumped for.</p>
<p>The findings are interesting for all sorts of reasons. First, it seems that young children do trust — and mistrust — humanoid robots in the same way as people. But clearly, their opinions about the mental capacities of the information-giver are important for this. “At the least, psychological agency seems to be a critical factor in determining whether young children trust the testimony of social robots and may well be important more generally,” the researchers observe.</p>
<p>Educational devices range from humanoid robots to disembodied voices — like Apple’s Siri. More work is now needed to establish just how much — or little — psychological agency has to be inferred by a young child for it to trust a machine in the way it does a human informant. It may well also be the case that older children react differently, of course. Only further work will tell.</p>
<p>Still, as the researchers write, the findings certainly do imply that when designing educational robots for young children, designers should bear in mind the impact of cues that suggest psychological agency. For this age group at least, evidence of accuracy alone is not enough.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xray-map-sky-erosita-telescope-milky-way">This is the most comprehensive X-ray map of the sky ever made</a></h4>

<p>A new map of the entire sky, as seen in X-rays, looks deeper into space than any other of its kind.</p>



<p>The map, released June 19, is based on data from the first full scan of the sky made by the eROSITA X-ray telescope onboard the Russian-German SRG spacecraft, which launched in July 2019. The six-month, all-sky survey, which began in December and wrapped up in June, is only the first of eight total sky surveys that eROSITA will perform over the next few years. But this sweep alone cataloged some 1.1 million X-ray sources across the cosmos — just about doubling the number of known X-ray emitters in the universe.</p>



<p>These hot and energetic objects include Milky Way stars and supermassive black holes at the centers of other galaxies, some of which are billions of light-years away and date back to when the universe was just one-tenth of its current age.</p>



<p>eROSITA’s new map reveals objects about four times as faint as could be seen in the last survey of the whole X-ray sky, conducted by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/glitches-bump-rosat-fast-track">ROSAT space telescope</a> in the 1990s (<em>SN: 6/29/91</em>). The new images “are just spectacular to look at,” says Harvey Tananbaum, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., not involved in the mission. “You have this tremendous capability of looking at the near and the far … and then, of course, delving in detail to the parts of the images that you’re most interested in.”</p>

<h3>Mapping the sky in X-rays</h3>



<p>In this map of X-rays emitted by celestial objects across the sky, X-rays are color-coded by energy: Blue signifies the highest energies, followed by green, yellow and red. The red foreground glow comes from hot gas near the solar system, whereas the Milky Way plane appears blue, because gas and dust in the disk absorb all but the most energetic X-rays. The map includes many of the Milky Way’s supernova remnants, including Cassiopeia A and Vela, and a star system called Scorpius X-1, which was the first X-ray source discovered beyond the sun. It also showcases the Milky Way’s star-forming regions, such as the Orion Nebula and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chasing-cosmic-engine">Cygnus Superbubble</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/12</em>), and a mysterious arc of X-rays called the North Polar Spur. Beyond the Milky Way are nearby galaxies, such as the Large Magellanic Cloud, and distant galaxy clusters, such as those contained in the Shapley Supercluster. </p>

<p> eROSITA can flag potentially interesting X-ray phenomena, such as flares from stars getting shredded by black holes, which other telescopes with narrower fields of view but better vision can then investigate in detail, Tananbaum says. The new map also allows astronomers to probe enigmatic X-ray features, such as a giant arc of radiation above the plane of the Milky Way called the North Polar Spur.</p>



<p>This X-ray feature may be left over from a nearby supernova explosion, or it might be related to the huge blobs of gas on either side of the Milky Way disk, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-giant-gas-fermi-bubbles-seen-visible-light-first-time">Fermi Bubbles</a>, says eROSITA team member Peter Predehl, an X-ray astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany (<em>SN:6/8/20</em>). eROSITA observations could help the Russian and German teams involved in the mission figure out what the spur is.</p>



<p>About 20 percent of the marks on eROSITA’s map are stars in the Milky Way with intense magnetic fields and hot coronae. Scattered among these are star systems containing neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs, and remnants of supernova explosions. eROSITA also caught several fleeting bursts from events like stellar collisions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Vela" class="wp-image-3089124" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/062420_mt_scivis-xray_inline2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089124">A supernova remnant called Vela (center, reddish green) is one of the most prominent X-ray sources in the sky. The supernova exploded about 12,000 years ago, about 800 light-years away, and overlaps with two other known supernova remnants: Vela Junior (faint purple ring at bottom left) and Puppis A (blue cloud at top right). All three explosions left behind neutron stars, but only the stars at the centers of Vela and Vela Junior are visible to eROSITA.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089124">Peter Predehl and Werner Becker/MPE, Davide Mella</span></figure>



<p>Beyond the Milky Way, most of the X-ray emitters that eROSITA found are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-plasma-jets-are-shaped-like-bell-bottoms">supermassive black holes gobbling up matter</a> at the centers of other galaxies (<em>SN: 6/18/20</em>). Such active galactic nuclei comprise 77 percent of the catalog.</p>



<p>Distant clusters of galaxies made up another 2 percent of eROSITA’s haul. These clusters were visible to the telescope thanks to the piping hot gas that fills the space between galaxies in each cluster, which emits an X-ray glow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Shapley Supercluster" class="wp-image-3089123" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/062420_mt_scivis-xray_inline3.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089123">The Shapley Supercluster (pictured at right) is composed of many smaller clumps of galaxies about 650 million light-years away.

Zoomed-in images on the left showcase a few of the most massive clusters in the bunch.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089123">Esra Bulbul and Jeremy Sanders/MPE</span></figure>



<p>“At present, we probably know about a little less than 8,000 clusters of galaxies,” says Craig Sarazin, an astronomer at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville not involved in the work. But over its four-year mission, eROSITA is expected to find a total of 50,000 to 100,000 clusters. In the first sweep alone, it picked up about 20,000.</p>



<p>That census could give astronomers a much better sense of the sizes and distributions of galaxy clusters over cosmic history, Sarazin says. And this, in turn, may give new insight into features of the universe that govern cluster formation and evolution. That includes the precise amount of invisible, gravitationally binding dark matter out there, and how fast the universe is expanding.</p>

<p>Closer to home, observations of supernova remnants could help clear up some confusion about the life cycles of big stars, says eROSITA team member Andrea Merloni, an astronomer also at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. Past X-ray surveys have found fewer supernova remnants than theorists expect to see, based on how many massive stars they think have blown up over the course of the galaxy’s history. But eROSITA observations are now revealing plumes of debris that could be previously overlooked stellar graves. “Maybe we’ll start balancing this budget between the expected number of supernovae and the ones that we are detecting,” Merloni says.</p>



<p>eROSITA is now beginning its second six-month, all-sky survey. When combined, the telescope’s eight total maps will be able to reveal objects one-fifth as bright as those that could be seen on a single map. That not only allows astronomers to see more X-ray sources in more detail, but track how objects in the X-ray sky are changing over time.</p>

<p>The scientific debate over evidence that the coronavirus can float in the air for extended periods of time is intensifying.</p>



<p>The World Health Organization has repeatedly downplayed the importance of such airborne transmission, instead emphasizing, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations">with substantial evidence</a>, the risks of close contact with infected people. </p>



<p>But now, over 200 experts have signed an open letter to the WHO saying <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798?searchresult=1">it’s time to recognize evidence that the coronavirus is airborne</a>. The letter, published July 6 in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>, argues that the public health institution must update its prevention recommendations to help people avoid those risks. </p>



<p>“We acknowledge that there is emerging evidence in this field,” Benedetta Allegranzi, coordinator of WHO’s global infection prevention unit said July 7 in a <a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Femergencies%2Fdiseases%2Fnovel-coronavirus-2019" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">news conference</a>. “We have to be open to this evidence and understand its implications regarding the modes of transmission and also regarding the precautions that need to be taken.” The WHO plans to issue updated guidelines in the coming days</p>





<p>Here’s what you need to know about the ongoing debate and what it means for fighting the spread of COVID-19.</p>



<h4>What is airborne transmission?</h4>



<p>At the beginning of the outbreak, scientists thought that the virus was spread largely through bits of spit or mucus that people coughed or sneezed. Those droplets, up to roughly a millimeter across, would fall from the air within a short amount of time. The WHO has long maintained that the coronavirus spreads primarily via these larger droplets, which don’t easily travel farther than about six feet.</p>

<p>But researchers increasingly think that the coronavirus can stay in the air longer and travel farther in tinier bits, called aerosols, that can be generated by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-breathing-talking-enough-spread-airborne">people talking, breathing</a> or singing (<em>SN:4/2/20</em>).</p>



<p>These aerosols, which are less than 5 microns in diameter, can linger in the air for extended periods in places without ventilation, possibly infecting people long after the infected person has left.</p>



<h4>What’s the evidence the virus is airborne?</h4>



<p>Laboratory studies have found that infectious coronavirus can <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973">persist in the air for at least three hours when artificially aerosolized</a>, though these results are hard to translate to real-world conditions. But evidence from “superspreader” events also point to airborne transmission. For example, a single infected person at a choir practice in Mount Vernon, Wash., infected at least 45 other people, many of whom were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-6-feet-may-not-be-enough-social-distance">farther than six feet from the sick singer</a> (<em>SN: 4/17/20</em>). </p>



<p>And one of the first outbreaks in Guangzhou, China was linked to a single positive case <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">eating at a restaurant</a> on January 24 (<em>SN: 6/18/20</em>). That person infected nine others that night, and an analysis of airflow patterns suggests that viruses were <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article">propelled as far as 20 feet by an air conditioning unit</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists are still working out whether airborne transmission is a common feature of COVID-19’s spread, but evidence suggests it does happen.</p>



<h4>Why does it matter?</h4>



<p>The mode of transmission informs prevention strategies. The WHO has continually emphasized the importance of social distancing and handwashing to fight the spread of COVID-19. While still important, these measures are insufficient against an airborne virus, which can travel far in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces. Masks may be necessary in such situations, even with proper social distancing. </p>



<p>The authors of the open letter implore the WHO to consider updating its recommendations to possibly include avoiding overcrowding in public buildings, properly ventilating indoor spaces and introducing germicidal ultraviolet light to air filtration systems to help mitigate airborne transmission. Even a simple open window might create enough ventilation to prevent an airborne coronavirus from infecting a new host.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-particle-cern-tetraquark-first-four-same-kind-quark">This is the first known particle with four of the same kind of quark</a></h4>

<p>In a never-before-seen particle, four quarks of a feather flock together.</p>



<p>Physicists think they have detected the first conglomerate of four quarks incorporating more than two of the same kind. This tetraquark contains <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16957">four quarks of the charm variety</a>: two charm quarks and their antimatter counterparts, called anticharm quarks, researchers report online at arXiv.org on June 30.</p>



<p>Quarks — fundamental building blocks of matter — typically make up three-quark particles, like protons and neutrons, or quark-antiquark pairs, like pions and kaons. Physicists have observed some more exotic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exotic-particle-packs-foursome-quarks">quark quartets</a> (<em>SN: 4/11/14</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lhc-reports-pentaquark-sightings">even quintets</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/15</em>). But the new four-quark particle, dubbed X(6900), is the first four-quark particle with all of the same type. Since charm quarks and their anticharm counterparts are among the heaviest types of quarks, it is also the first tetraquark to include more than two heavy quarks.</p>



<p>“It’s a pretty exciting finding,” says physicist Matthew Shepherd of Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>





<p>Quarks are bound together by the strong force. Discovering new, exotic quark arrangements “tells us something about the types of patterns of quarks that the strong interaction generates, which tells us something about the strong interaction,” Shepherd says. A deeper knowledge of that fundamental force of nature could give insight not only into quirky particles like X(6900) but also common quark-based particles, like the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei.</p>



<p>Evidence of the new tetraquark was lurking in data collected from 2009 to 2018 at the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva. In these experiments, physicists used the LHC to smash protons together and observe the particles forged in the collisions.</p>



<p>The LHC data contained signatures of a particle with the mass expected for a quartet of charm quarks: around 6,900 million electron volts. That particle decayed into two J/psi particles, each containing a charm and an anticharm quark, suggesting it was originally a tetraquark with two charm and two anticharm quarks. Like other known tetraquarks, X(6900) could be either a single entity, composed of four quarks all tightly bundled together, or a pair of two-quark particles that are more loosely bound — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-figured-out-how-pentaquarks-are-built">like a set of atoms in a molecule</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/19</em>).</p>



<p>“We need to do many kinds of checks to confirm that it’s really there,” says study coauthor Liupan An, a particle physicist at the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Florence. Those checks could include collecting more data with the LHC or seeing if other particle collision experiments produce similar results.</p>



<p>Assuming that the evidence for this exotic quark cluster holds up, the strange new particle offers “a sort of stress tester” for ideas about how quarks construct matter, says study coauthor Chris Parkes, a physicist at the University of Manchester in England. He compares using this tetraquark for studying particle physics to biologists looking at extremophile creatures, like tardigrades, to understand the limits of biology — or to astronomers using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-orbiting-milky-way-giant-black-hole-confirms-einstein-was-right">black holes to see whether theories about gravity hold up</a> in such intense environments (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>).</p>



<p>It may be easier to study quark interactions in X(6900) than its other four-quark relatives, which contain lighter quarks, Shepherd says. That’s because it’s notoriously challenging to accurately predict the complex, fast-moving behavior of light quarks. When it comes to the four heavy quarks in X(6900), on the other hand, physicists could potentially build simpler models to predict quark behavior.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><img alt="Rules of Contagion cover" class="wp-image-3089421" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/062020_reviews_cover-120x186.jpg" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38ucbOy">The Rules of Contagion</a><br /><em>Adam Kucharski</em><br /><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>Epidemiologists like to say, “If you’ve seen one pandemic, you’ve seen … one pandemic.” But behind each outbreak lie core principles that help explain why the outbreak began, why it grew, why it peaked when it did and why it ended. In <em>The Rules of Contagion</em>, mathematician and epidemiologist Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine outlines those principles and shows how they apply beyond infectious disease, to the spread of ideas, financial crises, violence and more. </p>



<p>Kucharski hardly mentions the novel coronavirus sweeping the globe. He was just wrapping up final edits when the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, China. But the book still feels extraordinarily prescient. Kucharski provides context for readers to understand the current pandemic, as well as a framework for thinking about other types of contagious spread. <em>Science News</em> spoke with Kucharski about the principles of contagion, disease modeling and misinformation. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em>Your book looks at the principles of contagion and how they apply beyond infectious diseases. Why is it useful to transport those ideas to other fields?</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Kucharski</strong></em>: I’ve noticed that the same mistakes get made repeatedly across fields. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, a lot of people realized that the network structure between banks and loans and exposure to risk was very similar to a lot of the network features that caused problems with sexually transmitted infections in the 1970s and ’80s. If there are a lot of “loops” in the network, with people connected to each other in multiple ways, it makes it harder to stop the spread. If the network is structured so that highly connected individuals are disproportionately linked to less-connected individuals, it can result in an outbreak that spreads slower at first, but eventually reaches more of the network. Pre-2008, the financial network had both of these features.</p>



<p>It’s also important to understand the underlying network. When looking at violence, it might be tempting to think the events are random, but there is often a series of connections that link them, and targeting these links with interventions can help prevent future incidents.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN: </em>You write that we need to separate the features that are specific to a particular outbreak from the underlying principles that drive contagion. What are those principles?</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Kucharski</strong></em>: There are four factors that are worth bearing in mind. The first one is duration — how long people are infectious for. The second is what people do while they’re infectious: the opportunities for contagion. Another feature is what I call the transmission probability — the chance something actually gets across during an interaction. Then the final important one is susceptibility. If you have the virus or if you try to spread an idea, what is the chance that someone is susceptible?</p>



<p><em><strong>S</strong></em><strong><em>N: </em>Modeling, which is the focus of your book, has played an important role in the coronavirus response. But models aren’t perfect. How do we prevent inaccurate predictions from eroding people’s confidence in modeling?</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Kucharski</strong></em>: It helps to get away from the idea that all models are trying to make an exact forecast of what will happen in a month’s time or two months’ time. I see models as a way of clarifying our thinking about how the process works. Every time you see someone in the media claiming they have a solution to COVID, they are implicitly relying on a model. They might not outline what that model is, but they are making assumptions about how transmission functions, and they’re making assumptions about how their proposed measure will influence transmission. The advantage of a model is it lays out those steps very clearly, and it means that people can criticize them.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN: </em>After the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the spread of misinformation gained a lot of attention. How have social media platforms tried to combat this in response to COVID-19? </strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Kucharski</strong></em>: We’ve seen some quite dramatic changes in terms of what’s being limited. A few years ago, the focus was on attempting to remove all the harmful content. The problem with trying to reactively remove all harmful content is that online outbreaks spread so quickly — it’s difficult to keep up with transmission. A more effective approach may be to reduce susceptibility. We’re seeing a lot more focus on preemptive messaging. If you type COVID into a search bar on most tech platforms, you will have a huge amount of credible information before you find anything that might lead you down some sort of rabbit warren into unreliable information. This is one of the first times that we’ve really seen that level of blanket preempting across multiple platforms — Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.</p>



<p><em><strong>SN: </strong></em><strong>Technologies like contact tracing apps could help curb the spread of coronavirus, but they also raise privacy concerns. How do we strike a balance?</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>Kucharski</strong></em>: If you look at countries in Asia that have been very good at contact tracing, often the surveillance data is far more detailed. In Korea, they have access to people’s credit card transactions, to their cell phone locations. We haven’t seen anything near that scale in Europe or the U.S. If we’re talking about learning from these countries, we have to look at what they’ve done and then decide what elements of that we do or don’t want to introduce. Do you want to give up more data in the possibility that disease control could work better and you could get back to elements of normality quicker, or do you want to protect privacy with the knowledge that it may mean that we’d need some additional physical distancing in place? We need to have a really frank public discussion about what we think of appropriate trade-offs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-ethical-issues">How making a COVID-19 vaccine confronts thorny ethical issues</a></h4>

<p>Ethical concerns abound in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. How do we ethically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-human-challenge-trial-infect-people-vaccine">test it in people</a>? Can people be forced to get the vaccine if they don’t want it? Who should get it first?</p>



<p>Tackling those questions demands that a vaccine exist. But a slew of other ethical questions arise long before anything is loaded into a syringe. In particular, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/abortion-opponents-protest-covid-19-vaccines-use-fetal-cells">some Catholic leaders</a> in the United States and Canada are concerned about COVID-19 vaccine candidates made using cells derived from human fetuses aborted electively in the 1970s and 1980s. The group wrote a <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Letter-to-FDA-urging-ethical-COVID-vaccines.April%2017%202020.pdf">letter</a> to the commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April, expressing concern that several vaccines involving these cell lines were selected for <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/06/16/fact-sheet-explaining-operation-warp-speed.html">Operation Warp Speed</a> — a multibillion-dollar U.S. government partnership aimed at delivering a COVID-19 vaccine by January 2021.</p>

<p>The group urged the FDA to instead provide incentives for COVID-19 vaccines that do not use fetal cell lines. But, as virologist Angela Rasmussen of Columbia University pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1270059290582081539">on Twitter</a>, those other vaccines are being developed with scientific input from research using HeLA cells — which come with their own thorny ethical issues of consent.</p>





<p>Here’s how scientists and bioethicists are thinking about the cell lines they use as they develop COVID-19 vaccines.</p>



<h4>What are cell lines, and what is their connection to vaccine research and development?</h4>



<p>Cell lines are cultures of human or other animal cells that can be grown for long periods of time in the lab. Some of these cultures are known as immortalized cell lines because the cells never stop dividing. Most cells can’t perform this trick — they eventually stop splitting and die. Immortal cell lines have cheated death. Some are more than 50 years old.</p>



<p>Cell lines can be manipulated to become immortal. Or sometimes, immortality arises by chance. “Whenever people make primary cell cultures from different organs of different animals, every so often you just get … lucky, and some cultures just won’t die,” explains Matthew Koci, a viral immunologist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Such long-lasting cell lines go on to get studied, and studied some more. Some end up being used in labs around the world.</p>



<p>Immortalized cell lines are crucial for many different types of biomedical research, not just vaccines. They’ve been used to study diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer’s and much more. Some are human cells, but many also come from animal models. For example, many COVID-19 studies — beyond just those related to vaccines — are using Vero cells, a cell line derived from the kidney of an African green monkey, Rasmussen says.</p>



<p>Two common immortalized cell lines go by the monikers HEK-293 and HeLa. HEK-293 is a cell line isolated from a human embryo that was electively aborted in the Netherlands in 1973. Catholic leaders and other antiabortion groups have objected to the use of HEK-293 in the development of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Cells derived from elective abortions, including HEK-293, have been used to develop vaccines, including rubella, hepatitis A, chickenpox and more. Other fetal cell lines, such as the proprietary cell line PER.C6, are also used in vaccine development, including for COVID-19.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="microscope image of HEK-293 cells" class="wp-image-3089388" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/063020_bb_vaccine-explainer_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089388">These are HEK-293 cells, isolated from a human embryonic kidney sample in 1973.

Genes inserted into the cells then made them immortal, meaning they are able to divide forever.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089388">GerMan101/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figure>



<p>HeLa cells are named after Henrietta Lacks, a Black tobacco farmer and mother of five from Virginia who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. That cell line comes from a sample taken from her cervix by researchers at Johns Hopkins University when she was undergoing treatment there. These cells have been used in development of vaccines including the polio and human papilloma virus, or HPV, vaccines. They’ve even contributed to our understanding of the human genome.</p>



<h4>Are human immortalized cell lines necessary to make COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p>More than 125 candidate vaccines against COVID-19 are under development around the world. As of July 2, 14 were in human trials.</p>



<p>Those vaccines can be divided into a few different types. Some, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people">RNA vaccines</a> made by companies like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-moderna-vaccine-immune-response-people">Moderna</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/20</em>), do not require a live cell, and thus, no cell line. But other types do require live cells during their production. That includes candidates that use the old-school method for developing vaccines: attenuation. This is “what Pasteur did” when he made the first vaccines against anthrax and rabies, explains Mark Davis, a virologist at Stanford University. “You grow a virus,” and over time the virus loses potency. “It’s still alive, but for some reason, it typically loses its more dramatic clinical effects.”</p>

<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>In another type of vaccine under development called viral-vector, the viral genes to produce immunity to the coronavirus are placed in another, harmless virus. That new combined virus is then grown in cells.</p>



<p>In vaccine development in general, “if we’ve got a virus that has to go through its life cycle, that happens in cell lines,” Koci says.</p>



<p>Many current vaccines, such as those for influenza, hepatitis B and HPV, are grown in nonhuman cell lines and even chicken eggs, bacteria or yeast. But human cell lines are especially useful when working with a new virus, Koci explains. “We don’t know what’s really important” yet in how the coronavirus replicates, he says. There’s no guarantee that a nonhuman cell line will work immediately. Over a few years of work, Koci says, a COVID-19 vaccine might be developed that could be grown in yeast or chicken eggs. But we don’t have years. “We want to make [the system] look as [much like] a human cell as we can.”</p>



<p>This is where immortal cell lines come in.</p>



<p>HEK-293 cells, for example, are especially useful for vaccine work, Rasmussen explains. It’s easy to put new viral genes in them, she says, and once they have the genes inside, HEK-293 cells can pump out large amounts of viral protein — exactly what’s needed to help people develop an immune response.</p>



<p>HeLa are also relatively easy to work with. They can be used to analyze how the coronavirus enters cells to hijack their machinery, for example. “It’s great to have them in the arsenal,” Rasmussen says. But, she says, it’s important to “think about their origins.”</p>



<h4>What are some of the moral or ethical issues associated with cell lines such as HEK-293 and HeLa?</h4>



<p>No matter what cell line is used, ethical questions will need to be answered. Cell lines derived from animals have all the ethical complications associated with animal research. But in the case of fetal cells, some anti-abortion groups are opposed to using anything that involves fetal cell lines anywhere in its development. The basis for the objection comes down to the idea that if you use anything derived from an abortion, you are in some small way complicit in the abortion itself.</p>



<p>Fetal cell lines have been widely used in basic science and clinical medicine for decades, says Nicholas Evans, a bioethicist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “Chances are if you have had a medical intervention in this country or pretty much any other country, you have benefited from the use of these cell lines in some way.”</p>



<p>Catholics got <a href="https://www.immunize.org/talking-about-vaccines/vaticandocument.htm">permission in 2005</a> and <a href="https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/03/vaticans-academy-for-life-encourages-parents-to-vaccinate-children/">2017</a> from the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life to get vaccines that use historical fetal cell lines, if no alternatives are available. “The reason is that the risk to public health, if one chooses not to vaccinate, outweighs the legitimate concerns about the origins of the vaccine,” Evans explains. Of course, many people who are anti-abortion are not Catholic, and not all Catholics agree.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img alt="Henrietta Lacks" class="wp-image-3089390" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/063020_bb_vaccine-explainer_inline2_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089390">Henrietta Lacks (pictured) had cancer cells taken from her cervix in the early 1950s.

<p>In the case of HeLa cells, the ethical problems began the day the cells were taken from Lacks, who was never told that her cells might be used for experimentation. “There was no informed consent. She wasn’t aware, and her family wasn’t aware,” says Yolonda Wilson, a bioethicist at Howard University in Washington, D.C. “The use of this Black woman’s body has I think contributed to a kind of cultural memory of mistrusting health institutions among Black folks,” she says. “It’s not this one-off … it’s a larger narrative of disrespecting Black patients, using Black people and Black bodies in experiments.”</p>



<p>In 2010, science writer Rebecca Skloot wrote<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-immortal-life-henrietta-lacks-rebecca-skloot"> a book</a> about Lacks’ story. Since then, Wilson says, “Johns Hopkins University, at least, seems to recognize the ethical issues involved and [is] taking steps to repair some of the damage that has been done.” The university has <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henriettalacks/honoring-henrietta-lacks.html">worked closely</a> with members of Lacks’ family to create scholarships, awards and symposiums about medical ethics. The university will also be constructing a building to be named in Lacks’ honor. But Wilson notes that damage still remains in the broader Black community.</p>



<h4>How should those ethical issues be taken into account in COVID-19 vaccine development?</h4>



<p>There’s no avoiding immortal cell lines. “Certainly I would expect they would be involved in some of the work, directly or not” in any vaccine that comes out, Rasmussen says. Even though HeLa cells or HEK-293 cells might not be used in the production of a particular COVID-19 vaccine, they are being used as scientists work to understand the virus. Some knowledge gained from those cell lines will go into a vaccine, at the very least.    </p>



<p>But for HeLa cells in particular, Wilson says, there’s an opportunity for restorative justice. Given the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">disproportionate effects</a> of the virus among Black people in the United States due to underlying health conditions and jobs that may expose them more to the virus (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>), “special effort should be made to ensure that Black people are vaccinated once we know that this is safe,” she says. Latino people have been similarly hard-hit by COVID-19. </p>



<p>Wilson also notes that it’s an opportunity to help researchers think more about the history and context of their work. “It’s important not to act as though the science that happens is divorced from the communities in which it happens.”</p>



<p>The world is waiting anxiously for a COVID-19 vaccine. But as work to make a vaccine goes on, scientists need to think about the materials they use and why, Rasmussen says. “I think probably more [scientists] think about HeLa cells in this way,” she explains. “Many of us have read Skloot’s excellent book.” But that doesn’t mean that scientists could, or should, stop using HeLa cells entirely. In the end, she says, “you’re going to use the cell type that’s right for the experiment.”</p>



<p>Wilson agrees. Ethical considerations are not about weighing an ethical approach against the need to save lives. “That’s false framing,” she says. “It’s not: Be ethical or save lives. Ethics should guide us in thinking how to save lives.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>As the reality of the coronavirus pandemic set in in March, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">we looked at</a> the work of psychologists attempting to understand how the crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. A few months later, and <a href="https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research">hundreds of studies</a> have been conducted or are in progress, examining everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the characteristics that make people more likely to obey lockdown measures.</p>
<p>However, some researchers have raised alarm. They’re worried that many of these rapid new studies are falling prey to methodological issues which could lead to false results and misleading advice. Of course, these aren’t new problems: the pandemic comes at the end of a decade in which the field’s methodological crises have really been thrust under the spotlight. But is the coronavirus pandemic causing researchers to fall back on bad habits — or could it lead to positive change for the field?<span id="more-39882"></span></p>
<h3><strong>A methodological crisis…</strong></h3>
<p>The past decade has been a turbulent one for psychology. Researchers have come to realise that a lot of psychological research rests on rather shaky foundations.  A pivotal 2015 study, for instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">attempted to replicate the findings of 100 psychology studies</a> published in three influential journals, finding a significant effect for just 36 of the 97 studies that had originally found a positive outcome. Other replication attempts have cast doubt on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">well-known findings</a> that appear in many introductory textbooks.</p>
<p>And it’s not all about reproducibility: even when findings do hold up, they don’t necessarily <em>generalise</em> beyond the narrow group in which they were found. Most work focuses on participants who are Western and Educated and come from Industrialised, Rich and Democratic countries — an issue that has become known as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/">psychology’s WEIRD problem</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this will be news if you follow psychology research (or read this blog). And things have <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/17/we-are-witnessing-a-renaissance-in-psychology/">undoubtedly improved</a>. Researchers are more aware than ever of the underlying causes of these problems. Increasingly, they are pre-registering their studies so that their methods and hypotheses are out in the open before they even begin collecting their data. Replication studies abound, weeding out those findings that fail to replicate. Large collaborations are popping up to study psychological phenomena with huge numbers of participants across multiple countries.</p>
<h3><strong>.. meets a health crisis</strong></h3>
<p>Enter the COVID-19 pandemic. On the surface, psychology seems like it should have a lot to contribute in a crisis whose management relies on getting people to act in certain ways. But many researchers point out that the methodological issues that have come to the fore in the past ten years are all the more serious when it comes to an actual health emergency.</p>
<p>Some critics say that evidence from past psychological research is simply too flawed or opaque to inform decisions that involve life-or-death situations — an argument perhaps best exemplified by a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/whds4/">recent preprint</a> from Hans IJzerman from Université Grenoble Alpes and colleagues, which questions whether psychology is really “crisis ready”. The team explicitly call out the lack of generalisability and reproducibility in past work. How can we be sure that studies based on small, “WEIRD” pools of participants in very specific circumstances apply to a broad population in the midst of a crisis? Andrew Przybylski, Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute and co-first-author on that preprint, likens the situation to “a high stakes version of Groundhog Day”. Just because we’re trying to figure out how to respond to a crisis doesn’t mean that all of those issues that have come to light in the past ten years have just gone away, he says.</p>
<p>Of course, others have expressed more optimism about the role of psychology. This preprint was partly a reaction to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z.pdf">review published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>, in which Jay Van Bavel and colleagues outlined the ways that psychology <em>could</em> support the response to the coronavirus pandemic. While acknowledging that evidence is limited, the team make a number of suggestions based on past work, such as taking into account that people have an “optimism bias”, believing bad things are more likely to happen to others than themselves. And over at <em>The Psychologist,</em> you can read <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/april-2020/coronavirus-psychological-perspectives">dozens of perspectives</a> from psychologists about how the field can help right now. Still, the debate about whether or not the field is “crisis ready” continues.</p>
<h3><strong>Letting our guard down</strong></h3>
<p>And for many, that sense of repeating past mistakes also permeates much of the rapid research that psychologists have produced since the crisis began. Writing at <em>The 100% CI</em> in late March, Anne Scheel from Eindhoven University of Technology <a href="http://www.the100.ci/2020/03/26/crisis-research-fast-and-slow/">expressed worries</a> that new studies attempting to understand the pandemic are being rushed out with major flaws: they may have a small number of participants and be underpowered, for instance. And there’s still the question of generalisability. Yes, these studies are being conducted in the context of the pandemic so are at least more relevant to the current situation. But they’re still conducted in an artificial environment — usually online —  and often consist of surveys that may not tap into how people think or behave in their daily life. And that WEIRD problem is not going anywhere.</p>
<p>In other words, in “crisis mode”, researchers may be falling for the same old pitfalls that psychology has been trying to move on from in the past decade. “[I]t feels as if we’ve put our guard <em>down</em> rather than up,” Scheel writes.  Three months after typing those words, does she feel like things have improved? “My long-story-short answer would be: I’ve rarely felt so grimly vindicated,” says Scheel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new scales to tap into attitudes and behaviours related to coronavirus have cropped up — but here too many researchers have expressed scepticism about the assumptions and methodologies used to develop these. Take the “Fear of COVID-19 Scale”, for instance, a seven-item scale that has already been translated into many languages and which asks questions like “I cannot sleep because I am worried about getting coronavirus-19”. The implication is that higher scores on the scale are bad; indeed, the authors write that the scale will “be useful in providing valuable information on fear of COVID-19 so as to facilitate public health initiatives on allaying public’s fears”.</p>
<p>But another group found that people who scored higher on the scale were <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jkfu3/">more likely to practise positive public health behaviours</a> like social distancing. They suggest that rather than measuring some pathological “fear”, the scale may actually be tapping into adaptive negative emotions that help us respond to dangerous situations. Again, concerns about the validity of measures aren’t new (in fact, the same team recently made a similar argument that scales of “social media addiction” are really tapping in to normal, rather than pathological, social behaviour, as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/15/are-you-addicted-to-spending-time-with-your-friends-study-satirises-measures-of-social-media-addiction/">we reported in April</a>). But these issues are arguably more problematic in a crisis situation.</p>
<p>None of this is to imply there aren’t many psychologists doing useful research right now —  indeed, you can read about some of the important work being done in areas like mental health in our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">previous post</a>. However, it’s clear that the crisis has highlighted — and potentially exacerbated —  many of the field’s existing problems and limitations.</p>
<h3><strong>A way forward</strong></h3>
<p>But there have also been a number of suggestions for how to improve the research response. With calls for data sharing and collaboration, and the increased use of open science practices <a href="https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/rapid-registered-report-coronavirus-aims-to-stop-researchers-following-false-research-leads">like Registered Reports</a>, there are some bright spots, says Przybylski.</p>
<p>The preprint that claimed psychology is not crisis-ready had one unlikely proposal: draw from rocket science. NASA uses a system of “technology readiness levels” to determine whether a new piece of technology is ready to be deployed. The first level indicates that researchers have reliably observed some principle that could help develop a technology; at later levels they have tested a piece of technology in an appropriate environment; and at the highest level they have successfully used the complete system in a mission.</p>
<p>The team writes that most psychological research findings haven’t even passed that first level: it’s still unclear whether many of the effects researchers have found are reliable, let alone whether they can be used in real-world interventions. So they suggest a psychological equivalent of NASA’s framework, called “Evidence Readiness Levels”, to guide the development and implementation of psychological research. Interestingly, they’re not the only ones who have suggested a NASA-inspired rating system. Another preprint from Kai Ruggeri and colleagues (including NASA chief scientist James Green) <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/fjwvk/">proposes a similar rating system</a> that could allow decision makers to quickly assess the quality of evidence.</p>
<p>Others have argued that the actual infrastructure by which psychologists communicate and share information needs to be adapted to better suit the crisis. Along with several colleagues, Ulrike Hahn at Birkbeck University of London has <a href="https://www.scibeh.org/">set up an initiative</a> that aims to “reconfigure behavioural science for crisis knowledge management”. It’s a kind of meta-science project, says Hahn: “In a sense [it’s] trying to use extant tools to do something like build what the internet would be like, if the internet was still run by scientists, for scientists”. To that end, the team have set up subreddits where behavioural scientists can talk to each other and with policy makers and journalists, as well as a growing database of resources on psychology and the coronavirus.  Although the project is still in a proof-of-concept stage, the team hopes that these sorts of forums can facilitate the kind of speedy, transparent discussion and early evaluation of ideas and results that is necessary in a crisis, while also making information readily available to policy makers and the public.</p>
<p>Researchers have also highlighted the urgent need for more large-scale, collaborative studies. In an April paper in <em>Lancet Psychiatry, </em>for instance, a multidisciplinary team <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30168-1/fulltext">outlined priorities for mental health research</a> during the pandemic. Alongside various recommendations, the authors call for work to be conducted at scale with multiple research groups and networks, warning against “the current uncoordinated approach with a plethora of underpowered studies and surveys”. And at least some funding bodies and research councils are beginning to recognise the need to consolidate efforts in this way, notes Przybylski, who was also a co-author on this paper. Having large consortiums working together is “the kind of thing that I hope will eventually move psychology into the domain of ‘real science’ along with physics and chemistry,” he says.</p>
<p>That idea that improvements in our response to the pandemic could also lead to improvements in psychology more generally underlies many of these suggestions. Przybylski says that the notion of evidence readiness levels, for instance, “has been implicit in a lot of our thinking for a long time”, well before coronavirus emerged. Similarly, infrastructure that facilitates communication between researchers and builds an online community is always going to be helpful, says Hahn. “That kind of ‘ideal internet for science’ won’t stop being useful once the crisis has passed”.</p>
<p>Of course, whether or not the crisis does end up leading to long-term change remains to be seen. Some studies have already been published following rapid review, but most of the larger scale research will only hit the journals months or years down the line. Will we then look back at the pandemic as a time when psychological research held a strong line of defence and response, or when we let our guard down and allowed poor practices to spread?</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/alcohol-492871_640-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>You have probably been in situations where someone offers you an alcoholic drink and you feel like you have to drink it. Or perhaps you offer people a drink and make sure that they join in the fun. Peer pressure to drink alcohol is common in our everyday lives; from parties, your local pub, to nowadays COVID-19 pandemic friendly social distancing beers on Zoom with your mates.</p>
<p>Based on our systematic review of 13 qualitative research studies here are five key lessons:</p>
<p><strong>1. Peer pressure is not just experienced by adolescents and young people:</strong></p>
<p>A common perception is that peer pressure exists mainly in young people. However, peer pressure can affect people of all ages. The review found the adults often saw themselves as ‘older and wiser’ compared to when they were young. But many still experienced pressures to drink and continue drinking. Who hasn’t had the offer of ‘one for the road’?</p>
<p><strong>2. People can feel threatened by peer pressure:</strong></p>
<p>Peer pressure experiences varied from friendly banter to aggressive forms of pressure where people felt alcohol was ‘forced on you’. Being encouraged to ‘keep up’ with others’ drinking was a common reason for drinking too much.</p>
<p><strong>3. Peer pressure can have a negative impact:</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, to get rid of peer pressure many people gave in and drank more alcohol. They either had a drink when they didn’t want to drink, or drank more than they had intended. Drinking alcohol in response to peer pressure was seen as ‘caving in’. Most people who drank as a result of peer pressure regretted this decision later.</p>
<p><strong>4. Our wider social context matters to build and keep up peer pressure:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The social surroundings often influenced peer pressure to drink. Drinking was seen as ‘a sociable thing’ – as normal and helping you to fit in. For men, drinking could also be seen as a way to show their masculinity, which included ‘drinking like a man’ and choosing manly drinks.  Drinking provided connections to other people, and those who didn’t drink were often seen as boring or outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>5. People develop strategies to deal with peer pressure.</strong></p>
<p>Many reported using strategies to avoid pressure. Strategies included ‘nursing your drink’, drinking alcohol-free options which mimic alcoholic in flavor and appearance, or driving their car to provide an excuse for not drinking which would usually be accepted. Some people who did not drink much alcohol ‘came out’ out about their drinking preference, but this seemed to be rare. Others selected their group of friends to make sure it included non-drinkers or those who only drank moderate amounts.</p>
<p>The next time that you’re at a party, in the pub or having social distancing beers on Zoom, will you recognize when you are pressured to drink? Will you cave into the peer pressure, or have a strategy to deal with it? And what can you do to make sure that people don’t feel like they have to drink alcohol if they don’t want to?</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>The creeping realisation that Santa isn’t real can be a watershed moment — not quite an entry into adulthood, but certainly a step in its direction.</p>
<p>But “real” and “not real” are not the only two categories that children have when it comes to cultural figures, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234142">according to a new study</a> in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Rather than a black-and-white model, Rohan Kapitány and colleagues propose a “sensible hierarchy” of belief in various figures, finding that cultural rites and norms for those figures play a big part in its creation.</p>
<p><span id="more-39877"></span>Even very young children are capable of understanding the difference between real and non-real characters. But there are various factors that can convince them that a figure is real: testimony from others such as parents; indirect evidence like chocolate eggs or money left under a pillow; direct evidence like seeing a shopping centre Santa; and engagement in rituals — leaving cookies and milk out on Christmas Eve, for example.</p>
<p>To understand how children conceptualise and sort real from non-real figures, the researchers first asked 95 Australian children aged between two and eleven to rate the realness of 12 target figures on a scale from zero to eight. These included both real people (e.g. the kids’ band The Wiggles), and fictional figures (e.g. Santa, unicorns, and Harry Potter), as well as more ambiguous figures like aliens and dinosaurs. Adult participants also answered the same questions as part of a separate study.</p>
<p>Results suggested that children conceptualised the figures as belonging to one of four groups. The Wiggles and dinosaurs belonged to a “virtually real” group; cultural figures like Santa and the Tooth Fairy formed a second group; ambiguous figures like aliens made up another; and the final group included fictional characters like Peter Pan and Spongebob Squarepants. Adults, on the other hand, grouped figures into just three groups: real, not real and ambiguous. A second study with another set of children found a similar pattern.</p>
<p>As hypothesised, these groupings also conformed to a hierarchical pattern: the more culturally and evidentially supported a figure was, the more likely a child was to believe they were real. Unsurprisingly, the kids considered the “virtually real” group to be the most real — but they also believed that cultural figures were more real than other fictional characters. This makes sense when you consider the amount of “evidence” for the existence of Santa and Peter Pan, for instance: both are fictional characters, but only one has high levels of indirect and direct cultural evidence supporting it. Belief in fictional characters also, predictably, decreased with age.</p>
<p>One limitation of the study, however, was that children may also have been unclear on what “real” actually meant. In the case of Santa, many children may know he isn’t real in a <em>literal</em> sense but could have had experience “meeting” a figure in costume — 40% of children said they’d seen Santa in real life, the same number who said they’d seen The Wiggles, who are actually real. Dinosaurs, similarly, <em>used</em> to be real, which many children know. This knowledge may have impacted results.</p>
<p>Ritual seems to be a key factor here. Santa and the Tooth Fairy, as figures used to enforce normative behaviour, have huge amounts of ceremony around them, both positive and negative — the fun of receiving money under your pillow or preparing for Christmas, and the threat that fun could be taken away because of bad behaviour.</p>
<p>Future work could look at ritual participation, and how different emotional states and interactions impact upon childrens’ hierarchy of beliefs, as well as possible cultural differences in such rituals.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-alien-intelligence-self-destructive-civilizations">Self-destructive civilizations may doom our search for alien intelligence</a></h4>

<p>On Earth, civilizations have limited lifetimes.</p>



<p>Roman civilization, for instance, lasted less than a thousand years from the founding of its republic to the fall of its empire (after a long decline). In the New World, Maya civilization spanned roughly two millennia (maybe a little longer depending on when you date its beginning). In the late Bronze Age, the Greek Mycenaean civilization lasted a mere five centuries or so. As for American civilization (as in the United States of), at the rate things are going it won’t last even that long.</p>



<p>For some reason, civilization is not a self-perpetuating state of affairs on this planet. And perhaps not on other planets, either. In fact, limits to civilization lifetimes may explain why extraterrestrial aliens have not yet communicated with Earthlings. A new analysis suggests that the entire Milky Way galaxy currently houses only a few dozen worlds equipped with sufficiently sophisticated technology to send us a message. They are probably scattered at such great distances that any signals sent our way haven’t had time to get here. And by the time a signal arrives, there may be nobody here around to hear it.</p>



<p>“We may imagine a galaxy in which intelligent life is widespread, but communication unlikely,” write Tom Westby and Christopher Conselice in the June 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>





<p>Westby and Conselice, of the University of Nottingham in England, base <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03968">their analysis</a> on a modified version of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drake-equation-turns-50-interview-frank-drake">Drake equation</a>, proposed nearly 60 years ago by the astronomer Frank Drake. At a time when most scientists didn’t take communicating with E.T. seriously, Drake identified the factors that would, in principle, permit an estimate of how many communicating civilizations might exist in the galaxy. His equation provided the framework for all subsequent scientific assessment of the prospects for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>



<p>Westby and Conselice accept the Drake equation as “a tool for estimating the number of planets in our galaxy that host intelligent life with the capability of releasing signals which could be detectable from Earth.” (Such Communicating Extra-Terrestrial Intelligent civilizations are sometimes referred to by the acronym CETI.) But since some of its terms are impossible to measure today (such as how many stars have planets, and how many planets are capable of hosting life), Westby and Conselice adopt a novel approach by making assumptions that can circumvent the lack of data needed to fill in the Drake equation’s blanks.</p>



<p>Westby and Conselice begin by assuming it takes 5 billion years for intelligent, technologically advanced life to evolve — because that’s (approximately) how long it took on Earth. In some scenarios they assume that any habitable planet that lasts that long will, in fact, evolve such life. Given those data points, the task of counting galactic civilizations then involves figuring out how many stars are old enough and how many planets orbit those stars at a distance providing Goldilocks temperatures plus water and other raw materials needed to create and sustain biological beings.</p>



<p>For one thing, that means the stellar system must possess sufficient quantities of metals — in astronomers’ argot, elements heavier than hydrogen or helium. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and other more complex substances must be available for life to both evolve and build radio transmitters or lasers to send signals through space.</p>



<p>So in their new CETI equation, Westby and Conselice show how the number of intelligent, communicating civilizations in the galaxy today depends on how many stars the galaxy contains, how many of them are more than 5 billion years old, with how many habitable planets, and the average lifetime of an advanced civilization. Crunching all sorts of numbers about star formation rates and ages, results of planet searches and other astronomical studies yields estimates for each term in the CETI equation. It turns out that some of those factors don’t limit alien life’s prospects very much. Almost all the stars in the galaxy are older than 5 billion years, for instance (and their average age is almost 10 billion years).</p>



<p>Some of those stars would be ruled out as E.T. habitats because of a lack of raw materials. Assuming the most pessimistic scenario — that life requires stars to have at least as much metal as the sun — eliminates about two-thirds of the galaxy’s stars. Of those remaining, the fraction with planets in an orbit conducive to habitability is probably about 20 percent.</p>



<p>Since the galaxy is home to more than 200 billion stars, age, metal content and habitability limits still leave billions of possible CETI abodes. But that’s before factoring in civilization lifetime. It’s safe to say that a communicating civilization can last 100 years, since Earth’s technology has been emitting radio waves for that long. But if no high-tech society survives for more than a century, very few will be around at this particular time to communicate with us. With the strictest set of assumptions, assuming 100 years as the average CETI life span computes to only 36 communicating civilizations in the galaxy today. If so, far more movies have been made on Earth about alien civilizations than there actually are alien civilizations.</p>



<p>Among those 36, the closest neighbor would probably be about 17,000 light-years away, “making communication or even detection of these systems nearly impossible with present technology,” Westby and Conselice write. For an ambitious civilization lifetime of 2,000 years, the nearest CETI neighbor could still be thousands of light-years away. In a wildly optimistic case, with an average high-tech lifetime of a million years, the closest civilization should be within 300 light-years and maybe as close as 20.</p>



<p>“The lifetime of civilizations in our galaxy is a big unknown … and is by far the most important factor in the CETI equation,” Westby and Conselice note. “It is clear that … very long lifetimes are needed for … the galaxy to contain even a few possible active contemporary civilizations.”</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how different assumptions can affect the prospects for getting alien e-mail, you can check out a tool at the <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/alien-civilization">Alien Civilization Calculator website</a> created by physicists Steve Wooding and Dominik Czernia. Their tool permits you to plug in values to either the new CETI equation or the original Drake equation to see how different assumptions affect the galaxy’s population of alien civilizations.  </p>



<p>All such calculations are pretty imprecise. The uncertainty range for Westby and Conselice’s estimate of 36 civilizations, for instance, is four to 211. But the lack of precision is not as meaningful as the underlying message — the importance of civilization lifetime for the odds of receiving a message. And that message implies, as Westby and Conselice emphasize, that no news from E.T. is a bad sign for the lifetime of civilization on Earth.</p>



<p>Since most stars in the galaxy are much older than the sun, the absence of signals so far suggests that most communicating civilizations have already come and gone, like the Maya and Myceneans.  If that’s the case, an ability to communicate may signify an ability to self-annihilate.</p>



<p>“Perhaps the key aspect of intelligent life, at least as we know it, is the ability to self-destroy,” Westby and Conselice comment. “As far as we can tell, when a civilization develops the technology to communicate over large distances it also has the technology to destroy itself and this is unfortunately likely universal.”</p>



<p>In other words, Earth’s entire civilization will go the way of the Roman Empire sooner rather than later. There are plenty of likely roads to ruin. Nuclear holocaust is always a possibility, although nowadays it seems more likely that a viral pandemic will reboot the planet’s biosphere. Or climate change might do the job. If all else fails, there’s always social media.</p>



<p>Yet there is always hope that high-tech societies can survive longer. Maybe long-lived alien civilizations are not so far away after all, but simply have chosen not to communicate with use because we don’t seem to be sufficiently civilized.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanets-supercritical-water-liquid-gas">Some exoplanets may be covered in weird water that’s between liquid and gas</a></h4>

<p>Small worlds around other stars may come in more than two varieties.</p>



<p>Using exoplanet densities, astronomers have largely sorted planets that are bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-exoplanets-habitable-earth-neptune">two categories</a>: denser, rocky super-Earths and larger, puffy mini-Neptunes (<em>SN: 6/19/17</em>). Mini-Neptunes are generally thought to be padded in thick layers of hydrogen and helium gas, like the giant planets in our own solar system. But astronomers have detected clear evidence of hydrogen on only some mini-Neptunes — and, curiously, seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/watery-exoplanets-skies-suggest-unexpected-origin-story">traces of water</a> on others (<em>SN: 5/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>Now, new simulations indicate that some planets that look like gaseous mini-Neptunes could actually be rocky planets <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab9530">covered in superheated oceans</a>, where the water is in an exotic state between liquid and gas. Such extreme saunalike worlds could bridge the divide between rocky and gaseous planet types, researchers report in the June 15 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Olivier Mousis, a planetary scientist at Aix-Marseille University in France, and colleagues ran simulations of ocean-covered worlds in close orbits around their stars, where mini-Neptunes are often found. Intense stellar radiation would cause water on the planets to puff up into a diffuse layer of “supercritical” water between liquid and gas, topped by a steamy water vapor atmosphere, the team found. On Earth, supercritical water can be used to break down toxic waste.</p>



<p>The puffiness of each simulated planet depended on factors like its water content. But Mousis’ team simulated water worlds with a range of sizes and densities that match nearly all of the hundreds of mini-Neptunes discovered so far. This hints that water-containing mini-Neptunes may be better explained by supercritical oceans than by hydrogen and helium gas layers. For instance, the authors note that the mini-Neptune <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">K2 18b</a>, where water has been spotted, fits the profile of a supercritical ocean planet of about 37 percent water (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>More detailed observations of exoplanets in the future may prove whether this new planetary model holds water.</p>

<p>Ancient Americans ventured deep into caves along a stretch of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula to mine a red pigment that could have had both practical and ritual uses, researchers say.</p>



<p>Discoveries of mining-related artifacts and digging areas by divers in three now-submerged cave systems indicate that people there removed a natural pigment called red ochre, say archaeologist Brandi MacDonald of the University of Missouri in Columbia and her colleagues. Radiocarbon dates of burned wood from fires used to illuminate mining areas place humans at these sites between roughly 12,000 and 10,000 years ago, making it <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba1219">the oldest evidence of ochre mining in the Americas</a>, the investigators report July 3 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Previous finds have suggested that ancient Americans used red ochre in many ways, including as an antiseptic, sunscreen, hide-tanning agent and for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-babys-genome-unveils-native-american-ancestry">body painting and other symbolic purposes</a> (<em>SN: 2/12/14</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Floating through the eerie depths of a submerged cave system on the Yucatán Peninsula, divers recovered evidence that ancient people dug up deposits of the red pigment as early as 12,000 years ago when the chambers were dry. The findings make this the oldest known ochre mine in the Americas.</figure>



<p>Remnants of ancient pigment mining uncovered by MacDonald’s team raise the possibility that some miners may have died and been left where they perished. Divers previously found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-skeleton-mexico-underwater-cave-early-americans">at least 10 human skeletons in Yucatán caves</a> dating to as early as around 12,000 years ago, before rising seas inundated the underground chambers (<em>SN: 2/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>In one cave system, an approximately 900-meter-long series of tunnels dubbed La Mina contained extensive evidence of red ochre extraction. Several narrow passages leading into La Mina contained piles of stones and broken pieces of cave growths that miners apparently used as navigation guides. Other broken-off cave growths had been wielded as digging tools. Most of the 352 pits and other intentionally disturbed areas in La Mina contain remnants of ochre deposits, the researchers say. Ochre samples from La Mina were bright red and chemically suitable for making paint, they add.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caecilians-amphibians-venomous-bites">Bizarre caecilians may be the only amphibians with venomous bites</a></h4>

<p>Caecilians are amphibians like salamanders and frogs, but they’re often mistaken for snakes because of their long, legless bodies. Now, scientists think that the similarities between the two are more than skin deep.</p>



<p>New microscope and chemical analyses suggest that, like snakes, <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(20)30419-3">caecilians have glands near their teeth that secrete toxins</a>. The discovery raises the possibility that caecilians may be the first amphibians found capable of delivering a venomous bite.</p>



<p>Pedro Mailho-Fontana, an evolutionary biologist with the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, has been studying <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/caecilians-other-amphibian">caecilians</a> for several years, and in particular, the glands in their skin. He has helped show that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22005-5">the animals have separate glands for secreting mucus on their heads and poison on their tails</a>.</p>



<p>But one day in early 2018, as Mailho-Fontana was slowly eroding the skin on the skull of a dead ringed caecilian (<em>Siphonops annulatus</em>) to get a closer look at the mucus glands, he saw something that made his hair stand on end: large glands in the animal’s upper and lower jaws that had ducts going to the teeth.</p>





<p>Mailho-Fontana, along with fellow evolutionary biologists Marta Antoniazzi and Carlos Jared also at the Butantan Institute, set about characterizing these unexpected oral glands in several caecilian species using standard and electron microscopes. Perhaps the most striking finding is that the glands arise from dental tissue. That’s just like venom glands of snakes, but it’s a first for amphibians, the researchers report July 3 in <em>iScience</em>.</p>



<p>The team also performed preliminary biochemical tests on the fluid in the newfound glands, and discovered that it contains phospholipase A2 enzymes, a large group of fat-chopping proteins that are frequent components in animal venoms. But the work stopped short of conclusively showing that the animals are venomous.</p>



<p>Venoms aren’t entirely unknown from amphibians; some use bony protrusions to create wounds in their attackers and deliver skin-derived toxins that way. And Jared and his colleagues previously discovered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-venomous-frogs-stab-toxin-dripping-lip-spikes">the only known venomous frogs</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/15</em>). But Jared notes that these amphibians cannot inject their venoms and instead rely on an attacker pressing on their pointy bits.</p>

An analysis of fluid in those glands reveals enzymes commonly found in animal venoms.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089337">Carlos Jared</span></figure></div>



<p>The caecilian oral glands don’t appear to help inject secretions either. The team didn’t find any tubes or grooves in the teeth that could facilitate the delivery of the fluid. Instead, it appears the glands work more like the venom systems of Gila monsters or other venomous lizards: The glands simply ooze secretions onto the teeth, which then enter the victim as those teeth tear into flesh.</p>



<p>That these snakelike animals seem to possess a venomous bite even somewhat akin to snakes’ isn’t likely to be a coincidence, Antoniazzi says. “We think it has to do with this fact that they have similar bodies,” she says. Without limbs to subdue prey, both caecilians and snakes benefit from having oral chemical weapons.</p>



<p>The caecilians’ teeth and associated glands are “extremely fascinating,” says Kartik Sunagar, an evolutionary biologist with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, comparing them to “something out of an alien movie.” But it’s still unclear if the gland secretions are indeed toxic and play a functional role in feeding or defense, he says.</p>



<p>Tracking which genes are turned on or off in the oral glands compared with the tail poison glands or other tissues could give a better sense of what the oral secretions contain and whether they are unique to those glands, Sunagar says.</p>



<p>The team hopes to provide additional evidence for these amphibians being venomous soon, including a more detailed work-up of the oral gland components, which would shed new light on these enigmatic and poorly studied animals. Caecilians are “perhaps the most unknown vertebrate,” Jared says. “This project has opened the door for future studies.”</p>

<p><strong>We’ve all seen the social media posts proclaiming that countries with female leaders are faring better in the pandemic than those with male leaders.</strong> But while there are clearly prominent examples of women-led nations whose response has been excellent — Germany and New Zealand, in particular — is this claim actually true? The evidence is pretty weak, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-the-data-really-says-about-women-leaders-and-the-pandemic/">writes Hilda Bastian</a> at<em> Wired</em>, who points to the small sample size (as women still make up a small proportion of world leaders), as well as the confirmation bias that leads us to ignoring women-led countries that have not fared as well.</p>

<p><strong>Horror movie fans may be better equipped to deal with the distress caused by the pandemic, a preprint has claimed</strong>.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swine-flu-influenza-pandemic-reasons-not-to-worry">4 reasons not to worry about that ‘new’ swine flu in the news</a></h4>

<p>It may feel odd to be thinking ahead to the next potential pandemic when the world is far from finished with the current one. But reports of a newly identified swine influenza virus that shows hints of being able to spread among humans have raised that specter — although public health officials say it’s not an imminent threat.</p>



<p>That virus, identified in pigs in some parts of China, has characteristics similar to a strain that caused the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2009-science-news-year-body-brain">2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/09</em>), a new study finds. But just identifying such a flu virus circulating in pigs does not mean it poses an immediate threat to people. Rather it signals to researchers that they should monitor sick people for similar viruses.</p>



<p>“It’s not an immediate threat where you’re seeing infections,” Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said in a U.S. Senate hearing on June 30. “But it’s something we need to keep our eye on, just the way we did in 2009 with the emergence of the swine flu.”</p>



<p>Influenza viruses bind to a protein called sialic acid to break into cells. Birds and people have different types of this protein in their upper airway, but pigs have both. That makes pigs not only susceptible to swine-specific flu strains but also to flu viruses from birds and humans. As a result, the animals often become influenza mixing pots.</p>





<p>Once in pigs, bird, swine and human flu viruses can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swine-and-men">exchange genetic material</a> — called reassortment — giving rise to new strains (<em>SN: 2/12/10</em>). If some of those new strains can infect people and make them sick, the virus might go on to cause larger outbreaks.</p>



<p>Like the 2009 H1N1 virus, a newly identified pig virus, called G4 EA H1N1, or G4 for short, can attach to the type of sialic acid that lines a person’s respiratory tract, and it <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/23/1921186117">can also replicate in human cells grown in a dish</a>, researchers report June 29 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Infected ferrets — an animal commonly used to study influenza because ferrets exhibit similar symptoms as people — can also get sick and pass the virus to other ferrets. The findings hint that the virus has the potential to cause disease and be transmitted among people.</p>



<p>“It really points out the fact that we’ve got to keep watching influenza viruses,” says Marie Culhane, a swine veterinarian who studies influenza at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Here are four things to know about the G4 swine flu virus.</p>



<h3>The virus began circulating in pigs in 2013.</h3>



<p>That means the new virus isn’t really brand new.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“ … This virus is very good at going pig to pig. And it’s also probably good at not causing very severe disease in the pigs, because if it was … people would want to do something about it.”</p><cite>Marie Culhane, swine veterinarian at the University of Minnesota</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>
</div>



<p>Jinhua Liu, an influenza researcher at China Agricultural University in Beijing, and his colleagues analyzed more than 30,000 nasal swabs or lung samples from pigs across 10 provinces in northern and central China for influenza viruses over seven years, from 2011 to 2018. The G4 virus emerged in pigs in 2013 and in the following years, it became more prevalent. By 2016, it was the dominant form of influenza virus circulating in tested pigs.</p>



<p>“That means that this virus is very good at going pig to pig,” Culhane says. “And it’s also probably good at not causing very severe disease in the pigs, because if it was … people would want to do something about it.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear just how widely the virus has spread. So far, scientists have tested only a small portion of pigs in China.</p>



<h3>The virus has infected some people, but it’s unclear if they got sick.</h3>



<p>Ten percent of 338 people tested who worked with pigs had antibodies, or immune proteins that recognize the virus — a sign that they had recovered from a previous infection, Liu and colleagues found.</p>



<p>Antibodies can stick around for years after an infection, so it’s not known when the workers were exposed the virus. It’s also unclear whether those people had symptoms while they were infected. It’s possible that the virus doesn’t cause severe disease, so the infections went unnoticed. If the workers did have symptoms, there’s also a chance that the signs of illness were indistinguishable from regular flu.</p>



<p>There is a slight possibility that the test picked up immune proteins that recognize another flu virus, not G4. Looking for antibodies is like “looking for smoke,” Culhane says. “You see smoke, but you don’t know where the fire is.”</p>



<p>Other flu antibodies that bind to closely related virus strains did not recognize the newer virus. That means that the part of the virus that the antibodies bind to has changed enough so that people don’t have protection from previous flu bouts and might not be immune if the virus began to spread.</p>



<h3>There’s no evidence the virus can easily spread among people.</h3>



<p>When monitoring different flu strains and determining pandemic risk, “what people watch for is human-to-human transmission,” Culhane says. If lots of people who have no connection to pigs or other infected animals were infected with the virus, that would be more concerning.</p>



<p>The study found that only 4 percent of people in the general population had antibodies to G4 — and those with regular exposure to pigs were more likely to test positive. The paper also cites two cases of flu that were caused by a G4-like virus in people whose neighbors had pigs. But there’s no evidence that someone who worked with pigs then passed the virus to someone else.</p>



<h4>There’s no evidence of the virus in other places.</h4>



<p>The World Health Organization coordinates a Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, which gathers data from member countries to monitor seasonal and pandemic flu. The United States has its own monitoring system in place within the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Right now, only pigs in China are known to carry the G4 flu strain. There’s no evidence that G4 or similar viruses are in other countries. For the United States, specifically, “there’s just no evidence of that, and we look at the data all the time,” Culhane says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/white-throated-sparrow-song-variation">A sparrow song remix took over North America with astonishing speed</a></h4>

<p>Some North American birds are changing their tune.</p>



<p>The traditional song of the white-throated sparrow (<em>Zonotrichia albicollis</em>) ends with a repeated triplet of notes. By 2000, however, some birds in western Canada were whistling a variation ending in a two-note pattern. That new song has <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30771-5">since spread widely across North America</a>, researchers report online July 2 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The findings fly in the face of previous hypotheses that birdsong dialects don’t change much within local regions. The rapid spread of the new song is akin to someone moving from Kentucky to Vancouver and everyone in Vancouver suddenly picking up a Kentucky accent, says Ken Otter, an avian behavioral ecologist at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, Canada.</p>



<p>Otter and his colleagues documented the adoption of the western song at a research station in eastern Canada. In 2005, only one male out of 76 surveyed sang the doublet-ending song. In 2014, 22 percent of 101 males surveyed sang the new song. And in 2017, nearly half of 92 males recorded had adopted the variation.</p>

<p>The researchers confirmed the spread of the song with the double-noted ending across the continent — as far east as Quebec and Vermont — via recordings from citizen scientists.</p>



<p>Eastern sparrows probably picked up the new song at common <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-some-birds-sing-elaborate-songs-winter">wintering grounds</a>, the researchers say (<em>SN: 2/4/16</em>). By tracking birds from central British Columbia with backpacklike geolocators, the team found that the birds migrated to the southern U.S. Great Plains, which overlap with known wintering grounds of birds that breed east of the Rockies.</p>



<p>One explanation for this shift may be a female preference for novel songs, a focus for future study, Otter says.</p>

<h3>Far and wide</h3>



<p>After 2000, a new version of the white-throated sparrow’s song that ends in a double note pattern (blue circles) spread more than 3,000 kilometers east, to areas where the traditional song, with its three-note pattern (red circles), had only been documented previously. Circle size correlates to the number of songs recorded by researchers and citizen scientists. The data show that by 2019, the new song has completely replaced the traditional one in western North America. While the traditional song can still be heard in the East, the new song has been documented as far east as Quebec and Vermont.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/annual-e-waste-electronics-recycling-75-million-metric-tons">Earth’s annual e-waste could grow to 75 million metric tons by 2030</a></h4>

<p>The planet’s hefty pile of discarded electronics is getting a lot heavier, a new report finds.</p>



<p>In 2014, the world collectively tossed an estimated 44.4 million metric tons of unwanted “e-waste” — battery-powered or plug-tethered devices such as laptops, smartphones and televisions. By 2030, <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Pages/Spotlight/Global-Ewaste-Monitor-2020.aspx">that number is projected to grow to about 74.7 million tons</a>, according to the<em> Global E-Waste Monitor 2020</em>. That’s roughly equivalent to eight times the weight of China’s Three Gorges Dam.</p>



<p>The findings come from <a href="https://globalewaste.org/">a partnership formed in 2017</a> between the United Nations International Telecommunication Union, the International Solid Waste Association and other groups to track the accumulation of electronic debris. The projected e-waste for 2020 and other future years doesn’t include any economic consequences that might be related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>What a waste</h3>





<p>The yearly amount of e-waste is projected to almost double in weight from 2014 (44.4 million metric tons) to 2030 (74.7 million tons). Actual data is shown in dark blue, and projected data is in light blue. These numbers are based on calculations of global consumption of electronics as well as on simulations that take into account both sales and product life spans. The projected e-waste for 2020 and other future years doesn’t include any economic consequences that might be related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Higher consumption rates of electronics, as well as shorter life cycles for many devices, are contributing to the rapid pileup. And most people also are not properly and safely recycling their devices, the report found. Of the 53.6 million tons of e-waste generated in 2019, only 9.3 million tons, or 17.4 percent, were recycled.</p>



<p>Discarded electronics can contain hazardous materials — such as cadmium and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-levels-fish-are-rising-despite-reduced-emissions">mercury</a> in laptops and smartphones, and refrigerant chemicals like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emissions-banned-ozone-destroying-chemical-have-been-traced-china">chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons</a> — that can leach into the environment (<em>SN: 8/7/19; SN: 5/22/19</em>). E-waste is also a source of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microplastics-may-enter-freshwater-and-soil-compost">plastic</a> waste (<em>SN: 4/5/18</em>). What’s more, not recycling e-waste can contribute to global warming, the report notes, because humans are mining and processing new materials rather than reusing existing materials.</p>



<p>E-waste also contains so many valuable recoverable metals, such as iron, copper and gold, that it essentially represents an “urban mine,” the report states. The value of the raw materials in 2019’s e-waste could be as much as $57 billion — only about $10 billion of which was recovered through recycling.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="90" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/logo-bmcoralhealth-pr-140x90.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Water fluoridation is a measure to prevent caries, a disease of significant public health importance. Caries, when not managed, result in pain and discomfort for individuals and have further implications for the health and well-being of the affected individual, such as retarded growth and development of pre-school children. The huge cost of managing caries has significant impact on the allocation of public health funding.</p>
<p>Different management strategies have been employed to prevent caries. Behaviour based interventions to reduce individual’s exposure to caries’ risk factors such as a reduction in sugar consumption, have limited success. Public water fluoridation is a cost-effective approach to facilitate access of populations to systematic fluoride and, in turn, reduce caries.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11995" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11995" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Water-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© samopauser / stock.adobe.com</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The effectiveness of water fluoridation is still being extensively debated globally.  First, there is contradictory evidence on its effectiveness in preventing caries and there are reported risks of adverse effects such as dental and skeletal fluorosis. There are also debates weighing up the potential health benefits in the context of ethical principles and personal liberties.  Fluoridation reduces the risk of ill health in a manner which protects the vulnerable and reduces health outcome inequality between the different socioeconomic groups. Those who oppose fluoridation do so on the grounds that it is unethical to coerce individuals to live healthy lives, and emphasises the importance of consent before any health intervention.</p>
<p>Given the level of interest in public water fluoridation, the range and complexity of the public debate, and its implication for policy making, this Collection aims to bring together empirical research papers, and theoretical and conceptual analyses about water fluoridation and caries. The Collection will consider manuscripts on the following three themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population level impact of the introduction or the cessation of water fluoridation on health</li>
<li>Barriers to the implementation of fluoridation and reasons for its cessation, including the assessment and evaluation of the attitudes and knowledge of members of the public, dental professionals and policy makers on water fluoridation</li>
<li>Ethical arguments for and against water fluoridation</li>
</ul>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://effectiviology.com/">Itamar Shatz</a></p>
<p>It feels bad to know that you’ve messed up, especially when other people have to pay a price for your actions. Unfortunately, this feeling is something that most of us end up experiencing at one point or another — when we’re placed on a team with other people at school or at a job, for instance, and make a mistake that forces our team members to do more work as a result.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1027/1864-9335/a000411">recent research</a>, published in <em>Social Psychology</em> by James Wirth at Ohio State University and his colleagues, shows that there is a trait that can reduce those negative feelings, called “self-compassion”.</p>
<p><span id="more-39863"></span></p>
<p>Self-compassion is composed of three components: <em>self-kindness</em>, which involves showing kindness to yourself, <em>mindfulness</em>, which involves keeping your emotions balanced, and<em> common humanity</em>, which involves recognising that everyone experiences challenges. Past work has shown that self-compassion can be beneficial from an emotional perspective, for example by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/20/writing-about-your-emotional-pain-could-make-you-feel-worse-unless-you-do-it-with-self-compassion/">protecting people who write about their emotional pain</a>, and by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/17/encouraging-self-compassion-may-help-people-with-chronic-pain-live-more-active-happier-lives/">helping people with chronic pain lead happier and more active lives</a>.</p>
<p>To see whether self-compassion could also protect people from the negative feelings that occur when they perform poorly in a way that hurts their group, the researchers conducted a series of online experiments, each with around 160 to 300 participants.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, participants imagined playing a trivia game as part of a team. Some imagined that they performed as well as their team members, while others imagined that they performed poorly, and thus reduced the team’s number of correct answers.</p>
<p>In the second experiment, participants actually engaged in a team task, in which they saw three words, and had to find a fourth word that linked them together. Some participants were told that they performed as well as their team members (who were actually computer agents), while others were told that they performed worse and that as a result, the team did not get enough answers correct and would have to answer more questions as a penalty.</p>
<p>In both cases, when people performed (or imagined performing) poorly, they experienced more negative emotions, suffered from lower self-esteem, felt more burdensome and ostracised, and expected more exclusion from other group members.</p>
<p>However, self-compassion significantly reduced these negative outcomes: participants who were high in self-compassion did not experience as many negative emotions and concerns over being a burden as those who were low in self-compassion.</p>
<p>In two further experiments, the researchers attempted to untangle the effects of poor performance from those of harming one’s group. In one experiment, participants were either asked to recall a time when their poor performance harmed members of their group, or when they performed poorly but not in a way that harmed their group. In the other, participants engaged in the same word creativity task as before. This time, however, all participants were told that they performed worse than their team members, but some were told that their team would be impacted by this, while others were told that there would be no harm to their team.</p>
<p>These studies showed that when their poor performance also harmed other members of their group, participants felt more negative social consequences, such as feeling burdensome. Again, self-compassion seemed to buffer against these negative effects.</p>
<p>The study does have some limitations, as the researchers themselves note. For example, the experiments were conducted in an online setting, where participants did not directly experience the in-person social interaction that plays an important role in these kinds of situations. Still, it’s encouraging that most of the study’s main findings replicated across all of the individual experiments.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings help explain why some people feel crushed when they make mistakes, while others manage to cope well. Furthermore, they suggest that practising self-compassion might help you cope with difficult situations where you feel you are being a burden on others. For example, if you’re part of a group project and you make a mistake, you could benefit from reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and that you shouldn’t be too hard on yourself if you do so. If you’re someone who’s not naturally self-compassionate, this may be difficult, but as the researchers note, with enough practice, it might be possible to increase your self-compassion over time.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-six-months-covid-19-symptoms">Why COVID-19 is both startlingly unique and painfully familiar</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">For Abby Knowles, a headache and fatigue was just the start.</p>



<p>She soon felt like she had a tight band across her chest, making it difficult to breathe. She developed pain in her upper body, which led doctors to check if she was having a heart attack (she wasn’t). Her blood pressure began to oscillate — too low, too high — leaving her lightheaded and nauseous. Her mind became so foggy she couldn’t read a book.</p>



<p>A symptom might taper off, only to return. “You’ll think, ‘Oh I’m done with that bit, brilliant,’” Knowles says, “and then three days later it will be back.” After more than three months of illness, Knowles — who is 38 and lives in Reading, England — has been referred for an evaluation for long-term complications from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, her husband Dan, who also became sick toward the end of March, had a high fever and more typical COVID-19 symptoms for a few days but soon recovered.</p>



<p>The experiences of the Knowles and many COVID-19 patients point to the ways that the coronavirus can be maddeningly unpredictable. Some people have debilitating illness, while others barely feel sick, if at all. For some, it’s mostly a respiratory illness, while others have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-sense-smell-brain-nerve-cells">neurological symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 6/12/20</em>), such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-symptoms-signs-loss-smell-taste">loss of smell</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/20</em>). Severely ill patients may develop life-threatening <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-preventing-dangerous-blood-clots-lungs">blood clots</a> (<em>SN: 6/23/20</em>), adding vascular symptoms to the list. Some patients are struggling to get back to normal long after being sick.</p>

<h3>COVID-19:<br />The first six months</h3>



<p>This story is one in a series looking at the first six months of the pandemic. </p>





<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-six-months-what-we-know">Here’s what we’ve learned in six months of COVID-19 — and what we still don’t know</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-united-states-wasted-time-lockdowns-reopening">The U.S. largely wasted time bought by COVID-19 lockdowns. Now what?</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>And the way the disease plays out by age can be baffling. Severe cases of COVID-19 have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-parents-summer">rare among children</a>, but some have suffered a dangerous inflammatory syndrome that can appear weeks after an infection (<em>SN: 6/3/20</em>). Older people remain at highest risk for hospitalizations and death from COVID-19, but young adults are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-young-adults-can-face-severe-cases">getting seriously ill</a>, too (<em>SN: 3/19/20</em>). That group generally tends to fare better than the very young and very old with viral infections (one glaring exception: the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed healthy, young adults at a high rate).</p>



<p>In the six months since China reported a pneumonia of unknown cause, doctors have described a burgeoning catalog of health harms from what’s now called COVID-19. In some ways, the disease stands apart: The range of COVID-19’s effects and the difficulty in predicting how severely it will hit any one person is out of the ordinary. But some of the symptoms and patterns associated with COVID-19 are painfully familiar.</p>



<p>Combating COVID-19 — there are now over 10.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, and more than half a million have died of the disease — will take a better understanding of how it operates at every level, from the microscopic on up. Moving from the viewpoint of a cell to a person to society, here’s a look at how COVID-19 compares to other viral infections and the harms they inflict.</p>



<h4>Peering at the cell</h4>



<p>Studying how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the immune system has revealed some surprises along with one explanation for why COVID-19 can be a severe illness.</p>



<p>During a viral infection, the infected cells put out a call to arms and a call for reinforcements, says virologist Benjamin tenOever of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. The cells release interferons, proteins that “signal to all of the neighboring cells that there’s a virus present,” he says. The cells also send out proteins called chemokines, which attract immune cells to the site of infection.</p>



<p>Viruses endeavor to overcome both calls. Influenza, for example, dampens each enough to replicate and move to another host, but not so much that a person can’t eventually clear the infection. SARS-CoV-2 does something different: It slams the brakes on the call to arms but puts the gas on the call for reinforcements, tenOever says.</p>



<p>In experiments with cells, animals and blood and tissue samples from COVID-19 patients, tenOever and his colleagues found low levels of interferons, which sound the call to arms. But <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30489-X">levels of chemokines</a>, which bring in the cavalry of immune cells, were high, the researchers report May 28 in <em>Cell</em>.</p>



<p>“It makes no sense,” tenOever says, as the juiced up call for reinforcements “doesn’t even necessarily benefit the virus.” But it can cause big problems for patients. The excessive show of immune cell force spurs inflammation and cell death, which can stoke yet more inflammation and cell death. This severe immune reaction can damage the lungs and other organs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="SARS-CoV-2 SEM image" class="wp-image-3089239" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/063020_ac_6months-symptoms_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089239">This colorized scanning electron micrograph shows a cell infected with SARS-CoV-2 (yellow), the virus that causes COVID-19. The way the virus interacts with the immune system can lead to serious problems for patients, researchers say.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3089239">NIAID</span></figure>



<p>The way that SARS-CoV-2 tangles with the immune system largely sets it apart from other viruses, although SARS-CoV — the coronavirus behind the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003 — also showed the same mismatched approach to the call to arms and call for reinforcements, tenOever says. And the Ebola virus does something a little similar, although for a different reason, he says. That virus is good at blocking the call to arms, but it damages so many cells quickly during an infection that it ends up triggering a lot of inflammation, even though it isn’t revving up the call for reinforcements.</p>



<h4>From person to person</h4>



<p>Many of the symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19 are seen with other viral infections. For example, loss of smell, called anosmia, can occur during infections with common cold-causing coronaviruses and other viruses that target the upper respiratory tract. Fatigue is common with such viral illnesses as mononucleosis, which is usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Blood clotting problems can occur in patients severely ill with certain viral infections.</p>



<p>But the sheer breadth of symptoms and complications associated with this illness is unusual. With COVID-19, “we are seeing such a devastatingly wide range of effects,” says infectious disease physician Anna Person of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.</p>



<p>Person knows COVID-19 both as a doctor and a patient. The Sunday in late April that the avid runner became ill started like any other and included a seven-mile run. But that evening, “I just had a wave of feeling horrible,” Person says, with chills and signs of a fever. “It hit me like a sledgehammer.”</p>



<p>During Person’s bout of COVID-19, she temporarily couldn’t smell or taste — coffee tasted like water, she says — and she experienced confusion and memory problems. Two months on, she’s slowly starting to feel like herself, but it’s taken longer than she expected. She has begun running again, but still battles heavy fatigue. Yet her case is considered mild because she didn’t need to be hospitalized.</p>

<p>The risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 increases with age and with certain underlying conditions, but younger, healthy people are also ending up on ventilators or having strokes. What’s so unpredictable, Person says, is that “while we have studies that have told us certain risk factors for more severe disease, we’re seeing so many exceptions to that.”</p>



<p>Severe illness is no stranger to other viral infections, from dengue to West Nile to measles to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shingles-virus-rash-chicken-pox-complications">chickenpox and shingles</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/19</em>). And with respiratory viruses such as the flu, “there’s always a subset of people who present with very severe infection,” says infectious disease specialist Preeti Malani of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Those patients can end up with acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, a deadly condition that deprives the organs of oxygen. But with COVID-19, she says, “clearly it’s a very different scale.”</p>



<p>Even those who seem to pass through a SARS-CoV-2 infection without a sniffle may not come out unscathed. Researchers assessed 37 people who tested positive for the coronavirus but didn’t have symptoms in the two weeks before their test or during their isolation in the Wanzhou People’s Hospital in China. Twenty-one had abnormal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6">features in their lungs</a> that have been seen in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the researchers report online June 18 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>That leaves open the possibility that asymptomatic people, not just those with symptoms, may end up with long-term consequences. “One of the concerns is, are these people going to be left with lungs that don’t function normally?” Malani says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="CT scan of SARS-CoV-2 patient's lungs" class="wp-image-3089240" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/063020_ac_6months-symptoms_inline2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3089240">These chest computed tomography scans from two patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but did not have symptoms show signs that the virus affected their lungs.

<h4>Social scenarios</h4>



<p>There is still much to learn about why an individual person might be more or less at risk of developing complications or long-term damage from COVID-19. But there’s little question anymore that certain scenarios put a person at higher risk of getting an infection in the first place. The virus mainly spreads by respiratory droplets, generated by coughing, sneezing or talking, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">people are in close contact</a> (<em>SN: 6/18/20</em>).</p>



<p>“Who are the people who are more likely to be in constant close contact with others, who are not able to isolate from respiratory droplets, who are not able to work from home?” says Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Those “often times are minority communities.”</p>



<p>The racial and ethnic disparities in terms of who has access to health care, owns a home and has a job that can be done remotely have produced stark differences in who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">gets sick and dies from COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). An analysis at the U.S. county level shows that greater social vulnerability — a measure which takes into account socioeconomic status, minority status, access to housing and transportation and other factors — is associated with a higher risk of being <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-05882-3">diagnosed with COVID-19</a> and a higher risk of death from the illness, researchers report online June 23 in the <em>Journal of General Internal Medicine</em>.</p>

<p>Most patients hospitalized at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with COVID-19 are from communities of color, says Person. “It’s systemic racism at work.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first pandemic to disproportionately burden Black, Latino and Native American communities. For example, the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 was riskier for these Americans. And there is evidence that, even though fewer were infected, Black Americans <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2223">were more likely to die</a> from the 1918 pandemic flu than white Americans, researchers report online June 5 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. “These problems have existed for centuries,” says Marcelin. Inequities “permeate every aspect of society, including health care and the way we respond to health care crises.”</p>



<p>All told, COVID-19 leaves us both with déjà vu and the sense we’re blazing new territory. Certainly some of what’s so transformative about the experience is that many of us are living through a pandemic of this scale for the first time, as we face a virus our bodies have never seen before. Because the coronavirus is new, “we’re learning on the job,” Marcelin says. “That makes it a lot more scary to think about.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>What proportion of world history is the United Kingdom responsible for? While it’s clearly hard to put an exact number on it, you might be surprised by the answers participants gave in a 2018 study: on average, Brits believed that the country has contributed a whopping 55% of the total history of the world. And they weren’t alone: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/21/national-narcissism-is-rife-finds-survey-of-35-countries/">participants from 34 other countries all rated their own nations</a> as having outsized contributions, from 11% in Switzerland to 61% in Russia.</p>
<p>Other work has found that people make similar claims about the regions they live in: one study found that Americans believe their own state is responsible for 18% of the nation’s history, despite just being one of 50 in the country. Now <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-020-01059-9">a series of studies in <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em></a> has looked at exactly <em>why</em> people make these judgements, known as “collective overclaiming”.</p>
<p><span id="more-39858"></span>In the new paper, Morgan Quinn Ross at The Ohio State University and colleagues studied the phenomenon through the lens of support theory. Simply put, this theory states that the way an event is described influences how likely we believe it is to occur. In particular, if an event is “unpacked” into its constituent parts, we generally see it as more likely. For instance, people believe that a plane crash is more likely when they think about the possible causes of plane crashes — human failure, terrorism, and so on — than when they just think about the likelihood of a plane crash in general.</p>
<p>Across a series of five studies, the team examined whether a similar kind of bias could account for our tendency to overclaim the contributions of a particular region. In the first, 302 participants read about a fictitious country, Oloram, and were asked how much the territory Adivigan was responsible for the historical developments of the country. Crucially, participants either learned that there were a total of 5, 20, or 50 territories, of which Adivigan was just one, and were told to keep in mind that the total contribution of all territories should equal 100%.</p>
<p>Without any other information to go on, it would seem to make sense simply to estimate the contribution of Adivigan as a proportion of the total number of territories (i.e. 20% for the 5 territory condition or 2% for the 50 territory condition). And in the 5 territory condition, participants weren’t far off: on average they estimated that Adivigan was responsible for 23% of the country’s history. But participants considerably overestimated the contribution for the 20 and 50 territory conditions (average responses were 16% and 12% respectively, while the mathematically correct responses would be 5% and 2%).</p>
<p>This study showed that the extent of overclaiming increased when there were more territories. The researchers suggest that this may be because with people’s focus concentrated on Adivigan, they tend to lump all the other regions together, rather than considering them as many individual territories (i.e. they don’t “unpack” them, in the language of support theory). This means people are prone to underestimate the role of these other regions — particularly when there are more of them.</p>
<p>To test this idea further, the team asked a separate set of participants to complete a similar task, except this time they all read that Oloram had 5 territories. Some participants again rated the contribution of just one region, while the others rated all five. As expected, when the participants had to “unpack” the scenario by rating all of the territories, they were spot on, rating the contribution of each as 20%. But when they rated just one of the territories, they again overestimated its contribution at 39%.</p>
<p>In a later study, the team looked at whether the amount of information given to participants influenced their judgements. In the “minimal content” condition, they simply read that Adivigan was one of Oloram’s 20 territories; in the “content” condition they were given facts about the territory (e.g. that it has prominent shipping and trade industries and boasts a popular forest); and in the “detailed content” condition they read more detailed information (e.g. that it has more than 30 financial institutions and several rare tree species).</p>
<p>In all conditions, participants once again overestimated Adivigan’s contributions to the history of the country. But participants who received more information overestimated these contributions the most: those in the detailed content condition rated the contribution at 36%, compared to 14% in the minimal content condition.</p>
<p>Overall, the results suggest that our tendency to overclaim may at least partly be the result of cognitive biases: we overestimate the contributions of the region that is most salient to us or that we know most about — whether that is Adivigan or the UK. And while in the real world there’s probably an element of nationalism at play as well, the fact that these biases were seen even for fictitious territories suggests that that can’t be the sole explanation.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the findings also suggest a way to overcome this bias: by “unpacking” all the other alternative regions, rather than considering them as one entity. So, suggest the authors, learning about the history of other countries could help reduce the “inflated perceptions” you might hold about your own nation.</p>

[Brain scanning is <a href="https://www.dana.org/article/fmri-still-not-a-mind-reader/" target="_blank">still not a mind reader</a>.] An increasing number of media reports (and scientific studies) have shined a light on this fact: the mental life of one person differs from that of another, sometimes in startling ways. It's <b><i>always</i></b> been that way, but now it's <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank" title="The Shock of the Unknown in Aphantasia: Learning that Visual Imagery Exists">out in the open</a>. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">The cat is out of the bag.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALCOj5AvBTI/XvtnS1WdygI/AAAAAAAANLE/vrJmmk8cCEoz5WUY6h-THwoe4HvOW1d8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/cat%2Bis%2Bout%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbag.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="418" data-original-width="720" height="231" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ALCOj5AvBTI/XvtnS1WdygI/AAAAAAAANLE/vrJmmk8cCEoz5WUY6h-THwoe4HvOW1d8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/cat%2Bis%2Bout%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbag.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />When reading that sentence, did you have a fleeting mental picture in your mind's eye? Maybe it was clear, maybe it was hazy. Or maybe you saw no visual image at all... if that was the case, you might have a condition known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">Aphantasia</a>, the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery. This is a normal variant of human experience, albeit an uncommon one.<br /><br />What are the “consequences” of having Aphantasia? You may be more likely to choose a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945220301404" target="_blank">scientific or mathematical occupation</a>, although artists and photographers with Aphantasia certainly exist. Aphantasia is often associated with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303568" target="_blank" title="(A)phantasia and severely deficient autobiographical memory: Scientific and personal perspectives">poor autobiographical memory</a> (diminished ability to recall the past episodes of your life).<br /><br />Does Aphantasia affect your emotional reactions to ordinary experiences like looking at pictures or reading a story? If visual imagery is important for having an affective response to the shark story, would people with Aphantasia show physiological (bodily) signs of emotion while reading? <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract" target="_blank">Wicken and colleagues (2019)</a> asked this question by comparing the skin conductance response (sweaty palms) evoked by reading vs. looking at pictures. This was a pilot study reported in a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/726844v1.abstract" target="_blank">preprint</a> (not yet peer reviewed).<br /><br />If visual imagery is necessary for an affective response to evocative stories, then A-Phantasics should have diminished (or absent) skin conductance responses (SCRs) compared to Typical-Phantasics. In contrast, SCRs to unpleasant pictures should not differ between the two groups, because the picture-viewing experience doesn't require imagery. However, it's still possible that imagery-based elaboration (or verbal elaboration, for that matter) could amplify the SCR, especially since each picture was presented for 5 seconds.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PsrkMb454sQ/XvwLo6xfJ9I/AAAAAAAANLQ/XREQEyoVQ9QcU_QIBv9snHfFSnZr1Su2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/baseline%2Bphotos--%2Bfrightening%2Bphotos.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="458" data-original-width="616" height="237" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PsrkMb454sQ/XvwLo6xfJ9I/AAAAAAAANLQ/XREQEyoVQ9QcU_QIBv9snHfFSnZr1Su2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/baseline%2Bphotos--%2Bfrightening%2Bphotos.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />For the reading condition, stories were presented as sequential short phrases (to match reading speed across subjects). The control conditions weren't well-matched, unfortunately. This was especially true for Stories, where reading the task instructions served as the neutral comparison condition (instead of reading a neutral story).<br /><br /><br /><b>Participants</b><br /><br />The participants were 24 individuals with intact imagery (based on the <a href="https://aphantasia.com/vividness-of-visual-imagery-questionnaire/" target="_blank">Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217303581" target="_blank">binocular rivalry priming</a><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> scores within the typical range) and 22 self-identified Aphantasics (who were older, on average, than the control participants).<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span>  For the Aphantasia group, seven (out of the original 29) were excluded because their VVIQ or priming scores exceeded the cut-off. <br /><br /><br /><b>Results</b><br /><br />For the Pictures (Perception) condition, the physiological response to Unpleasant vs. Neutral stimuli was not significantly different for the two groups.

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>The once popular idea that our personality becomes “set like plaster” by the age of 30 has been refuted by studies showing that we do change —  <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/01/merely-desiring-to-alter-your-personality-is-not-enough-and-may-backfire-unless-you-take-concrete-action-to-change/">and can even purposefully change ourselves</a>. Many studies have identified shifts in Big Five traits across the lifespan. However, the often inconsistent results have made for ongoing controversy about <em>how</em> personality typically changes with age.</p>
<p>Now a new analysis of data from 16 longitudinal studies, with a total sample of more than 60,000 people from various countries, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/per.2259">reveals some important insights</a>. The work, published by Eileen Graham at Northwestern University, Chicago, and her colleagues in the <em>European Journal of Personality Research</em>, suggests that there are indeed some clear patterns of change through middle age and into older age for at least four of those five traits.</p>
<p><span id="more-39851"></span>For all the studies included in the analysis (from the US, the Netherlands, Sweden, Scotland  and Germany), participants had completed an assessment of at least a subset of the Big Five traits (extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness) on at least three separate occasions.</p>
<p>The researchers then compared the results, to consider the balance of evidence for the extent and direction of personality change over time. The way they did this was important. The team used a “coordinated integrative data analysis”, which allowed them to look for patterns in findings, but as the data was not pooled, they could also identify variations between different studies, and explore possible reasons for differences in results. They also looked for any links between personality changes and the participant’s sex and age group (under or over 60 years old) at the time of their first assessment.</p>
<p>The findings from the various studies were not all in agreement with each other. However, the team found fairly consistent evidence for some clear patterns of change for all of the traits, except agreeableness.</p>
<p>Both extraversion and conscientiousness showed a fairly steady pattern of decline with time. For conscientiousness, this decline was clearest among participants who were over 60 when they took the first personality test. This finding is consistent with several theories about personality change with age, the authors note, including the idea that for younger and middle-aged people, it’s advantageous to exhibit pro-social traits like extraversion and conscientiousness, but as social demands begin to wane in older age, so might these traits. Indeed, the team also found that openness, another prosocial trait, was stable through middle adulthood, before decreasing in older age.</p>
<p>Neuroticism showed a different, U-shaped pattern. Overall, the data suggests that neuroticism decreases through most of adulthood, then increases again in older age. This is consistent with the idea that in old age, we tend to become anxious about terminal illnesses and death.</p>
<p>The team found that sex was not relevant, except for neuroticism: females had slightly steeper declines through middle adulthood than males.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the samples also revealed some individual differences in changes for all five personality traits — so, though there were these overall trends in changes, not everyone in each sample, or across the samples, changed at the same rate, or even in the same direction.</p>
<p>More work is now needed to understand why. As the researchers write, “people change differently on different traits, personality is not stable for everyone across the lifespan (but is for some people), and accounting for or explaining these changes is difficult.”</p>
<p>More generally, though, the team would like to see more psychology studies using this approach. By not merging the individual data sets, this type of meta-analysis can not only help to clarify the picture of results in a given field, but also preserve the differences between studies, which could help with the increasingly popular exploration of differences — as well as similarities — between people.</p>

<img alt="Pride parade" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Pride-parade-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Pride Month is celebrated around the world in June to commemorate the 1969 <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/stonewall-uprising-50-years-lgbt-history">Stonewall Uprising</a>. Pride is both a celebration and a protest and encourages acceptance, solidarity, and visibility of LGBTQ2S+ people and their rights, including their right to healthcare.</p>
<p>Compared to the general population, it is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/about.htm">well documented</a> internationally that LGBTQ2S+ people experience poorer health outcomes, both psychologically and physically. These poorer health outcomes are a consequence of <a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/jhdrp/vol2/iss2/6/">healthcare disparities</a>. That is, LGBTQ2S+ individuals face unequal burdens in healthcare which increases the incidence, or prevalence, of poorer health outcomes.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a vicious circle that continues due to the lack of attention on the poorer health outcomes and underserved healthcare needs that LGBTQ2S+ people experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>In healthcare settings, LGBTQ2S+ people are more likely to <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303049">not receive appropriate healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbtq-rights/news/2018/01/18/445130/discrimination-prevents-lgbtq-people-accessing-health-care/">experience discrimination and harassment</a>. Barriers to accessing healthcare bring harmful experiences for LGBTQ2S+ people. These experiences can have detrimental effects, including <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146139">decreasing the likelihood</a> of seeking healthcare in the future, consequently leading to poorer health outcomes. This is a vicious circle that continues due to the lack of attention on the poorer health outcomes and underserved healthcare needs that LGBTQ2S+ people experience.</p>
<h2>What are some of the common barriers in LGBTQ2S+ healthcare?</h2>
<img alt="Barrier " class="aligncenter wp-image-11982 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/barrier-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>There are multiple unsolved barriers for LGBTQ2S+ people to access healthcare and here we touch on some examples. It is especially important to acknowledge that these barriers can be further exacerbated by a number of factors, including the current <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/how-covid-19-affecting-lgbt-communities">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, where, as an example, transgender people have been found to face <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(20)30182-0/fulltext">unprecedented and enlarged healthcare disparities</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are limited numbers of healthcare staff trained to deliver healthcare that recognizes the needs of the LGBTQ2S+ people. Considering the risks of facing discrimination, LGBTQ2S+ people <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08834-y">could hesitate</a> to disclose information such as sexual orientation and how they identity to healthcare staff. This makes it difficult for healthcare personnel to appreciate the specific needs of the patient and to provide the most appropriate and holistic care.</p>
<p>Secondly, The LGBTQ2S+ community continues to face severe inequalities in their access and provision of care, which is closely linked to governmental policy. Most recently, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/health/trump-health-care-transgender-rights.html">revised US Affordable Care Act</a> has narrowed the definition of sex discrimination to the extent that it omits protections for transgender people in the US.</p>
<p>Thirdly, LGBTQ2S+ people can also experience discrimination and harassment in the workplace. LGBTQ2S+ people are <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223372">more likely</a> to have a lower income, which can be a financial pressure and barrier to LGBTQ2S+ people accessing and using health services.</p>
<h2>How can we remove the barriers in the future?</h2>
<img alt="Removing Barriers" class="aligncenter wp-image-11983 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Removing-Barriers-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Researchers have previously presented an LGBTQ2S+ <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-57192-008.html">Health Equity Promotion Model</a>, guiding LGBTQ2S+ people to consider both positive and negative health-related circumstances to reach full psychological and physical health potentials. But more research and work is needed to involve LGBTQ2S+ people in guiding the research agenda to promote the recognition of specific healthcare needs, whilst respecting the differences amongst the community.</p>
<p>Significant efforts need to be made to reduce health disparities and remove barriers to healthcare. Society should work together to promote healthcare equity, address and prevent LGBTQ2S+ poorer health outcomes, support LGBTQ2S+ people to access safe and inclusive healthcare, and work to eliminate healthcare disparities. It is essential to translate negative research findings in this context into reformative and progressive practices.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p><em>This article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm </em></p>
<p>In 2014, the Samaritans launched what seemed like an innovative new project: Radar. Designed to provide what the charity described as an “online safety net”, users could sign up to Radar to receive updates on the content of other people’s tweets, with emails sent out based on a list of key phrases meant to detect whether someone was feeling distressed.</p>
<p>In principle, this meant people could keep an eye on friends who were vulnerable: if they missed a tweet where somebody said they felt suicidal or wanted to self-harm, for example, Radar would send it on, in theory increasing the likelihood that someone might get help or support.</p>
<p>In practice, however, things weren’t so simple. Some pointed out that the app could be used for stalking or harassment, allowing abuse to be targeted during someone’s lowest point. There were false positives, too — “I want to kill myself”, for example, is often used as hyperbole by people who aren’t actually distressed at all. And others felt it was an invasion of privacy: their tweets might be on a public platform, they argued, but they were personal expression. They hadn’t consented to being used as part of a programme like Radar, no matter how well meaning it was.</p>
<p>Samaritans shut down Radar just a week after launch. But since then, the use of social media data in mental health research — including tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts, and blogs — has only increased. Researchers hope that the volume of data social media offers will bring important insights into mental health. But many users worry about how their data is being used.</p>
<p><span id="more-39844"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Targeted tools</strong></h3>
<p>Social media’s role in research continues to grow. In February of this year, a team from King’s College London made headlines with a paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> that found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57835-9">days with particularly high volumes of depression and schizophrenia-related tweets also saw higher numbers of crisis episodes</a> at mental health service providers in London.</p>
<p>The benefits of using such data are clear, says Anna Kolliakou, lead author of the paper. The volume of data would have been otherwise impossible to obtain, for one, and there was potential to gain insight into the “opinions and experiences of communities that transcend location”.</p>
<p>The KCL team hopes that monitoring tweets at a population level could predict mental health service activity and help manage strained services. But others have looked at whether social media data could also tell us something about <em>individuals’ </em>mental health. A 2017 study looked at the course and onset of PTSD using Twitter data, for instance, suggesting that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5636873/">language of people’s tweets could provide early hints they would develop the condition</a>.</p>
<p>And in 2018 researchers found  that the use of “language predictive of depression” on Facebook – sadness, loneliness, hostility and more – <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/44/11203">could predict whether a user was depressed</a>, in some cases a full three months before they received a formal diagnosis. The paper’s authors suggested that such predictive data could be used to screen (consenting) adults for depression.</p>
<p>When it comes to studies looking to help at-risk individuals, Sarah Knowles, an NIHR Senior Research Fellow in Knowledge Mobilisation at the University of York, is “very sceptical of accuracy and validity, and what they’re intended to achieve”.</p>
<p>“I haven’t ever seen a convincing example of how targeting an individual on social media helps them personally, and it’s perhaps more likely to make them feel isolated or even attacked,” she says. “Some people use social media as an outlet for difficult feelings, and worrying about being ‘tagged’ as at-risk might shut this down, so you’re potentially removing a coping strategy.”</p>
<p>Knowles also points out that a high number of people who seek help find it difficult to access (figures vary, but the Mental Health Foundation suggests that <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/statistics/mental-health-statistics-people-seeking-help">75% of people with mental health problems in England</a> may not get access to the treatment they need). Framing mental health as a problem of “detection” is therefore missing the point, she argues. And programmes like Radar ultimately “comfort onlookers who are worried about someone, rather than help the person expressing a problem”.</p>
<p>Even if algorithms could help identify those who are at risk, there are still questions about whether such tools are wanted. A survey published in late 2019 found that although people may see the value of using algorithms to detect mental illness from social media data, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/30/public-wouldnt-trust-companies-to-scan-social-media-posts-for-signs-of-depression-survey-finds/">they don’t actually trust social media platforms</a> with their personal information.</p>
<p>These aren’t just academic arguments — Facebook is already using an algorithm in some countries to detect suicidal ideation in posts, with the aim of providing help to those who need it.</p>
<p>The company says that machine learning <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/09/inside-feed-suicide-prevention-and-ai/">is only one part of its efforts to help people who are struggling</a>: in a blog post, its head of product development writes that “technology can’t replace people in the process, but it can be an aid to connect more people in need with compassionate help.” For those with concerns about the ethics of machine learning in this context, however, that reassurance is not likely to go far enough.</p>
<h3><strong>Public or private?</strong></h3>
<p>In the studies that used Facebook and Twitter data to predict PTSD and depression, participants had consented: they knew what their data was being used for. But one of the appeals of social media data for many researchers is the ability to scrape information from so-called “public” datasets.</p>
<p>However, this might not be as straightforward as it seems, at least ethically speaking. A study in <em>Social Media and Society</em> found that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305118763366">many users don’t believe that researchers should use their tweets for research</a> without permission. Another was more mixed, with <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0105-5">some users feeling positively</a> about their data being used for mental health monitoring, at least when anonymised. But others were still not convinced.</p>
<p>Despite this tension, research using data scraped from Twitter without consent continues. One study <a href="https://mental.jmir.org/2018/4/e61/">used tweets from a hashtag</a>, “#MyDepressionLooksLike”, to identify communities tweeting about  depression; another <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3207.pdfhttps:/www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-3207.pdf">looked at the language used</a> by people who had tweeted that they were affected by PTSD, depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder.</p>
<p>Many of those who share online are sceptical. “I know that an argument in favour of this would be that once people speak on public platforms, they inherently give permission for that content to be used,” says Sarah-Louise Kelly, a content writer who lives in Glasgow. “But I disagree.” Kelly wrote a blog for many years, starting from her teens; many of her posts included accounts of depression, OCD, anxiety and trauma. She’s recently limited her tweets and blogs about mental health, but says she still tries to be open about “the peaks and troughs” of her mental health.</p>
<p>At 30, Kelly notes that she’s “from a generation that used the internet as a diary”: she’s “never grown out of the mindset” that sharing online can bring community, catharsis and solidarity.  She also feels uncomfortable about her data being used in research.</p>
<p>“If tweets or blogs of mine have been used in research, I really resent that I’ve never been contacted,” she says. “Where’s the gain for me and my community? I have to pay for my own therapy, I have to work out my own coping mechanisms, I learn nothing. I understand the importance of these studies and don’t want to undermine them. But social media users deserve to be treated as more than case studies when they’re discussing such intimate problems.”</p>
<p>Martin*, in his 40s, initially joined Twitter for news updates, but he soon found himself part of a community of people who shared his experiences with poor mental health. “It was really important to me because not everybody in my life knew I was unwell — I had a job at the time I was terrified of losing,” he says. Martin, in a new role and a new relationship, is now able to be more open, and he uses Twitter less to talk about his own experiences with mental illness. But, like Kelly, he’s unhappy with the idea that personal posts could be used as research data.</p>
<p>“There were things I posted online that, at that time, I wasn’t saying to anybody else,” he says. “I was talking about bad experiences with mental health services, stigma, knowing that I was speaking to an ‘audience’, if you will, that would understand what I’d gone through. The idea of that being scraped from Twitter and used in research doesn’t really sit right with me.”</p>
<p>It’s not that he doesn’t want to contribute to learnings about mental health — he points to several Covid-19 related surveys on mental health that he’s completed over the last few months alone. But consent is important. “I read a lot about mental health, I’m interested in the area in general, so this isn’t an anti-research stance. But any [research] I’ve been involved with — that I know of, anyway! — has been something I’ve willingly opted into. That should be the case with everything.”</p>
<p>Martin’s experience with healthcare services has also been mixed: he’s been “invalidated” by psychiatrists and other healthcare workers, and mentions that many of those from his Twitter community have experienced the same thing.</p>
<p>“Obviously researchers are not psychiatrists and they’re not responsible for my treatment or care,” Martin says. “But when you’ve been in a situation where you feel that you’ve not been treated with due respect or you’ve had your voice taken away from you, it’s even more important that anything that <em>is</em> related to mental health involves giving full consent. That’s something I know a lot of people feel strongly about.”</p>
<h3><strong>Reading the fine print</strong></h3>
<p>While some object to the potential use of their posts, others aren’t aware that it’s happening at all. The <em>Social Media and Society </em>study found that many users were unaware public tweets could be used by researchers, and <a href="https://howwegettonext.com/scientists-like-me-are-studying-your-tweets-are-you-ok-with-that-c2cfdfebf135">as co-author Casey Fiesler noted</a>, Twitter or Facebook privacy policies don’t seem to increase awareness, even when they are clear about how users’ data could be used. “As we know,” she wrote, “most people don’t read privacy policies.” Plus, she said, many people don’t have a good understanding of how far their social media posts really reach. Kelly also raises this point: “Lots of people treat social media like an extension of community; they think they’re speaking just to their followers.” When posts are used as part of research, however, that community inadvertently gets a lot bigger.</p>
<p>Knowles feels strongly that social media data should not be automatically available to use at all. “It’s [people’s private] information, and they should be able to have reasonable expectations about being informed if someone else wants to reuse it.” Think about a coffee shop, where you can sit and have a conversation with a friend about your health. “That’s public,” she says. “But we all know you shouldn’t sit down, eavesdrop, and assume you have the right to take away and use what was said.”</p>
<p>None of this is to say that researchers are throwing away all conception of ethical data collection when working with social media: Knowles says that many researchers are wary of using social media data at all, and that approvals from ethics committees for such work can be demanding too. She’s more worried about commercial organisations — like Facebook — using universities’ procedures as a benchmark for conducting social media research. If universities haven’t got a clear set of ethical standards yet, following in their footsteps may not be the best idea.</p>
<p>Kolliakou agrees that ethical consideration is paramount: “researchers have an obligation to handle this data like they would any other research project — privacy and confidentiality should be the utmost priorities.”</p>
<p>But she’s also hopeful that use of social media data could have a big impact on the prevention of illness or distress. “There have been great advances in developing systems that could automatically identify individuals experiencing a crisis,” she says. “The question is whether this is at all acceptable. This is a complex research issue still at its infancy, and until we have some concrete findings that it actually works, uninvited contact with users should not be made. Intervening with individuals unaware their information has been used is invasive and not appropriate.”</p>

<p><strong>Visual illusions occur because our brains construct stories about how things should look, based on our experiences and expectations, which don’t always match up with reality. </strong>And with a greater understanding of how we (mis)interpret the visual world, perhaps we can also come to understand the more complicated biases in our thoughts and behaviour that have led to the polarised political climate, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/20978285/optical-illusion-science-humility-reality-polarization">writes Brian Resnick</a> at <em>Vox</em>.

<p><strong>Many scientists have challenged the notion that only papers published in peer-reviewed journals are of good quality — or that peer-review <em>guarantees </em>good</strong> <strong>quality</strong>. And now the coronavirus pandemic has really highlighted the limitations of the publishing process. Researchers are making coronavirus-related preprints available as quickly as possible, to ensure that information is shared more rapidly than the review process would allow, while several high profile, peer-reviewed journal papers have recently been retracted. At <em>Wired, </em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/peer-reviewed-scientific-journals-dont-really-do-their-job/">psychologist Simine Vazire discusses the issues</a> with the traditional peer-review process, with some suggestions for how to improve things for the future.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>At the moment, most of us are on red alert when it comes to sounds of illness, with sniffling in the supermarket or coughing behind us in a queue the cause of significant alarm.</p>
<p>And while we might like to think we’re able to tell the difference between someone clearing their throat and somebody who is genuinely unwell, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.0944#d1e255">new research</a> published in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em> suggests we’re less good at identifying threats than we think.</p>
<p><span id="more-39832"></span>To investigate how well people can detect pathogen threats from cough and sneeze sounds, Nicholas M. Michalak from the University of Michigan and colleagues first recruited 148 participants to listen to 20 audio clips of coughs and sneezes taken from online videos. Half of these sounds were from people who were genuinely ill with colds or the flu, whilst the other half merely had allergies or had consumed powdery spices and were therefore non-infectious.</p>
<p>After each clip, participants indicated whether they thought the sound was from someone with an infectious or non-infectious condition, and were also asked how certain they were about their answer. Finally, they completed an index of disease concern, which measures worries about contracting certain illnesses.</p>
<p>But participants were no better than chance at correctly identifying infectious and non-infectious coughs and sneezes, with 45% accuracy across the board and no difference when it came to each type of sound. Participants were reasonably certain about their judgments — but, in fact, for those who were more certain were actually <em>less</em> accurate.</p>
<p>A second study looked at the impact of disgust on identification of infectious sounds. The team played the same sounds to 146 participants — only this time, in addition to identifying the sounds, participants were also asked how disgusting they found them. Again, participants were no better than chance (42%) at detecting infectious or non-infectious coughs and sneezes, and increased certainty was related to decreased accuracy. Disgust did have an impact, however: the more disgusting participants found a cough or sneeze, the more likely they were to judge it as having an infectious origin, regardless of whether it was actually infectious or not. A third study replicated these findings.</p>
<p>So it seems as if we’re more likely to perceive something as a threat if we find it more disgusting — but that that assumption fails to serve us in terms of accuracy. This may be a protective measure: it’s probably safer, in the long run, to presume something innocent is actually infectious.</p>
<p>The experiments here only contained audio, and the team notes that people may be much better at identifying infectious sounds when integrated with other sensory information — if somebody sneezes and also has a hoarse voice and bags under their eyes, we’re probably going to know they’re ill; if they’re holding a spoon full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_challenge">cinnamon</a> ready to do a viral challenge, they’re probably not.</p>
<p>Telling the difference between an innocent and infectious cough feels like a useful thing to be able to do, particularly considering the current situation. But, as this research shows, we’re not actually very good at it. “Thus, the next time you hear someone cough or a sneeze”, the team concludes, “perhaps leave the diagnosis to the doctor.”</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>How many secrets have your friends shared with you? The answer could reveal a lot about your relationships. We not only share secrets with people we’re close to, but swap secrets to strengthen relationships. In my new novel, <a href="https://emmayoung.net/here-lie-the-secrets">Here Lie the Secrets</a>, I do use the sharing of deeply personal secrets to advance the relationship of my two main characters… However, as we also all know, discovering that a friend goes on to share your secret can seriously damage your relationship.</p>
<p>Secrets, then, have an important role in our social lives. But, asks Zoe Liberman at the University of California Santa Barbara, when do we become aware of this? To what extent do children understand the significance of secrets — and the consequences of spilling them? <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/dev0000960">Her results</a>, published in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>, suggest be that it would be unwise to trust a four-year-old with any kind of secret — but with an 8-year-old, you’re much more likely to be safe.</p>
<p><span id="more-39823"></span>For the first of three studies, Liberman recruited 51 preschoolers (children start school later in the US than the UK, so these kids were aged between 3 and almost 6) and 67 school-age children, aged between 6 and almost 11. The children were introduced to three cartoon character children, whose gender was matched to the participant: a protagonist, their friend, and a classmate. The kids then either learned that the main character told their friend a secret, or that they told the classmate a secret. When the kids were asked whether they thought the confidante would keep the secret, Liberman established that the school-age group, but not the preschoolers, understand that friends are likely to keep each other’s secrets, while a classmate might not. They understand, then, that secret-keeping is important in friendship.</p>
<p>For the second study, on 80 preschoolers and 175 school age children, Liberman used the same kind of experimental set-up to investigate the children’s thoughts about the consequences for a friendship if one friend either kept or revealed the other’s “personal secret” (described as something they had never told anyone before) to another child. She found that by six years of age, children expect the telling of a friend’s secret to weaken that friendship (an expectation that the 3–5 year olds did not share). Liberman also presented the participants with scenarios in which a “fact”, rather than a secret, was shared. The older children realised that sharing a fact wouldn’t impact a friendship. They understood then, that secrets are special.</p>
<p>In these two studies, Liberman used the terms “secret” and “fact”. But perhaps the younger children didn’t really grasp the meaning of the term “secret”. So for the third study, she used previously validated examples of secrets, facts and surprises instead. Based on earlier work, she expected that the children would understand “He took something that wasn’t his”, for example, as a secret; “There is a playground at his school”, as a fact; and “He is having a surprise party for his dad” as a surprise. This study, on a fresh group of 123 preschoolers and 133 school-age children, largely replicated the earlier results. The older children, but not the younger ones, understood that sharing a friend’s secret with a third party would be damaging to a friendship. Again, they also recognised that sharing a surprise or fact would <em>not </em>have an impact.</p>
<p>“We provide the first evidence that school-age children understand that how secrets are kept and told is related to relationship maintenance,” writes Liberman. And her work does show progressive improvements in this understanding with age. Though it was weak or non-existent in the 3- to 5-year-olds, it was apparent by age 6, and then became stronger through to age 11.</p>
<p>More work is now needed to further explore children’s expectations about secrets. Do kids — as adults implicitly do — understand that secret-sharing is a way of strengthening nascent relationships, for example? And to what extent do children understand that spilling a secret can affect an individual’s reputation?</p>
<p>As Liberman writes, “Secrets are a particularly powerful type of social knowledge and future research investigating children’s inferences about secret sharing will shed light on this critical and understudied aspect of children’s social-cognitive development.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Prosocial behaviour can sometimes feel pretty paradoxical: you’re doing something to benefit somebody else, but it can come at a cost to yourself. That cost could be small — getting up to make a cup of tea, for example — or could be more significant in terms of time, money, or energy.</p>
<p>Research has already established that there are four main forms of “reciprocity” that drive people to behave prosocially: wanting to do something nice for somebody who had been kind to you (direct reciprocity); doing good in the presence of people who might reward your generosity (reputational giving); paying it forward after experiencing kindness yourself (generalised reciprocity); or doing something for someone you’d seen be generous (rewarding reputation).</p>
<p>But most of these motivations have been studied individually: what happens when — as in real life — they all occur at once? In a <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/23/eaba0504">new study</a> published in <em>Science Advances</em>, David Melamed and colleagues find that people intrinsically want to help each other — even when those drivers seem like they are competing with one another.</p>
<p><span id="more-39819"></span>To understand how these four motivations work together and overlap in a real life setting, the researchers asked participants to make a series of decisions about gifting tokens to other participants, who they did not realise weren’t real. For each decision, participants had a pool of 10 tokens: any they didn’t allocate to other users, they were told, they would keep for themselves. At the end of the study, these tokens would have a monetary value, so it was actually costly to gift to others but beneficial to receive tokens from others (received tokens were worth twice as much).</p>
<p>To mimic the four drivers of reciprocity, participants saw information about what others had done with their tokens in each series of decisions. To imitate direct reciprocity, for instance, participants were told another participant had given them a number of tokens, while to imitate reputational giving they were told one participant would know how many tokens they had given to another. Importantly, a series of decisions contained between one and four of these different scenarios, allowing the researchers to look at how the factors interacted with one another as they would in the real world.</p>
<p>Individually, motivators for prosocial behaviour were as expected: participants were more likely to give more if they knew they would be directly rewarded themselves (direct reciprocity), if they were given information about one or two others who had given to them (generalised reciprocity), if there had been others to witness their giving (reputational giving), and if they had seen another participant being generous (rewarding reputation).</p>
<p>More interestingly, however, these factors barely ever seemed to “crowd” each other out. For instance, it didn’t matter if participants saw someone giving tokens to others <em>and</em> were given information about those who had given to them directly — they still shared their tokens with both of those individuals. These findings indicate that people are likely to be driven to act in a prosocial way no matter how different motivators are combined.</p>
<p>This is particularly interesting when considered through the lens of self-bias: you might expect that someone would be less likely to reciprocate a favour done for someone else if they are <em>also</em> focused on repaying a favour that had been done specifically for them. But this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>So when you’re fed up with the world, it might be worth bearing these results in mind. Because even when it costs someone something, they’re still likely to help you out — and that potential for prosocial behaviour is most certainly a cause for cheer. “From an evolutionary perspective, it’s kind of perplexing that it even exists, because you’re decreasing your own fitness on behalf of others,” Melamed concludes. “And yet, we see it in bees and ants, and humans and throughout all of nature.”</p>

<p>If I had to choose between giving up alcohol or coffee, it would have to be alcohol. I just love coffee too much… But do I, really? Or do I just <em>want</em> it, which is different?</p>
<p>Despite being the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world, there’s ongoing debate about just how addictive caffeine is. It does share some of the criteria for dependence: regular users who skip their morning cup will often report withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, for example. “Caffeine use disorder” is even being discussed for potential inclusion in the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. But is it really addictive in the same fundamental way as a harder drug like cocaine?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881120922960">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em> suggests that it is. Nicolas Koranyi at the University of Jena, Germany, and colleagues found that heavy coffee drinkers <em>want</em> coffee a lot more than they <em>like</em> it. The implication is that they drink it mostly or entirely to feed their addiction, rather than for pleasure.</p>
<p><span id="more-39813"></span>Typically, as someone develops an ever stronger dependence on an addictive drug, they come to <em>want</em> it more, as brain networks involved in motivation become more sensitised, but to <em>like</em> it less. The team figured that this was, then, a useful framework in which to explore attitudes to coffee.</p>
<p>It’s not reasonable, though, just to ask people how much they want or like coffee, the team decided. They might easily confuse the two, and not know the answer. So the team designed a study to tap into the participants’ implicitly held associations between coffee and wanting or liking.</p>
<p>Fifty-six German students took part. About half were “heavy” coffee drinkers, who consumed three or more cups per day. The rest either didn’t drink coffee or had no more than one cup a day. The participants first reported on their levels of coffee-related complaints, such as withdrawal symptoms. Then they embarked on the computer-based assessment.</p>
<p>In the “liking” component of the study, participants saw a series of pictures of coffee and juice, interleaved with other trials in which they saw positive or negative pictures (e.g. puppies or human skulls). They had to use two keys on the keyboard to quickly indicate whether a given picture was either coffee or juice, or whether it was “pleasant” or “unpleasant”. For instance, during part of the experiment the right hand key was used to indicate that a picture was of coffee, but also to indicate that a picture was pleasant. This mapping changed during the experiment. Simply put, by comparing the speed of participants’ responses when “coffee” and “pleasant” pictures shared a key to when “coffee” and “<em>unpleasant</em>” pictures shared a key, the researchers could explore the extent to which they implicitly liked coffee.</p>
<p>In the “wanting” component, participants again had to rapidly sort a series of coffee and juice images, this time indicating whether they were “wanted” or “not wanted”. Again, these were interspersed with other trials, this time displaying either a letter or a number. Participants had to respond with the “I want” key for numbers, and if their response was correct they would get a small amount of money. If they saw a letter, they had to respond “I do not want”. These trials gave an indication of how much participants implicitly <em>wanted </em>coffee .</p>
<p>(It’s worth noting that this kind of task, known as the Implicit Association Test, has <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/05/psychologys-favourite-tool-for-measuring-implicit-bias-is-still-mired-in-controversy/">come under criticism in the past</a>. However, in previous work, some of the authors of this new study have argued that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02483/full#h7">the test holds enormous potential, if used properly</a>. And in this study, it was not used in the same way as in controversial research to supposedly explore implicit racism, for example.)</p>
<p>The results revealed that heavy drinkers had a strong wanting for coffee — much more than the light drinkers. But both heavy and light drinkers showed a similarly low liking for coffee. “To our knowledge, the findings… provide the first demonstration of a dissociation between wanting and liking for coffee for heavy coffee drinkers,” the researchers report. And this suggests that caffeine should indeed be placed in the same group as alcohol, cocaine and amphetamines, in affecting brain systems involved in motivational, wanting processes.</p>
<p>Caffeine likely has a much weaker effect on this system than those other drugs. “However, with regard to the underlying motivational and neurophysiological processes involved in dependence development, the main difference between highly addictive drugs (eg alcohol or cocaine) and substances with lower addictive strength (eg caffeine) may be mainly a quantitative than a qualitative one,” the team concludes.</p>
<p>As someone who typically drinks two cups of coffee each morning, I don’t meet the team’s “heavy user” definition. No matter how much I want it, I also know that I like it — especially a great cup. My favourite local cafe can’t re-open too soon…</p>

<p>Becoming a father is an extremely important life event for a man. Fathers can experience new emotions, feelings, and changes initiated by the transition into parenthood. Some evidence shows that around <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185905">10% of new fathers experience depression</a>, and yet this is still little understanding about this let alone appropriate support. Most new mothers perceive the father to be a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03701.x">crucial source of support</a>. Poor paternal support can exacerbate <a href="https://www.ajan.com.au/archive/Vol33/Issue1/4Wynter.pdf">maternal mental health problems</a>. However, many <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1229-4?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">fathers feel alienated and have little knowledge</a> about how they can support their partner at this time.</p>
<p>These days, around 98% of fathers are present at the birth of their child. If that birth becomes traumatic, the father witnessing these events can also become traumatized. While research exists about the impact of <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-88?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">birth trauma on mothers</a>, little is known about the impact on fathers. Some evidence shows that fathers encountered ‘<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1259-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">a rollercoaster of emotions, characterized by isolation and abandonment</a>’ when witnessing their partners’ birth trauma. Previous studies have shown that <a href="https://fn.bmj.com/content/97/6/F439">fathers get little information and support</a> in the event of a traumatic birth.</p>
<p>Fathers’ mental health matters for many reasons; we need to understand more about how we can help dads. My recent research has sought to explore that in more depth, while my campaigns urge better support for fathers. It’s not about support for fathers instead of mothers; it’s as well as. If we help fathers, we help mothers. If we help them both, we also help their children.</p>
<h3><strong>My research with fathers’ mental health</strong></h3>
<p>So far, my work has focused on three areas: what information and support fathers need to help their wife/partner should they experience poor mental health in the perinatal period; what support we need to give to fathers to deal with their own mental health in the perinatal period; and what information and support we need to give to fathers should their wife/partner experience what might perceived to be a traumatic birth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our research shows that fathers feel that they are not properly considered when it comes to providing information and support regarding their own postnatal mental health.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are currently finalizing work on our research focusing on what support we need to give to fathers to manage their own mental health in the perinatal period, while the other two areas have been addressed in our recent papers in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p><u>Fathers and birth trauma </u></p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02902-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our study</a> of fathers who witnessed their partner’s traumatic birth, 61 fathers took part in a qualitative study that asked them to reflect on what information and support they were given. From those responses, three main themes were identified.</p>
<p>1.  Fathers’ understanding after the experience</p>
<p>Dads told us that ‘nothing could prepare them’ for the experience. One father said, “<em>At no point was there any explanation to either my partner or myself to calm the situation</em>.”</p>
<p>Fathers also confirmed that they felt the experience was ‘not about them’, as one dad expressed his exclusion:  “<em>No. I’m the male. My presence was often not acknowledged let alone my feelings</em>.”</p>
<p>2.  Life after birth trauma</p>
<p>Many fathers expressed concerns about what happened after the event:  “<em>The trauma of my son’s birth put me immediately into what felt like sole-responsibility for my entire family 24/7, ultimately excluded me from colleagues and friends and I struggled to cope</em>.”</p>
<p>The trauma clearly had an impact on many of the fathers’ mental health. One father told us he was “<em>Upset, distressed and unable to cope very well. It was a feeling about the fragility of life during the birth and the overwhelming nature of the birth and the subsequent days</em>.”</p>
<p>For some fathers, the traumatic experience had an impact on the relationship with their partner and infant. For example:  “<em>I wanted to be with my wife but I felt guilty that I didn’t want to be with the baby. When I was with the baby I didn’t feel the level of love that everyone says you do and I felt guilty about that</em>.”</p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11975 alignleft" height="244" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/pic-300x244.jpg" width="300" />
<p>3.  Support fathers received vs. what they wanted</p>
<p>Fathers told us that they were not getting that support from healthcare professionals. One father said, “<em>I should have been more included from the beginning. A mother and father should both complete questionnaires regarding depression and a father should be asked how he is feeling or if there is anything that he wants to ask or doesn’t understand. These questions are solely aimed at the expectant mother whilst a father has to butt in and speak during a conversation he is only there to witness</em>.”</p>
<p><u>Fathers supporting partner’s poor postnatal mental health</u></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03043-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">second study</a> sought to explore fathers’ experience of their partners’ postnatal mental health. Twenty-five fathers took part in a qualitative study that asked them to reflect on what information and support they were given when their partner became unwell. From their responses to an online questionnaire, we revealed several important themes.</p>
<p>1.  Fathers not getting enough support</p>
<p>Focusing on the amount of support received, one father told us “<em>I didn’t know how to help her.</em>”</p>
<p>Other fathers felt that any support given was of a poor quality. One commented that the support offered “…<em>didn’t cover anything about the father and I felt lost</em>.”</p>
<p>2.  Fathers not getting enough information</p>
<p>Fathers told us that they felt poorly informed. For example, one dad reflected on how he desired a “<em>…basic understanding of depression and how to help when dealing with psychosis episode</em>s.”</p>
<p>3.  Having someone to talk to</p>
<p>Many fathers would welcome having someone to talk to. One father explained how “… <em>a specialist to sit with me and explain the situation and care plan</em>” would have been useful.</p>
<blockquote><p>International Fathers Mental Health Day is a global event illustrating why fathers’ mental health matters.</p></blockquote>
<p>4.  Health professionals not taking fathers seriously</p>
<p>Many fathers said that they experienced very little help from the health professionals caring for their partner. One said, “<em>My wellbeing was of little interest to midwifes, health visitors… I had not given birth so had no cause for sympathy. A leaflet for my wife and a page for the fathers to read which wasn’t enough</em>”</p>
<h3><strong>Global impact for fathers’ mental health</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, the outcomes from our latest research show that fathers feel that they are not properly considered when it comes to providing information and support regarding their own postnatal mental health, including the impact of birth trauma, and for helping their partner should she need support.</p>
<p>Today, June 22, is <a href="https://www.postpartum.net/news-and-blog/ifmhd/">International Fathers Mental Health Day</a> (IFMHD; the day after Fathers’ Day each year). In addition to research, <a href="https://www.andrewmayers.info/index.html">my work</a> involves campaigning for better perinatal mental health. I lead the UK side of IFMHD with global campaigner <a href="https://www.reachingoutpmh.co.uk/">Mark Williams</a>. IFMHD is led in the USA by Daniel Singley (<a href="https://www.menexcel.com/">The Center for Men’s Excellence</a>) with support from <a href="https://www.postpartum.net/">Postpartum Support International</a>. Bronwyn Leigh, Director of the <a href="https://www.centreforperinatalpsychology.com.au/">Centre for Perinatal Psychology</a>, leads from Australia.</p>
<p>IFMHD is a global event that shares blogs, videos, research and news items illustrating why fathers’ mental health matters. In recent years, truly powerful stories have been posted across <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ifmhd&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dadsMHday/">Facebook</a> and we have featured in some noteworthy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/when-postpartum-depression-stole-my-husband/2019/09/06/e560822c-be07-11e9-a5c6-1e74f7ec4a93_story.html">global print and broadcast media</a>. Publicity and evidence from IFMHD and other research-led campaigning has enabled us to influence change in mental health support services for fathers, at least in the UK. Research by groups such as ours helped persuade NHS England to begin screening fathers for their mental health for the very first time. We hope that our new evidence, highlighted here, will have similar impact, perhaps even beyond the UK.</p>

                <p class="text-right">-&nbsp;<a href="https://app.wallabag.it/bookmarklet?url=http://romainbrette.fr/academic-precarity-and-the-single-pi-lab-model/" target="wallabagit"><small>Wallabag.it!</small></a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://instapaper.com/hello2?url=http://romainbrette.fr/academic-precarity-and-the-single-pi-lab-model/" target="instapaper"><small>Save to Instapaper</small></a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://getpocket.com/save?url=http://romainbrette.fr/academic-precarity-and-the-single-pi-lab-model/&title=Academic precarity and the single PI lab model" target="pocket"><small>Save to Pocket</small></a>&nbsp;-</p>
                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/academic-precarity-and-the-single-pi-lab-model/">Academic precarity and the single PI lab model</a></h4>

<p>Brilliant young scientists are struggling to obtain a stable faculty position, all over the world. It seems that “publish or perish” was actually quite hopeful. Now clearly, at least in biology, it is more like “publish in Science, Nature or Cell every other year or perish”. Only a small proportion of PhD holders manage to obtain a stable academic position, and only at an advanced age after multiple postdocs. Of course, this competition for publishing in certain venues also has a great impact on science; encouraging dishonesty and discouraging both long-term creative work and solid incremental science. Everyone complains about the situation.</p>
<p>What should we do about it? What I hear most frequently is that governments should increase the budget and create more faculty positions. That is certainly necessary but I think it is a reductionist view that largely misses the point. Of course, at the time when you start hiring more faculty, the proportion of young scientists who get a faculty position increases. However, if each of them then opens their lab and hire dozens of postdocs, then this proportion quickly reverts to what it was before.</p>
<p>What is at stakes is the general organization of research, in particular the “X lab” model (e.g. the Brette lab), with one group leader (the “PI”) surrounded by a number of graduate students and postdocs (I will discuss only the research staff here), with a complete turnover every few years. It seems that in many countries, to get a faculty position means to start their “own” lab. This is not the case yet in France, but this lab model is spreading very, very fast. With the new law on research currently in discussion (“discussion” might not be the appropriate word, though), it is planned that about 25% of all new recruitments will follow this model (a tenure-track system).</p>
<p>The math is easy. In a stable world, each faculty member will train on average one student to become a faculty member. For example, if a typical lab consists of 1 PI with 3 graduate students, rotating every 4 years, then over 40 years the PI will have trained 30 students, one of which would become a PI. The “success rate” would therefore be 1/30. Even with just one student at any given time, the chance for a student to end up getting a faculty position is 1/10.</p>
<p>Of course, one does not necessarily pursue a PhD with the goal of obtaining a faculty position. It is completely respectable to do a PhD then go to the industry. In many countries, holding a PhD is an asset. It is generally not the case in France, though. One may also want to do a PhD not for career, but because it is interesting in itself. This seems perfectly valid. Note that in that case, implementing a subtask of the PI’s project and doing all the tedious bench work might not be ideal. In any case, it must be emphasized that in this lab model, training students for research is only a marginal aim of a PhD.</p>
<p>How about postdocs? A postdoc is not a diploma. It typically doesn’t improve employability much. Of course, it could be done just for its own interest. But the experience I hear is mostly that of a highly stressful situation, because many if not most postdocs are hoping to secure a stable faculty position. Let us do the math again, with a simplified example. Suppose each lab has just 1 postdoc, rotating every 4 years. Compared to the above situation, it means that 1 out of 3 graduate students go on to do a postdoc. Then each of these postdocs has a 10% chance of getting a faculty position.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at funding questions now. What seems very appreciated is that when you start a lab, you get a “start-up package”. There is a blog post on Naturejobs entitled “<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2015/11/16/the-faculty-series-top-10-tips-on-negotiating-start-up-packages/">The faculty series: Top 10 tips on negotiating start-up packages</a>” that describes it. We can read for example: “<em>There’s no point having equipment if you don’t have any hands to use it. One of the largest costs you can expect to come out of your start-up fund are the salaries of PhD students and postdocs. They’re the most crucial components of the lab for almost all researchers</em>.”. It is very nice to provide the PI with these “components of the lab”, but as argued above, a direct consequence is to organize academic precarity on a massive scale. This remains true even if the entire budget of the State is allocated to research.</p>
<p>The same goes for the rest of the funding system. Project-based funding is conceived so that you hire people to implement your project, which you supervise. Part of these people are students and postdocs. For example, an ERC Starting Grant is 1.5 million euros for 5 years, or 300 k€ per year. In France, a PhD student costs about 30 k€ / year and a postdoc about the double. Of course, to that must be added the indirect costs (25%) and the grant also covers equipment and your own salary. But this is generally sufficient to hire a few students and postdocs, especially as in many countries graduate students are funded by other sources. Then the budget goes up to 2 million € for the consolidator grant and 2.5 million € for the advanced grant. The ERC has become a sort of model for good funding schemes in Europe, because it is so generous. But is it? Certainly it is for the PI who receives the grant, but a world where this mode of funding is generalized is a world where research is done by a vanishingly small proportion of permanent researchers. It is a world that is extremely cruel to young scientists, and with a very worrying demographic structure, most of the work being done by an army of young people with high turnover. You might increase the ERC budget several fold because it is such a great scheme, it will not improve this situation, at all.</p>
<p>Ending academic precarity is a noble cause, but one has to realize that it is inconsistent with the one PI - one lab model, as well as with project-based funding. I want to add a couple of remarks. Precarity is obviously bad for the people who experience it, but it is also bad more generally for the academic system. The excessive competition it generates encourages bad practices, and discourages long-term creative work and solid incremental science. We must also look beyond research per se. The role of academia in society is not just to produce new science. It is also to teach and to provide public expertise. We need to have some people with a deep understanding of epidemiology that we can turn to for advice when necessary. You would not just hire a bunch of graduate students after a competitive call for projects to do this advising job when a new virus emerges. But with a pyramidal organization, a comparatively low proportion of the budget is spent on sustaining the most experienced persons, so for the same budget, you would have much lower expertise than in an organization with more normal demographics. This is incredibly wasteful.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? Well, first of all, research has not always been organized in this way, with one PI surrounded by an army of students and postdocs. The landmark series of 4 papers by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 on the ionic basis of neural excitability did not come out of the "Hodgkin lab"; they came out from “the Physiological Laboratory, University of Cambridge”. The Hubel and Wiesel papers on the visual cortex were not done by graduate student Hubel under the supervision of professor Wiesel. Two scientists of the same generation decided to collaborate together, and as far as I know none of their landmark papers from the 1960s involved any student or postdoc. What strikes me is that these two experienced scientists apparently had the time to do the experiments themselves (<em>all</em> the experiments), well after they got a stable faculty position (in 1959). How many PIs can actually do that today, instead of supervising, hiring, writing grants and filling reports? It is quite revealing to read again the recent blog post cited above: “<em>There’s no point having equipment if you don’t have any hands to use it.” </em>- as if using it yourself was not even conceivable.</p>
<p>In France, the 1 PI - 1 lab kind of organization has been taking on gradually over the last 20 years, with a decisive step presumably coming this year with the introduction of a large proportion of tenure tracks with “start-up packages”. This move has been accompanied by a progressive shift from base funding to project-based funding, and a steady increase in the age of faculty recruitment. This is not to say that the situation was great 20 years ago, but it is clearly worsening.</p>
<p>A sustainable, non-pyramidal model is one in which a researcher would typically train no more than a few students over her entire career. It means that research work is done by collaboration between peers, rather than by hiring (and training) less experienced people to do the work. It means that research is not generically funded on projects led by a single individual acting as a manager. In fact, a model where most of the working force is already employed should have much less use of “projects”. A few people can just decide to join forces and work together, just as Hubel and Wiesel did. Of course, some research ideas might need expenses beyond the usual (e.g. equipment), and so there is a case for project-based funding schemes to cover for these expenses. But it is not the generic case.</p>
<p>One of the fantasies of competitive project-based funding is that it would supposedly increase research quality by selecting the best projects. But how does it work? Basically, peers read the project and decide whether they think it is good. Free association is exactly that, except the peers in question 1) are real experts, 2) commit to actually do some work on the project and possibly to bring some of their own resources. Without the bureaucracy. Peer reviewing of projects is an unnecessary and poor substitute for what goes on in free collaboration - do I think this idea is exciting enough to devote some of my own time (and possibly budget) on it?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the problem of academic precarity, of the unhealthy pressure put on postdocs in modern academia, is not primarily a budget problem. At least it is not just that. It is a direct consequence of an insane organization of research, based on general managerial principles that are totally orthogonal to what research is about (and beyond: teaching, public expertise). This is what needs to be challenged.</p>

That’s because they have a fourth cone in their retina that responds to ultraviolet light (humans only have three cones). Experiments have shown that when ultraviolet wavelengths combine with other wavelengths like those of red or blue light, the animals appear to see distinct colours.</p>

<p><strong>We’ve just experienced the saddest two weeks on Twitter, according to a long-term project that has been tracking the sentiment of users for over a decade.</strong> The “hedonometer” compares the language used in tweets with a dictionary of sad and happy words. In the two weeks beginning May 26<sup>th</sup>, these words were, on average, sadder than at any point previously, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01818-3">reports Giuliana Viglione</a> at <em>Nature</em>. However, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">it’s debatable</a> how much we can glean from this kind of data.</p>

<p><strong>In the office, it’s easy to get informal feedback on your work: you just have to drop by your boss’s desk or chat to your colleagues over lunch. </strong>But in lockdown, where you have to arrange Zoom meetings or type out an email, things are different, <a href="https://theconversation.com/informal-feedback-we-crave-it-more-than-ever-and-dont-care-who-its-from-138932">write Nathan Eva and colleagues</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, memes have played an increasingly important part in online political discussion: in 2016, the <em>Washington Post </em>dubbed the 2016 presidential election “the most-memed election in U.S. history”, and CNN has already christened the 2020 race “the meme election”.</p>
<p>But politicians may want to pause for thought before they hit send on that jokey tweet. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08824096.2020.1767047">New research</a> in <em>Communication Research Reports, </em>from Ohio State University’s Olivia Bullock and Austin Huber,<i> </i>suggests that humour doesn’t always go down well online — and that this can impact what voters think of particular candidates and potentially how they vote.</p>
<p><span id="more-39800"></span></p>
<p>The researchers showed 407 participants the Twitter profile of a fictional politician, Alex Smith, displayed as either male or female and either young or old. Smith was not given a political affiliation. The profile contained five tweets related to various hot-button issues including education, healthcare and voting and campaign issues.</p>
<p>Half of participants saw formal, serious tweets on the topic (“we’re tired of getting bad healthcare! It’s time to fix our broken system”) while the other half saw informal tweets containing puns or plays on words (we’re <em>sick</em> of getting bad health care! It’s time to <em>heal</em> our broken system”).</p>
<p>After viewing the profile, participants completed a questionnaire about their perceptions of Smith. First, they indicated how humorous they found the messages, before rating how appropriate they felt the tweets were for someone running for office and how surprised they were by them (that is, how much the tweets violated expectations about a candidate’s behaviour). They also answered questions on perceived credibility and how knowledgeable, trustworthy and likeable they found the candidate. Finally, participants were asked how likely they would be to vote, campaign or donate to the candidate were they running in their area.</p>
<p>Participants did find the punny tweets more humorous compared to the more formal ones <span>—</span> but that wasn’t necessarily a good thing. Those in the informal condition felt the tweets they saw violated their expectations about how a candidate should behave far more than those in the formal condition. This, in turn, led to feelings that the candidate was less credible, and to reduced levels of support. These findings held across sex and age, neither of which had a significant impact on how participants responded to the tweets.</p>
<p>The study suggests that informal or jokey tweets could have a tangible impact on a politician’s success in the polls. But none of this is to say that well-executed jokes might not have a positive impact sometimes. <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/ejas/12158">Other work</a> has suggested that Trump and his supporters were actively boosted during the 2016 election by their successful memeing, and it’s a strategy his camp continues to use in the run-up to the next one. And in some cases, humour clearly <em>is</em> working <span>—</span> Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/12/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-twitter-social-media">widely lauded</a> for her often humorous social media presence. This could relate to a <em>lack</em> of expectancy violation: politicians like Trump and Ocasio-Cortez have built their brands on more informal (though very different) communication styles, meaning voters are not surprised by jokes online.</p>
<p>Puns, the “informal” form of communication used in this study, are not a particularly sophisticated form of humour, so future work might look at different types: irony, sarcasm or surrealism, for example. The relationship between jokes and political affiliation would also be interesting to look at: what impact humour has on floating voters, for example, or whether partisan voters have different interpretations of jokes that come from their own party or a rival party.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that political campaigns will become any less “online” <span>—</span> if anything, the influence of the internet is only set to increase. But caution is probably needed for political candidates looking to get a laugh <span>—</span> otherwise, they may <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/08/12/news/hillary-clinton-tweet-emoji-reaction/index.html">find themselves</a> the butt of the joke.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Whether we’re learning a new language, prepping for a job interview or simply trying to remember what we went into the kitchen for, many of us are keen to cultivate a better memory. And often strategies that add an element of effort or difficulty can help: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/22/the-act-of-drawing-something-has-a-massive-benefit-for-memory-compared-with-writing-it-down/">drawing things</a> rather than writing them down, for example, or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/10/these-two-revision-strategies-can-prepare-you-for-an-exam-much-better-than-just-restudying-your-notes/">generating questions</a> about study material rather than simply reading it.</p>
<p>So in 2018, there was much fanfare when a team from Australia’s RMIT University developed a difficult-to-read font, <a href="https://sansforgetica.rmit/">Sans Forgetica</a>, that they said could boost memory through such a “desirable difficulty”.</p>
<p>But new <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658211.2020.1758726?journalCode=pmem20">research</a> in <em>Memory</em> from Andrea Taylor and colleagues from the University of Warwick and the University of Waikato, New Zealand, has put the font to the test — and found little evidence that it actually improves our memory.<span id="more-39791"></span></p>
<p>Sans Forgetica was developed by a team of psychologists, marketers and graphic designers to create a feeling of “disfluency”. The font appears slanted and broken up, and, they claimed, this obstruction forces readers to process the information more deeply, promoting learning at the same time. Though previous research <em>had</em> suggested that disfluency can promote learning, there was mixed evidence on whether it was possible to create this effect with a font. The group of researchers behind Sans Forgetica believed that it was. Their results were never published, however, so the new team wanted to try and replicate those effects themselves.</p>

<p>An initial test established that Sans Forgetica is indeed more difficult to read than the standard font Arial; the team then conducted three experiments to establish whether the font had memory-boosting qualities too. First, 156 participants were shown a series of twenty word pairs, each of which was presented to them on a screen for 100 milliseconds. Each pair contained two associated words — <em>chip</em> and <em>potato</em>, for example — and half of the pairs were presented in Sans Forgetica and half in Arial.</p>
<p>After a short break of either ten, twenty or thirty seconds, participants took part in a memory test in which the first word of a pair was presented — their job was to type the second word. This test was presented in Times New Roman.</p>
<p>The results suggested that words written in Sans Forgetica were not more memorable: in fact, participants recalled <em>fewer</em> words that had been presented in the font than they did words presented in Arial. This was true regardless of how long the delay between tests was.</p>
<p>A second study looked at Sans Forgetica’s impact on longer, prose pieces. Three hundred participants read five educational prose passages (around 300 words long) containing some information in Sans Forgetica and some in Arial. After five minutes playing a card matching game, participants were tested on their memory of the information via multiple choice questions on the passages.</p>
<p>But despite claims that Sans Forgetica actively boosts memory, there was no difference in performance between the two fonts — participants answered 74% of questions about Sans Forgetica-printed information correctly vs 73% of Arial-printed information.</p>
<p>A final study looked at whether Sans Forgetica might have an effect on memory when people had to process information more deeply. The team asked 275 participants to read 500-word passages on different topics presented in a mix of Sans Forgetica and Arial. They were then asked to answer 12 questions designed to test their understanding of <em>concepts</em> contained in the passages, typing their understanding of a particular idea (e.g. “how does the process of gas exchange work?”) in an open-text box.</p>
<p>Again, participants’ memory for the conceptual information was no better when it had been shown in Sans Forgetica than when it had been shown in Arial: for information presented in Sans Forgetica, participants scored an average of 37.6%; in Arial, their score was 37.06%.</p>
<p>The results suggest that disfluent fonts — that is, fonts supposedly promoting desirable difficulties — aren’t actually that useful when it comes to retaining information. The team does note that individual differences, which they did not examine, could impact on the efficacy of Sans Forgetica or similar fonts. And if disfluent fonts promote <em>deep</em> learning, as their proponents claim, then an effect may also be more obvious after a longer break period — this could be a good focus of future research.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for a magic bullet to boost your memory, Sans Forgetica probably isn’t it.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about paper "Probabilistic Optimization Algorithms for Real-Coded Problems And Its Application in Latin Hypercube Problem".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm for read-coded problems called the Probabilistic Optimization Algorithm (POA). In the proposed algorithm, rather than a binary or integer, a probabilistic representation is used for the individuals. Each individual in the proposed algorithm is a probability density function and is capable of representing the entire search space simultaneously. In the search process, each solution performs as a local search and climbs the local optima, and at the same time, the interaction among the probabilistic individuals in the population offers a global search. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are studied in this paper and their effect on the search process is presented. A structured population is proposed for the algorithm and the effect of different structures is analyzed. The algorithm is used to solve Latin Hyper-cube problem and experimental studies suggest promising results. Different benchmark functions are also used to test the algorithm and results are presented. The analyses suggest that the improvement is more significant for large scale problems.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic was the elephant in the room throughout this e-Congress. Delegates sat behind their screens to view lectures and asked questions using a chatbox function. Only minor technical issues occurred, honestly to be expected in this new era of conference attendance. And while <a href="https://twitter.com/carmona_loreto/status/1268161577011773440">17,500</a> attendees connected on Day 1 of the e-Congress, the typical media channels, e.g. Twitter, appeared significantly quieter than <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/07/03/eular-2019-highlights-from-the-annual-conference/">2019’s edition</a>. Indeed, Editorial Board Members at <a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Rheumatology </em></a>remarked to me that clinical and household duties interfered with their ability to engage fully in this meeting. Good thing that all lectures and conference resources are online until 1 September 2020!</p>

Reference: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Landewe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof Robert Landewé</a></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>COVID-19 has become part of our medical reality, and the scientific programme demonstrated this. Prof <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Landewe">Robert Landewé</a>, University of Amsterdam, led an opening session on <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/05/annrheumdis-2020-217877.long">EULAR recommendations</a> related to the management of RMDs in the context of COVID-19. He noted that rheumatologists are well-placed to manage coronaviruses, given that i) they understand the immune system, ii) their medical speciality is used to treating multiple organ systems at once, and iii) rheumatologists often use the immunotherapy drugs currently being trialled in SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr Machado provided reassurance that rheumatic patients receiving immunosuppressant medications were not disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2</p></blockquote>
<p>Notable talks included <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=PMMAC99">Dr Pedro Machado</a>, University College London, who <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/29/annrheumdis-2020-217871.full">reported the first findings</a> from the <a href="https://rheum-covid.org/">Global Rheumatology Alliance database</a> on the outcome of COVID-19 and impact of rheumatic disease therapy on 600 patients across 40 countries. He provided reassurance that rheumatic patients receiving immunosuppressant medications were not disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers analysed rheumatic patient data and studied potential hospitalization and course of COVID-19 infection, valuable data given its scarcity to date. The intake of glucocorticoid steroids, of anti-malarial drugs (e.g. hydroxychloroquinine), and of TNA-alpha inhibitors were associated with an increased, no change, and reduced probability of hospitalizations, respectively. Most patients with RMDs recovered from COVID-19 irrespective of their medication choice, and treatment regimens should proceed with vigilance. As this study was associative and not causative, well-designed clinical trials are needed to inform future medical practice.</p>
<p>Prof <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfJohnIsaacs">John Isaacs</a>, University of Newcastle, then talked about the <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/23.2">increased risk of rheumatic patients</a> suffering from venous thromboembolism, a blood clotting complication that can kill one third of those affected. Since these blood clots play a serious role in how COVID-19 <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003">kills</a>, new research indicates that <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/8.2">TNF-alpha inhibiting drugs</a> reduce thrombotic risk by lowering inflammation. Increased awareness of such complications and maintenance of therapies is therefore recommended in people with arthritis.</p>
<p>Even before COVID-19, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirsten_Hoeper">Dr Kristen Hoeper</a> explained that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24659148/">~50% of patients with RMDs</a> received inadequate medical care. One new study from Germany demonstrated that patient care in rheumatoid arthritis by ‘rheumatological assistants’ (i.e. specialized nurses) is just as effective as treatment by rheumatologists. Given the pressures SARS-CoV-2 is currently placing on healthcare systems, EULAR, therefore, advocates an <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/61">integrated team approach</a> comprising rheumatologists and other health care professionals in the management and psychological support of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. As telemedicine grows in parallel, the face of patient care is changing rapidly.</p>
<h3><strong>Other interesting talks</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Virtual experiences cannot truly serve as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, as the lack of physical networking opportunities is a major drawback.</p></blockquote>
<p>An increasing number of patients with osteoarthritis are taking pain-relieving opioids, such as tramadol and codeine. Recent European <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/174.1">analyses</a> found that consumption of opioids in patients has increased from 15% (2007) to 25% (2016), even when <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/58.2">anti-inflammatory drug treatment begins</a>. The <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/Suppl_1/118.1">risk of death</a> during the first year of opioid treatments compared to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was significantly higher in another study. Calls for doctors to use these analgesics more safely is advised, given their abuse potential, and other pain control methods are encouraged.</p>
<p>The early implementation of patient and public involvement (PPI) in research, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and high-intensity exercise into rheumatology care was evident by the symposia on offer at this e-Congress. The field of rheumatology is ahead of the curve in recent years, so it may not take long until automated scoring of radiographic images and prescriptive exercise are incorporated in other clinical disciplines.</p>

<h3><strong>First thoughts on virtual conferences</strong></h3>
<p>Virtual experiences cannot truly serve as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, as the lack of physical networking opportunities is a major drawback. However, the scientific content did not significantly suffer by the switch to virtual. <a href="https://www.congress.eular.org/organising_committees.cfm">EULAR steering committee</a> should be commended for pivoting their content online and launching the <a href="https://www.eular.org/eular_virtual_research_center.cfm">Virtual Research Centre</a>, a hub to accelerate research into RMDs.</p>
<p>I personally adapted by re-connecting online with those I enjoyed meeting at EULAR 2019 and whom I was prevented from seeing this year. Others, such as <a href="https://emeunet.eular.org/">EMEUNET</a> (Emerging EUlar NETwork), hosted a networking event on the virtual world platform <a href="https://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. Behavioural adaptions such as these may be necessary in 2021, if we cannot meet in Paris for the next EULAR Congress.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/feature-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Perinatal anxiety, which refers to the experience of distressing anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and up to a year after childbirth, is fairly common. In fact, research suggests under ‘normal circumstances’ around 1 in 5 women may experience significant levels of anxiety in the perinatal period. However, it seems likely that this proportion may be even higher as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, and preliminary evidence we are collecting appears to support this idea.</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of perinatal anxiety, fewer than 50% of women experiencing symptoms will seek help or receive treatment (see the <a href="https://www.nct.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/hidden-half-campaign">NCT’s #hiddenhalf campaign</a> for more details). This is problematic, as research suggests that untreated perinatal anxiety may be associated with a number of long- and short-term consequences for both mother and baby, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032709001797">premature birth</a>, <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/99/9/800">excessive infant crying</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791845/">bonding issues</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00737-009-0109-y">developmental and mental health problems in children</a>. So it is important that we better understand, recognize, and support women who may be suffering from perinatal anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>To shed some light on this, we recently held focus groups to explore women’s experience of anxiety in the perinatal period and gain insight into their opinions of online support. While <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02990-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, was carried out before the pandemic began, some of the findings may be particularly relevant at a time when we are social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<h3><strong>Anxiety Triggers</strong></h3>
<p>The study identified a number of specific sources of anxiety for women in the perinatal period. These included:</p>
<blockquote><p>In lockdown, turning to the internet for information and online peer support may be particularly helpful.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>(1) A mismatch between mothers’ reality and their expectations of childbirth and motherhood.</em> Both social media and traditional media contain romanticized depictions of what pregnancy and having a baby should be like, which can set unrealistic expectations about motherhood and can lead women to feel anxious and like they have failed when their experiences don’t quite match up.</p>
<p>“<em>I just struggle with parenthood being completely honest. It’s like one of these things where there’s so much social media these days saying how you should be this and that. And for me that’s actually, like the biggest thing that really blocks me from thinking actually it’s OK, like this is normal.”</em></p>
<p><em> (2) Uncertainty and maternal confidence.</em> Related to point 1, many women described struggling with the adjustment to motherhood. In line with a plethora of research that shows a significant link between anxiety symptoms and feelings of uncertainty, women in this study found the unknowns of pregnancy and motherhood to be particularly anxiety-provoking. They felt generally underprepared which often translated into a lack of maternal confidence and feeling like they weren’t doing it ‘right.’ This uncertainty stemmed from a general lack of experience with and knowledge about key aspects of motherhood, from giving birth to changing nappies and feeding.</p>
<p><em>“That’s actually why people then struggle. I suppose we all go through our lives being good at a lot of things. You’ve established a career, you’ve established yourself, you’ve got qualifications. And then suddenly… this baby arrives and you’re not good at anything.”</em></p>
<p><em>(3) A lack of support. </em>Most women a spoke about motherhood being isolating at times, which was a large source of distress. Those who were far away from friends and family felt this was a particular source of anxiety. This may be of particular concern under lockdown, especially as most women in our study highlighted that their peers were the single most important source of support in the perinatal period.</p>
<p><em>(4) Mental health literacy.</em> A lack of recognition and knowledge about perinatal anxiety itself also contributed to anxiety symptoms, as women often didn’t know what was wrong with them. While many were able to find information about postnatal depression, few identified information about the anxious symptoms they were experiencing, which led them to feel distressed, confused, and increasingly anxious. This lack of knowledge and uncertainly about their situation acted as both a barrier to seeking support and as a trigger for spiraling anxiety.</p>
<h3><strong><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11960 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/iStock-471401853-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Online Support</strong></h3>
<p>One of the key aims of the study was to explore women’s opinions of existing and potential online strategies for supporting perinatal anxiety.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, women in the study thought the Internet could be a valuable source of support for women experiencing perinatal anxiety. Specifically, they felt that being able to access unbiased evidence-based information about parenthood and anxiety itself could alleviate some of the uncertainty that underlay their anxiety symptoms. However, they were generally unable to find information on perinatal anxiety specifically. To address this, we have now developed an open-access website that provides evidence-based information explicitly about perinatal anxiety. Visit <a href="https://www.openpaws.co.uk/">Open P.A.W.S.</a> for access to more information, screening tools, self-help guides, and exercises.</p>
<p>Furthermore, women were able to use the internet to access peer support, which also had the power to breakdown idealized notions of motherhood. While our research suggests using large forums (such as Mumsnet/Netmums) may be more anxiety-provoking than relieving, many mums found smaller targeted groups really helpful. These offered an opportunity to form virtual relationships with mothers in the same position as themselves, and hear more realistic stories of parenthood which could normalize their own experiences.</p>
<p><em>“So we just post whatever’s going on. So if you’re having a really naff day you’ll say Jesus Christ, the kids have done this, this and this. And someone goes oh tell me about it. And it’s just somebody, like, who’s feeling the same thing as you, so it’s not completely like… all the social media where it’s this perfect mum… it’s well I’m here with cereal stuck in my hair and it’s two o’clock in the afternoon. So at least with that it was other normal mums that were just like yeah, I’m doing the same thing as you. So you didn’t feel so alone.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Isolation and lockdown</strong></h3>
<p>In lockdown, when feelings of isolation are likely to further exacerbate anxiety symptoms, turning to the internet for information and online peer support may be particularly helpful. Finding reliable, realistic sources of information about perinatal anxiety (such as OpenPAWS) and targeted peer support (such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1732740973652517">The Perinatal Mental Health International Online Peer Support Group</a>) is likely to be particularly beneficial in alleviating symptoms of anxiety during this time.</p>

Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction<div id="content"><p>Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.quantlib.org/">QuantLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine">Open Source Risk Engine</a> (ORE), <a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system">libbitcoin</a>and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgc99cdfe"><h2 id="orgc99cdfe">About</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc99cdfe"><p>Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a <i>deep understanding</i>of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: <i>wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen</i><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup>. The situation <i>had</i> to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2">2</a></sup> to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">other complex domains</a>, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for <i>in vivo</i>communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. </p> <p>So that's that for the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. But, just <i>what</i> exactly are we researching? </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org038ff83"><h3 id="org038ff83">Scope</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org038ff83"><p>These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain "trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS" - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, <i>especially</i> when we lack competence to do so<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours "Computational Finance". Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/">Wolfram's writings</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. </p> <p>I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. </p></blockquote> <p>These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, <i>everything is interconnected with everything else</i>, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let <i>taste</i> be my guide<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are "intuitive" boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd3a5007"><h3 id="orgd3a5007">Structure</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3a5007"><p>An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. </p>  <p>Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org81de0c9"><h3 id="org81de0c9">Audience</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81de0c9"><p>The target audience for this material is the fabled <i>homo developus</i>, that non-existent "standard developer" - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the "finance" part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content <i>very</i> slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those <i>not in the know</i>, so slowness is unavoidable<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. </p> <p>With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. </p> <p>In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets "plain" software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance <i>or</i> mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04a295b"><h3 id="org04a295b">Mathematics</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a295b"><p>Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering <i>application</i>perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. </p> <p>Our core belief is that an <i>average reader</i> (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of <i>how things work</i> just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/">Experimental Mathematics</a>. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in <a href="https://codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix</a>, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3d4740f"><h3 id="org3d4740f">Cryptos</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d4740f"><p>Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i>. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as <i>cryptos</i>, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the "real" world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - <i>i.e.</i>, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs <i>vast amounts of data of the right kind</i>. Lets elaborate further on this point. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7" id="fnr.7">7</a></sup>. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a <i>simulated world</i> - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate <i>all</i> of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for "immersive" exploration. In fact, the <i>very processes for data generation</i> will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. </p> <p>Of course, generated data is not perfect - <i>i.e.</i>, <i>realistic</i> it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can <i>assume</i> the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos <i>as if they were regular currencies</i>, except where they are just <i>too different</i> - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org92cf76f"><h3 id="org92cf76f">Non Goals</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92cf76f"><p>If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you. Even when we discuss trading strategies and other similar topics, our focus is always on trying to understand how the machinery works rather than on how to make money with it. Similarly, if you are a quant or are trying to become one, you are probably better off reading the traditional books such as Hull or Wilmott rather than these posts, as our treatment of mathematics will be far too basic for your requirements. However, if you are an expert in this subject area, or if you find any mistakes please do point them out. </p></div></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orge684ba8"><h2 id="orge684ba8">Legalese</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge684ba8"><p>As with anything to do with finance, we need to set out the standard disclaimers.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>As shops re-opened in the UK this week, social media users were quick to pour scorn on the hundreds of eager shoppers who queued up to get in. Yes, it’s <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/shops-reopening-coronavirus">unclear whether it was a good decision</a> to re-open businesses — but there was a certain snobbishness to many of these posts. Most of the ire was directed at those lining up outside Primark, which sells clothes at prices more affordable to those on low incomes than most other high street stores. Meanwhile, queues also formed outside high-end shops like Selfridges and Harrods — but these shoppers somehow escaped the wrath of most social media commentators.</p>
<p>This situation seems to reflect a broader inequality in how we judge other people’s purchase decisions: we’re much more willing to scrutinise — or even dictate — how people on lower incomes spend their money compared to those on higher incomes. There are countless examples of this — think of the low-income mother who is criticised for treating her children to a rare meal out, or the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/why-do-refugees-have-smartphones-syrian-woman-explains-perfectly-refugee-crisis-a7025356.html">refugee who is shamed for owning a smartphone</a>.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/03/2005475117.short">new study in <em>PNAS </em></a>provides some clues as to the origins of this bias. Across a series of 11 studies involving more than 4,000 participants, Serena Hagerty and Kate Barasz from Harvard Business School find that we tend to believe lower-income people <em>need </em>less than those on higher incomes, and that this in turn restricts our perceptions about what is acceptable for this group to buy.</p>
<p><span id="more-39782"></span>In the first couple of studies, participants read about Joe, who was described as having either a low- or high-paying job. They learned that Joe had won a $200 gift card which he spent on a flat screen TV. They then rated five statements which measured how “permissible” they thought his purchase was (e.g. “He made a responsible purchasing decision” and “He deserves to buy what he did”). Those who read that Joe had a low income rated his purchase as less permissible than those who read that he had a high income, or who were given no information about his income.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, participants read about a woman looking for a child’s car seat who ultimately chooses to buy the more expensive of two options. Again, those who read she had a low income thought her decision was less permissible than those who read she had a high income. In fact, the team observed the same pattern for a range of products: participants who rated the permissibility of 20 different goods and services, from household appliances to pet products, indicated that almost all of these were less acceptable for a lower-income person to buy.</p>
<p>So people clearly think that purchasing the very same product is often less acceptable for a low-income than high-income individual — but why is that the case? The researchers thought it could come down to people’s perceptions of the <em>needs</em> of others. So, in the next few studies, they looked at which purchases participants deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The team repeated the car seat scenario, for instance, finding that those who read that the mother was on a low income believed that the purchase was less <em>necessary</em> than those who read she was on a high income. Similarly, in another study, participants read about a low- or high-income family looking for a new house, and were asked to rate how necessary it was that the house had 20 different features, such as a garage or storage space. Of these 20 features, 17 were rated as more necessary for the high-income family. Disturbingly, these even included basic requirements like “close to hospitals” or “a neighbourhood that is safe/secure”.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that people believe low-income individuals need particular items less than high-income individuals — and further studies showed that purchases that were considered less necessary were, in turn, considered less permissible.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers demonstrated that these perceptions actually influence people’s behaviour. In one study, participants could help a hypothetical family decide what to buy. Participants who read that the family was on a low income were much less likely to allocate money to “low permissibility” products like a television than those in the high-income condition. And when deciding whether to gift a low-income individual either a $100 grocery voucher or a $200 electronics voucher, only a quarter of participants went for the latter, even though it was worth twice as much. More than half said they would give a high-income individual the electronics voucher, however. “Paradoxically, the result was that participants effectively allocated more money to higher-income people than lower-income people,” the authors note.</p>
<p>These last findings have worrying implications when it comes to thinking about charitable donations or how resources are distributed to the less fortunate, write the authors. If people hold such a narrow view of the needs of those on lower incomes, then it’s easy to see how resources could be allocated disproportionately to the most basic necessities — food and housing, say — while ignoring higher-level needs that are seen as less “permissible” — access to the internet or to recreation facilities, for instance.</p>
<p>The research could also help explain why it is so common to hear politicians and opinion writers moralising about what poorer people should and should not spend their money on, or why state provisions for those on lower incomes often barely meet the most basic standard. “In essence,” the researchers conclude, “people seem to conceptualize necessity differently for lower-income versus higher-income others, such that the “wants” of the poor evolve into the “needs” of the wealthier.”</p>

A mixed-methods study</a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11942 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Cancer-treatment-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Trial participation has not been found to provide better outcomes for cancer patients than standard care. With nearly <a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer">one in six deaths estimated to be due to cancer</a>, interest in innovative cancer research and treatment breakthroughs is high. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12937">previous study</a> showed that the information given to cancer trial participants and their physicians can be misleading, with information heavily focused on positive outcomes, with little information on the possible adverse effects or disadvantages of taking part. This can blur the boundaries between treatment and research, resulting in the belief that the best treatment for cancer provided within the context of a clinical trial. Through interviews and a systematic review of the literature, Nielsen <em>et al</em>. explored how physicians and nurses perceived the benefits of clinical trial participation and whether clinical trial participation provided better outcomes for cancer patients. Interviews revealed that there is a widespread belief amongst nurses and physicians that treatment for cancer, in the context of a clinical trial, is better than standard care. Many believed that recruiting patients to trials is a way to give them access to cutting-edge treatment. A search of the literature found no support for the belief that treatment in clinical trials is superior to standard care, despite rapid developments in cancer treatment in recent years. Lack of trial reporting transparency was also said to contribute to the belief that participating in trials is associated with better outcomes. Patient information sheets for cancer clinical trials should be designed to be free of suggestions that trial participation is the best treatment option for cancer patients. The focus should be shifted to encourage trial participation to further knowledge, to the potential benefit of future patients.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Energy</em></strong> – <a href="https://bmcenergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42500-020-00013-4">Comparing negative emissions and high renewable scenarios for the European power system</a></p>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11945 alignright" height="194" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Renewable-Energy-300x194.jpg" width="300" />
<p>High renewable power system scenarios coupled with low levels of negative emissions technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, could deliver a net-negative European power system by 2050. Decarbonizing electricity generation is key to achieving the <a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf">Paris Climate Agreement</a> for limiting average global temperature rise to ‘well below 2°C’ above pre-industrial levels. Gaffney <em>et al.</em> modeled emissions reduction, technical operation, and system costs for the year 2050. The analysis was designed to also include short time windows, to gain insights into the impact of high levels of variable renewable energy sources. It was demonstrated that high renewable power systems, coupled with negative emissions technologies, such as biomass carbon capture and storage, can deliver a net-negative European power system at lower costs, without breaching published sustainable biomass and geological storage potentials in Europe, with the opportunity to contribute to power system inertia. This study offers a first step in the comparison of future decarbonization scenarios and highlights concerns with system operation, economics, and emissions reduction, at a European scale.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Family Practice – </em></strong><a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-020-01122-z">Safety, efficiency and health-related quality of telephone triage conducted by general practitioners, nurses, or physicians in out-of-hours primary care: a quasi-experimental study using the Assessment of Quality in Telephone Triage (AQTT) to assess audio-recorded telephone calls</a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11946 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Nurse-Triage-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Nurses, using computerized decision support systems, performed better on a large number of health-related items than GPs, in telephone triage. Out-of-hours primary care services are increasing in a number of regions around the globe. Telephone triage is instrumental in the management of patient flow and workload. However, ensuring triage services are safe and efficient remains a challenge. Some countries, such as Denmark, use GPs to primarily perform triage services. However, this is hotly debated since many countries report increasing shortages of GPs, and GPs have self-reported high stress and burn-out symptoms. Graverson <em>et al.</em> studied a random sample of audio-recorded telephone triage calls from Danish out-of-hours primary care services triaged by GPs, nurses using computerized decision support systems, or physicians with different medical specialties. Nurses using computerized decision support systems performed better than GPs in telephone triage on a large number of health-related items, had lower levels of undertriage but were perceived less efficient. Nurse-led triage offers a solution for high GP workload seems feasible, but further research is needed since fewer GPs may be required for telephone triage services, but more GPs may be needed to meet out-of-hours service demand.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Research Notes</em></strong> – <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-020-05093-3">Multiplex PCR for identification of two butterfly sister species: <em>Eurema mandarina</em> and <em>Eurema hecabe</em></a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11943 alignright" height="202" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Grass-Yellow-Butterfly-300x202.jpg" width="300" />A multiplex PCR method has been found to accurately and reliably distinguish between closely related species of butterflies. In insects, closely related species are often difficult or impossible to distinguish solely by morphological traits alone. Existing techniques, such as using mitochondrial DNA markers, are not always available for species with complex genomic histories. Miyata <em>et al.</em> developed a multiplex PCR method to amplify and distinguish the sequences of  the triose phosphate isomerase (<em>Tpi</em>) gene of two species of Japanese grass yellow butterflies (<em>Eurema mandarina</em> and <em>Eurema hecabe</em>). The method designed was found to easily, reliably, and cost-effectively distinguish between two species of butterfly. The <em>Tpi</em> gene sequences were found to be sufficiently variable to differentiate different species but invariable enough to allow designing primers within species. The <em>Tpi</em> gene offers a potential target for marker development of multiplex PCR to distinguish other closely related butterfly species when other approaches are unavailable.</p>

<p><strong><em>BMC Veterinary Research</em></strong> – <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-02364-w">Pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects of intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy: a randomized, prospective, masked, clinical trial</a></p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11944 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/Post-operative-veterinary-care-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Route of administration has been found to influence the analgesic efficiency of buprenorphine in dogs. Buprenorphine is used for postoperative pain management in cats and dogs, for example, in routine spays, known clinically as ovariohysterectomies. Previous studies have described the pharmacokinetics of the drug, however, the pharmacodynamics effect of this drug has not been consistently reported in these studies, which is important for understanding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the drug in companion animals. Steagall <em>et al.</em> randomized dogs in a masked clinical trial to either receive buprenorphine intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously before ovariohysterectomy and pain was scored with the Glasgow composite pain scale for dogs. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out on the dog’s blood samples. Subcutaneous administration of buprenorphine failed to provide sufficient analgesia due to erratic drug absorption. Dogs in this group received the highest amount of rescue pain relief compared to dogs that received buprenorphine intravenously or intramuscularly. At the doses administered, intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration are preferred for postoperative buprenorphine analgesia.</p>

They are in season and make for a delicious, healthy snack. The deep red color and the aroma of the sliced berries are striking. That’s pelargonidin 3-glucoside (<strong>1</strong>) and methoxyfuraneol (<strong>2</strong>) captivating the senses. There’s gamma-decalactone (<strong>3</strong>) in those berries too. In fact, there are <a href="https://edu.rsc.org/feature/what39s-in-your-strawberries/2020275.article">hundreds of other biochemical compounds</a> naturally present in this fruit. The situation is no different for other foods like turmeric, ginger, garlic, romaine lettuce, chocolate, coffee, and even wine.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11951" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11951 size-medium" height="188" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/fig1-1-300x188.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Source: www.ars.usda.gov/oc/images/photos/aug08/d1194-1</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Some compounds found in strawberries include pelargonidin 3-glucoside (1, PubChem ID <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/443648">443648</a>), methoxyfuraneol (2, <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/53929577">53929577</a>) and gamma-decalactone (3, <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/12813">12813</a>).</p>
<p>But what health effects can these compounds produce? The answers are many, of course, because the catalog of compounds in any one food is long and diverse, and testing every compound experimentally is prohibitive. However, some answers can arise from putting rigorous computational methods to the task of exploring nutrition’s “dark matter.”</p>
<p><strong>The dark matter in nutrition</strong></p>
<p>In metabolomics, this “dark matter” is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/41/12549.long">the massive amount</a> of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00179">spectral data</a> that cannot be assigned easily to known molecules. As relating to nutrition, this notion of dark matter recently has been explored in two ways. First, there are <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/usda-nutrient-data-laboratory">efforts</a> to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/bax044/3867710">expand</a> the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/">catalogs</a> of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-019-0005-1">compounds</a> present in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814619314001">raw</a>, fermented, processed, stored, and metabolized food. With this foundation, the second exploratory step is naturally to identify the biological functions of each compound. To make progress in step two, we elected to use the well-characterized universe of pharmaceutical compounds as an anchor to predictions about food compounds. Specifically, we asked the question: “Can we predict biological function of a compound by identifying structurally similar pharmacological agents?” And so, the design and coding of PhyteByte began.</p>
<p><strong>What PhyteByte does</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>PhyteByte is software built to predict biological effects of food compounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>PhyteByte is software built to predict biological effects of food compounds. The implementation is simple: the end-user inputs a protein target, and PhyteByte identifies food compounds with a relatively high likelihood of interacting with the target, thus predicting biological effects. PhyteByte leverages a random forest classifier to perform much of the heavy lifting. This model is trained to identify pharmaceutical compounds from databases like <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">ChEMBL</a>. Compounds are <a href="http://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Features/Fingerprints.html">encoded</a> as “fingerprints” – simple bit vectors that store complex cheminformatics sub-structure information. Our model learns the sub-structures that it is looking for – for a given target – and generalizes this to identify novel food compounds in our test dataset.</p>
<p>Importantly, PhyteByte is a prediction tool. Its output is a list of molecules and their source foods that are very likely to have specific biological effects, but it is not a tool to devise a meal plan or provide for dietary recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>The road ahead for computational nutrition</strong></p>
<p>PhyteByte is just one of numerous examples of new computational methods – like complex systems theory and machine learning – being layered atop genomics, metabolomics, and genetics data in nutrition research. In fact, one can make the point that computational nutrition is merely the natural offspring of the nutrition-omics marriage.</p>
<p>Computational nutrition likely will develop in several ways. One, given a phenotype or protein of interest, foods are proposed that may affect that phenotype or protein, and done in a targeted, macronutrient-free manner. Two, more detailed epidemiological and food frequency questionnaire data can support tests for connections between certain foods and health outcomes. Here, the foods under study contain compounds that potentially offer narrowly defined health benefits based on similarity to known drugs. Three, such computationally derived pharmacological-food compound links can inform drug development. For example, drug efficacy studies could instruct volunteers to avoid specific foods that contain compounds potentially exhibiting physiological effects like the drug.</p>
<p>Importantly, while some of the above scientific endeavors have been woven into nutrition research for some time, all of what is described here requires that efforts be put forth at a much grander scale. And, for such approaches to be most effective, there must occur a concerted, broad effort to identify and accurately quantify the roughly 2000 different compounds in each food, a theme central to the emerging foodomics field.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/home-office-5000278_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>All aspects of my professional work as an associate professor of biology have been altered by the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. I especially am investing my time in different ways and am working mostly at home. Working from home would have been severely prohibitive for me just a few weeks ago, due to lack of access to adequate internet connectivity in the rural area where I live. However, our local electric cooperative now provides fiber optic internet that my family and I are using to our full advantage, as we engage in professional &amp; school work—and the business of family life—simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote><p>Research aspects of my work suddenly became secondary to teaching responsibilities. All of my teaching switched abruptly from quality in-person experiences honed over years, to hastily contrived online substitutes cobbled together in a panic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Research aspects of my work suddenly became secondary to teaching responsibilities. All of my teaching switched abruptly from quality in-person experiences honed over years, to hastily contrived online substitutes cobbled together in a panic. The biggest challenge was delivery of emergency substitutes for field and laboratory coursework. Thus, I have been creating, documenting and demonstrating activities from home. This has meant <em>Drosophila</em> breeding experiments on the dining room table, seedlings in a window sill, and turning a corner of the garage into a video production set to capture animal behavior. During my unpaid summer, I will be investing significant time and effort in professional development opportunities that I hope will help me do a better job of continued, emergency, remote instruction that will be necessary in the coming academic year. In some instances, redundant planning for in-person, remote and hybrid instructional modes must be done.</p>
<p>Due to recent departures of employees and hiring freezes, I do not have the assistance of a laboratory technician or collections manager, who normally would support my teaching and research, which means I am doing that work myself, on top of usual and additional responsibilities.</p>
<p>My access to campus facilities is limited to once per week, and this is a special privilege so that I may care for the physical laboratory resources. Almost all research work on my campus has been discontinued or put on hold. The vast majority of students are prohibited from entering campus buildings, and their research in my lab has stopped.</p>
<figure><img class="alignleft" src="https://bmcserieseditors.biomedcentral.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=45/https://images.zapnito.com/uploads/9a4dfe9fafe44c3d29b43d7006b83255/48a2b8a3-f141-48f9-b8b0-45edb3e362c1.jpeg" /></figure>
<p>My research activity normally involves field work and use of specimens from institutional collections. These collections are closed, and I cannot visit them. Specimens borrowed from collections are not being used, and they have been boxed up and fill the lab benches normally occupied by students (see figure).</p>
<p>Due to certain travel restrictions, my field work has been delayed, and I was fortunate to obtain one-year extensions from grant agencies for time-sensitive aspects of these studies. However, an ongoing project at a local wildlife refuge will have at least a one-year gap.</p>
<p>My research collaborators around the globe are facing similar, if not more extreme, restrictions and challenges, not the least of which is lack of internet access. The majority of my collaborations are on hold or progressing extremely slowly. Professional meetings have been canceled or indefinitely postponed.</p>
<p>Graduate students have had to halt or delay projects. My undergraduate research students have had a variety of on-the-fly substitute projects to complete from home. In some cases, depth and breadth of study have been sacrificed so students could complete alternatives to fulfill degree requirements on time. Looking ahead, I am concerned about multiple cohorts of developing researchers worldwide who will have critical gaps in their experience and knowledge bases, due to the limitations we face.</p>
<p>Sabbatical leaves for research, including my own, have been delayed or are in question. Faculty promotion clocks have been altered and complicated. Submission of my own dossier likely will be delayed by at least one year. Our campus anticipates increased faculty teaching loads to help off-set financial impacts. We are not alone, and in fact, we may be among the fortunate.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not alone, and in fact, we may be among the fortunate.</p></blockquote>
<p>On a positive note, I’ve been able to make more rapid and substantial progress than expected on biodiversity data transcription, editing and management. Public access to important data from historical collections and literature will be available in greater quantity and sooner than expected. I may also be able to complete and submit some manuscripts that had been delayed due to now moot priorities. As an editor, I am beginning to see others have had the same opportunities. Clearly, Covid-19 will have a lasting impact on research progress and prospects for years to come, in ways we recognize and in ways we have yet to anticipate.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/feature2-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><em>“Listening to my baby heart sound was very helpful to me. I felt that my right was respected as I took in my baby monitoring. Thanks for this program. I am happy.”</em></p>
<p>These are the words of a young Liberian mother who, as part of an innovation to improve neonatal and maternal health, was listening to the heart beat of her own fetus at the end of every contraction during her labor, using a simple handheld sonicaid ultrasound device.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this approach needed?</strong></h3>
<p>In a low-resource country such as Liberia, where there are few midwives — according to the WHO and World Bank, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.NUMW.P3">only 1 midwife or nurse per 10,000 population</a>, the second lowest number in the world after Somalia — midwives are often too overworked and overstretched to monitor the fetal heart rate regularly in every woman in labor, even though doing this essential task is necessary to detect fetal distress that could lead to negative outcomes. As a result, changes in the fetal heart rate that could indicate problems are often missed, leading to <a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/newborn-care/">high rates of birth asphyxia</a> in newborn infants in such settings.</p>
<p>Training more midwives is a long-term but absolutely crucial strategy. As shown in the recently published <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/nursing-report-2020">State of the World’s Nursing Report 2020</a>, investment in nurses and midwives is vital to delivering Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an immediate option is to train mothers in labor to listen to their fetal heart rate at the end of every contraction and notify the attending midwife if they detect any changes. If confirmed, suggesting fetal distress, the midwife would then notify a senior clinician who would undertake an immediate clinical intervention to protect the fetus from harm.</p>
<h3><strong>A feasibility study</strong></h3>
<h3><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11905 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/Picture1-226x300.png" style="font-size: 16px;" width="226" /></h3>
<p>The first step of such a bold and unusual potential approach is to find out if mothers are willing to monitor their own fetus during labor, and if so, if they are able to detect any changes. Our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02921-z?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> emphatically shows that it is not only feasible for Liberian mothers, many of whom cannot read or write, to monitor their own fetus during labor and accurately detect changes, but that the majority found the experience positive and beneficial for their own wellbeing and that of their babies.</p>
<h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3>
<p>The comments from participating mothers are poignant and moving and, if you have time, the authors encourage you to read the full set of comments in the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02921-z#Sec28">additional files</a> linked to our paper<strong>.</strong> The vast majority of participating mothers (387 out of the 400 mothers who provided comments) found the experience positive. Many commented on how much they enjoyed listening to their baby’s heart beat or hearing their baby “breathing” inside them, and that it gave them hope that their baby was alive. Several commented that hearing their baby’s heart beat gave them strength and courage to carry on while they were experiencing labor pain.</p>
<p>Many women commented on the negative effects of the severe pain of labor and as a result, MCAI and the Ministry of Health have recently started an initiative to administer IV paracetamol, an analgesic which is appropriate to the Liberian setting, to mothers who are requesting pain relief during labor.</p>
<p>Another encouraging finding was that of the 26 of 461 participating mothers for whom changes in the fetal heart rate were identified, the mothers detected these changes in 24 of these cases. Identification of these changes led to swift clinical intervention and ultimately resulted in all 26 babies, some of whom had needed further management in the neonatal unit, surviving and being discharged home healthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Expanding the task-sharing program to include mothers in the monitoring of their own unborn babies seems to be a welcome extension, while also providing benefits to the mothers themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This finding also showed that maternal monitoring in itself is not enough as there also needed to be appropriate clinical interventions to manage any detected changes in the fetal heart rate. So in addition to maternal fetal monitoring, there also need to be in place robust clinical protocols, a skilled workforce, and appropriately equipped and supplied facilities to be able to appropriately manage any changes in fetal heart rate and deliver the Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care required to save lives and improve the quality of care.</p>
<p>Maternal fetal monitoring has continued in the two public hospitals that were involved in the feasibility study and, as a result of these positive findings and experiences, the Liberian Ministry of Health has agreed to expand maternal fetal monitoring to three more hospitals.</p>
<h3><strong>Expansion of task sharing</strong></h3>
<p>Innovative solutions to help overcome human-resource scarcities in low-income settings are not new. For example, because of the severe lack of doctors, the <a href="https://12dec1c3-e3f4-e784-7f3a-6e7903610962.filesusr.com/ugd/dd2ba4_40c5e3dabfc44420af2dc6de29201de2.pdf">established Liberian task-sharing program</a> involves training midwives in advanced obstetric care and training nurses in advanced neonatal care in order to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths and improve the quality of care. Expanding the task-sharing program to include mothers in the monitoring of their own unborn babies seems to be a welcome extension, while also providing benefits to the mothers themselves. As a young mother recently commented during the continuation of the maternal fetal monitoring program:</p>
<p><em>“I tell the midwife thanks for the care that was given to me. It empower me to listen to my own baby heart beat and I hope that other women will do the same.”</em></p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/627428622/0/oupblogpsychology/">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a></h4>

<p>A growing body of evidence supports my clinical experience that younger people, high schoolers especially, are having more psychological problems during the pandemic than adults. There are many reasons for this. Adolescents are in the developmental stage of forming a new social world away from their parents. Social needs tend to dominate their lives and yet currently this growth has come to a bit of a standstill. In addition, teenagers are not fully cognitively developed; their moods still dominate compared to the planning and attention that are controlled by the prefrontal cortex, which doesn’t fully develop until about age 25. We all need to create a new and different worldview, but adults have more history and neurological development to take the long view.</p><p>We can help support our teens in many ways. Here are some recommendations for how to communicate and foster mental health during this difficult time; many of them will benefit the entire family.</p><p>Listen.<strong> </strong> Remember that no matter how much teens might protest, they are still dependent on their parents; the family is still the go-to support system. We need to show our teens that they can still count on us; that are we are emotionally there for them. I don’t mean a rose-colored glasses approach, but a realistic and strong view. Listen rather than trying to solve problems and try to check in often. It may be painful to hear teens’ worries because in the current situation, we are all struggling with a variety of anxieties. Communicate that although this is an extremely challenging situation, we can get through it together.</p><p>Communicate what you know as well as uncertainty. We’re are all under enormous stress. Our children can see it in us. Rather than try to avoid the sadness, it is better to communicate what you can. For example, if you know that if you get sick a relative or family friend is ready to step in, that will reassure your teens. On the other hand, if your teen wants to know when they will be able to go out in groups, you can reply that you don’t know but are monitoring the guidelines. Clarify that all this hardship is about keeping us as safe as possible.</p><p>Remember coping skills and resilience. Although teens are still developing psychologically, they may be aware of their strengths and weaknesses. Under this enormous stress, however, they may overlook how they have coped during hard times in the past. You can remind them how, for example, when there was illness in the family, they read certain types of books, baked, or wrote in a journal. Many of us, in the hopes of protecting our children from pain, do not help them learn distress tolerance. Even though we are in the midst of a worldwide trauma, building on a teen’s existing strengths can help increase distress tolerance.</p><p>Pay attention.<strong>  </strong>Most of us are struggling with some level of anxiety or sadness. This is a natural response to a surreal situation. Clinical anxiety or depression is something different. If you observe panic attacks, extreme worry, or avoidance, those are some symptoms of an anxiety disorder.  Similarly, some symptoms of a major depressive episode include feeling sad or empty, feeling hopeless, experiencing changes in appetite or sleep, expressing guilt, and having suicidal thoughts. Remember, too, that in adolescents, irritability may be a more prominent symptom than sadness. Even now, you can contact your pediatrician for a referral to a mental health professional.<strong> </strong>Getting in touch with a previous psychotherapist or psychiatrist can be in enormously helpful, even if just for a “check in.” Most psychotherapists are now comfortable using teleconferencing or telephone sessions.</p><p>Don’t forget to take care of yourself. It is an axiom in mental health that if a parent is feeling psychologically healthy, so will a child.  This is an upsetting time and parenting is one of life’s most challenging (also rewarding) experiences. Try to include some time for yourself for restoration, fun or a conversation with a close friend. Reach out to family, friends, or close co-workers for specific assistance. Some of the tips suggested may not be easy or even possible for you given your economic or social situation. You may be a single parent. You may be a member of a minority group or frontline healthcare professional. If so family, religious groups, neighborhood networks, or community agencies can also provide the support that you need. Please don’t hesitate to get help; we can get through this if we all work together.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-consoling-her-sad-daughter_2826738.htm#page=1&amp;query=family%20help&amp;position=12">Image</a> by rawpixel.com via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/the-emotional-toll-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-teenagers/">The emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on teenagers</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/627428622/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/627428622/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/627428622/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/pandemic-practicalities-and-how-to-help-teenagers-manage-time-at-home/" rel="nofollow">Pandemic practicalities and how to help teenagers manage time at home</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/five-questions-about-ptsd/" rel="nofollow">Five questions about PTSD</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/seven-ways-to-talk-to-terminal-patients/" rel="nofollow">Seven ways to talk to terminal patients</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>Researchers already knew that mental health problems like depression and anxiety are linked to a greater risk of developing dementia. Now a new study suggests that negative thinking among older adults could also be related to increased risk. </strong>Participants who displayed more repetitive negative thinking patterns showed a greater decline in cognition and memory, <a href="https://theconversation.com/dementia-negative-thinking-linked-with-more-rapid-cognitive-decline-study-indicates-140511">writes researcher Natalie Marchant</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>, as well as more deposits of tau and amyloid in the brain — both biological markers of Alzheimer’s disease. It remains to be seen whether negative thinking is a cause or effect of these changes.</p>

<h4>A call to celebrate with reflection in the absence of convocation.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fK-Q38qYGjFLA9jd4yWJdA.jpeg" /></figure><p>I just graduated with a degree in Neuroscience without a plan to go to med school or grad school.</p><p>“Then what do you want to do with that?” People would always ask.</p><p>“Learn about the brain.”</p><p>That was my answer every time. To me, a degree was always a gem of knowledge before it was a stepping stone. I hope my fellow graduating class of 2020 feel that way about their degrees too — we need to, now more than ever.</p><p>With jobs and internships blasted to smithereens, convocations cancelled, and glamorous grad trips put on hold, graduation must take on a new meaning. It must be a reflection on the gems of knowledge we gained from our degrees: the lessons learned that will forever change the way we look at, live in, and leave the world. Here are 5 lessons I learned from my Neuroscience degree.</p><h4>Lesson 1 — Let Your Parents Take Pictures: Episodic Memory is the First to Go</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*r1DUFAbUtjw2XJVU" /></figure><p>I used to get annoyed when my mom wanted to take a selfie with us. I don’t any more.</p><p>“Why now?” we’d all ask as she whipped out her phone.</p><p>“To remember this!” she’d say.</p><p>As I studied aging and memory, I began to realize how good of a reason that really was.</p><p>Generally, most of us can achieve “healthy aging” by learning new skills, being creative, and thinking and working in different ways. We can sail into the sunset of life with relative sharpness of mind, and even memory. For example, we won’t forget how to drive a car or brush our teeth because our procedural, or “muscle”, memory remains in good shape. Semantic memory — memory for facts — doesn’t suffer much either, and can even get better as we age (think about your last game of trivia with mom and dad). One type of memory, however, is <em>not</em> immune to aging: episodic memory.</p><p>Episodic memory, or memory for personal experiences, is shown to decline in accuracy as we get older. So, while my mom may be able to mince garlic, drive to Costco, and name the singer of <em>Suspicious Minds</em> with ease, she may <em>not</em> always remember what she ordered on the second time we went to that Ramen place in Palo Alto, and who was there. But a cue, like a picture, can be the magic wand for recalling the night a few siblings and I slurped away with her just down the street from Stanford.</p><p><strong>Lesson 1. </strong>Be patient with your parents when they can’t remember the little things, and support their requested selfies so they can.</p><h4>Lesson 2 — Play Cards With Everyone : Remembering What Makes Us, Us</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HdBCRkRupUHybzqH" /></figure><p>If you were observing the beginning of a card game, you wouldn’t judge the players by their starting hands.</p><p>We’ve all been dealt a hand of cards. This hand isn’t chosen and doesn’t change. This hand is unique to us and has certain strengths and weaknesses. This hand is our genes.</p><p>Understanding the relationship between genes and behavior has changed the way I interact with others. Looking back at the times I discriminated against people because of their behavior, I could very well have been doing so because of their genes. I have been guilty of judging card players by their starting hands.</p><p>“Why is she overreacting?” I’d ask. “I wish he wasn’t so impulsive,” I’d think. I later learned in <em>Behavioral Neuroscience</em> that slow stress recovery and impulsivity are sometimes results of specific gene variants — a specific card in one’s hand. I learned that one fourth of the population holds the slow-acting variant of COMT, which is an enzyme that aids in stress recovery. It turned out all the “over-reactors” I was so quick to label were just working with a unique card in their hand. Then I learned that a certain variant of the DRD4 gene, held by around 20% of the population, is implicated in addiction, impulsivity, higher risk-taking and even schizophrenia. Come to think about it, all those people I thought were “impulsive adrenaline junkies” had been dealt a joker at the beginning of the game.</p><p>Other behaviors can hardly be traced back to a single gene, but follow the “common variant” model. Autism follows this model, wherein a certain “recipe” of common gene variants may be the culprit. Individuals with autism might have a 5 of diamonds, an 8 of spades, and a jack of hearts — common cards all of us hold. But that specific combination may be just the one to produce the set of behaviors we’ve come to define as “autism.”</p><p>While I never dared call an autistic person weird, I was no stranger to passing that judgment on “normal” people I found socially clumsy. Understanding the neurobiology of autism (or lack thereof) called for a shift in paradigm: “autism” is a set of traits, just like any other set of traits produced by any given hand of common cards. If every single person could have their genotype mapped and behavior closely observed, we would find more correlations between certain behavior sets and gene variant combinations. Then everyone would have a “disorder.” So if today I run into someone I’m tempted to call weird, annoying, or anything else, I can remember that these traits are the results of unique card combinations, a lot like the ones in my own hand.</p><p>Now, you’d might as well rescind my degree if I were claiming we were all puppets of our DNA. If there is any certainty in neuroscience, it’s that our brains are plastic: we can change the way experiences and genes have programmed us to think and behave (more on that in Lesson #4). A DRD4 holder can learn to tame his impulsivity. Someone with the slower COMT variant can work to reframe her stressors. And those who behave a little differently in social situations can find confidence and connection in society. Nevertheless, everyone has to start — and end — with the genes they’ve been dealt, and only time, experience, and patience can help us fulfill the potential therein.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2. </strong>Never judge a player by their starting hand and play fairly with everyone — we’re all learning to play our cards right.</p><h4>Lesson 3 — The Best Way to Do Dishes : Letting Dish Soap Do Its Job.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-45BSqN1OpsgRB0_" />Photo by Odua Images</figure><p>Imagine you had to learn how to wash dishes all over again, but this time only through observation. You’d soon find there are different styles.</p><p>You may enjoy the efficiency of the filler-uppers, who turn their sink into a soapy swimming hole for the evening. The brute-forcers might excite you as they pour soap straight onto the dish and scrub frantically under a running faucet. But understanding the chemistry may call you down a different path.</p><p>Soap cleans dishes — I didn’t need a chemistry class to tell me that. What I <em>did </em>need it to tell me was <em>how</em>. Water — a polar molecule — and grease — a nonpolar molecule — don’t mix. This is where dish soap comes in. Soap is an amphipathic molecule: it’s both polar and nonpolar. It can grab the grease and hold on with its nonpolar tail as its polar head follows water down the drain. Understanding this, we can see how soap can’t possibly do its thing when violently swished around in a pool or under a waterfall. It needs to do its job in steps: 1) bind to the grease, 2) get washed down the drain.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3: </strong>The best way to wash dishes is a quick rinse to remove the leftover food scraps followed by a soapy scrub sans water, and <em>then</em> a thorough rinse under the faucet. “Wash, rinse, repeat,” simple. But for me, it’s now a simplicity that isn’t blind. For me, the magic of dish soap is, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, a “simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity.”</p><h4>Lesson 4 — Why “It’s Not Good For Man to Be Alone”: On Potentiation and Proximity.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MRxZRyxVChxx8JTN" />Photo by ZoomSpectrum</figure><p><em>“Marketing degrees are useless.”</em></p><p><em>“He’s just following the crowd.”</em></p><p><em>“She’s just doing that because…”</em></p><p><em>“Musical Dance Theatre majors are wasting their time.”</em></p><p>Left alone, I would think thoughts like these. Left alone for longer, I would start to believe them. This is the dark side of potentiation, or how thoughts become “ingrained” in our brains. Understanding potentiation helped me break unhealthy trains of thought, and build healthier ones. To understand potentiation, however, you’ll need a crash course in neuroanatomy.</p><p>A rake is a great model for a neuron. The teeth of the rake represent the dendrites, the receiving end of a neuron. These dendrite “teeth” converge onto the head of the rake, which represents the cell body, a control center that processes input from the dendrites. From the head protrudes the long rake handle representing the axon, or “giving” end of the neuron. If the cell body “decides” to send a message to the next cell, it shoots an electrical impulse — an action potential — down the axon. The axon then communicates to the dendrite of the next cell. If you string a bunch of rakes together end-to-end, with the handle of one rake feeding into one of the teeth of the next, you have a neural pathway.</p><p>The first time I thought, “marketing degrees are useless,” an entire neural pathway fired. Zooming into the connections, or synapses, between neurons in the pathway, we can begin to understand how our thoughts become potentiated.</p><p>Take the first neuron in the pathway: when an action potential shot down its axon and reached the end, it released chemicals — neurotransmitters — that travelled across the synapse toward the dendrite of the second neuron. When the dendrite received the neurotransmitter, it sent input to its cell body, much like one of the skinny teeth of a rake feeds into the head. As I kept thinking, “marketing degrees are useless,” the cell body continued to receive input from this dendrite and charge began to build up. When the amount of charge reached a threshold, the cell body shot an action potential down its axon to communicate to the next cell, but this had repercussions. An action potential did not only shoot <em>forward</em>, down the axon rake handle, but also <em>backwards</em>, throughout the dendrite teeth in the form of a <em>backpropagating </em>action potential<em>.</em> So long as I kept thinking “marketing degrees are useless” without interruption, one of these teeth was still busy receiving input from the first neuron.</p><p>When the action potential of the first neuron met the <em>backpropagating</em> action potential of the second at their synapse, potentiation ensued: the connection between the first and second neuron was strengthened. The first now released neurotransmitter with every thought, the second neuron was more sensitive to that neurotransmitter, and as a result, it became a lot easier for me to think that marketing degrees were useless.</p><p>Until of course, I talked to a marketing student, and learned a new idea that would prove valuable at work.</p><p>I thought my neighbor was just following the crowd until I talked to him on the way to church and learned his genuine motivations.</p><p>I was sure why my friend was acting irritated until she told me otherwise.</p><p>I was so convinced that Musical Dance Theatre majors were wasting their time until I interviewed one.</p><p>It turns out, Musical Dance Theatre majors spend multiple days understanding the inner world of character they dance, sing, and act on behalf of. They do what I hadn’t done: get <em>proximate</em> to those who so desperately need their understanding.</p><p>Students of the Bible agree that when the Creator stated, “It’s not good for man to be alone,” he was hinting at a partner. But there’s another reason it’s not good for man to be alone: Partners and everyone else were meant to be loved, and when we are left alone to think about them, our thinking is flawed. When we are left alone for longer, we begin to believe ourselves.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> It’s not good for man to be alone because thoughts potentiate, so get proximate to others. Proximity will shatter your belief about someone and give you a chance to build something beautiful in its place.</p><h4>Lesson 5 — Mercy Softens, Trust Ennobles.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kIJcLvJTv0cgXpaH" /></figure><p>A few weeks into my last semester, I made a realization. In response to it, I wrote the following email to my professor and meant it:</p><blockquote>Hi Dr. ______,</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I made a mistake: </strong>I did not check the exam availability days. I assumed it ran for 4 days and thought I could still take it today. May I still take the exam, not for credit, but just as a benchmark for myself? I know you don’t allow exams to be taken home, so I can take it during a TA office hour or one of yours? Let me know what you advise.</blockquote><blockquote>thank you,</blockquote><blockquote>Isaac Wu</blockquote><p>He said yes.</p><p>The morning of the exam, I was upset. My roommates had done something I couldn’t let go of. As I walked with my professor of <em>Advanced Neuroscience</em> to the empty computer lab, my mind hardened with grudges. As we neared the entrance, he spoke up and told me the test I was about to take was actually going to be for credit and that there were no penalties.</p><p>Every thought was silenced — something had changed inside.</p><p>I felt the muscles in my face relax.</p><p>I let go of the roommate thing.</p><p>I was softened.</p><p>He was letting me off the hook when he had every reason not to, and it stopped me cold. At that point, the points were immaterial: My accumulated GPA was high and essentially set in stone and I’d already had a job lined up. Nevertheless, his mercy had softened me.</p><p>I was getting my things settled when he spoke up again, saying that he needed to go teach another class, and I should slide my test under his door when I was finished. He then said, “I know there are so many ways you can cheat, and I know you won’t use them. Do great.” He slipped out the door and I was alone in the large computer lab. I completed my midterm in silence, with a pencil and nothing else. I did my absolute best — his trust had ennobled me.</p><p>I grabbed my phone and took the above picture. I wanted to remember this moment forever.</p><p>I didn’t need the picture. I would continue to put forth incredible effort in that class to learn everything I possibly could, to perform as well as I could, and to do it all with the utmost honesty. A few months later, I only needed a fifteen out of one hundred on my quarantined, un-proctored final to pass the class. With the COVID-converted grading system, anything above a C would be a “Pass” that wouldn’t affect my GPA. Still, I studied as if every future neurosurgery patient or grad school application depended on it, though I knew I’d never have either of the two.</p><p>He didn’t have to let me take the test for credit but he did.</p><p>He could’ve gotten someone to proctor but he didn’t.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: </strong>Mercy softens, trust ennobles.</p><h4>Congrats, Grad.</h4><p>These gems won’t lose their shine.</p><p>Because there are more selfies to be taken</p><p>…more card games to be played,</p><p>…more house chores to be enriched by a scientific lens,</p><p>…proximities to be enjoyed,</p><p>…mercy and trust to be given.</p><p><strong>We are all graduating with something:</strong> a Neuroscience Degree at BYU, a marketing degree somewhere else (and a useful one at that!), more time at home with family. Whatever we emerge with during this world-wide pandemic is a graduation, a step toward a life more insightful and moral. Write down the lessons learned — these are the things worth celebrating.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/iStock-613687218-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>‘Choice’ has increasingly become a fundamental aspect of Western public health policy and practice since the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. For maternity care, it is a buzzword that has generated a growing body of research around how to best support decision-making and achieve informed choice among women. However, promoting more service user autonomy and care experiences that are aligned with personal values can lead to complex trade-offs, as choices are <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-143-4-200508160-00010">based</a> on more sophisticated, expanding services with less reliance on a clinician’s intuitive judgment. While sometimes maternity care professionals believe they are offering choice, in reality, women still have a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/324/7338/639">limited role</a> in decision-making and do not feel their care is presented as a choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Is choice really so complex?</strong></h3>
<p>We often hear about the ‘burden’ of choice, and how difficult it can be to make one in complex situations or when there are many options before us. Long-standing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10350446/">understandings</a> of decision-making and choice often assume that the decider uses a rational process to weigh up and decide between all available options. This idea of a ‘rational’ decision-making process is connected to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1955-01791-001">classical decision theory</a>, a concept developed during the 1950s. However, in reality, humans rarely make choices according to the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-10203-004">standards</a> of classical decision theory, even though the quality of their decision-making is judged based on the prescripts of this long-standing theory, despite its inadequacies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Women’s decision-making and choice about pregnancy and birth care is a dynamic process.</p></blockquote>
<p>‘<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-012-2077-6">Shared decision-making</a>’ is a collaborative approach where clinicians support service users to reach a decision about their care. While shared-decision-making principles have been well-established, there are <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/ktt23/chapter/Evidence-context">barriers</a> to implementing them in practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding decision-making and choice through research</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding decision-making and choice assumptions is important because there is growing evidence of the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7400">benefits</a> of <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early">different options</a> for maternity care in Western settings, as well as the notion of reproductive choice as a human right. As research studies increasingly collate evidence concerning the clinical outcomes of different care options, it should follow that we also bring together the findings about women’s experiences of choosing these options.</p>
<p>Reviewing a breadth of research all together can be helpful for elucidating complex phenomena, especially those that carry assumptions about what is optimal and what is not. Reviews also help researchers evaluate the quality of studies conducted on a specific area and determine whether there are any gaps in the literature.  The aim of <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-03023-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our review</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a><em>, </em>was to describe and interpret qualitative research on women’s experiences of decision-making and choice about their pregnancy and birth care. Given the prominence of choice in health policy, we wanted to shed light on how this has been addressed in research to date and what the findings indicate.</p>
<h3><strong>Findings and conceptual model</strong></h3>
<p>We reviewed 37 original studies and conducted a meta-synthesis of these studies’ findings. A <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-8-45">meta-synthesis</a> involves bringing all of the qualitative data from a review together and re-analyzing it, in order to discover essential features across the body of literature. Because decision-making and choice are complex phenomena, we developed a conceptual model based on our analysis to bring all of these features together into one, presented in Figure 1:</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11938" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11938" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/figure-300x169.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1, from Yuill, et al. 2020</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The model takes into account the three essential themes that emerged from the meta-synthesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‘Uncertainty’</em> encompasses several different experiences that are related to mothers’ concerns about the unknown and the course of pregnancy, childbirth and maternity care, all of which shape women’s decision-making and the options they ultimately pursue.</li>
<li>Women frequently discuss their maternity experiences in terms of control, whether it be losing it, maintaining it or reclaiming it. We chose to shift the perspective to <em>‘Bodily autonomy and integrity’</em> because ‘control’ is not always explicitly stated by participants, and experiences often refer back to the body.</li>
<li><em>‘Performing good motherhood’</em> is related to responsibility and risk, which are often <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698575.2013.859231">ascribed</a> to mothers to manage, as well as the gendered cultural norm that ‘good’ motherhood and birth takes place in a hospital with a team of medical professionals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model also recognizes that decision-making is an active process, so these themes are connected through three inter-linking actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>‘Information gathering’</em> illustrates the multiplicity of information-seeking and what women specifically gain from different sources.</li>
<li><em>‘Balancing aspects of a choice’</em> is concerned with looking at how women consider the different options available to them and, essentially, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of those they encounter.</li>
<li>In terms of decision-making, an important part of the process is <em>‘Aligning with a birth philosophy’</em>, or perspectives that inform the ways in which people understand the world and life in it, further shaping the information women access, the care opinions they ultimately choose and the ways they justify their choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important finding from our review is that decision-making and choice are temporal, or related to time. For pregnancy and birth, they are made within a defined period, and often invoke both the past, whether this is personal, familial, social or historical, and the future. Finally, our discussion highlighted the importance of embodiment in maternal health experiences and how this is connected to experiences of decision-making and choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>Our findings indicate that women’s decision-making and choice about pregnancy and birth care is a dynamic process that is not always straightforward. This means that the use of prescriptive and rigid theoretical frameworks, like classical decision theory, for decision-making and choice need to be rethought. Policymakers and practitioners alike should examine critically current choice frameworks to ascertain whether they truly allow for flexibility in decision-making. Health systems should embrace more fluid, personalized models of care, such as <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD004667/PREG_midwife-led-continuity-models-care-compared-other-models-care-women-during-pregnancy-birth-and-early">midwife-led continuity models of care</a>, to augment service users’ decision-making agency.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/06/10/black-lives-matter/">Black lives matter</a></h4>

<p>Today, June 10th 2020, black academic scientists are holding <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a strike in solidarity with Black Lives Matter protests</a>. I strike with them and for them. This is why:</p>
<p>I began to understand the enormity of racism against blacks thirty five years ago when I was 12 years old. A single event, in which I witnessed a black man pleading for his life, opened my eyes. I don’t remember his face but I do remember looking at his dilapidated brown pants and noticing his hands shaking around the outside of his pockets while he plead for mercy:</p>
<p>“Please baas, please baas, … ”</p>
<p>The year was 1985, and I was visiting my friend Tamir Orbach at his house in <del>Pretoria</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Tshwane_Metropolitan_Municipality" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tshwane</a>, South Africa, located in Muckleneuk hill. We were playing in the courtyard next to Tamir’s garage, which was adjacent to a retaining wall and a wide gate. Google Satellite now enables virtual visits to anywhere in the world, and it took me seconds to find the house. The courtyard and retaining wall look the same. The gate we were playing in front of has changed color from white to black:</p>

<p>The house was located at the bottom of a short cul de sac on the slope of a hill. It’s difficult to see from the aerial photo, but in the street view, looking down, the steep driveway is visible. The driveway stones are the same as they were the last time I was at the house in the 1980s:</p>

<p>We heard some commotion at the top of the driveway. I don’t remember what we were doing at that moment, but I do remember seeing a man sprinting down the hill towards us. I remember being afraid of him. I was afraid of black men. A police officer was chasing him, gun in hand, shouting at the top of his lungs. The man ran into the neighboring property, scaled a wall to leap onto a roof, only to realize he may be trapped. He jumped back onto the driveway, dodged the cop, and and ran back up the hill. I remember thinking that I had never seen a man run so fast. The policeman, by now out of breath but still behind the man, chased close behind with his gun swinging around wildly.</p>
<p>There was a second police officer, who was now visible standing at the top of the driveway, feet apart, and pointing a gun down at the man. We were in the line of fire, albeit quite far away behind the gate. The sprint ended abruptly when the man realized he had, in fact, been trapped. Tamir and I had been standing, frozen in place, watching the events unfold in front of us. Meanwhile the screaming had drawn one of our parents out of the house, concerned about the commotion and asking us what was going on. We walked, together, up the driveway to the street.</p>
<p>The man was being arrested next to a yellow police pickup truck, a staple of South African police at the time and an emblem of police brutality. The police pickup trucks had what was essentially a small jail cell mounted on the flat bed, and they were literal pick up trucks; their purpose was to pick up blacks off the streets.</p>

<p>Dogs were barking loudly in the back of the pickup truck and the man was sobbing.</p>
<p>“Please baas, not the dogs. Not the dogs. Please baas. Please baas…”</p>
<p>The police were yelling at the man.</p>
<p>“Your passbook no good!! No pass!! Your passbook!! You’re going in with the dogs and coming with us!”</p>
<p>“Please… please… ” the man begged. I remember him crying. He was terrified of the dogs. They had started barking so loudly and aggressively that the vehicle was shaking. The man kept repeating “Please… not with the dogs… please… they will kill me. Please… help me. Please… the dogs will kill me.”</p>
<p>He was pleading for his life.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Law</strong></p>
<p>The passbook the police were yelling about was a sort of domestic or internal passport all black people over the age of 16 were required to carry at all times in white areas. South Africa, in 1985, was a country that was racially divided. Some cities were for whites only. Some only for blacks. “Coloureds”, who were defined as individuals of mixed ancestry, were restricted to cities of their own. In his book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Born-Crime-Stories-African-Childhood-ebook/dp/B01DHWACVY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Born a Crime</a>“, Trevor Noah describes how these anti-miscegenation laws resulted in it being impossible for him to legally live with his mother when he was a child. Note that Mississippi removed anti-miscegenation laws from its state constitution only in 1987 and Alabama in 2000.</p>
<p>The South African passbook requirement stemmed from a law passed in 1952, with origins dating back to British policies from the 18th century. The law had the following stipulation:</p>
<blockquote><p>No black person could stay in a white urban area for more than 72 hours unless explicit permission was granted by an employer (required to be white).</p></blockquote>
<p>The passbook contained behavioral evaluations from employers. Permission to enter an area could be revoked by any government employee for any reason.</p>
<p>All the live-in maids (as they were called) in Pretoria had passbooks permitting them to live (usually in an outhouse) on the property of their “employer”. I put “employer” in quotes because at best they would earn $250 a month (in todays $ adjusted for inflation) would sleep in a small shack outside of a large home, and receive a small budget for food which would barely cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mielie-meal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">millie pap</a>. In many cases they lived in outhouses without running water, were abused, beaten and raped. Live-in-maids spent months at a time apart from their children and families- they couldn’t leave their jobs for fear of being fired and/or losing their pass permission. Their families couldn’t visit them as they did not have permission, by pass laws, to enter the white areas in which the live-in-maids worked.</p>
<p>Most males had passbooks allowing them only day trips into the city from the black townships in which they lived. Many lived in Mamelodi, a township 15 miles east of Tswhane, and would travel hours to and from work because they were not allowed on white public transport. I lived in Pretoria for 13 years and I never saw Mamelodi.</p>
<p>I may have heard about passbooks before the incident at Tamir’s house, but I didn’t know what they were or how they worked. Learning about pass laws was not part of our social studies or history curriculum. At my high school, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria_Boys_High_School" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pretoria Boys High School</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Milner,_1st_Viscount_Milner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Milner school</a> which counts among its alumni individuals such as dilettante <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a> and murderer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorius</a>, we learned about the history of South Africa’s white architects, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Must_Fall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cecil Rhodes</a> (may his name and his memory be erased). There was one black boy in the school when I was there (out of about 1,200 students). He was allowed to attend because he was the son of an ambassador, as if somehow that mitigated his blackness.</p>
<p>South Africa started abandoning its pass laws in 1986, just a few months after the incident I described above. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Suzman" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Helen Suzman</a> described it at the time as possibly one of the most eminent government reforms ever enacted. Still, although this was a small step towards dismantling apartheid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela</a> was still in jail, in Pollsmoor Prison at that time, and he remained imprisoned for 3 more years until he was released from captivity after 27 years in 1990.</p>

<p><strong>Order</strong></p>
<p>We did not stand by idly while the man was being arrested. We asked the police to let him go, or at least to not throw him in with the dogs, but the cops ignored us and dragged the man towards the back of the van. The phrase “kicking and screaming” is bantered about a lot; there is even a sports comedy with that title. That day I saw a man literally kicking and screaming for his life. The back doors of the van were opened and the dogs, tugging against their leash, appeared to be ready to devour him whole. He was tossed inside like a piece of meat.</p>
<p>The ferocity of the police dogs I saw that day was not a coincidence or accident, it was by design. South Africa, at one time, developed a breeding program at Roodeplaat Breeding Enterprises led by German geneticist Peter Geertshen to create a wolf-dog hybrid. Dogs were bred for their aggression and strength. The South African <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerboel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Boerboel</a> is today one of the most powerful dog breeds in the world, and regularly kills in the United States, where it is imported from South Africa.</p>

<p>After encounters with numerous Boerboels, Dobermans, Rottweilers and Pitbull dogs as a child in South Africa I am scared of dogs to this day. I know it’s not rational, and some of my best friends and family have dogs that I adore and love, but the fear lingers. Sometimes I come across a K-9 unit and the terror surfaces. Police dogs are potent police weapons here, today, just as they were in South Africa in the 1980s. There is a long history of this here. Dogs were used to terrorize blacks in the Civil Rights era, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/01/trump-vicious-dogs-protesters-civil-rights-slavery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent invocation of “vicious dogs” by the president of the United States conjures up centuries of racial terror</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Academia</strong></p>
<p>I immigrated to America in August 1988, and imagined that here I would find a land free of the suffocating racism of South Africa. In my South African high school racism was open, accepted and embraced. Nigg*r balls were sold in the campus cafeteria (black licorice balls), and students would tell idiotic “jokes”  in which dead blacks were frequently the punchline. Some of the teachers were radically racist. My German teacher, Frau Webber, once told me and Tamir that she would swallow her pride and agree to teach us despite the fact that we were Jews. But much more pernicious was the systemic, underlying, racism. When I grew up the idea that someday I would go to university and study alongside a black person just seemed preposterous. My friends and I would talk about girls. The idea that any of us would ever date, let alone marry an African girl, was just completely and totally out of the realm of possibility. While my school, teachers and friends were what one would consider “liberal” in South Africa, e.g. many supported the ANC, their support of blacks was largely restricted to the right to vote.</p>
<p>Sadly, America was not the utopia I imagined. In 1989, a year after I immigrated here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yusef_Hawkins" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yusef Hawkins was murdered</a> in a hate crime by white youths who thought he was dating a white woman. That was also the year of the “<a href="https://time.com/5597843/central-park-five-trump-history/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Central Park Five</a>“, in which Trump played a central, disgraceful and racist role. I finished high school in Palo Alto, across a highway from East Palo Alto, and the difference between the cities seemed almost as stark as between the white and black neighborhoods in South Africa. I learned later that this was the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining" rel="noopener" target="_blank">redlining</a>. My classmates and teachers in Palo Alto were obsessed, in 1989, with the injustices in South Africa. but never once discussed East Palo Alto with me or with each other. I was practicing for the SAT exams at the time and remember thinking Palo Alto : East Palo Alto = Pretoria : Mamelodi.</p>
<p>Three years after that, when I was an undergraduate student studying at Caltech in Los Angeles, the Rodney King beating happened. I saw a black man severely beaten on television in what looked like a clip borrowed from South Africa. My classmates at the time thought it would be exciting to drive to South Central Los Angeles to see the “rioters” up close. They had never visited those areas before,  nor did they return afterwards. I was reminded at the time of the poverty tourism my friends in South Africa would partake in: a tour to Soweto accompanied by guides with guns to see for oneself how blacks lived. Then right back home for a braai (BBQ). My classmates came back from their Rodney King tour excitedly telling stories of violence and dystopia. Then they partied into the night.</p>
<p>I thought about my only classmate, one out of 200,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/edray-goins-black-mathematicians.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> who was actually from South Los Angeles</a> and about the dissonance that was his life and my classmates’ partying.</p>
<p>Now I am a professor, and I am frequently present in discussions on issues such as undergraduate and graduate admissions, and hiring. Faculty talk a lot, sometimes seemingly endlessly, about diversity, representation, gender balance, and so forth and so on. But I’ve been in academia for 20+ years and it was only three years ago, after moving to Caltech, that I attended a faculty meeting with a black person for the first time. Sometimes I look around during faculty meetings and wonder if I am in <a href="https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people?cat_one=Faculty&amp;cat_two=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">America</a> or <a href="http://www.biologicalsciences.uct.ac.za/bio/staff/academic/academic%20staff" rel="noopener" target="_blank">South Africa</a>? How can I tell?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Racism</strong></p>
<p>Today is an opportunity for academics to reflect on the murder of George Floyd, and to ask difficult questions of themselves. It’s not for me to say what all the questions are or ought to be. I will say this: at a time when everything is <em>unprecedented </em>(Trump’s tweets, the climate, the stock market, the pandemic, etc. etc.) the murder of George Floyd was completely <em>precedented.</em> His words. The mode of murder. The aftermath. It has happened many times before, including recently. And so it is in academia. The fundamental racism, the idea that black students, staff, and faculty, are not truly as capable as whites, it’s simply a day-to-day reality in academia, despite all the talk and rhetoric to the contrary. Did any academics, upon hearing of the murder of George Floyd, worry immediately that it was one of their colleagues, George Floyd, Ph.D., working at the University of Minnesota who was killed?</p>
<p>I will take the time today to read. I will pick up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316323543/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Long Walk to Freedom</a>, and I will also read #BlackintheIvory. I may read some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Paton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alan Paton</a>. I will pause to think about how my university can work to improve the recruitment, mentoring, and experience of black students, staff and faculty. Just some ideas.</p>
<p>All these years since leaving South Africa I’ve had a recurring dream. I fly around Pretoria. The sun has just set and the Union Buildings are lit up, glowing a beautiful orange in the distance. The city is empty. My friends are not there. The man I saw pleading for his life in 1985 is gone. I wonder what the police did to him when he arrived at the police station. I wonder whether he died there, like many blacks at the time did. I fly nervously, trying to remember whether I have my passbook on me. I remember I’m classified white and I don’t need a passbook. I hear dogs barking and wonder where they are, because the city is empty. I wonder what it will feel like when they eat me, and then I remember I’m white and I’m not their target. I hope that I don’t encounter them anyway, and I realize what a privilege it is to be able to fly where they can’t reach me. Then I notice that I’m slowly falling, and barely clearing the slopes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckleneuk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Muckleneuk hill</a>. I realize I will land and am happy about that. I slowly halt my run as my feet gently touch the ground.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ritesh Kumar will talk about impedance spectroscopy and its use in the design of electronic tongue and nose systems. Specifically, he will refer to the paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al. along with some of his previous works.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Impedance spectroscopy is a powerful technique which has been applied to the design of instruments for characterising liquids and solids. The ‘impedance fingerprints’  obtained at various frequencies can be used to classify, define sensitivity, selectivity, linearity of systems. It uses a sweep of sinusoidal frequencies as perturbation signal at low voltage so as to remain in the linear and causal domain. In this talk, I will be presenting about impedance spectroscopy and its use in the design of electronic tongue and nose systems in general and specifically the paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al. along with some of our previous works in the design of Electronic Tongue systems. The paper by Radislav A. Potyrailo et al.  shows that the run-of-the mill metal oxide gas sensors can act as high performance sensors using the impedance measurements. They show exemplary performance in terms of linearity, limit of detection, cross-sensitivity etc. This can pave way for the design of low cost and efficient electronic nose systems.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/homeless-5210796_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Worldwide, as many as 150 million people or roughly 2% of the global population are classified as homeless, and as many as 1.6 billion people (20% of the world population) lack adequate housing.</p>
<p>Homeless people are more likely than the general population to have mental disorders. Evidence suggests that the vast majority of homelesss people suffer from mental, neurological, and substance disorders including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder (BD), substance use, and personality disorders.</p>
<p>Specifically to BD, numerous studies have reported that the prevalence estimates of BD might be substantially high among homeless people when compared to the general population. The reported prevalence estimates of BD among the homeless people range from 2.41% to 42.42% depending on the study. Several factors contribute to this wide range of prevalence rates, including: (1) the use of different instruments to assess BD; (2) the presence of comorbidities and other mental, substance use and physical health problems; and (3) the difference in sociodemographics and other characteristics of the participants.</p>
<p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that the presence of BD among the homeless increases the likelihood that the person stays homeless for longer and increases the risks of mortality from suicide, drug use, and general medical conditions. It is also associated with an elevated risk of the vulnerability of the homeless person, such as criminality and violent victimizations.</p>
<p><strong>Why did we do this study?</strong></p>
<p>Although homeless people have been disproportionately affected by BD, the global prevalence estimate of BD among homeless people is unknown.  We therefore systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the existing epidemiological data on the prevalence of BD worldwide. The findings of the study may assist the concerned bodies in the planning and implementation of better screening and management strategies to address the burden and impacts of BD among homeless people.</p>
<p>We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus to identify pertinent studies that reported the prevalence of BD among homeless people in March 2019.  A meta-analysis using a random effect model was conducted to pool the prevalence estimated from individual studies.</p>
<p><strong>What did we find?</strong></p>
<p>Of 3236 studies identified, 10 studies with 4300 homeless individuals were included in the final analysis. The estimated global prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4%. This result is remarkably higher (11.35-fold higher) than the reported prevalence of BD among the general population. The prevalence of BD among the homeless was 10.0% in Europe and it was 13.2% in other countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The estimated global prevalence of BD among homeless people was 11.4% which is remarkably higher than the reported prevalence of BD among the general population.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What do our findings imply? </strong></p>
<p>In this study, we found that the prevalence of BD among homeless people was considerably high as compared to the reported prevalence in the general population. This result implies that greater attention and action are required to identify and treat BD among homeless people. In addition, the findings suggest the need for further studies evaluating the possible contributing factors for this remarkably high prevalence estimate of the disorder as well as better prevention and treatment strategies for this population group.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5JAZfOdbjp8/">Published Peer Review: 1 Year Across PLOS</a></h4>

<p>Last May, PLOS announced a new option for authors to publish their peer review history, and the support from our communities has been loud and clear. Since our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/12/celebrating-6-months-of-published-peer-review-at-plos/">update 6 months ago</a>, we’ve jumped from 800 to over 3,500 articles with published peer review history!</p>



<h4><strong>Why Publish Peer Review</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening access to the reviewer comments benefits readers who wish to dive deeper into a specific study. Comments from experts who reviewed the article that would traditionally remain unseen helps contextualize the research. Upcoming researchers can get a glimpse behind the curtains and see what sort of requests authors in their field were asked to address during revisions. If an author chooses to publish both a preprint and their peer review history, the process from first draft to final article can be learned from. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those involved in the peer review process also benefit, as the potential for reviews to be made public further fosters an environment where authors, editors, and reviewers respectfully collaborate to deliver the best possible manuscript for their community.</span></p>



<h4><strong><b>Our First Year Publishing Peer Review</b></strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By leaving the decision to opt-in for published peer review history with authors, we’ve seen a steady 39% opt-in rate among eligible manuscripts across all of PLOS. Of those 3,500 publications that agreed to participate in the last year, 60% have at least one signed review! </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this increased number of publications with peer review history under our belt, we’ve continued to see the highest opt-in rates in our journals publishing work in health or life-sciences. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within PLOS ONE, Oral Health (57%), Clinical Trials (51%), and Women’s Health (51% and 67 opt-ins) lead the pack in terms of opt-in percentage for subjects with over 20 opt-ins. We’re ecstatic to see so many articles dealing with public health providing access to expert reviewer opinions to further validate the studies.</span></p>



<h4><strong>Choosing to Collaborate</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe authors and reviewers should be in control of how their work is portrayed. Reviewers are given the choice to sign their comments, and authors choose to opt-in when they’ve received and had an opportunity to respond to all reviewer feedback, and their paper has been accepted. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this system, both roles work in tandem to drive a transition to more diverse, transparent peer review options. A reviewer who signs their name and provides substantial comments backed by evidence may entice an author to opt-in and have the reviewer’s comments published. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, an author may entice a reviewer to sign their name if their paper is already participating in other aspects of open science, such as publishing a preprint or sharing data and code in a repository. Regardless of your role on a specific paper, you have the choice with PLOS to enact transparency in peer review.</span></p>



<h4><b>The Transforming Landscape of Open Review</b></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different forms of Open Review are taking hold and changing the evaluation process. </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/reimagining-review-in-a-world-of-preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprint commenting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other opportunities are being realized due to the </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/peer-review/summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shift in research attitudes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The greater research community is more accepting than ever to Open Review concepts such as portable peer review (reviews that can be transferred across journals) or </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/convening-the-review-commons-community"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform providing independent peer review prior to journal submission. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing the essential role of peer review, reviewers have more opportunities to claim credit for their difficult and constructive work. These changes are all opportunities for researchers to cultivate transparency in peer review and, across all sectors of science, improve context and trust. </span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/06/08/strike4blacklives/">arXiv staff to participate in the #strike4blacklives</a></h4>

<p>The arXiv staff is deeply saddened and angered by the recent killings of George Floyd, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others. We recognize that Black people live with the injustices of systemic racism every day — and have for centuries — in North America and around the world.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that in research, as in life, people often perpetuate bias and systemic racism, both consciously and unconsciously. Members of arXiv’s own physics community asked us to pause business-as-usual this week and join scientists participating in the <a href="https://www.particlesforjustice.org/">#strike4blacklives</a>. Our US-based staff agreed.</p>
<p>arXiv is an essential, daily tool for most physicists, and Black physicists are faced with the simultaneous tasks of writing and reading papers, while also fighting for their rights.</p>
<p>“The strike is an idea that grew out of discussions among Black physicists and astronomers, and importantly one thing that it offers us is a day of rest,” says <a href="http://www.cprescodweinstein.com/">Dr. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein</a>, professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire and co-organizer of the #strike4blacklives. “I want a day where I don’t have to worry that I’ve missed an important paper on the arXiv because I am stressed out while my non-Black colleagues happily keep going. The strike is not just about gathering people together to begin to take action, but it is also about a day of rest for the people most affected by this heated moment.”</p>
<p>arXiv will not mail a daily announcement on the evening of Tuesday, June 9, 2020. Submissions received at or after 14:00 ET Monday, June 8 and before 14:00 ET Wednesday, June, 10 will be announced at 20:00 ET Wednesday, June 10.  We also encourage authors to pause their submissions on Wednesday, June 10 to participate in the #strike4blacklives.</p>
<p>We encourage arXiv readers to use the time they would normally spend reading the daily announcement or submitting an article to instead <a href="https://www.particlesforjustice.org/resources">read about and discuss racism</a> and <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/action">how they will work in their own local and professional communities to address it</a>. If you choose to participate, please consider tagging <a href="https://twitter.com/arxiv">@arXiv on Twitter</a> to let us know what you are doing.</p>
<p>arXiv was founded as an open and freely available service to disseminate scientific research, and, as such, is an equalizer and democratizer. The arXiv staff is proud of this heritage and at the same time we recognize there is still much work to be done. The staff is participating in the #strike4blacklives and #shutdownSTEM at the request of our community, and we encourage members of minority groups around the world who are underrepresented in science to <a href="https://bit.ly/arXivStrikeInput">reach out to arXiv</a> to help us understand how to serve you better.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Um3afkRT6xE/">PLOS and Carnegie Mellon University announce APC-free open access publishing agreement</a></h4>

<p><em>The following joint press release was issued on June 8, 2020.</em></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a two-year open access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to funds.</p>



<p>“The evidence is undeniable — open access research enables the convergence of disciplines that drives scientific innovations,” said Keith Webster, dean of Libraries and director of Emerging and Integrative Media Initiatives for Carnegie Mellon University. “This agreement with PLOS gives our researchers more avenues to provide their work to the public, and, in doing so, increases readership and opportunities for societal impact.”</p>



<p>Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Carnegie Mellon will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the two-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. CMU researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these two years and will not be charged any APC. This pilot will further PLOS’ mission of making open access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages and geographies.  </p>



<p>“The agreement with Carnegie Mellon University is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in open access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreements with the University of California and Iowa State University,” said Sara Rouhi, director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/06/AdobeStock_52342066-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I am a nurse scientist and health services researcher. I was born and raised in a series of small towns in rural Washington State in the U.S. In September 2009, I returned to the Pacific Northwest to pursue a PhD. It was the height of the Great Recession (2008-2009) and I quickly became concerned that the recession was making it harder for people to access care in the kinds of resource-poor areas similar to where I grew up. I decided to focus my dissertation work on this area and started by carrying out interviews with public health stakeholders around Washington State. Interviews yielded widespread concern about the effects of the recession — particularly among maternal and child health (MCH) populations. Disparities in MCH outcomes like timing of entry to prenatal care (PNC), birth weight (BW), and infant mortality are long-standing and have been <a href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/maternal-infant-and-child-health">documented</a> by race/ethnicity, geography and other social characteristics groupings like education and insurance status.</p>
<h3><strong>My research</strong></h3>
<p>To explore the effects of the recession, I obtained de-identified birth certificate data from Washington State and Florida. Birth certificate data was a good fit because it allowed me to link to county level data including unemployment rate, local health department expenditures, and other community characteristics that were likely to change during the recession. Over the course of three related papers, published in <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/12552"><em>Race and Social Problems</em></a> and <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a><em>, </em>my co-authors and I analyzed relationships between MCH outcomes and disparities before, during, and after the Great Recession.</p>
<h3><strong>What did we find?</strong></h3>
<h4>Increases in disparities – worse outcomes</h4>
<p>In our <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12552-019-09272-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">first paper</a>, we used <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446274">Healthy People protocols</a> to assess the degree of disparities and the extent to which changes occurred during and after the Great Recession for seven MCH outcomes. As expected, we found that disparities increased for some groups during the recession. However, we surprised to find that there were more total increases in disparities in Washington than in Florida and more disparity increases after the Great Recession than during.</p>
<blockquote><p>WIC appears to have been beneficial for decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight.</p></blockquote>
<p>The majority of increases only occurred during one recession period (i.e. during or after but not both), but disparities for some groups and some outcomes increased during both recession periods. For example, among non-Hispanic Black mothers who entered prenatal care late or not at all (late/no PNC) disparities increased (outcomes worsened) during both recession periods. Disparity increases also appeared to predominantly cluster by race/ethnicity and individual social characteristics rather than by geography. Based on these findings, we focused further research on factors contributing to increasingly disparate outcomes in timing of PNC initiation.</p>
<h4><em>Predictors of late/no prenatal care</em></h4>
<p>In our <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2486-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">second paper,</a> we used regression modeling to estimate relative contributions of individual, community, and local health department (LHD) variables on the probability of late/no PNC in Washington and Florida. Here, we found consistent contributions over time of individual-level maternal predictors for late/no PNC, the largest of which were young age and low education. However, we did identify changes in associations before compared to during the recession for some community and LHD-level predictors (e.g., % voting Republican, LHD expenditures) in non-beneficial directions.</p>
<p>In contrast, women enrolled in the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic">WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program</a> had a lower probability of late/no PNC than those without WIC. These findings suggest that policy makers and providers should consider targeted outreach to pregnant women with high individual-level disadvantage characteristics—particularly those of young age or with low education.</p>
<h4><em>WIC and improved outcomes</em></h4>
<p>In the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-02937-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">third paper</a>, we studied interactions between enrollment in the WIC Program and individual characteristics in relation to birth weight. We focused on a high-need subset of the study population — those with Medicaid or no insurance. We found that WIC interactions were associated with higher birth weights for infants of mothers who were very young (age &lt;14), received late/no PNC, and among non-Hispanic Black infants. These effects are illustrated in the figure below for birth weight in grams among Black compared to White infants and infants of very young mothers compared to mothers age 30-34, with and without WIC, both before and during the recession. While disparities persisted during both periods, with or without WIC, the gap narrowed for infants of mothers who received WIC during their pregnancy.</p>

<h3><strong>What can we learn from this?</strong></h3>
<p>The ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated unfolding economic and social crises bear similarities to the Great Recession and there are many lessons to be learned from it and applied to the current situation. Three key takeaways from our studies are summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequality in the U.S. continues to be multi-generational, with disparities in access to care and outcomes apparent before and at birth.</li>
<li>During the Great Recession, disparities increased and widened in both Washington and Florida, despite differences in state-level economic circumstances and demographics, highlighting the need for dedicated public health funding and programs to support timely, ongoing data collection and analysis to identify and address disparities in care and outcomes at local, state, and federal levels.</li>
<li>WIC appears to have been beneficial for decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight among the very young, Black, and late/no prenatal care enrollees. However, these benefits did not appear to extend to all groups. Thus, targeted outreach and/or program modifications may be needed to expand benefits to additional groups.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><em>On June 2, 2020, arXiv’s executive director, Dr. Eleonora Presani, presented at the <a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas236">American Astronomical Society’s 236th meeting</a>, held virtually.

<h4><b>AAS Publishing Exclusive: A Discussion with the arXiv Executive Director</b></h4>
<p>by Alex Pizzuto</p>
<p>Day 2 of the meeting started strong, featuring a discussion with arXiv Executive Director <b>Eleonora Presani</b>, who detailed the current status and future outlook of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/">open access archive service</a> many of us know and love. Not only is Presani new to the role of executive director, but the role itself is only two months old, marking a step towards engaging with the scientific community more efficiently and productively. As someone equipped with both a PhD in astroparticle physics and more than 6 years of experience from a career in scientific publishing, Presani is extremely qualified to help execute the vision of arXiv.</p>
<p>Presani began her presentation with her own mantra on the dissemination of scientific research: “knowledge only exists if it is accessible.” As an organization, Presani believes that arXiv functions as the “enablers” for the sharing of this knowledge, and seeks to make accessible environments like arXiv; those which are for researchers, by researchers. To get a sense of the sheer volume of knowledge that passes through the arXiv servers, Presani quizzed her audience, revealing some dumbfounding statistics about the quantity of preprints that have been submitted:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.08.22-PM.png"><img alt="Tweets from Astrobites" class="wp-image-635 size-medium aligncenter" height="231" src="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.08.22-PM-300x231.png" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>The fact that about half of the funding for arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/donate">is from the community</a> is a testament to the fact that arXiv exists to serve the community.</p>
<p>Although many organizations have been slowed to a halt by the tragic global pandemic, Presani assures us that arXiv is still working hard. Over the last few months, arXiv has rolled out user-driven classification, which alerts authors when they assign their papers to a category that disagrees with arXiv’s classification algorithm. They have also been executing operational stability drills and developing a COVID-19 moderation plan, to make sure that no matter what is going on in the world, scientists can stay connected through their research.</p>
<p>Looking more to the future, we were then told about arXiv’s 3-year strategic plan (picture below). This plan is broken down into three distinct user categories (readers, authors, moderators) and discusses how each of these users can benefit in three different areas (control, impact, and collaboration). In order to successfully execute this plan, however, arXiv requires our help and wants to hear from scientific communities like the AAS, in order to learn what researchers believe are the highest impact deliverables.</p>
<p>There are also some specific tasks that the arXiv team is focusing on over the next 18 months. These include distributing some of their classification data to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a>, allowing users to contribute to classification algorithms. Additionally, arXiv will be rolling out an update to TeXLive2020 and is actively working on improving their user disambiguation techniques.</p>
<p>Focusing arXiv’s resources to decide which of these goals is completed first is no simple task. Presani highlighted how challenging it is to balance all of the lofty goals of arXiv with their limited resources and discussed how no changes should be rolled out until they are up to arXiv’s high standards, noting that “arXiv was launched in 1991, and when it launched, it was an extremely cutting-edge product and it stayed the same for 30 years. It’s important to find the right balance between being quick and keeping the high quality of the work.”</p>

<p>Interested in helping arXiv execute their vision? There are a variety of ways to contribute. Start by joining arXiv’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/user-testing">user testing</a> or read their <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/">blog</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/new">news/announcements</a>. They are also looking for volunteers to help with developing a better moderator workflow, and they are soliciting applications for volunteers (if interested, you can send your CV and a motivation letter to moderation@arxiv.org). Best of all, continue to use the arXiv and engage in discussion with the administrators about what your perfect arXiv would look like in the future.</p>

Some geneticists have very unorthodox ideas. These might sound like racism or eugenics to simple folks, but it is really high science. UK Biobank is apparently on board.

<p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about the paper "A Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck framework for modeling large scale extracellular electrodiffusion surrounding morphologically detailed neurons".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is cur- rently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracel- lular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneu- trality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentra- tions and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.</p>

Deprivation. Xenophobia. Contamination. These are some of the fears related to COVID-19. Scores of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vRmgzqnAyky3wO--t4pBDc2iw9rbMmKHjPw205p6wjQ/" target="_blank" title="Google Docs - not all are included here">COVID questionnaires</a> have popped up recently to assess fear, anxiety, stress, and depression related to the novel coronavirus and its massive disruption to daily life. Most are freely available for use as research tools, but few have been validated and peer reviewed.<br /><br />The COVID Stress Scales (CSS) developed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300463" target="_blank">Taylor and colleagues (2020)</a> were recently published in the <i>Journal of Anxiety Disorders</i>. The authors propose a new COVID Stress Syndrome, and present evidence that the CSS subscales are intercorrelated (which is suggestive of a “coherent” condition).<br /><br />To develop the CSS, representative samples of people in Canada (n=3,479) and the US (n=3,375) completed a 58-item survey on <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/" target="_blank" title="an online survey platform">Qualtrics</a>. Factor analysis identified five subscales... <br /><ol><li>COVID danger and contamination fears</li><li>COVID fears about economic consequences </li><li>COVID xenophobia</li><li>COVID compulsive checking and reassurance seeking</li><li>COVID traumatic stress symptoms</li></ol><br />...and limited the questionnaire to 36 items. I'll note that “fears about economic consequences” were restricted to a lack of supplies at grocery stores and pharmacies, rather than fears of crushing debt, eviction, hunger, and homelessness because of unemployment.<br /><br />One can view this new syndrome as a context-related extension of OCD contamination fears, compulsive checking, and <a href="https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/health-anxiety-what-it-and-how-beat-it" target="_blank">health anxiety</a> (preoccupation with the possibility of serious illness). Indeed, convergent validity was confirmed by showing correlations with established measures of those conditions. Unique aspects of COVID Stress Syndrome <span class="st">—</span> not seen in other diagnoses <span class="st">—</span> include fears that grocery stores would run out of toilet paper,<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span> and especially a fear of foreigners (xenophobia). Xenophobia is promulgated by <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1239685852093169664" target="_blank">politicians</a> and amplified by bad actors on social media and <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/21/21221007/anti-asian-racism-coronavirus" target="_blank" title="How the coronavirus is surfacing America’s deep-seated anti-Asian biases">IRL</a>. I don't think xenophobia (specifically, anti-Asian sentiment) is on the list of symptoms for any DSM diagnosis. <br /><br />Basically, it seems that a coherent condition called COVID Stress Syndrome would require racist beliefs and a fear of people who are Chinese, Chinese-American, or Chinese-Canadian.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span>The prevalence of COVID Stress Syndrome in their Canadian and American  samples was not specified, nor was the cut-off point for such a diagnosis. Plenty of Americans are xenophobic, but they don't have bad dreams about coronavirus. <br /><br />In an editorial, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300451" target="_blank">Taylor and Asmundson (2020)</a> said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">It appears that people who develop COVID Stress Syndrome have pre-existing psychopathology, particularly pre-existing high levels of health anxiety and obsessive-compulsive checking and contamination symptoms. <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>It remains to be seen whether the COVID Stress Syndrome is simply an adjustment disorder, abating once the pandemic is over, or whether it will become chronic for some individuals.</b></span></blockquote><br />So much about COVID-19 “remains to be seen”, and this level of uncertainly is a major source of anxiety on its own.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span>The toilet paper question just missed the cut...included were worries about water, cleaning supplies, medications, etc. The original version also included “worry about looting &amp; rioting.”<br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b><span style="color: black;"> One could really say </span></span><span style="color: purple;"><span style="color: black;">East Asian people more broadly.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/625592634/0/oupblogpsychology/">Moving beyond toxic masculinity: a Q&amp;A with Ronald Levant</a></h4>

<p>In 2018, the American Psychological Association released its first ever Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men. At the time of the release, these guidelines were met with criticism by some who viewed them as pathologizing masculinity, but since the guidelines were released the discussion of “toxic masculinity” has spread to all areas of our society and culture. Ronald F. Levant has served as president of American Psychological Association as well as president of the association’s Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinities. Levant has been a leader in the research on the psychology of men. We spoke with him about how traditional masculinity ideology is conceptualized by psychologists, how it plays out in our society, and why it’s important from a psychological standpoint to move beyond the concept of toxic masculinity.</p><p><strong>Sarah Butcher: </strong>You observe that the feminist movement opened up more options for girls and women to express their identity but that there was no corresponding movement for men. Why do you think that is?</p><p><strong>Ronald Levant:</strong> In the 1960’s amid the civil rights and LGBTQ movements, women decided once again (think of the suffrage movement) to address their oppression.  The result is what is called second wave feminism. Over the 70s to the 90s many men felt defensive in the face of women’s newfound assertiveness, resulting in what was then called a masculinity crisis (think <em>Bridges over Madison County</em>). This led to several different types of movements. One that gained prominence was the mythopoetic movement (remember Robert Bly and <em>Iron John</em>?), which did help some men become more comfortable with their emotions but was also was suffused with misogyny. Others like the Promise Keepers and the Men’s Rights Organization were even more blatantly misogynistic. What we advocate is a movement that is inspired by the ideals of gender equality, one that would help men ditch the burdens of dominance, and teach men that they can be men without the trappings of masculinity.</p><p><strong>SB: </strong>You coined the term Traditional Masculinity Ideology—how do you define it, and how do you see it playing out in the lives of men?</p><p><strong>RL: </strong>The most current definition is the holistic set of beliefs about how boys and men should, and should not, think, feel and behave. As far as current research is concerned, we’re typically looking at seven sets of prescriptive and proscriptive norms–avoidance of femininity; negativity toward sexual minorities; self-reliance through mechanical skills, toughness, dominance, importance of sex, and restrictive emotionality.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: Do you see any biological component to masculinity, or is it entirely socially constructed?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: There may be a biological basis to masculinity, but I am not aware of any solid support for this proposition. More importantly, we are psychologists not biologists, and we study masculinity as a social and psychological phenomenon.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: In recent decades, men have begun shouldering more of the burden of domestic labor and childrearing (although far from an equal share). Why does that pose a challenge to traditional masculinity ideology?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Good questions. It poses a challenge to traditional masculinity ideology because it violates the avoid all things feminine norm, because childcare (and nurturance in general) is considered feminine.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: Research has shown that men have a harder time expressing (and even naming) their emotions. Why is that and what are the consequences for themselves and others?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Decades ago, I noticed this in my work in the Boston University Fatherhood Project, and curiosity drove me to study the emotion socialization research literature in developmental psychology. Boys start out life more emotionally expressive than girls as neonates and retain this advantage over the first year of life, but from ages two to six—due to the childhood socialization of emotions, in which boys are made to feel ashamed of themselves for expressing vulnerable and caring emotions—many lose this expressive ability. This study formed the base for my normative male alexithymia hypothesis. “Alexithymia” means no words for emotions. My hypothesis is that socialization guided by traditional masculinity ideology, and in particular the norm of restrictive emotionality, produces a mild form of alexithymia in men, who cannot give a good account of their inner lives. This has enormous implications for relationships, stress management, and mental health. I later developed a treatment for such men called Alexithymia Reduction Treatment.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: As you argue, most violence is committed by men, yet most men aren’t violent. What is it that leads a minority of men to engage in violent behavior, and what role does traditional masculinity ideology play?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: This is a good question. The short answer is that we don’t know why some men are violent and others are not. Various theories have been proposed, with social-situational factors having more weight than personality factors. What we do know is:</p><ul type="disc"><li>The vast majority of boys and men are not violent.</li><li>The vast majority of adult men do not endorse traditional masculinity ideology.</li><li>There are literally 40 + years of research showing correlations between all of the masculinity scales and harmful outcomes, and many of these are related to violence.</li><li>We <em>think</em> that the correlation is due to the boys and men who score at the very high end of these scales. Thus, high endorsement of or conformity to the norms of traditional masculinity is associated with rape myth acceptance, disdain for racial and sexual minorities, or aggression, for example.</li></ul><p><strong>SB</strong>: What role does traditional masculinity ideology play in sexual violence, ranging from sexual harassment to rape?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Based on the avoid femininity norm, boys prefer playing with other boys rather than girls, and thus rarely get to know girls as persons. In puberty boys become very interested in girls, but as sex objects. Objectifying women is at the very foundation of sexual violence.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: You also examine different versions of masculinity ideology such as African American masculinity and Latinx masculinity. How can the theory of intersectionality help us understand these different masculinities?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: The theory of intersectionality says that our overall identity and sense of self is a composite of a number of specific identities that may relate to our race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age cohort, etc. So, for example, African American men have to fulfil the requirements of the male role (e.g., providing for one’s family) impeded by racism, which has reduced educational and employment opportunities for black men.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: What is the role of traditional masculinity in mental and physical health?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: Traditional masculinity ideology emphasizes toughness, self-reliance and never revealing vulnerability. In the areas of physical and mental health this translates into taking health risks, not seeking professional help when needed, and relying on alcohol for stress reduction.</p><p><strong>SB: </strong>Based on your clinical experience, what are some of the most effective techniques for men who want to escape the prison of traditional masculinity ideology?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: The most effective techniques I have found is helping men who are unable to verbalize their emotions to learn how to do that, to open up their hearts to their families. This often involves first dealing with their fears that this will somehow emasculate them, strip them of their ‘man card,’ and along the way dealing with their sense of shame resulting from violating the male code.</p><p><strong>SB</strong>: What role do fathers play in the propagation of traditional masculinity ideology, and what are some tips for fathers wishing to model a more gender-neutral approach?</p><p><strong>RL</strong>: The “essential father hypothesis” posits that the father’s essential role is to model masculinity and heterosexuality for his sons. Although this idea has been largely discredited in academia it is still very prominent among the public. A better alternative is the involved father role, in which dads share parenting duties equally with their female partners.</p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@healing_photographer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Aarón Blanco Tejedor</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/men?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/moving-beyond-toxic-masculinity-a-qa-with-ronald-levant/">Moving beyond toxic masculinity: a Q&amp;A with Ronald Levant</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/625592634/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/625592634/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/625592634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/why-big-protests-arent-a-good-measure-of-popular-power/" rel="nofollow">Why big protests aren’t a good measure of popular power</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/the-history-of-canada-day/" rel="nofollow">The history of Canada Day</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/five-questions-about-ptsd/" rel="nofollow">Five questions about PTSD</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/vaccination-2722937_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong><em>What is HPV?</em></strong></p>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infectious agent and is increasingly common in young people. HPV is linked to several cancers – especially cervical cancer – and genital warts (GW).</p>
<p><strong><em>How high is the burden of HPV related diseases?</em></strong></p>
<p>Every year, a large number of women and men are affected by the anal, cervical, oropharyngeal, penile, and vaginal cancers linked to HPV. Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common malignancy among women worldwide, <a href="https://www.hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/XWX.pdf?t=1589902406273">with more than 300,000 deaths in 2018 alone.</a></p>
<p>Besides cervical cancers, GWs are also common manifestations of genital HPV infection. Although usually not regarded as a serious condition, GWs cause physical symptoms such as pruritus and pain, and have a negative impact on sexual life resulting in significant loss of quality of life for those with the sexually transmitted infection.</p>
<p><strong><em>How can I get protection against cancers and/or genital warts?</em></strong></p>
<p>The next generation of children and young adults may not face HPV related cancer and/or GWs thanks to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The vaccine helps protect against certain types of HPV that can lead to cancer or GWs. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine targets virus types 16 and 18 – the two types that cause 80% of cervical cancer cases – and also HPV types 6 and 11, associated with 85–95% of GW cases.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is the quadrivalent HPV vaccine effective?</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08753-y?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our study published today in <em>BMC Public Health</em></a> summarizes the available data assessing the real-world impact of publicly funded quadrivalent HPV vaccination from the beginnings up to the 13th of January 2020. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether quadrivalent HPV vaccine has any effects in the prevention of GWs.</p>
<p>Eight randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were included where HPV vaccines (3 doses) or placebos were administered to females or males (in one study) and then the number of GW cases was compared between the vaccinated and placebo group. Eight time trend studies were also included to assess the population-level effect of the quadrivalent HPV vaccination by comparing the prevalence of GWs between the pre- and post-vaccination periods.</p>
<blockquote><p>The quadrivalent HPV vaccine significantly reduced the risk of GWs</p></blockquote>
<p>The quadrivalent HPV vaccine significantly reduced the risk of GWs. In the post-vaccination period, the number of GW events in women was considerably lower. Although young men were not vaccinated, the number of GW cases was also reduced among them, to be attributed most likely to the indirect protection provided by the vaccination of women. Subgroup analysis showed that GWs were reduced more substantially in those under 21 years of age than in older persons.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25744474/">The findings are consistent with previous reviews and meta-analyses</a>, where it was also found that the prevalence of GWs decreased significantly in vaccinated girls and the quadrivalent prophylactic vaccination could prevent HPV infection both in men and women.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where has the quadrivalent HPV vaccine been introduced?</em></strong></p>
<p>Gardasil® has been the vaccine of choice worldwide. It has been chosen by health authorities in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden for regional or national vaccination programs. In Australia, cases of GW have nearly disappeared since 2007 – this was the year when the national vaccination program against cervical cancer using the quadrivalent vaccine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21970896/">was introduced as a school based program for 12- and 13-year-old girls</a>. By October 2019, 98 countries introduced HPV vaccines through national immunization programs.</p>
<p>Our meta-analysis gives strong evidence for the effectiveness of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Such knowledge can help governments with making decisions about the implementation of the vaccination in their countries for young females and also males, preferably through school-based programs.</p>

<p>In April 2014 the UK government launched the ‘NHS Visitor and Migrant Cost Recovery Programme Implementation Plan’ which set out a series of policy changes to recoup costs from ‘chargeable’ (largely non-UK born) patients. In England alone roughly 75% of all diagnoses of Tuberculosis (TB) will be made in people born abroad. Because of this, the authors of this manuscript set out to assess the impact of the Cost Recovery Programme (CRP) on the quality of healthcare received by those not eligible for free NHS healthcare. Utilizing a dataset of 2237 diagnosed TB cases the authors found that median time-to-treatment after the introduction of the CRP increased by 20 days from 69 to 89 days for non-UK patients. They also found a significant change in the number of years migrant patients had been living in the UK before diagnosis. Rising from 10 years pre-CRP to 14.8 years post CRP. With delays in the diagnosis of TB increasing morbidity and mortality it is imperative that diagnosis is made as early as possible. With direct significant relationships between the introduction of the CRP and an increase in time-to-treatment the authors argue that restricting healthcare access for non-UK populations undermines national efforts to eliminate TB and conclude that governments have a “moral and legal obligation” to uphold the right to the highest attainable standard of health for all people, no matter their immigration status.</p>

<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 should be characterized as a pandemic. Since then we have witnessed the devastating and unpredictable spread of COVID-19 globally resulting in unprecedented lockdowns on a global scale. Aside from the increased burden on healthcare systems and the devastating humanitarian loss, researchers are now facing significant challenges in appropriately conducting statistical analyses of COVID-19 data to meet the WHO goal of evaluating “as fast as possible the effect of adjunctive and supportive therapies”. With appropriate statistical models playing a major role in “fighting panic with information” to reduce or eliminate the risk of bias across clinical and epidemiological studies the Guest Editors of this collection describe the most striking challenges experienced by statisticians and data analysts alike.</p>

In this study the authors conduct a meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of telemedicine (health services and medical activities provided by healthcare professionals through remote communication technologies) for the management of women with GDM. Identifying a total of 32 Randomized control trials and a total of 5108 patients the authors found that the use of telemedicine had significant improvements in GDM measures as compared to the standard care group. They also identified that the use of telemedicine lowered indices of cesarean section, neonatal hypoglycemia, preeclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth and neonatal asphyxia, amongst others. The authors conclude that use of communication technology and telemedicine had significant positive effects on the control of GDM and also significantly reduce the risk of maternal and neonatal/fetal complications.</p>

<p><em>Octopus vulgaris</em> is one of the most iconic species of neurobiology research. This is mainly attributed to its reputation as one of the most intelligent studied invertebrates, possessing both long and short term memory capability and a striking ability to perform complex cognitive tasks. However, given the high level of parental care required for successful spawning of offspring, laboratory research and experimental populations have been notoriously difficult to maintain. In this study the authors present a novel option for a parameter-controlled artificial seawater standalone egg incubation system that has the ability to replace the significant level of maternal care required, allowing the successful embryonic development of small-egged octopus species under laboratory conditions.</p>

<p>With more than half of all adults reporting having experienced neck and shoulder pain it has become the second most common musculoskeletal disorder. Unsurprisingly it is most common amongst office workers who perform low intensity, but continuous movements as part of their role. Previous research has identified a relationship between resistance training and pain relief, but none have come to a consensus on the best resistance training frequency. Thus, the authors here set out to test which dose of resistance training achieved the greatest reduction in pain. Using a cohort of 27 individuals the authors imposed two interventional routines. One cohort completed one 10 minute session daily, 5 days per week and the other completed two 10 minutes sessions daily, 5 days per week. The authors found no difference between the two interventions, finding instead that any bout of high intensity resistance training significantly reduced levels of workplace related pain and improved the quality of life of office workers.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about the paper "On Robot Compliance: A Cerebellar Control Approach".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed. Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators mimicking human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant movements.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/iphone-313845_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Children today seem like they were born with an iPad in hand. Toddlers might not be potty trained yet, but they know how to switch from one app to the other, Facetime their grandparents and even change WiFi networks. Researchers are still unsure as to what effects this precocious use of technology, particularly increased use of the internet, will have on children.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11908 alignleft" height="112" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/HBN_logo_4color-300x112.jpg" width="300" />In an attempt to address this important question, we analyzed data from the openly shared Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network. Children ages 7-15—and their parents—answered questions about their internet use, how well they sleep, how much exercise they get, and problems they might be having in school, at home, or with other social relationships. Each child also underwent comprehensive psychiatric assessments, which allowed us to examine how internet use might be associated with a range of different clinical syndromes including depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because many youth have more than one of these conditions, we also examined how comorbidity across these conditions may also be associated with problematic patterns of internet use.</p>
<p>We found that children who show problematic levels of internet use also have higher rates of depression, ASD and ADHD. We could not discriminate whether those with one or more of these disorders go on to have higher rates of problematic internet use, or if increased internet use was related to the development of psychiatric disorders and functional impairment. Nonetheless, these findings add to a growing literature suggesting associations between mental health disorders and problematic internet usage. We must proceed with caution: how can we discover what constitutes healthy patterns of internet use and make sure our children are taking advantage of all the benefits the internet has to offer while also protecting them from potential consequences?</p>
<p>Our study focuses on behaviors associated with internet use, rather than quantities of use. This is an important distinction, as it is more reminiscent of measures of addiction, which are primarily defined by behavioral patterns rather than subjective reports that someone “drinks too much”. Before we can discriminate between problematic and non problematic internet use that may be defined differently for different children in different contexts, it will be important to identify behavioral markers of harmful internet use. Examples of such behaviors include displays of aggression when internet time is limited or in response to inquiries about online activities, loss of sleep, negative effects on schoolwork and/or relationships, or a tendency to turn to the internet to avoid unpleasant or difficult activities. Perhaps this shift in focus is more important now than ever, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the dramatic increases in internet use that it has necessitated for connecting, socializing and learning. For many, particularly those in the most affected areas under lockdown, these increases will undoubtedly make conventional wisdom about what constitutes “too much” or “too little” internet seem out of touch at least in the near future.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most worrisome learning point from our work is that problematic internet usage in children is associated with global functional impairment – beyond the presence of any formal psychiatric disorder. This suggests that a child with ADHD who exhibits problematic internet usage patterns may be more likely to have difficulty in daily life functioning than a child with ADHD and less problematic usage. An important caveat: our findings are based on a one-time snapshot. We can’t draw conclusions regarding internet use as a cause or consequence of childhood disorders. Also, the findings only apply to problematic internet use, not to regular use. In fact, internet use that is not excessive or problematic could actually have beneficial influences on child functioning. We plan to follow up these youth to gain more insight into the nature of the relationships between functional impairment, psychiatric disorders and problematic internet use.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/house-2683861_640-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Loneliness is not a twenty first century creation. Nor is it the result of the physical distancing, self-isolation and distant and remote social relationships we are experiencing as a result of COVID-19. Like joy or sorrow, loneliness can be seen as part of being human. It has been described and experienced by people of different ages, across different cultures and in different historical periods.</p>
<p><strong>What is loneliness?</strong></p>
<p>Loneliness is the feeling or response we have when our social relationships fail to match our expectations or desires. This could be because the quality of the relations is superficial or lacking in the depth and meaning we would like. It can also be because the number of our relationships is lower than we would like. Loneliness may also result when how we experience our relationships, in person, on-line or by telephone, does not match our expectations. This is especially relevant during the distant and remote socializing we are experiencing during COVID-19. On-line or telephone conversations may combat loneliness by enabling us to keep in touch with our family and friends. Alternatively, these types of contact may make us feel lonelier by reminding us how much we miss personal contact. Loneliness is not the same as living alone, spending time alone or being socially isolated.</p>
<p><strong>Why does loneliness matter?</strong></p>
<p>Loneliness was once seen as a problem that was only experienced by older people. Indeed it was often seen as part of the normal ageing process. Now it is clear that loneliness effects people of all ages.  This is important because being lonely is now seen as so serious that is seen as a public health problem. We now have a Minister for Loneliness and national strategies to combat loneliness. Much of the drive to tackle loneliness is because research has associated it with a range of health problems. These include death, chronic physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, depression and mental health as well as health behaviors such as decreased physical activity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Loneliness is increasingly being defined as a medical or health care problem rather than one of wellbeing and quality of life</p></blockquote>
<p>Loneliness is increasingly being defined as a medical or health care problem rather than one of wellbeing and quality of life. We know that those people who experience loneliness reported lower levels of wellbeing, quality of life and life satisfaction. In the flurry of activity focused on the health problems associated with loneliness the links with wellbeing are overlooked. However these are very important and are why I would argue that loneliness really matters. All of us, regardless of age, evaluate our wellbeing and quality of life and this can be reduced by loneliness. For this reason alone, we need to understand loneliness and what factors can make people vulnerable to experiencing loneliness. This is especially important for older adults where national and international policies focus on living well in later life and of having a ‘good old age’. These policy goals mean that we need to understand the drivers of loneliness in later life if we are going to  develop robust ways of addressing loneliness and support a meaningful and good quality of life for our older citizens.</p>
<p><strong> What types of factors are related to loneliness?</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-large wp-image-11912" height="380" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/loneliness-1024x608.png" width="640" />There are three different types of factors that may make older people vulnerable to loneliness. First there are individual characteristics such as widowhood or bereavement, low income or poor health. Secondly there are community and neighborhood factors such as the availability of parks or availability of facilities such as libraries. Thirdly there can be national or societal level factors such as policies and attitudes to older people. We know very little about how community or neighborhood factors are linked to loneliness. In our study we looked at two area characteristics – the index of multiple deprivation and area type (urban or rural). We studied their relationship with two measures of loneliness for 4,663 adults aged 50 and over who took part in the 2014 wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).</p>
<p><strong>Identifying lonely places</strong></p>
<p>Overall, 18% of participants reported that they experienced loneliness and 25% that they often felt lonely in the area where they lived. It is important to remember that just over two thirds of participants, 68%, did not report either form of loneliness. We found no difference  for either measure of loneliness between participants living in urban and rural areas. There was no relationship between individual loneliness and the deprivation score for the community where participants resided.  There a significant statistical relationship between the level of deprivation of an area and levels of area based loneliness. Those living in the most deprived communities were 53% more likely to report experiencing loneliness in the area than those living in the least deprived areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>Those living in the most deprived communities were 53% more likely to report experiencing loneliness in the area than those living in the least deprived areas.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Integrating area and place of residence in loneliness research</strong></p>
<p>Existing evidence investigating the factors that make older people, and other age groups, vulnerable to loneliness have focused upon individual characteristics such as marital status or household size. We also have evidence linking loneliness to transitions or changes in circumstances such as retirement, bereavement, becoming a carer or the onset of chronic illness. We have extended our understanding  of loneliness by demonstrating a link with deprivation and now need to identify the components of deprivation-housing stock, lack of community facilities, transport, availability of blue-green spaces or lack of community cohesion and trust that are creating lonely places.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/624857730/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why anti-vaxxers are rising again</a></h4>

<p>In the midst of a health crisis when our only hope is a new vaccine, many have begun to wonder how those with anti-vaccination sentiments might respond to the current COVID-19 crisis. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/health/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-intl/index.html">Many have guessed</a> that the only natural, rational response would be for anti-vaxxers to change their minds and wholeheartedly embrace the prospect of a new vaccine. After all, there is a prevailing theory that anti-vaccine sentiment arises at least in part from a collective amnesia about the true scourge of vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccines, so the argument goes, are a victim of their own success, resulting in a situation in which people do not remember why they are getting vaccinated because the diseases that the vaccines prevent against have been absent for so long. If this theory is true, then in a situation in which we are face-to-face with the ill effects of an infectious pathogen, we should all readily embrace a new vaccine.</p><p>It turns out that the anti-vaxxer response to COVID-19 and the prospect of a new vaccine, much like science denialism more generally, is much more complex than that. The response also seems to suggest that the idea that amnesia about diseases that have been largely conquered by vaccines is probably not the primary reason for anti-vaccine sentiments. So how have people with anti-vaccine tendencies responded to COVID-19? While it’s still too soon to have a complete picture of this, especially since no new vaccine has been rolled out yet, several interesting patterns have emerged.</p><p>Staunch anti-vaxxers still oppose vaccines, including potential new coronavirus vaccines, and are active at spreading misinformation. Those who have not made up their minds about whether vaccines are safe <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/anti-vaccination-community-divided-how-respond-to-coronavirus-pandemic">are now wavering more</a> than they were previously. Whereas before they may have been slightly more inclined in the anti-vaccine direction, now they are questioning those viewpoints more. They do seem to remain amenable to being persuaded.</p><p>Public figures, such as politicians and musicians, who are staunch anti-vaxxers <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://theconversation.com/what-impact-will-the-coronavirus-pandemic-have-on-anti-vaxxers-135153">are facing more opposition now</a>. Crisis situations have the tendency to bring certain background issues into high relief. People who may have found anti-vaxxers to be somewhat irritating but not a direct threat are now viewing them differently and thus more social pressure is being placed on anti-vaxxers to abandon their views and change their behaviors.</p><p>Still, anti-vaxxers are very active and very vocal, both about potentially refusing a new vaccine for coronavirus but also<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/a-fake-pandemic-antivaxxers-are-spreading-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories/"> increasingly voicing conspiracy theories</a> about coronavirus itself. These conspiracy theory claims run the gamut, from claiming the virus is not as bad as public officials note to warning people that public officials and government bodies like the CDC are not to be trusted.</p><p>Another very disturbing development is the migration of objections to a putative coronavirus vaccine away from a scientific and health basis and toward a more general political basis. Anti-vaxxers are now linking stay-at-home orders and the hoped-for vaccines as assaults on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html">liberty and freedom</a>. Although anti-vaxxers have always made personal liberty a part of their message, by incorporating objections to a coronavirus vaccine into the broader context of freedom, they have taken this link to an extreme.</p><p>Heidi Munoz Gelisner, a leader in anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protests, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html">told a reporter</a> at the <em>New York Times</em>, “we have always been about freedom.” This adds a new dimension to our efforts to ensure that there is swift uptake of a coronavirus vaccine as soon as it becomes available. Targeting the pro-vaccine message on issues of vaccine safety and efficacy may not address this broader issue. Of course, the notion that vaccines involve a personal liberty aspect is faulty: it is long recognized that no one has the right to jeopardize the health of others, especially children, and therefore that democracies can legitimately enforce vaccine requirements. Nevertheless, Americans are perhaps more insistent about a broad range of personal liberties than citizens of any other country and therefore we will have to consider ways to address this aspect of anti-vaccination sentiment as well.</p><p>More than <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01221-y">90 vaccines</a> against the virus that causes COVID-19 are now in various stages of development and the most optimistic predictions would give us a viable one in a year to 18 months. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.axios.com/what-experts-say-works-for-combating-coronavirus-misinformation-146084b8-1312-403d-b948-3e190f16b7f3.html">Research</a> by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, indicates that we can no longer rely on debunking myths about vaccines after they have been promulgated throughout the media. Rather, her work calls for “proactive messaging,” in which groups of experts begin to thwart anti-vaccination messages before a crisis promoted by misinformation begins. Thus, we need to start immediately to use evidence-based communication methods to preempt the different varieties of misinformation about a vaccine for COVID-19. There is no time to waste.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/asian-scientists-working-vaccine-creation_5634025.htm">Photo</a> by pressphoto via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/why-anti-vaxxers-are-rising-again/">Why anti-vaxxers are rising again</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/624857730/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/624857730/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/624857730/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/five-questions-about-ptsd/" rel="nofollow">Five questions about PTSD</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/accepting-uncertainty-creates-freedom/" rel="nofollow">Accepting uncertainty creates freedom</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/06/income-inequality-drives-health-disparities/" rel="nofollow">Income inequality drives health disparities</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/05/20/remembering-the-caregivers/">Remembering the Caregivers</a></h4>

<img alt="pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-1-1-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With a rapidly aging population of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) starting dialysis, the demands on caregivers have increased.  The need for help with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing), mobility, transportation, social support and food preparation are often not anticipated.  The burden of these additional roles and lack of support can have a major negative impact on the caregivers physical, social and emotional health.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology</em></a> publication, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01830-9">Shah et al.</a> compared the health related quality of life and the care related quality of life among caregivers of older individuals (&gt;75 years of age) receiving dialysis or conservative care (medical management only).  Caregivers completed surveys that assessed their health related quality of life and experience as caregivers  These surveys addressed areas that healthcare teams often forget such as activities outside care-giving, social support, institutional support, control over caring and relationship with t<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11898 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/05/blog-300x200.png" width="300" />he care recipient. Utilizing this survey highlights the changes in the caregiver’s life that are often not considered in counseling about end stage kidney disease management with patients and the families. While there was no difference in the HRQoL, the caregivers of dialysis patients reported a worse carer experience, where the survey results of this group reflected the perception of providing an ‘intense’ level of care to recipients in bad health and for more than 20 hours/weeks. This is especially striking considering 70% of the caregivers surveyed had been providing this level of care for &gt;2 years.  These findings highlight the need to expand the dialysis preparations and the support provided to caregivers.</p>
<p>Currently, protocols focus on education about dialysis modality options, early referrals for dialysis access planning/creation and information for the patient about the dialysis procedure.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/15/suppl_3/8/1849543">Most of the data</a> that has helped shape the current approaches have been based on outcomes such as the number of hospitalizations, morbidity, mortality, nutritional status, or infection rates in patients starting dialysis with little or no preparation. While these are important issues to address, this approach does not consider the overall impact of dialysis on the life of the patient or the effects on the caregiver, including changes to their lifestyle, employment and family responsibilities.  As such, many caregivers struggle with how to accommodate the needs of their family member without the skills and resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the increasing number of older individuals needing dialysis support, there is a higher likelihood that they will have comorbidities and thus a potentially greater need for help with care. As a result, caregivers can experience stress, depression, feelings of being overwhelmed and social isolation. This impact on caregivers was noted in <a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(02)44553-2/abstract">another study</a> of 100 hemodialysis patients and their primary caregivers utilizing the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).  After more than 4 months of dialysis, caregivers were reported to have higher subjective burden scores.  Current practices do not encompass follow-up with the caregivers to see how they are adjusting to the initiation of dialysis and how they are dealing with the transition.  A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/23/12/3960/1888462">systematic review</a> of studies with interventions for informal caregivers demonstrated only three studies with interventions for caregivers and these involved education material to enhance caregiver knowledge.</p>
<p>Our approach to dialysis preparation falls short if providers are not first acknowledging with patients and their caregivers the impact of end-stage kidney disease on their lives and providing the resources and support they need during this transition period.  Understanding what is important to them and what they do on a day-to-day basis in terms of work, family, and social obligations needs to be part of routine discussions.  Discussions about the impact on the family and caregivers also needs to be part of the routine dialysis preparations.</p>
