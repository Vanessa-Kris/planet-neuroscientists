<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Epileptic seizures represent dysfunctional neural networks dominated by excessive and/or hypersynchronous activity. Recent progress in the field has outlined two concepts regarding mechanisms of seizure generation, or ictogenesis. First, all seizures, even those associated with what have historically been thought of as ‘primary generalized’ epilepsies, appear to originate in local microcircuits and then propagate from that initial ictogenic zone. Second, seizures propagate through cerebral networks and engage microcircuits in distal nodes, a process that can be weakened or even interrupted by suppressing activity in such nodes. We describe various microcircuit motifs, with a special emphasis on one that has been broadly implicated in several epilepsies: feed-forward inhibition. Furthermore, we discuss how, in the dynamic network in which seizures propagate, focusing on circuit ‘choke points’ remote from the initiation site might be as important as that of the initial dysfunction, the seizure ‘focus’.</p>

<p>On the way to meet your friend at a cafe you’re confident about sticking to your resolutions for healthier living. It soon goes awry though – no, not because of your weak willpower, but due to your excess empathy.</p>
<p>Your friend orders first and plumps for the super indulgent Winter Warmer Chocca Mocha with added marshmallows. You follow suit, sensing that if you’d stuck with your original plans for a skinny coffee, you’d have made your friend feel awful. There is now a name for this behaviour: You just engaged in “altruistic indulgence”, the most appealing of excuses for a naughty lapse, described for the first time in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2018.1546616">a paper</a> in <em>Social Influence.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-36109"></span></p>
<p>The researchers led by <a href="http://www.youjae.com/english/profile.html">Youjae Yi</a> at Seoul National University first conducted a field study at a university cafe. They obtained the till receipts for 649 transactions and looked to see whether customers had ordered a low-calorie or high-calorie coffee.</p>
<p>Around half the lone customers ordered a healthy option and half opted for high calorie. Similarly, among the customers who were in a pair and who had ordered first, there was again roughly a 50/50 split in choosing healthy or unhealthy.</p>
<p>In striking contrast, among customers who ordered second, their rate of ordering unhealthy leapt to 80 per cent if their companion had ordered a high-calorie drink (conversely, if the first-ordering companion plumped for a healthy drink, the rate of choosing healthy among those choosing second was only 60 per cent, which is statistically not a significant difference from the average rate of choosing healthy among lone customers or first-order customers).</p>
<p>Put differently, when following a companion who made an unhealthy order, the average rate of choosing unhealthy among customers choosing second increased by 33 per cent; in contrast, when following a companion who made a healthy order, the average rate of choosing healthy among customers choosing second increased by just 8 per cent.</p>
<p>“The modelling behaviour for unhealthy choices was much stronger than that for healthy choices,” the researchers said, adding that this result is consistent with their theory that if our companion orders an unhealthy option, we are often motivated to copy them so as to avoid making them feel bad.</p>
<p>To test this idea further, Yi and his team conducted an online experiment in which they asked 174 women in the US to imagine meeting a friend or a rival at a burger bar and that their companion had ordered first and had chosen the more indulgent, higher-calorie burger of the two on offer. Next, the participants were asked to say which kind of burger meal they would order – the healthier or the more indulgent. The researchers reasoned that if altruistic indulgence is a real phenomenon then participants would be more likely to choose the unhealthy option if they were dining with a friend (based on the logic that you are more likely to feel altruistic concern for a friend than a rival).</p>
<p>Participants asked to imagine dining with a friend were indeed more likely to follow their companion’s lead and opt for the high-calorie burger (51 per cent chose this option, compared with 29 per cent in the rival condition). Moreover, the researchers asked the participants about the motives influencing their choice – concern for their companion’s feelings or a desire to be liked and accepted.  In statistical terms, the higher rate of choosing the unhealthy burger in the friend scenario was entirely explained by the participants in this condition (compared with the rival condition) being more motivated by concern for their companion’s feelings, not by any greater desire to be liked or accepted.</p>
<p>“Typically indulgence is regarded as an egoistic choice associated with short-term pleasure for the self and engaged via loss of self-control,” the researchers said. “However, we show that altruistic indulgence is associated with self-sacrifice (forgoing one’s preference and health) … [as a way to protect the feelings of one’s companion].”</p>
<p>Yi and his team said future studies could look into the circumstances that might increase or decrease altruistic indulgence (they predicted that it might be greater when dining with a heavier companion who chooses an unhealthy food or drink option, “… because people should believe that a healthy choice will make a heavier individual feel particularly guilty”) and studies could also investigate how people feel after engaging in altruistic indulgence – will they feel happy that they protected their friend’s feelings or bad that they ate or drank unhealthily?</p>

For a one year period, the investigators (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full" target="_blank">Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018</a>) conducted field work within the community of  young Moroccan men in Barcelona, Spain. As the authors explain, the Moroccan diaspora is an immigrant community susceptible to jihadist forms of radicalization:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Spain hosts Europe’s second largest Moroccan diaspora community (after France) and its least integrated, whereas Catalonia hosts the largest and least integrated Moroccan community in Spain. Barcelona ... was most recently the site of a mass killing ... by a group of young Moroccan men pledging support for the Islamic State. According to a recent Europol’s latest annual report on terrorism trends, Spain had the second highest number of jihadist terrorism-related arrests in Europe (second only to France) in 2016...  </blockquote><br />After months of observation in selected neighborhoods, the researchers approached prospective participants about completing a survey, with the assurance of absolute anonymity. No names were exchanged, and informed consent procedures were performed orally, to prevent any written record of participation. The very large sample included 535 respondents (average age 23.47 years, range 18–42), who were all Sunni Muslim Moroccan men.<br /><br />The goal of the study was to look at <i>sacred values</i> in these participants, and whether these values might affect their willingness to engage in violent extremism. “Sacred values are immune or resistant to material tradeoffs and are associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics" target="_blank" title="the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, not on the consequences of the action">deontic</a> (duty-bound) reasoning...” (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full" target="_blank">Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018</a>). The term <i>sacred values</i> doesn't necessarily refer to religious beliefs. One of the most common is the basic human value, “it is wrong to kill another human being.” But theoretically speaking, we could include statements such as, “it is wrong to kill endangered species <a href="https://www.alternet.org/2015/07/6-rich-white-people-who-get-killing-wild-african-animals/" target="_blank">for sport</a> (or for any other reason).” <br /><br />In this study, <u>Sacred Values</u> included:<br /><ul><li>Palestinian right of return</li><li>Western military forces being expelled from all Muslim lands</li><li>Strict sharia as the rule of law in all Muslim countries</li><li>Armed jihad being waged against enemies of Muslims</li><li>Forbidding of caricatures of Prophet Mohammed</li><li>Veiling of women in public</li></ul><br />What were the <u>Nonsacred Values</u>? We don't know. I couldn't find examples anywhere in the paper. It's crucial that we know what these were, to help understand the “sacralization” of nonsacred values, which was observed in an fMRI experiment (described later). So I turned to the Supplemental Material of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0262" target="_blank" title="The price of your soul: neural evidence for the non-utilitarian representation of sacred values">Berns et al. (2012)</a>, inferring that the statements below are good examples of nonsacred values in a population of adults in Atlanta.<br /><ul><li>You are a dog person.</li><li>You are a cat person.</li></ul><ul><li>You are a Pepsi drinker.</li><li>You are a Coke drinker.</li></ul><ul><li>You believe that Target is superior to Walmart.</li><li>You believe that Walmart is superior to Target.</li></ul><br />But what if the nonsacred values in the present study of violent extremism were a little more contentious and meaningful?<br /><ul><li>You are a fan of FC Barcelona.</li><li>You are a fan of AC Milan.</li></ul><br />Anyway, to choose participants for the fMRI experiment, the investigators first divided the entire group into those who were more (<i>n</i>=267) or less (<i>n</i>=268)  vulnerable to recruitment into violent extremism (see <b>Appendix </b>for details).  An important comparison would have been to directly contrast brain  activity in these two groups, but that wasn't done here. Out of the 267 men more vulnerable to violent extremism, 38 agreed to participate in the fMRI study. These 38 were more likely to Endorse Militant Jihadism (score 4.24 out of 7) than the general fMRI pool (3.35) and the non-fMRI pool (2.43).<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span> <br /><br />A battery of six sacred and six nonsacred values was constructed individually for  each person and presented in the scanner, along with a number of grammatical variants, for a list of 50 different items per condition. The 38 participants were randomly assigned to one of two manipulations in a between-subjects design: exclusion (<i>n</i>=19) and inclusion (<i>n</i>=19) in the ever-popular ball-tossing video game of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03192765" target="_blank">Cyberball</a>. [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03192765.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup> </b></span><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nujcfnjo5cE/XEZbr7oP9iI/AAAAAAAAMuc/Y1CQ_Go_cF8J66NU-n1LbGHiD9EkrTSOwCLcBGAs/s1600/Study%2Bdesign_Cyberball%2Band%2Bviolent%2Bextremism.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="879" data-original-width="1600" height="218" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nujcfnjo5cE/XEZbr7oP9iI/AAAAAAAAMuc/Y1CQ_Go_cF8J66NU-n1LbGHiD9EkrTSOwCLcBGAs/s400/Study%2Bdesign_Cyberball%2Band%2Bviolent%2Bextremism.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Unfortunately, this reduced the study's statistical power. Nonetheless, a major goal of the experiment was to examine how social exclusion affects the processing of sacred values. I don't know if Cyberball studies are ever conducted in a within-subjects design (perhaps with an intervening task), or if exposure to one of the two conditions is too “contaminating”. At any rate, in real life, discrimination against Muslim immigrants is isolating and causes exclusion from social and economic benefits. Feelings of marginalization can result in  greater radicalization and support for (and participation in) extremist groups. <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>At this point in time, I don't think neuroimaging can add to the extensive knowledge gained from years of field work.</b></span><br /><br />Nevertheless, the investigators wanted to extend the findings of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0262" target="_blank">Berns et al. (2012)</a> to a very different population. The earlier study wanted to determine whether sacred values are processed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics" target="_blank">deontological</a> way (based on strict rules of right and wrong) or in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism" target="_blank">utilitarian</a> fashion (based on cost/benefit analysis of outcome). As interpreted by those authors, processing sacred values was associated with increased activation of left  temporoparietal junction (semantic storage) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (semantic retrieval). Berns et al. suggested that “sacred values affect behaviour through the retrieval and processing of  deontic rules and not through a utilitarian evaluation of costs and  benefits.” Based on those results, the obvious prediction in the present study is that sacred values should activate left  temporoparietal junction (L TPJ) and  left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (L VLPFC).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A1jhG0SOzHc/XEaKsppMMzI/AAAAAAAAMuo/20pS-D2IsWIkKT2l56RrwtJ17ileOia3gCLcBGAs/s1600/Sacred%2Bvs.%2BNonsacred.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="369" data-original-width="681" height="173" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-A1jhG0SOzHc/XEaKsppMMzI/AAAAAAAAMuo/20pS-D2IsWIkKT2l56RrwtJ17ileOia3gCLcBGAs/s320/Sacred%2Bvs.%2BNonsacred.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b><span>Fig. 3A (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full" target="_blank">Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018</a>).</span></b><br /><br /><br />Fig. 3A shows that only the latter half of that prediction was observed, and there was no explanation for the lack of activation in L TPJ. Instead, there was a finding in R TPJ in the excluded group which I won't discuss further.<br /><br />Of note, the excluded participants rated themselves as being more likely to fight and die for <i><b>nonsacred</b></i> values, compared to the included participants. This was termed “sacralization” and now you can see why it's so important to know the nonsacred values. Are we talking about fighting and dying for Pepsi vs. Coke? For FC Barcelona vs. AC Milan? Not to be glib, but this would help us understand why social exclusion (in an artificial experimental setting) would radicalize these participants (in an artificial experimental setting).<span style="color: purple;"><b> </b></span><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RuSJTqUYEBs/XEaPgNS9n3I/AAAAAAAAMu0/pZvyF0z1CoQCo0WhpYzCkSm1_PN6ykmSwCLcBGAs/s1600/LIFG%2Bincluded%2Bvs.%2Bexcluded.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="374" data-original-width="747" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RuSJTqUYEBs/XEaPgNS9n3I/AAAAAAAAMu0/pZvyF0z1CoQCo0WhpYzCkSm1_PN6ykmSwCLcBGAs/s400/LIFG%2Bincluded%2Bvs.%2Bexcluded.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b><span>Fig. 3B (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02462/full" target="_blank">Pretus, Hamid et al., 2018</a>).</span></b> <span>Nonsacred values activate Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG, aka VLPFC) in the excluded group, but not in the included group. This was interpreted as a neural correlate of </span><span>“sacralization”.</span><br /><br /><br />Another interpretation of Fig. 3B is that the exclusion manipulation was distracting, making it more difficult for these participants to process stimuli expressing nonsacred values (due to increased <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709652" target="_blank">encoding demands</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17924553" target="_blank">syntactic processing</a>, etc.). Exclusion increased emotional intensity ratings, and decreased feelings of belongingness and being in control. This distraction could have carried over to the task of rating one's willingness to fight and die in defense of values.<br /><br />Even if we say the brain imaging results weren't especially informative, the extensive ethnographic study and field surveys were a highly valuable source of data on a marginalized group of young Muslim men at risk of recruitment by violent extremist groups. It's a vicious cycle: terrorist attacks result in greater discrimination and persecution of innocent Muslim men, which has the unintended effect of further radicalization in some of the most vulnerable individuals. To conclude, I acknowledge that my comments may be out of turn because I have no authority or expertise, and because I'm from a country with an appalling record of discriminating against Muslims.<br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span>I was a bit confused by some of these scores, because they changed from one paragraph to the next, and differed from what was in Table 1.

Nerd Food: Tooling in Computational Neuroscience - Part II: Microscopy<div id="content"><p class="verse" style="text-align: right;"><small>Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing. <br /><i>Wernher von Braun</i></small></p> <p>Welcome to the second instalment of our second series on Computational Neuroscience for lay people. You can find the first post of the previous series <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">here</a>, and the first post of the current series <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/nerd-food-tooling-in-computational.html">here</a>. As you'd expect, this second series is slightly more advanced, and, as such, it is peppered with unavoidable technical jargon. Having said that, we shall continue to pursue our ambitious target of making things as easy to parse as possible (but no easier). If you read the first series, the second should hopefully make some sense.<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1">1</a></sup></p> <p>Our <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/nerd-food-tooling-in-computational.html">last post</a> discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience">Computational Neuroscience</a> as a discipline, and the kind of things one may want to do in this field. We also spoke about models and their composition, and the desirable properties of a platform that runs simulations of said models. However, it occurred to me that we should probably build some kind of "end-to-end" understanding; that is, by starting with the simulations and models we are missing a vital link with the physical (i.e. non-computational) world. To put matters right, this part attempts to provide a high-level introduction on how data is acquired from the real world and can then be used - amongst other things - to inform the modeling process. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">Macro and Micro Microworlds</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>For the purposes of this post, the data gathering process starts with the microscope. Of course, keep in mind that we are focusing only on the <i>morphology</i> at present - the shape and the structures that make up the neuron - so we are ignoring other important activities in the lab. For instance, one can conduct experiments to measure voltage in a neuron, and these measurements provide data for the functional aspects of the model. Alas, we will skip these for now, with the promise of returning to them at a later date<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2">2</a></sup>. </p> <p>So, microscopes then. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy">Microscopy</a> is the technical name for the observation work done with the microscope. Because neurons are so small - some 4 to 100 microns in size - only certain types of microscopes are suitable to perform neuronal microscopy. To make matters worse, the sub-structures inside the neuron are an important area of study and they can be ridiculously small: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine">dentritic spine</a> - the minute protrusions that come out of the dendrites - can be as tiny as 500 nanometres; the lipid bylayer itself is only 2 or 3 nanometres thick, so you can imagine how incredibly small ion channels and pumps are. Yet these are some of the things we want to observe and measure. Lets call this the "micro" work. On the other hand, we also want to understand connectivity and other larger structures, as well as perform observations of the evolution of the cell and so on. Lets call this the "macro" work. These are not technical terms, by the by, just so we can orient ourselves. So, how does one go about observing these differently sized microworlds? </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="F1.large.jpg" height="300px" src="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/39/16877/F1.large.jpg" width="300px" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> Example of measurements one may want to perform on a dendrite.

As it was with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope">Van Leeuwenhoek's</a> tool in the sixteen hundreds, so it is that today's optical microscopes still rely on light and lenses to perform observations. Needless to say, things did evolve a fair bit since then, but standard optical microscopy has not completely removed the shackles of its limitations. These are of three kinds, as Wikipedia helpfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Optical_microscopy">tells us</a>: a) the objects we want to observe must be dark or strongly refracting - a problem, since the internal structures of the cell are transparent; b) visible light's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system">diffraction limit</a> means that we cannot go much lower than 200 nanometres - pretty impressive, but unfortunately not quite low enough for detailed sub-structure analysis; and c) out of focus light hampers image clarity. </p> <p>Workarounds to these limitations have been found in the guise of <i>techniques</i>, with the aim of augmenting the abilities of standard optical microscopy. There are many of these techniques. There is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy">Confocal Microscopy</a><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3">3</a></sup> - improving resolution and contrast; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_microscope">Fluorescence microscope</a>, which uses a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy#Sub-diffraction_techniques">sub-diffraction technique</a></i>to reconstruct some of the detail that is missing due to diffraction; or the incredible-looking movies produced by <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/journey-through-the-brain-multiphoton-microscopy/">Multiphoton Microscopy</a>. And of course, it is possible to combine multiple techniques in a single microscope, as is the case with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphoton_fluorescence_microscope">Multiphoton Fluorescence Microscopes</a> (MTMs) and many others. </p> <p>In fact, given all of these developments, it seems there is no sign of optical microscopy dying out. Presumably some of this is due to the relative lower cost of this approach as well as to the ease of use. In addition, optical microscopy is complementary to the other more expensive types of microscopes; it is the perfect tool for "macro" work that can then help to point out where to do "micro" work. For example, you can use an optical microscope to assess the larger structures and see how they evolve over time, and eventually decide on specific areas that require more detailed analysis. And when you do, you need a <i>completely</i> different kind of microscope. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Electron Microscopy</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>When you need <i>really</i> high-resolution, there is only one tool to turn to: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope">Electron Microscope (EM)</a>. This crazy critter can provide <i>insane</i> levels of magnification by using a beam of electrons instead of visible light. Just how insane, you ask? Well, if you think that an optical microscope lives in the range of 1500x to 2000x - that is, can magnify a sample up to two thousand times - an EM can magnify as much as 10 <span class="underline">million times</span>, and provide a sub-nanometre resolution<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. It is mind boggling. If fact, we've already seen images of atoms using EM in <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks_31.html">part II</a>, but perhaps it wasn't easy to appreciate just how amazing a feat that is. </p> <p>Of course, EM is itself a family - and a large one at that, with many and diverse members. As with optical microscopy, each member of the family specialises on a given technique or combination of techniques. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope">Scanning Electron Microscope</a> (SEM) performs a scan of the object under study, and has a resolution of 1 nanometre or higher; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_confocal_electron_microscopy">Scanning Confocal Electron Microscope (SCEM)</a>uses the same confocal technique mentioned above to provide higher depth resolution; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy">Transmission Electron Microscopy</a> (TEM) has the ability to penetrate inside the specimen during the imagining process, given samples with thickness of 100 nanometres or less. </p> <p>A couple of noteworthy points are required at this juncture. First, whilst some of these EM techniques may sound new and exciting, most have been around for a <i>very</i> long time; it just seems they keep getting better and better as they mature. For example, TEM was used in the fifties to show that neurons communicate over synaptic junctions but its still wildly popular today. Secondly, its important to understand that the entire imaging process is not at all trivial - certainly not for TEM, nor EM in general and probably not for Optical Microscopy either. It just is a <i>very</i> labour intensive and <i>very</i>specialised process - most likely done by an expert human neuroanatomist - and the difficulties range from the chemical preparation of the samples all the way up to creating the images. The end product may give the impression it was easy to produce, but easy it was not. </p> <p>At any rate, whatever the technical details, the fact is that the imagery that results from all these advances is truly evocative - haunting, even. Take this image produced by SEM: </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="2014_06_26_human_ipsc_derived_neuron_deerinck.jpg" height="300px" src="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/news_uploads/2014_06_26_human_ipsc_derived_neuron_deerinck.jpg" width="300px" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Human neuron. <a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/new_reprogramming_method_makes_better_stem_cells">Source: New Reprogramming Method Makes Better Stem Cells</a></p></div> <p>Personally, I think it is incredibly beautiful; simultaneously awe-inspiring and depressing because it really conveys the messiness and complexity of wetware. By way of contrast, look at the neatness of man-made micro-structures: </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="bluegeneq%20x%20420.jpg" height="300px" src="http://m.eet.com/media/1118299/bluegeneq%20x%20420.jpg" width="300px" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span> The BlueGene/Q chip.

As you can see in the neuron micrograph, these images provide a great visual description of the topology of the object we are trying to study. You also may notice a slight coloration of the cell in that picture. This is most likely due to the fact that the people doing the analysis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining">stain</a> the neuron to make it easier to image. Now, in practice - at least as far as I have seen, which is not very far at all, to be fair - 2D grayscale images are preferred by researchers to the nice, Public Relations friendly pictures like the one above; those appear to be more useful for magazine covers. The working micrographs are not quite as exciting to the untrained eye but very useful to the professionals. Here's an example: </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="fetch.php?w=900&amp;tok=d88a10&amp;media=wiki:biomed-neurons.jpg" height="200px" src="http://www.leet.it/home/giusti/website/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=900&amp;tok=d88a10&amp;media=wiki:biomed-neurons.jpg" width="600px" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4:</span> The left-hand side shows the original micrograph. On the right-hand side it shows the result of processing it with machine learning. Source: <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4741-deep-neural-networks-segment-neuronal-membranes-in-electron-microscopy-images.pdf">Deep Neural Networks Segment Neuronal Membranes in Electron Microscopy Images</a></p></div> <p>Let's focus on the left-hand side of this image for the moment. It was taken using <i>ssTEM</i> - serial-section TEM, an evolutionary step in TEM. The <i>ss</i> part of ssTEM is helpful in creating <i>stacks</i> of images, which is why you see the little drawings on the left of the picture; they are there to give you the idea that the top-most image is one of 30 in a stack<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. The process of producing the images above was as follows: they started off with a neuronal tissue sample, which is prepared for observation. The sample had 1.5 micrometres and was then sectioned into 30 slices of 50 nanometres. Each of these slices was imaged, at a resolution of 4x4 nanometres per pixel. </p> <p>As you can imagine, this work is extremely sensitive to measurement error. The trick is to ensure there is some kind of visual continuity between images so that you can recreate a 3D model from the 2D slices. This means for instance that if you are trying to figure out connectivity, you need some way to relate a dendrite to it's soma and say to the axon of the neuron it connects to - and that's one of the reasons why the slices have to be so thin. It would be no good if the pictures miss this information out as you will not be able to recreate the connectivity faithfully. This is actually really difficult to achieve in practice due to the minute sizes involved; a slight tremor that displaces the sample by some nanometres would cause shifts in alignment; even with the high-precision the tools have, you can imagine that there is always some kind of movement in the sample's position as part of the slicing process. </p> <p>Images in a stack are normally stored using traditional formats such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format">TIFF</a><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. You can see an example of the raw images in a stack <a href="https://github.com/unidesigner/groundtruth-drosophila-vnc/tree/master/stack2/raw">here</a>. Its worth noticing that, even though the images are 2D grey-scale, since the pixel size is only a few nanometres wide (4x4 in this case), the full size of an image is very large. Indeed, the latest generation of microscopes produce stacks on the 500 Terabyte range, making the processing of the images a "big-data" challenge. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-5"><h2 id="sec-5">What To Do Once You Got the Images</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5"><p>But back to the task at hand. Once you have the stack, the next logical step is to try to figure out what's what: which objects are in the picture. This is called segmentation and labelling, presumably because you are breaking the one big monolithic picture into discrete objects and give them names. Historically, segmentation has been done manually, but its a painful, slow and error-prone process. Due to this, there is a lot of interest in automation, and it has recently become feasible to do so - what with the abundance of cheap computing resources as well as the advent of "useful" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> (rather than the theoretical variety). Cracking this puzzle is gaining traction amongst the programming herds, as you can see by the popularity of challenges such as this one: <a href="http://fiji.sc/Segmentation_of_neuronal_structures_in_EM_stacks_challenge_-_ISBI_2012">Segmentation of neuronal structures in EM stacks challenge - ISBI 2012</a>. It is from this challenge we sourced the stack and micrograph above; the right-hand side is the finished product after machine learning processing. </p> <p>There are also open source packages to help with segmentation. A couple of notable contenders are <a href="http://fiji.sc/Fiji">Fiji</a> and <a href="http://ilastik.org/">Ilastik</a>. Below is a screenshot of Ilastik. </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="Figure-2-a.png" height="300px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilastik/ilastik.github.io/master/gallery/Figure-2-a.png" width="400px" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span> Source: <a href="http://ilastik.org/gallery.html">Ilastik gallery</a>.</p></div> <p>An activity that naturally follows on from segmentation and labelling is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_tracing">reconstruction</a>. The objective of reconstruction is to try to "reconstruct" morphology given the images in the stack. It could involve inferring the missing bits of information by mathematical means or any other kind of analysis which transforms the set of discrete objects spotted by segmentation into something looking more like a bunch of connected neurons. </p> <p>Once we have a reconstructed model, we can start performing <i>morphometric analysis</i>. As wikipedia tells us, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics">Morphometry</a> is "the quantitative analysis of form"; as you can imagine, there are a lot of useful things one may want to measure in the brain structures and sub-structures such as lengths, volumes, surface area and so on. Some of these measurements can of course be done in 2D, but life is made easier if the model is available in 3D. One such tool is <a href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Neuro_tool">NeuroMorph</a>. It is an open source extension written in Python for the popular open source 3D computer graphics software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)">Blender</a>. </p>  <div class="figure"><p><img alt="NeuroMorph_screenshot.png" height="300px" src="https://en.blender.org/uploads/9/98/NeuroMorph_screenshot.png" width="300px" /></p><p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6:</span> Source: <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Segmented_anisotropic_ssTEM_dataset_of_neural_tissue/856713">Segmented anisotropic ssTEM dataset of neural tissue</a></p></div></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-6"><h2 id="sec-6">Conclusion</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6"><p>This post was a bit of a world-wind tour of some of the sources of real world data for Computational Neuroscience. As I soon found out, each of these sections could have easily been ten times bigger and still not provide you with a proper overview of the landscape; having said that, I hope that the post at least gives some impression of the terrain and its main features. </p> <p>From a software engineering perspective, its worth pointing out the lack of standardisation in information exchange. In an ideal world, one would want a pipeline with components to perform each of the steps of the complete process, from data acquisition off of a microscope (either opitical or EM), to segmentation, labelling, reconstruction and finally morphometric analysis. This would then be used as an input to the models. Alas, no such overarching standard appears to exist. </p> <p>One final point in terms of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). On one hand, it is encouraging to see the large number of FOSS tools and programs being used. Unfortunately - at least for the lovers of Free Software - there are also some proprietary tools that are widely used such as <a href="http://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida">NeuroLucida</a>. Since the software is so specialised, the fear is that in the future, the better funded commercial enterprises will take over more and more of the space. </p> <p>That's all for now.

<p>How much insight do you have into your own mental and emotional abilities, such as verbal intelligence, spatial cognition and interpersonal skills? Might your friends have a better idea of your strengths and weaknesses than you do? In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018330135">a new paper</a> in the journal <em>Heliyon</em>, a team led by <a href="https://aljoscha-neubauer.com">Aljoscha Neubauer</a> explain that while such questions of self- vs. other-insight have already been looked at in the context of the main <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160613-why-you-can-never-tell-what-your-friends-really-think-of-you">personality traits</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15053708">general IQ</a>, theirs is the first investigation in the context of more specific abilities. It’s an important issue for young people, they add, since choosing career paths that play to our abilities can increase the chances of later success – but it remains an open question whether and for which abilities people should rely on their own judgments or seek the advice of others.</p>
<p><span id="more-36049"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 233 participants in their mid-teens (average age 14) and 215 participants in their late teens (average age 18). Participants completed six tests, including: established measures of their verbal, numerical and spatial abilities; a test of divergent creativity (thinking up novel uses for an umbrella, plastic bottle and shoe); and a questionnaire tapping their intra- and interpersonal emotional management (based on the participants’ selection of the best way to deal with various social and emotional scenarios).</p>
<p>Immediately after completing the tests, the participants filled out an additional questionnaire asking them to reflect on and estimate their own abilities in the various domains that had been tested. Finally, they also completed the same questionnaire in relation to the abilities of one or more of their school classmates (such that each participant rated themselves and was also rated by two of their classmates).</p>
<p>The participants were very poor at judging their own verbal ability and their judgments of their peers’ verbal abilities were not much better – a result that the researchers described as their “most puzzling”, considering you’d think such abilities would be apparent both to oneself and one’s peers, especially in a school context. One possible explanation is that the teenagers’ conception of verbal intelligence “might not correspond” with the researchers’ conception and the way it was tested; another explanation, the researchers suggested, is that the participants verbal IQ was perhaps rather low and “individuals of lower verbal ability might be particularly weak at self- and peer estimating because this might require exactly what they are missing: a good verbal ability”.</p>
<p>In contrast with verbal intelligence, participants had some accurate insight into their own creativity, and even more insight into the creativity of their peers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for spatial ability an age difference emerged. At age 14, as with verbal ability, participants were poor at judging their own and each other’s spatial ability. By age 18, by contrast, participants had some accuracy at judging their own spatial abilities, but not their peers’ abilities.</p>
<p>In relation to interpersonal competence, the participants had a degree of insight into their own abilities, but not each other’s (perhaps because they simply scored how much they liked the person they were rating rather than offering an unbiased estimate of their social and emotional skills). One detail here is that their ability to estimate their peers’ interpersonal skills increased “considerably” at age 18, compared with 14, albeit that this accuracy was still relatively poor.</p>
<p>Finally, as the researchers expected, the participants’ were able to estimate their own intra-personal abilities with some accuracy, but not the intra-personal abilities of their peers (presumably because our inner emotional worlds are hidden to an extent).</p>
<p>Neubauer and his colleagues said their findings have “important practical implications”, particularly in the context of young people choosing their career paths. While they acknowledged their findings need replicating, they suggested that for some domains, especially verbal IQ, young people appear to have surprising ignorance of their own ability (or lack of ability). Even for those abilities where participants had more insight (into themselves and their peers), it’s worth noting that this was relatively modest, with their judgments accounting for only between 15 and 20 per cent of the variance in ability between participants.</p>
<p>Future research could test other age groups, and look at the judgments made by other informants besides participants’ peers, such as family members, to see if they would have greater insight into participants’ abilities. (The current study included a measure of friendship closeness but found no evidence that this affected the participants’ accuracy in judging their peers’ abilities.)</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that “As young people might have biased views of their own but also of their peers’ abilities, scientifically based career counselling should include not only tests for interests but also performance tests to avoid erroneous vocational decisions.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9817">Bullied Into Bad Science?</a></h4>

There's been an interesting discussion on Twitter about senior scientists who pressure their students or postdocs into scientific misconduct or otherwise poor science:

Bullying students into providing the "right" results: research misconduct by proxy?
This is probably among the worst but receives little attention

— Simon Eickhoff (@INM7_ISN) January 19, 2019
Today, I was made aware of a site called Bullied Into Bad Science which aims to tackle this problem.

<p>The<span><a href="http://www.maxplanckflorida.org/"> Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience</a></span> (MPFI) announces a new “labs@location” partnership agreement between the MPFI Electron Microscopy (EM) Core Facility and Germany-based microscopy company <span><a href="https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/home.html">ZEISS</a></span>, known for its cutting-edge imaging technologies. As a “labs@location” partner institution, MPFI will have access to state-of-the-art ZEISS technology before it is commercially available, providing researchers with innovative imaging tools that will empower their search for new insights into how the brain works. MPFI is the only the third institution in the United States to earn the labs@location designation.</p>
<p>“ZEISS and MPFI have a long-standing relationship—we have been closely cooperating to push the boundaries of visualizing the brain ultrastructure since MPFI was established in 2012,” said Dr. Naomi Kamasawa, Head of EM Facility. “Our facility might be small compared to other institutions, but the scientific excellence and technology feedback we provided, together with the continuous effort and passion to push boundaries in our research, made us a special partner for ZEISS.”</p>
<p>Kirk J. Czymmek, Head of the Global ZEISS Microscopy Customer Centers praised the EM Lab in his remarks, saying “The team that you have here is special, and they are internationally recognized for their expertise.”</p>
<p>MPFI and ZEISS launched the partnership on January 17, 2019 at an event that included lectures focused on Correlative Light-Electron Microscopy (CLEM), facility tours, and a partnership signing and reception held in MPFI’s Dreyfoos Atrium.</p>
<p>The first piece of equipment made available to MPFI scientists is known as the “Focal Charge Compensation module (FCC)”, which is integrated onto a Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscope system. The FCC introduces a local stream of nitrogen gas onto the sample inside the microscope, which absorbs unwanted electrical charges that interfere with imaging. “This new technology results in much higher quality images and allows us to collect data from even more challenging samples,” Dr. Kamasawa explained. “Anything that allows us to better visualize the structure of neurons and correlate it to their function will allow us to achieve a more complete understanding of neural networks, and ultimately, of the brain itself.” MPFI received the FCC equipment in August of this year, and was the first institution in the United States to use the technology after ZEISS made a number of significant improvements to the current commercially available model.</p>
<p>“The role of high-resolution imaging in unraveling the functional complexity of the brain cannot be overstated. This partnership is a great recognition of the unique know-how and research expertise provided by our electron microscopy facility. It underlines the importance of connecting core facilities, scientists and commercial partners, providing MPFI access to cutting edge technologies to push the boundaries of neuroscience research” said Dr. David Fitzpatrick, Scientific Director and CEO of MPFI.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>“Science is transitioning to utilizing 3D data sets and correlative microscopy, to this end we are pleased to partner with Max Planck Florida. These types of relationships are vital for us to better understand the issues and advantages of our hardware and software,” said James A. Sharp, President Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC.</p>
<p>In attendance were: Abdel Barraj, Head of Sales at ZEISS Microscopy North America; Kirk J. Czymmek, Head of the Global ZEISS Microscopy Customer Centers; Geoff Perumal, Academia Life Science EM/XRM Specialist at ZEISS Microscopy; Roger Unger, Regional Sales Manager, ZEISS; Oliver Tress, Systems Specialist, 3D Imaging, ZEISS; Robert Celestine, Area Manager, MICRO OPTICS OF FLORIDA, INC.</p>

<p>Recently it’s been difficult to avoid the mantra that masculinity is toxic. There’s that viral Gillette advert encouraging men to be nicer (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gillette-metoo-ad-on-toxic-masculinity-cuts-deep-with-mens-rights-activists">provoking a mix of praise, scorn and outrage)</a>; and the claim from the American Psychological Association (APA), in its promotion for its new guidelines on working with men and boys, that “<a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner.aspx">traditional masculinity—marked by stoicism, competitiveness, dominance and aggression—is, on the whole, harmful</a>” – a message welcomed by some, but criticised by many others, including Steven Pinker who dubbed it “<a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1085922404314968064">ludicrous</a>” and the British clinical neuropsychologist Vaughan Bell, who described the campaign as “<a href="https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1082280879790145536">an amazing misfire</a>“.</p>
<p>The APA report has been criticised on many grounds, including its oversight of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/03/the-psychology-of-sex-differences-5-revealing-insights-from-our-primate-cousins/">the biological roots of masculinity</a>, but the most frequently mentioned issue is with the overly simplistic, sweeping nature of the “masculinity is toxic” message. Traditional masculinity clearly reflects a host of values, beliefs and behaviours, some of which may indeed be harmful in certain circumstances, but some of which may also be beneficial, at least some of the time. Coincidentally, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-18237-001">a paper</a> in the January issue of the APA journal <em>Psychology of Men and Masculinity</em> captures just a little of this complexity.</p>
<p><span id="more-36060"></span></p>
<p>Responding to the lack of longitudinal research on this topic, and the concerns that potential positive aspects of masculinity have been overlooked, the new study measured nearly 300 young male college students’ endorsement of traditional masculinity at one time point, in the spring of their freshman year, and then measured their wellbeing six months later.</p>
<p>The findings are mixed, but given the recent cultural emphasis on toxic masculinity, one result stands out: young men who, on the “Conformity to Masculine Norms” scale, more strongly endorsed the masculine ideal of “success and winning” (they agreed with statements like “In general, I will do anything to win”), tended to score <em>higher</em> on psychological wellbeing six months later. “Men who adhere to this norm may experience a sense of mastery and achievement through their accomplishments,” said the researchers, led by <a href="https://psyc.umd.edu/gradprofile/kaya/aylin">Aylin Kaya</a> at the University of Maryland, “which can in turn boost their eudaemonic well-being.”</p>
<p>In contrast, and more in keeping with the message emanating from Gillette/the APA and others, the men who endorsed the masculine “Playboy” ideal (they agreed strongly that “If I could, I would frequently change sexual partners”) and/or the “power” ideal (“In general, I control the women in my life”) tended to report <em>lower</em> wellbeing six months later.</p>
<p>At the study start, the men also completed the “Gender Role Conflict” questionnaire (a scale developed in the 1980s ostensibly to explore problems arising from men’s aversion to femininity) and those who scored highly on the Restricted Emotionality sub-scale – for instance, they agreed “I have difficulty expressing my emotional needs to my partner” – also tended to report <em>lower</em> wellbeing six months later.</p>
<p>However, critics might point out that this correlation is almost inevitable as the items related to Restricted Emotionality are phrased in a negative way that assumes emotional control is a problem, such that it would be odd if a high score on this sub-scale was not associated with subsequent reduced wellbeing. A stronger case against traditional masculinity would be made by results showing that men who felt they successfully and deliberately controlled their emotions went on to experience diminished wellbeing, but such a finding seems highly unlikely given the shelves of evidence documenting the positive consequences of having more mental and emotional self-control.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the men’s endorsement, or not, of the majority of the norms that were measured by the “Conformity to Masculine Norms” scale did not, on their own, have a statistically significant association with their wellbeing six months on (positive or negative), including: “heterosexual-presentation” (being concerned to be perceived as straight); “self-reliance” (not wanting to seek help); “violence” (endorsing violence as a suitable response in some situations); “risk” (willingness to put oneself in risky situations); and “emotional control”.</p>
<p>Kayla and her colleagues said that the negative associations of the “Playboy” and “power” masculine norms with later wellbeing supported earlier cross-sectional work linking the endorsement of these norms with negative mental health outcomes in men. However, they added that the positive association between endorsing the “winning” norm and later wellbeing “is consistent with our hypothesis and with <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-21868-006">previous research</a> that has indicated in certain contexts, adherence to dominant masculine norms may contribute to positive mental health.”</p>
<p>Of course, these new results come with their own important caveats – they may not generalise to other groups beyond young American men at college, and they are based entirely on participants’ self-reports of their own values and wellbeing. Clearly more longitudinal research is needed, arguably using scales that are not phrased with an inherent bias against traditional masculine values, and also including outcome measures not only for the men themselves, but also for those people who live and work with them.</p>
<p>However, these results do provide a more nuanced take on the simplistic idea that traditional masculinity is entirely toxic, a point worth considering alongside the weight of research showing the benefit to children of having a father involved in their upbringing (a point that, hidden behind the “toxic masculinity” headlines, is acknowledged fully in the new APA report; <a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/boys-men-practice-guidelines.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/01/44847829654_61988f14da_b-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written by: Jenny Molloy (University of Cambridge), Juan Pedro Maestre (University of Texas, Austin)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experimental science is typically dependent on hardware: equipment, sensors and machines. Open Science Hardware means sharing designs for this equipment that anyone can reuse, replicate, build upon or sell so long as they attribute the developers on whose shoulders they stand. Hardware can also be expanded to encompass other non-digital input to research such as chemicals, cell lines and materials and a growing number of open science initiatives are actively sharing these with few or no restrictions on use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of academics are developing and using open hardware for research and education in addition to sharing their papers, data and software through broader open research practices. This brought a large cohort to the </span><a href="http://openhardware.science/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering for Open Science Hardware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GOSH) in Shenzhen China during October 2018, an four day event which convened over 110 of the most active users and developers of open science hardware from 34 countries and multiple backgrounds including academia, industry, community organising, NGOs, education, art and more. PLOS kindly supported an unconference session during GOSH 2018 where students and researchers shared the following opportunities and challenges to boosting open science hardware in an academic context and planned a course of action to forward the goal of the </span><a href="http://openhardware.science/global-open-science-hardware-roadmap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Open Science Hardware Roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make open science hardware ubiquitous by 2025.</span></p>
<p><b>Opportunities for open science hardware in academia</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open science hardware has some important intrinsic benefits. Firstly, it can reduce the cost of research, democratising opportunity and enabling limited budgets to stretch further. Joshua Pearce of Michigan Tech University has calculated a </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/spp/article/43/2/192/2414129"><span style="font-weight: 400;">return on investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hundreds to thousands of percent for funders of open hardware through a drastic reduction in lab costs. Secondly, it reduces duplication of effort by building on the work of others and thirdly, it provides opportunities to customise hardware to suit your optimal experimental design, rather than designing your experiment to fit the limitations of available hardware. Moreover, sharing more details of experimental designs facilitates replicability in science. This is needed more than ever given current lack of trust towards science in some societal contexts and fears within several scientific communities of a “reproducibility crisis”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining additional credit, citations and collaborations are all significant potential opportunities for academics developing open science hardware and are necessary to incentivise those activities. However, cultural change is required within existing systems of academic publication and reward to realise the opportunities. Change is coming, for example the recently established </span><a href="https://openhardware.metajnl.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Open Hardware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HardwareX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encourage formal publication of research advances and designs that well documented and appropriately licensed, while the </span><a href="https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Open Source Toolkit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channel highlights and rewards open hardware publications. We know that open approaches can reap rewards but there is room for further evidence in the hardware context. Open access publications and shared datasets can </span><a href="https://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confer a citation advantage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and many projects developing open research tools projects report high numbers of collaborations and significant funding that may not have been possible without their culture of sharing. The </span><a href="https://www.thesgc.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural Genomics Consortium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is involved in publishing over </span><a href="https://www.thesgc.org/publication"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two papers per week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partially a result of hundreds of collaborations through making data and tools freely available. Research funders can be responsive to openness as a strategy to maximise impact: UK-based research centre </span><a href="https://www.openplant.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenPlant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was awarded £12m to make open technologies for plant synthetic biology and two open source projects on diagnostics for infectious diseases were awarded &gt;£1m from the UK’s </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Challenges Research Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational use of open science hardware also reaps both tangible and intangible benefits for universities. It represents an opportunity to increase the quality of teaching and learning by providing access to instruments that would otherwise be too expensive in the numbers required for effective teaching. It also contributes to building critical thinking skills and breaking open the “black box” of laboratory equipment. There are many academics in the GOSH Community involving their students directly in developing open science hardware, such as air quality sensors at the University of Texas Austin or biological instrumentation through the </span><a href="https://www.biomaker.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biomaker Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cambridge. Still others such as the </span><a href="http://cta.if.ufrgs.br/capa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centro de Tecnologia Acadêmica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UFRGS in Brazil are using open hardware tools extensively in student lab practicals and research projects.</span></p>
<p><b>Challenges to address if open science hardware is to become ubiquitous</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several barriers to wider adoption of open science hardware in academia. One stumbling block is institutional buy-in and support: in these times of limited funding, many universities have become conservative about approaches to intellectual property and patenting of inventions. Encouraging an open approach to maximising societal and scientific impacts through technology and knowledge transfer requires a compelling narrative. This includes reassurance that openness is contextual. In some cases the traditional route of IP protection and restrictive licensing may be optimal to achieve intended outcomes, in others it is not and  open approaches should be considered a strategic option. It is also important to emphasise that open does not equal non-commercial. Indeed there are many examples of entrepreneurial academics and companies spinning off to sell open hardware back into academia but also to industry, non-profits, educational institutions and directly to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for ongoing support and scaling of open science hardware efforts is a perennial and important topic of discussion at GOSH. In the case of open science hardware, private investors may not consider open designs as maximizing profit opportunities but they can still be profitable and generate significant social and scientific returns. A major task for the GOSH academic working group formed at the unconference session is therefore to compile justification for a diverse range of funders including private philanthropists, social impact investors and venture funds to support open science hardware and further the goal of making it ubiquitous and widely used by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final topic of discussion during our session was creating awareness among the scientific community both online and offline at major scientific conferences. Offering community-level incentives, support and guidelines to document and share open science hardware is feasible and there is much low-hanging fruit. However, we have seen in other areas of open research that to obtain ubiquity these community efforts need to be backed by formal incentives and rewards. In other words, the value of open approaches has to be recognised in decisions around funding, promotions and hiring decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>Furthering open science hardware through community action</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four priority actions emerged which correspond closely to recommendations in the </span><a href="http://openhardware.science/global-open-science-hardware-roadmap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Open Science Hardware Roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: i) leverage the GOSH Community and network to produce guidance and case studies for universities, funders and other stakeholders; ii) put open science hardware on the agenda at large disciplinary conference; iii) raise awareness through mainstream academic channels; and iv) take the initiative within our own institutions to experiment with ideas and build local communities.</span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Asking patients to draw the parts of their body affected by illness (and similar drawing challenges) can provide insights into how they think about their illness, the seriousness of their condition, and how well they are likely to cope, among other things. For instance, when people who had experienced a heart attack were asked on repeated occasions to draw their heart, an increase in the size of their drawings over time correlated with more anxiety and a slower return to work.</p>
<p>This example and many others feature in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2018.1558088">new paper</a> in <em>Health Psychology Review</em> that’s charted the use of patient drawings in peer-reviewed research, finding that the approach has increased in popularity in recent years. From 1970 to 2002, the average number of papers involving patient drawings published per year was 0.5, whereas that increased to an average of 5.9 per year between 2003 and 2016. In all, Elizabeth Broadbent at the University of Auckland, and her colleagues found 101 relevant studies covering 27 categories of illness (most often cancer) and involving participants from 29 different countries, from Canada to Zimbabwe. “We can utilise patients’ drawings to improve our understanding of the illness experience and inform our clinical interventions,” they said.</p>
<p><span id="more-36032"></span></p>
<p>Besides assessing drawing size, other approaches used in this field include identifying themes in drawings; looking for distortions or omissions; studying drawing styles, such as use of colour; and analysing facial expressions.</p>
<p>Other study examples that feature in the review include research with brain injury survivors in which those who drew greater damage on their brain also tended to experience a longer recovery time and a worse quality of life; research with kidney transplant patients in which those who drew their kidneys larger tended to have higher anxiety and lower feelings of control; research comparing the drawings of healthy and sick children, which found sick children’s drawings featured fewer human figures; and research with AIDS-affected children that showed their drawings featured more bed-ridden people and less beauty and more distress.</p>
<p>There has also been drawing-based research involving people diagnosed with mental health conditions – for instance, a paper published in the 1970s found that drawings by people with depression “had less colour … and more emptiness and amorphousness than other diagnostic groups.”</p>
<p>While the research in this area is fascinating, it has suffered from a lack of methodological consistency such that Broadbent and her team were unable to conduct a meta-analysis (an analysis of findings combined from multiple prior studies). For example, there was great variation from one study to another in terms of the drawing instructions given to participants. This methodological variation also makes it difficult to establish the reliability and validity of using drawings as a research tool.</p>
<p>However, Broadbent’s team are optimistic: they recommend future research use drawing instructions that are as explicit as possible, and they believe patient drawings can offer insights missed by traditional health psychology questionnaires, thus helping to improve and personalise health psychology interventions (that are intended to help patients better understand and cope with their illness and treatment). For a flavor of this approach, here is one of their suggestions:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One way in which drawings could be used to personalise interventions is for the person delivering the intervention to discuss the patient’s drawing with the patient. Where misconceptions about pathophysiology are evident, these could be pointed out, and patients’ scans or x-rays, or medical test results could be discussed with the aim to correct misconceptions. Where emotions have been drawn, the drawing could be a good starting point for a discussion about how the patient has been emotionally affected by the illness.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have developed a new combination of technologies that allows them to identify the functional properties of individual synapses that link the two hemispheres and determine how they are arranged within a neuron’s dendritic field.</p>
<p>Each of the 20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex receives thousands of synaptic connections from other neurons, forming complex neural networks that make sensation, perception, movement, and higher cognitive functions possible.  Ultimately the function of these networks depends on events that occur within a neuron’s dendrite– extensions from the neuron’s cell body that resemble branches of a tree and receive synaptic connections from the axons of other neurons, A critical piece of the puzzle of cortical networks that continues to challenge neuroscientists is understanding the functional organization of synapses within a neuron’s dendritic field. This requires determining the functional properties of the synaptic inputs a neuron receives (<strong>what</strong> they are communicating), the source of the inputs (<strong>where</strong> they are coming from), and <strong>how</strong> they are arranged within the dendrite. <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)31081-X"> In a new article in <em>Neuron</em></a>, MPFI researchers detail how they recently devised new methods to answer these questions, revealing a functional order to the arrangement of distant and local synaptic inputs within a neuron’s dendritic field that may play an important role in coordinating network activity.</p>
<p>Graduate student Kuo-Sheng Lee, along with other members of the Fitzpatrick lab, explored this question in the mouse visual cortex by mapping the synaptic inputs that link the two cortical hemispheres via a fiber bundle called the corpus callosum. This pathway is thought to play a critical role in coordinating the activity of the two cerebral hemispheres, and, for the visual system, unifying our binocular view of the world. They developed an approach that would permit them to visualize the individual dendritic spines of a neuron (small dendritic specializations that receive excitatory synaptic inputs), characterize their functional properties, and determine whether they receive callosal inputs.</p>
<p>To visualize the activity of individual dendritic spines, Lee et al., used an advanced imaging technique that relies on calcium signals that are detected as changes in fluorescence.  By watching the dendritic spines ‘light up’ with activity in the living brain, they could present different visual stimuli to the animal and determine which was most effective. The dendritic spines, like most of the cells in visual cortex, respond selectively to the orientation of edges in the visual scene, so this was the functional property they chose to define for each spine. Then to determine whether a spine received synaptic input from the callosum, Lee et al. used direct stimulation of the other hemisphere and looked to see which of the dendritic spines would light up.  Having found that a small percentage of spines were reliably and consistently activated by stimulating callosal inputs, then they were ready to address how are they were arranged within the dendritic field.</p>
<p>One interesting possibility was that the callosal inputs with similar orientation preference might be clustered together within the dendritic field.  Previous results had provided evidence for clustering of synaptic inputs by functional properties and suggested that coactivation of clustered inputs could amplify their impact on the neuron’s response.</p>
<p>But, when they performed the analysis, they found that close pairs of spines receiving callosal input were no more likely to have similar orientation preference than a random distribution of the spines within the dendritic field. Then they considered another possibility. Perhaps the callosal spines were clustered with non-callosal spines with the same orientation preference, bringing spines with distant and local inputs that have similar orientation preference into close proximity on the dendrite.  When they took pairs of close spines, one a callosal recipient and the other non-callosal recipient, and examined the orientation preference of the pairs, they were excited to find that they were they more similar to each other than would be expected by chance.</p>
<p>Lee et al. recognized that their conclusions would be strengthened if they could confirm the functional evidence for orderly local and callosal connectivity with another experimental approach: defining the synaptic connections anatomically. To accomplish this, they used a novel technique called expansion microscopy to anatomically visualize the nanoscale synaptic contacts with conventional light microscopy. The results were consistent with the functional stimulation results, demonstrating that callosal inputs and local inputs (derived from the region right around the targeted neuron) that exhibit similar or­ientation preference are clustered within the dendritic field.</p>
<p>These observations put the concept of functional clustering into a whole new context: ‘birds of a feather flock together’ <strong>and</strong> ‘opposites attract’.  Functional clustering represents a fine scale spatial pattern of specificity in connections within the dendritic field that can bring together inputs that have similar properties <strong>and</strong> are derived from different networks.  Combined with the evidence that functional clustering of spines in the dendritic field can amplify their impact on neuronal response, neurons in the visual cortex could use this strategy to generate robust responses to orientation-matched inputs from the two hemispheres, contributing to a seamless perception of the visual world. A similar structure may apply to callosal connections that link other areas of the cortex, a fine-scale organization of synapses within the dendrites of individual neurons that has ramifications for large-scale network function.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/how-belief-systems-handle-contradiction-i-empirical-contradiction/">How belief systems handle contradiction - (I) Empirical contradiction</a></h4>

<p>In this essay, I will discuss the different ways in which a theory can be contradicted, and how theories react. The scope of this discussion is broader than science, so I will be discussing belief systems, of which scientific theories are a particular kind (although, according to Feyerabend, not that particular). Another kind of belief system is political theories, for example. What is a belief system? Roughly speaking (and it will get more precise in the discussion), it is a set of propositions about the world that have a universal character. In science, this could be the law of gravitation, for example. Those propositions have relations with each other, and thus they form a system. For example, some propositions might logically imply others. In a belief system, there are generally core concepts over which other propositions build upon (examples: the atom; the rational agent of economic theory).</p>
<p>How do we evaluate belief systems? In philosophy of science, it is generally considered that scientific theories are evaluated empirically, by testing the empirical validity of propositions. That is, we evaluate the extent to which propositions are contradicted by facts. This has been the core target of much of modern philosophy of science, and thus I will start by recapitulating arguments about empirical contradiction, and add a few remarks. What has been less discussed is two other types of contradiction, social and theoretical. By social contradiction, I refer to the fact that at any given time, different people hold contradictory beliefs, even when they are aware of the same empirical body of observations. How is it possible and do such contradictions get solved? By theoretical contradiction, I refer to the possibility that a system is in fact not logically coherent. It seems that in philosophy of knowledge, belief systems are generally seen as a set of logically consistent propositions, but I will argue that this view is not tenable or rather is a normative view, and that belief systems actually are in some sense “archipelagos of knowledge”.</p>
<p><u>Empirical contradiction</u></p>
<p>Science is largely dominated by empiricism. One version of it is the logical empiricism of the circle of Vienna (or logical positivism), dating from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. In a nutshell, it claims that scientific statements are of two types: elementary propositions whose truth can be verified empirically, in other words observations, and propositions that can be logically deduced from those elements. This leads to a bottom-up view of science, where experimental scientists establish facts, and then theoreticians build consistent theories from these facts. As far as I can see in my own field, this view is still held by a large portion of scientists today, even though it has been pretty much demolished by philosophy of science in the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. To give an example, logical empiricism is the philosophical doctrine that underlies the logic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Brain_Project">Human Brain Project</a>, whose core idea is to collect measurements of the brain and then build a model from those.</p>
<p>Karl Popper objected that, on a logical ground, propositions can in fact never be verified if they have a universal nature. For example, to verify the law of gravitation, you would have to make all apples in the world fall, and you would still be unsure of whether another apple in the future might not fall in the way you expect. Universal propositions can only be <em>contradicted </em>by observations. This leads to falsificationism, the idea that scientific theories can only be falsified, not verified. On this view, at any given time, there are different theories that are consistent with the current body of experimental observations, and science progresses by elimination, by coming up with critical tests of theories. For example, one of the motivations advanced for collecting “big data” in neuroscience, such as the connectome, is that theories are presumed to be insufficiently constrained by current data (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3169">Denk et al., 2012</a>). This view is extremely popular in biology today, even though again later work in philosophy of science has also pretty much demolished it.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing Quine (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Dogmas_of_Empiricism">Two dogmas of empiricism</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis">Duhem-Quine thesis</a>), we can object that a theory never gets tested directly, only models specific of a particular situation do. For example, if you wanted to test Newton’s laws, you could let an apple fall and measure its trajectory. But to do this, you would first need to come up with a model of the situation, where for example you would consider the apple as a point of a given mass subject to only the force of gravity. In this case, you would conclude that Newton laws are false. But you would have concluded differently if you had added an auxiliary assumption, that air also exerts a friction force on the apple, for which you would have to come up with a particular model.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">Kuhn</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">Lakatos</a> have pointed out that in fact, the way empirical contradictions are resolved is almost never by abandoning a theory. The process is rather one of <em>interpretation</em>, that is, of coming up with ways of making the observation congruent with the theory. This could be seen as a rhetorical maneuver, or as a fruitful scientific process. In this example, if you think that Newton laws are valid, then you would actually <em>deduce</em> the laws of friction from the empirical contradiction. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction">Laws of friction</a> are in fact very complicated in general and still an active field of research in physics, which draws on various domains of physics, and to make progress one has to accept the underlying theories.</p>
<p>The key point is to recognize that interpretation is not a flaw of the scientific process, but a logical necessity to confront a theory to reality. A theory is framed in the discrete structure of language, that is, in formal terms. For it to apply to anything in the world, things in the world must be mapped to the formal structure of the theory. This, in essence, is the process of modeling. In contrast with theory, a model does not have a universal character; it applies to a specific situation. In the example above, we would have to introduce the assumption that the apple is a rigid body, and that friction follows a particular law, for example that the friction force is proportional to speed. This implies that it is actually not possible to either verify or falsify a theory on the basis of an empirical observation.</p>
<p>This argument does not lead to a relativistic view (all theories have the same epistemic value and it is a question of taste); in this, I would temper some of the conclusions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend">Feyerabend</a>. Interpretation is in fact not only a logical necessity, but also a key element in scientific progress. Lakatos proposed that it is not theories that compete, but research programs. Some research programs are “degenerate”: they evolve by adding heteroclite ad hoc hypotheses to account for each new observation. Others are “progressive”: they evolve by extending their theoretical core, which then applies to new situations. In scientific practice, this is obtained by dissolving the specific character of interpretations into the universal character of theories. To come back to the apple example, initially we would interpret the empirical contradiction by coming up with an empirical model of friction, which essentially amounts to calling the empirical error “friction”. More precisely, it is an auxiliary hypothesis that makes the observation compatible with the theory. But this could then be turned into theoretical progress: from an analysis of a number of cases of falls of objects, we could then postulate that there is a friction force that is proportional to the speed of the apple and to its size (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law">Stokes law</a>). By doing so, we make parts of the previous interpretations instances of a new theoretical proposition. Note that this proposition only makes sense in the context of Newton’s laws, and thus we are indeed describing a system and not just a set of independent laws. The evaluative situation of the apple fall has now changed: we are evaluating a broader theoretical body (Newton’s laws + Stokes law) by using a narrower interpretative model (the apple is a rigid sphere).</p>
<p>Thus, interpretation is a key feature of belief systems, both logically necessary and progressive, and it appears to be neglected by the two flavors of empiricism that are broadly observed in science (verificationism and falsificationism). Yet without it, it is impossible to understand why people can disagree, other than by postulating than some must be either idiots or liars. I will address this issue in the next part on social contradiction.</p>
<p>So far, I have argued that scientists face empirical contradiction by interpretation. Theoretical progress is then made by dissolving interpretations into new theory. What this really means is that the very notion of “empirical contradiction” is in fact quite misleading, because for the person doing the interpretative work, there is no real contradiction, only a more complex situation than expected. I will end this part by drawing on developments of psychology, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance theory</a>, and extending to non-scientific situations.</p>
<p>Resolving empirical contradiction by interpretation is not at all specific of science, but is a general feature of how people confront their beliefs to facts. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails">When Prophecy Fails</a>, Leon Festinger and colleagues infiltrated a UFO sect that believed in an imminent apocalypse, and they examined what happened when the predicted end of the world did not happen. Believers did not at all abandon their belief. Instead, the leader claimed that they had managed to postpone the end of the world thanks to their prayers, and she proposed a new date. This is a case of interpretation of the observation within the belief system. But importantly, as discussed above, interpretation is not a flaw of human nature, but a necessary feature of belief systems. In this case, the believers appear to have arbitrarily made up an ad hoc justification, and we are tempted to dismiss it as a hallmark of irrational thinking. But when observe the anomalous trajectory of Jupiter and, to make up for this anomaly, we postulate that there must be an unobserved satellite orbiting around the planet, we are making an interpretative move of the same nature, except in this case it turns out to be correct. Our initial reaction in the former case is that any reasonable person should reject the theory if the prediction is directly contradicted, yet in the latter case we find the same attitude reasonable. In reality, the main difference between the two cases is not in the way empirical contradictions are handled, but in the perceived plausibility of both the prediction and the interpretation. Specifically, we do not believe that prayers can have any visible effect at all and thus the interpretative move appears irrational. But of course, the situation is quite different if the powers of prayer have a prominent role in our belief system. Thus, it is an error to describe the ad hoc interpretation as irrational. It is actually totally rational, in that it follows from logical reasoning (A, the end of the world should have occurred if we had not intervened; B, we have prayed; C, prayers have an impact; conclusion: the end of the world has probably be been prevented by our prayers). Only, rationality is applied within a highly questionable theoretical framework. In the end, we realize that it is not really the non-occurrence of the end of the world that should lead us to abandon the belief system, but rather the empirical contradictions of the belief system in its globality, for example the fact that prayers actually do not work.</p>
<p>Thus, it should not be surprising that in their field study, the authors find that it takes a number of failed end-of-the-world predictions before the beliefs are finally abandoned. This is what Imre Lakatos called a “degenerative research program”: the theory survives repeated contradictions only by making up an incoherent series of ad hoc assumptions. It ends up being overthrown, but the process can take a very long time (this process of change between scientific theories is well documented also by Thomas Kuhn’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The structure of scientific revolutions</a>).</p>
<p>This phenomenon is particularly visible in political discourse. Any significant political event or observation will be given a different interpretation depending on the political preferences of the person. It never happens that a right wing person turns left wing upon noticing that wealthy countries have many homeless people. Rather, an interpretation is made that revolves around the notion of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>To give a contemporary example, recent demonstrations in France have been met by an extraordinarily repressive response, with hundreds of serious injuries caused by police, some on journalists and children, which are documented by hundreds of videos circulating on social media (see @davduf and a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/01/16/maintien-de-l-ordre-le-lourd-bilan-des-lanceurs-de-balle-de-defense_5409630_1653578.html">recent article in Le Monde</a>). A recent one is a 47 year old voluntary fire man, father of three, who was demonstrating with his wife until they were dispersed by tear gas. He was later found lying alone in an empty street with a head injury, and an amateur video shows that police shot him in the head from behind with a flash-ball gun and launched a grenade in the street. The man is currently in a coma. In any of those cases, on social media there is invariably part of the comments that suggest that the man or woman must have done something bad (this is indeed the official doctrine, as the Minister of Interior has recently claimed that he is not aware of any case of police violence). It is not in itself irrational: simply, the commenter presumes that police do not hurt innocent citizens, deduces that the citizen involved is not innocent, and concludes that the critics are irrational conspiracy seekers.</p>
<p>There are indeed conspiracy theorists, for example those that claim that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories">landing on the moon was in fact filmed</a> in Hollywood studios. The fact that it is a conspiracy theory is not itself a reason to discredit it, since there have been conspiracies in History. The theory itself is also not irrational, in that it has logical coherence as well as empirical elements of support. For example, on the video the American flag appears to float in the wind whereas there can be no wind on the moon and in fact the flag should appear folded. Indeed: the flag was made rigid precisely for that reason. But most people do not know this fact, and thus the reasons why the ordinary citizen believes that man actually did land on the moon is that she trusts the source and finds the information plausible. Which attitude is irrational?</p>
<p>These examples illustrate several points. First, isolated empirical contradictions almost never shake a belief system. In fact, this is precisely what we mean when we say that “<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence">extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</a>”. This proposition, however, is quite misleading since the notion of what is extraordinary is specific of a particular belief system. There is no objective definition of “extraordinary”. Therefore, rather than being a normative feature of scientific method, it simply expresses the inherent conservativeness of belief systems. As Festinger’s study shows, it can take a large number of empirical contradictions to impact a belief system. As explained previously, this is not necessarily a flaw as those contradictions can (sometimes) be turned into theoretical progress within the belief system.</p>
<p>But there are other ways in which empirical contradictions are handled by belief systems, which are documented in psychology by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance theory</a>. A major one is simply to avoid being confronted to those contradictions, for example by reading newspapers with the same political views, or by discrediting the source of information without actually examining the information (e.g. social media propagate fake news, therefore the video cannot be trusted). Another is proselytism, that is, trying to convert other people to your belief system.</p>
<p>These mechanisms explain that at any given moment, mutually contradictory belief systems are held by people who live in the same world and are in contact with each other, and who can even discuss the same empirical observations. The conclusion of our discussion is that the main problematic issue in belief systems is not so much irrationality as dogmatism (but we will come back to irrationality in the third part on theoretical contradiction). Dogmatism arises from two different attitudes: blindness and deafness. Dogmatism is blind in that it actively refuses to see empirical evidence as potentially contradictory: it is not just that it is contradicted by empirical observations (this very notion is questionable), but rather that it dismisses empirical contradiction without seriously trying to accommodate for it in a progressive way (i.e., by strengthening its theoretical core). Dogmatism is deaf in that it refuses to acknowledge for the possibility that other rational belief systems can exist, and may have diverging interpretations of the empirical body of observations. Dogmatism denies the theoretical possibility of disagreement: the opponent is always either an idiot (irrational) or a liar (has ulterior motives). In the next part, I will turn to social contradiction: how different belief systems can co-exist and influence each other.</p>

<p>For every girl with ADHD, there are three boys with the same diagnosis. But among adults, the gender ratio is more like 1:1. That’s a big discrepancy. So what’s going on?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In 2017, Aja Louise Murray and colleagues <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087054717705202?journalCode=jada">investigated</a> possible predictors of childhood vs. later (adolescent/adult-onset) ADHD, and they found hints that girls tend to develop ADHD at a later age than boys. Now a team that includes the same researchers has investigated this explicitly and in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12721">their paper</a> in <i>Developmental Science</i>, they’ve confirmed it seems to be the case, which could partially explain the discrepancy in the ADHD gender ratio between children and adults.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36029"></span></p>
<p>The researchers analysed data on 1,571 children living in Zurich, Switzerland, whose teachers used a standard scale to assess symptoms of inattention and also of hyperactivity/impulsivity every year from age 7 (when the children started school) through to age 15. The two domains of ADHD were assessed separately, as previous work has found that they can develop at different rates.</p>
<p>When it came to inattention, most of the children (about 60 per cent of boys and girls) had low levels of symptoms between the ages 7 to 15. However, whereas the remaining 40 per cent of the boys had persistently high inattention levels during this period, among the girls there was more variation, and generally lower symptom levels: almost a third had moderate symptoms that declined with increasing age, while the others started out with relatively serious symptoms at age 7, which then declined, but still remained above average at age 15.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For hyperactivity/impulsivity, there were also some contrasting developmental profiles between the sexes. Again, the majority of children (81 per cent of the girls and 61 per cent of the boys) started out with low levels of symptoms, which decreased even further into late adolescence. There was also a group (13 per cent of boys and 10 percent of girls), who had mildly elevated symptoms in childhood, followed by a dip around age 11 to 13, but then a rapid increase. “This group could speculatively be characterised as ‘adolescence-triggered’,” the researchers write. Finally, there was also a group of children (24 per cent of boys, versus only 9 per cent of girls) who had high levels of symptoms all the way through the study period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In other words, according to this data, more boys than girls show consistently high levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity – and inattention – symptoms from a young age, whereas proportionately more girls than boys develop high levels of these symptoms (which may lead to a diagnosis of ADHD) only after early adolescence.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for this difference, it could be relevant to the sex difference in diagnosis rates because current ADHD diagnostic criteria for children require symptoms to have begun before the age of 12. This could mean that a greater proportion of girls with ADHD, than boys, are being missed by clinicians. (Exactly why adolescence might be associated with a sudden rise in these symptoms in some children, and especially girls, is not known – it could be to do with hormones, and/or increased social and academic pressures, the researchers note.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“More attention should be paid to early adolescence as a period of risk for hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom onset or worsening,” Murray and her colleagues write.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, they add: “It should be investigated whether removing the ‘onset before 12’ stipulation in diagnostic tests would help to identify more girls who would benefit from intervention.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Given a passage of text to study, many students repeatedly re-read it in the hope the information will eventually stick. Psychology research has shown the futility of this approach. Re-reading is a poor strategy, it’s too passive and it leads the mind to wander. Much better to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/29/episode-13-how-to-study-and-learn-more-effectively/">test yourself on what you read, or explain it to yourself or someone else</a>. Now <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-48893-001">a paper</a> in <em>Experimental Psychology</em> suggests the same is true of lecture videos – immediately re-watching them doesn’t lead to any greater learning.</p>
<p><span id="more-36020"></span></p>
<p>Leonardo Martin and his team asked 72 participants to watch two lecture videos, both around 10 minutes long. One was a live recording of a lecture about sanitation in the middle ages; the other consisted of voice over slides and was about problem solving. Some students watched the sanitation video first, the others watched the problem solving video first. Also, all the students watched one of the videos (either the sanitation one or the problem-solving one) just once before being tested on it, whereas they watched the other video twice in succession before being tested on it (nine multiple-choice questions in each case). Finally, while they were watching the videos, the students answered a few prompts about whether they were mind wandering or not.</p>
<p>If immediately re-watching a lecture video helps improve learning then the students ought to have performed better at the test that followed the video they watched twice. But this wasn’t the case – they averaged 79 per cent accuracy in the test about the video they watched once, compared with 76 per cent accuracy in the test that followed the video they watched twice (a statistically non-significant difference). The students also mind wandered more during the repeat viewing than when watching either of the lectures for the first time.</p>
<p>One important caveat is that this research was specifically about the effects of immediately re-watching a lecture video (“massed re-watching”, as the researchers put it). Re-watching a video after a sufficient delay could be more effective (akin to a form of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930147/">distributed practice</a>), although testing yourself is probably still the more favourable strategy.</p>
<p>“Re-watching a video lecture does not encourage individuals to build a richer representation of the content,” the researchers concluded, “thus leading to a more passive mode of viewing that puts little demands on attentional control, ultimately leading to more mind wandering.”</p>

<p>What strategies do you use to push through a tough challenge, be it a run on a treadmill or a stressful phone call with your boss? Perhaps you remind yourself of what you have to gain from completing the task, or you use distraction, or you think about the bad things that will happen if you give in? For <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2182">a paper</a> in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em>, a team led by Marie Hennecke at the University of Zurich has conducted what they say is the first ever investigation of these strategies, and others, that people use spontaneously in their everyday lives to “regulate their persistence during aversive activities”.</p>
<p>The researchers’ main interest was to see whether people with strong self-control differ from flakier types by virtue of their use of more effective strategies. In fact, this was not the case – yes, some strategies were more effective than others (offering hope to those of us with weaker willpower that we might benefit from adopting such strategies), but greater use of effective strategies did not explain the persistence of the grittier types, thus suggesting, as the researchers put it, that “… trait self-control and self-regulatory strategies represent separate routes to good self-regulation”.</p>
<p><span id="more-35990"></span></p>
<p>The researchers started with a pilot study in which they presented hundreds of participants with challenging scenarios (such as completing a treadmill run) and asked them to list any strategies they’d typically use to push through to the end. The researchers collapsed the answers into 19 strategies most of which fell under one of two headings: situation modification strategies (e.g. drinking coffee; listening to music while working); and attentional deployment strategies (e.g. motivational self-talk or thinking the finish is near).</p>

<p>Next, Hennecke’s team ran another pilot study with North American participants and German-speaking participants in which they asked them to complete a measure of their trait self-control and then to indicate how often they used these 19 different strategies (see left). For the study proper, the researchers then used a week-long “experience sampling method” with over 250 young German-speakers – as well as completing the trait self-control quiz, these participants were prompted multiple times a day to log any aversive challenges they’d recently been engaged in (examples included self-study, lectures, commuting and housework), what strategies they’d used to persist, and whether they’d been successful.</p>
<p>Across the different types of aversive challenge, the strategies correlated with success were: thinking about the positive consequences of getting to the end (this was also the most popular strategy); monitoring one’s goal progress; thinking that the end is near (the second most popular strategy); and emotion regulation (e.g. trying to stay in a good mood). In contrast, distracting oneself from the aversive challenge was associated with <em>less</em> success – perhaps because distraction makes us more inclined to give in and do something more pleasant (note the contrast with research on resisting temptations, such as in the classic Marshmallow Test studies, in which distraction <em>was</em> found to be effective).</p>
<p>These new findings are of theoretical interest – for instance, an excessive focus on the potential positive outcomes of challenges has previously been flagged in research as an unhelpful approach because it encourages a dependence on so-called extrinsic motivation. Researchers have <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7198/how-goals-and-good-intentions-can-hold-us-back">previously argued</a> that we are actually more likely to reach our goals if we can find pleasure in the process (intrinsic motivation). Hennecke and her colleagues speculated that perhaps the key factor here is whether the challenge is enjoyable or inherently aversive – if the latter, then perhaps focusing on positive outcomes can be an effective strategy. Further research can test this. Meanwhile, monitoring one’s progress is <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/21387/the-ostrich-problem-and-the-danger-of-not-tracking-your-progress">well-established</a> as an effective self-control strategy; on the other hand, the researchers said the strategy of thinking that the finish is near, while very popular here, has actually not been studied before.</p>
<p>Returning to Hennecke and her colleagues’ main focus – whether people with more self-control use more effective strategies – yes, two of the effective strategies were used more often by participants higher in trait self-control, namely focusing on positive consequences and emotion regulation (as was a third strategy – goal setting – though this strategy was not correlated with greater success). Crucially, however, as I mentioned above, the greater use of these two effective strategies did not explain why these high trait self-control individuals tended to enjoy greater success at aversive challenges. “It is possible that more automatic processes that individuals may not be able to explicitly report are better candidates for explaining individual differences in self-control,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Limitations of the new findings include the reliance on participants’ own estimates of their success at persistence, and the mostly student sample for the main study (for whom the nature of everyday challenges are likely to be different than for non-students). However, this research clearly breaks new ground. As Hennecke and her colleagues put it, “… our findings promote a more comprehensive understanding of self-regulatory success and failure during people’s daily attempts to regulate their persistence during aversive activities.”</p>

The story of Levon Khachigian’s research is a long and winding tale.

The team around the paediatric oncologist Nabil Ahmed at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, discovered a way to engineer T-leukocytes to bypass the blood-brain barrier at attack otherwise untreatable brain cancers. Their amazing technology to get this published in Nature was brazenly insolent data fakery.

<p>We had our first meeting of the year. The <a class="reference external" href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/teams/neurofedora/neurofedora.2019-01-11-14.00.log.html">full logs</a>
from our meeting are available here on the <a class="reference external" href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora mote application</a>. I have pasted the minutes of the
meeting at the end for your convenience.</p>
<p>The meeting was broadly for the team to come together and discuss a few things.
We checked on the status of current tasks, and discussed our future steps.
We've got to work on our documentation, for example.  There's a lot to do, and
a lot of cool new things to learn---in science, computing, and community
development. If you'd like to get involved, please get in touch.</p>
<p>We're continuing our work on including software in NeuroFedora, since that's
the major chunk of our work load.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9811">A Scientific Song of Consciousness and Self</a></h4>

In what may be a world first, a peer-reviewed journal, Frontiers in Psychology, has published a song.



The musical contribution to science is called 'It's Hard Work Being No One', and it comes from psychologist J. Scott Jordan of the Illinois State University. Here's some of the lyrics, which deal with nothing less than the existential question of identity:
I got a ticket on the next train to OZ
Gotta see that crazy wizard because
Even tin man was an I, just had no heart
Scarecrow was

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stereotype threat is a very evocative, disturbing idea: Imagine if simply being reminded that you are a member of a disadvantaged group, and that stereotypes hold that members of your group are bad at certain tasks, led to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performed worse on such tasks than you would otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s been the claim of stereotype threat researchers since the concept was first introduced in the mid-1990s, and it’s spread far and wide. But as seems to be the case with so many strong psychological claims of late, in recent years the picture has gotten a bit murkier. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-073115-103235"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that stereotype threat has a robust but small-to-medium sized effect on performance,” </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/19/reverse-stereotype-threat-women-play-chess-better-than-expected-against-men/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Alex Fradera here at the BPS Research Digest in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “but a </span><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440514000831"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that publication bias may be a problem in this literature, inflating the apparent size of the effect.” Adding to the confusion are some results which seem to run exactly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to what the theory would suspect, like the one Fradera was reporting on: In that study, female chess players were found to have performed better, not worse, against male opponents, which isn’t what the theory would have predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, another study is poised to complicate things yet further. In a paper to be published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Journal of Social Psychology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/v92wk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a team led by Charlotte Pennington of UWE Bristol recruited female participants to test two mechanisms (reduced effort and working memory disruption) that have been offered to explain the supposed adverse performance effects of gender-related stereotype threat. They also compared different ways of inducing stereotype threat. Interesting questions, you might think, but in all cases the researchers came up empty.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35934"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennington and her colleagues’ study consisted of a pair of experiments in which they asked women to complete eye-tracking (both experiments) tasks, intended to test their inhibitory control, and a mental-arithmetic task (the second experiment only) designed to test their working memory. The participants were split into groups and, prior to their completion of the task, given various stereotype reminders — some, for example, were informed that some research shows “that gender differences exist on visuospatial and mathematical tasks,” and that “females are shown to perform less accurately compared to males.” These reminders were used to provoke two different kinds of stereotype threat – one was “group-as-target”  designed to induce a fear that one’s own performance may be used justify stereotypes about women’s inferior performance; the other, a “self-as-target” threat, involved mentioning that women typically perform worse on the task than men, but with the focus of the results supposedly on their own personal ability. In the second experiment, a group was exposed to a positive stereotype claim, to see if that would improve performance, and in both experiments, a control group wasn’t exposed to any stereotype-laden messaging at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of both experiments are easy to sum up: Pennington and her colleagues detected no differences between the groups on the key measures they were testing, either in terms of reduced effort or signs of working memory interference. Simply put, neither experiment provided any evidence for a stereotype effect in this setting, let alone revealing anything about the possible mechanisms or contrasting effects of group- or self-threats. Of course, plenty of other studies </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provided evidence for such effects. It’s complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One paragraph in Pennington et al’s paper shows just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complicated:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has revealed many factors that heighten individuals’ susceptibility to stereotype threat. From a methodological viewpoint, performance decrements are more likely to occur under stereotype threat when the task is difficult … However, a recent meta-analysis casts doubt on task difficulty as a significant moderator of stereotype threat … It is also proposed that stereotype threat effects are more likely to emerge when individuals attribute worth to their social group membership (i.e., group identification…), endorse the stereotype to be accurate (i.e., stereotype endorsement…), and identify strongly with the stereotyped domain … Nguyen and Ryan (2008) report in their meta-analytic review, however, that women with moderate relative to high domain identification are more affected by gender-maths stereotypes, with research further suggesting that individuals do not need to identify with the stereotyped domain or group to experience stereotype threat .… The complexity of these observed findings has led some scholars to theorise that individuals may experience unique forms of stereotype threat, which are moderated by different factors and underpinned by diverse mechanisms … [References, removed here for ease of reading, can be found in the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/v92wk/">preprint</a>].</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If what all these messy, sometimes contradictory findings suggest is true, and stereotype threat, to the extent it has an effect, is moderated by factors like explicit endorsement (or not) of the stereotype in question, or domain identification (or not), and so on – then who is to say we’ve come close to figuring out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the possible moderators? At a certain point, the simple storyline that caused the concept to spread so virally in the first place just doesn’t quite hold anymore. It’s not “You will be affected by X,” but rather, “You might be affected by X, depending on A, B, and C.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the nature of good science, of course: We hone in on the truth by figuring out the complicated ways a given phenomenon works. But sometimes this process is at odds with science </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">communication</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and can lead to preemptive, oversimplification popularisation and application. If stereotype threat is so complicated that “individuals may experience unique forms of” it, then what are we left with, exactly?</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">Human Rights Day</a>  is held on the 10<sup>th</sup> December, the date that the United Nations General Assembly adopted the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. To mark this occasion, Professor Siroos Mirzaei, an Associate Editor for <em>BMC International Health and Human rights</em>  and Head of the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the Wilhelminen Hospital in Vienna, with Professor Thomas Wenzel, an Associate Professor from the Medical University of Vienna, were invited to write a blog post on the role that physicians play in upholding human rights and the dangers associated with this.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-10752 alignleft" height="255" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/human-resources-2724191_1280-300x300.png" width="255" />
<p>The authors explain that physicians are often faced with a variety of different ethical and human right issues. Examples include being requested to violate ethical standards in so called <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h589.long">“dual obligations”</a> situations, such as being involved in the planning and observation of torturing prisoners. Physicians can also find themselves at <a href="http://persian2english.com/?p=16713">serious risk</a> for upholding legal and ethical standards. Mirzaei and Wenzel then conclude the blog post by discussing the barrage of new ethical challenges that physicals may face, linked, for example, to medical technology or <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-24">health related aspects of conflicts</a>.</p>

<p>A new article, published as part of the ongoing <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/hsroud">Health Services Research for Opioid Use Disorders</a> thematic series in <em>BMC Health Services Research,</em> investigates different opioid treatment policies in the USA and how these variations may affect opioid-related hospital readmissions in different states</p>
<p>Such policies include, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law">Good Samaritan laws</a>, the availability of naloxone to reverse the effects of an overdose or the provision of medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence. Blanchard <em>et al</em> conducted a study to assess whether such state opioid treatment policies had an effect on 90-day opioid-related hospital readmissions.</p>
<p>Differences in index hospitalization rates suggest that states with opioid treatment policies had a higher level of need for opioid-related intervention; this may be a factor in the higher rates of hospital readmission in these states. This, in turn, also suggests that more research is needed to understand what various opioid treatment policies can be most effective in reducing hospital readmission rates.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy-induced_peripheral_neuropathy">Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy</a> (CIPN) is a progressive condition experienced by up to 40% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and sensitivity to cold in the hands and feet and sometimes in the arms and legs. It can cause sufferers to lose function of the affected limbs.  Diagnosing and treating CIPN quickly may prevent this loss of physical function.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a progressive condition experienced by up to 40% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Knoerl <em>et al</em> recently published the results of a trial whereby self-reported physical function in cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy (chemotherapy known to cause CIPN) is assessed via a newly developed Electronic Symptom Assessment-Cancer (ESRA-C) intervention.  The article reports that the patients experienced significantly less reduction in physical functioning when reporting their symptoms in this way.</p>

<p>Studies have suggested that caregivers can be vulnerable to psychological distress (for example, depression), particularly women. An article has recently been published in <em>BMC Women’s Health</em> that investigates the relationship between caregiving (proving unpaid care to someone who has physical, psychological or developmental needs) and depression amongst Baby Boomer women, using surveys distributed to women from nineteen different countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>Baby Boomer women living in countries where a higher proportion of their peers are expected to be in managerial/professional employment and living in countries where women are often in vulnerable employment were found to be at greater risk of displaying symptoms of depression</p></blockquote>
<p>The term “Baby Boomer” refers to people born between 1946 and 1964. This group of people benefited from the global revival after World War II, with many becoming more highly educated than the previous generation and therefore more likely to be employed in professional and managerial occupations.  Baby Boomer women living in countries where a higher proportion of their peers are expected to be in managerial/professional employment and living in countries where women are often in vulnerable employment were found to be at greater risk of displaying symptoms of depression.  These findings suggest that the risk of depression amongst Baby Boomer women in a caregiving role is dependent in some degree upon social context and structure and that promoting mental health for this group should therefore be tailored to their situation.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Around 30 per cent of British children fail to meet expected targets in reading or maths at age 11. These children face a future of continuing difficulties in education, as well as poorer mental health and employment success. Understanding why some kids struggle – and providing them with tailored support as early as possible – is clearly vital. Some will be diagnosed with a specific disorder, such as Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder or dyslexia, and get targeted help. But many will not. And even many conventional diagnostic labels may be misleading, and fail to capture the true picture of a child’s problems, according to new work by a team at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge, which has come up with a radical, alternative approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35933"></span></p>
<p>Duncan Astle and his colleagues studied 520 children aged between 5 and 18 years (average age 9) who had been referred to a research clinic at the unit for problems with attention, memory, language or poor school progress in reading or maths. Setting aside these diagnoses, they gave all the children a battery of assessments of their cognitive and learning performance, which included measures of working memory, phonological processing, spelling, reading, and maths. Their communication skills were measured using a separate checklist. A parent or carer also completed behavioural assessments of each child – reporting on their impulse control and emotional regulation, for example. The team then fed the cognitive and learning results for each child into an artificial neural network, which looked for any patterns in the data, grouping kids with distinct similarities into clusters.</p>
<p>One hundred and eighty-four of these children also had MRI brain scans – as did 36 typically performing children, for comparison – allowing the researchers to look for any group differences in patterns of communication between brain regions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As reported in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12747">their open-access paper</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em>, according to the artificial neural network analysis, the children fell into four distinct groups. But these bore no relationship to their previous diagnoses. As the researchers write, “children referred primarily for problems with attention, poor learning or memory were equally likely to be assigned to each group”. This finding is worth stressing. The conventional diagnostic labels already given to the children did not<i> </i>reflect their cognitive profiles identified by the thorough testing in this study: “The four groups cut across any traditional diagnostic groupings that existed within the data,” the researchers wrote. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So what did characterise these groups?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>More than half of the children in the sample fell into two extremes. Those in the “age appropriate” group in fact scored typically for their age on the cognitive tests; they did not have learning difficulties. But they did have an elevated level of behavioural difficulties, which presumably accounted for their problems in school. Meanwhile, members of the “broad cognitive deficits” group had widespread and severe cognitive problems, scoring in the bottom 5 per cent of the population on measures of spelling, reading and maths, and also experiencing difficulties with communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Generalised cognitive deficits therefore appear to constrain multiple aspects of learning,” the authors note. Relative to the other groups, kids in this group also showed reduced connectivity between some specific areas of the brain that have previously been identified as playing a role in multiple higher-order cognitive skills (such as problem-solving). “These general struggling learners are rarely studied, but our data suggest that they are common amongst those coming to the attention of children’s specialist services,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Children in the other two groups scored in between the two extremes, overall – but they also showed some specific deficits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One group was particularly poor at phonological processing – processing sounds in words – and verbal short-term and working memory. As might be expected, these children had trouble with speech, syntax and general coherence. And the brain imaging data showed reduced connectivity between regions implicated in language processing, supporting the AI analysis. However, these children were also poor at maths, which was unexpected. Though impaired phonological processing is typically associated with problems with reading, this data suggests that it’s likely to indicate more general learning deficits.</p>
<p>Members of the fourth group had distinct difficulties in working memory, scoring significantly below average on spatial, short-term memory and on verbal and spatial working memory. (There was no obvious differences in the brain connectivity patterns of these children.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the striking findings is that though the two intermediate groups had different specific deficits, their performance at maths and reading were almost identical. This contrasts with earlier research linking phonological problems to reading difficulties (dyslexia) and spatial short-term and working memory problems with trouble with maths (dyscalculia). This may be because previous studies have tended to recruit kids with these specific deficits – i.e. reading but not numeracy problems, for example. According to the new results, such specific learning problems may in fact be relatively rare in the general population of struggling learners (which chimes with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/18/uk-study-finds-children-with-maths-difficulties-sldm-dyscalculia-are-100-times-less-likely-to-receive-an-official-diagnosis-than-peers-with-dyslexia/">a recent study</a> of dyscalculia prevalence that found most children with dyscalculia also had language problems).</p>
<p>The researchers do acknowledge a few imitations with the study. For example, as a total of only 220 children were included in the neuro-imaging comparison portion of the research, only the largest and most consistent group differences are likely to have been revealed. (Which could explain why the team did not observe brain communication differences in a few of the groups.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But there are clearly potentially important insights here. <i>If</i>, as this work suggests, children can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>struggle with maths and reading for very different reasons, which do not necessarily align with diagnoses made in the conventional way, then surely the diagnosis and referral process has to be looked at – and the interventions that might help these children will surely have to be differently tailored, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Our new Board Chair is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairadam/">Alastair Adam</a>, currently Co-CEO of innovative digital textbook publisher, <a href="https://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/">FlatWorld</a>, who brings to the role not only a strong understanding of publishing – including scientific journals – but also his business savvy and strategic skills. Alastair joined the Board effective November 1 and assumed the Chair role on January 1, 2019, replacing our longtime Board Chair, Gary Ward (more on Gary a little later).</p>
<p>We also added <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/svazire">Dr. Simine Vazire</a>, who is currently a Professor in the Department of Psychology at UC Davis where <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/directory-of-people/featured-faculty/simine-vazire-studying-self-knowledge">her research</a> focuses on one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in psychology: how do we know ourselves? In 2017, she was awarded a <a href="https://www.bitss.org/lr-prizes/">Leamer-Rosenthal Prize</a> for Open Social Science in recognition of her efforts to advance reproducibility, openness and credibility in the social sciences. She held a previous role as a senior editor of <em>Collabra: Psychology</em> and Editor-in-Chief of <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>. Her scientific and editorial expertise bring a well-rounded and diverse perspective to our Board, and will help to ensure that working scientists retain a strong voice on our Board.</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/profile/victoria-coleman/">Dr. Victoria Coleman</a> joined the Board in May 2018. She is currently the Chief Technology Officer at the Wikimedia Foundation where she sets the organization’s technical roadmap for the evolution, development, and delivery of core platforms and architecture.  Victoria brings valuable technology experience to the Board at a time when PLOS, like many mid-size publishers, faces important and difficult choices about its technology infrastructure. Victoria serves in several advisory roles including the Board of the Santa Clara University Department of Computer Engineering and as Senior Advisor to the Director of the University of California Berkeley’s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society.</p>
<p>We also wanted to ensure that we maintain deep experience in PLOS’ core biomedical science fields, and we are very lucky to have Professor <a href="https://chancellor.ucsf.edu/campus-leadership/executive-cabinet/keith-yamamoto-phd">Keith Yamamoto</a> of UCSF agree to join us (effective February 1, 2019). Keith is both a highly regarded scientist running his own research lab and has extraordinary experience in the policy arena focusing much of his career on science practice, education, communication, and advocacy including strong and early support for OA. He currently serves as UCSF’s first vice chancellor for Science Policy and Strategy.</p>
<p>Last but by no means least, <a href="https://hewlett.org/people/suresh-bhat/">Suresh Bhat</a> joined us on November 1, 2018 as incoming Chair of the Finance Committee. Suresh brings to PLOS not only deep financial knowledge but also experience at a top research university and a passion for education. Suresh has headed finance programs for a number of financial institutions. He is currently CFO and Treasurer at the <a href="https://hewlett.org/">Hewlett Foundation</a>, prior to that, he was CFO at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley (and is a Haas and Cal alum).</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not take the opportunity here to express my heartfelt thanks to both Gary Ward, our now former Board Chair, and Mike Eisen, one of the co-founders of PLOS, both of whom left the Board in 2018.  In his seven years as Board Chair, Gary has led the Board with passion, wisdom and integrity, and has been both counsel and friend to many of us in the organization. Mike is of course irreplaceable in every way. His vision, zeal and dedication are a big reason that PLOS not only exists but has had such a deep impact on scientific communication. I have no doubt that Mike will continue to be one of PLOS’ greatest advocates (and yes, let us know when we get it wrong – as good friends do!).</p>
<p>While goodbyes are never easy, we are excited to embark on this new chapter for PLOS with the fresh wisdom of so many exceptional, dedicated individuals. Please join us in welcoming our new Board members!</p>

The authors of an much-ballyhooed 2017 paper about the spread of fake news on social media have retracted their article after finding that they’d botched their analysis. The paper, “Limited individual attention and online virality of low-quality information,” presented an argument for why bogus facts seem to gain so much traction on sites such as … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/09/oft-quoted-paper-on-spread-of-fake-news-turns-out-to-befake-news/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Oft-quoted paper on spread of fake news turns out to be…fake news</span></a>

<p>You might imagine – as prior research suggests many people do – that putting your feelings into words will only intensify them. In fact, many laboratory studies have found the opposite to be true. Stating out loud, or writing down, what you are feeling – a process that psychologists call “affect labelling” – seems to down-regulate emotions, diminishing their intensity.</p>
<p>Now an intriguing study has explored this phenomenon outside of the lab, analysing over a billion tweets to find examples of when people used a tweet to put their emotional state into words. From analysing the emotional language used in preceding and subsequent tweets, <a href="http://zhaojichang.cn/~fanrui/">Rui Fan</a> and his colleagues were able to see how the act of affect labelling influenced the course of an emotional state. “We found that, for a majority of individuals, emotional intensity decreased rapidly after their explicit expression in an ‘I feel’ statement,” the researchers write in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0490-5">their paper in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-35920"></span></p>
<p>Fan and his team identified over 42,000 English language tweets in which an individual had stated they were feeling a positive emotion (for example, writing “I feel happy” or “I feel awesome”) and another 67,000-plus in which an individual had stated they were experiencing a negative emotion (for example, writing “I feel sad” or “I feel terrible”).</p>
<p>Next, they used an established algorithm to analyse the emotional language content of any tweets written in the 6 hours prior to the affect labelling tweet, and 6 hours afterwards (the algorithm uses over 7,000 commonly used English words previously scored by human raters in terms of their relative positivity or negativity). The emotional language scores provided by the algorithm allowed the researchers to chart the intensity of the Twitter users’ emotions prior to and after they had explicitly labelled how they were feeling.</p>
<p>The picture that emerged was that both positive and negative emotions began ramping up prior to an act of affect labelling (captured in the “I feel …” tweet) and then rapidly calmed afterwards. On average, the positive emotional experiences were longer lasting than negative (94 versus 85 minutes). Also, the ramping up and subsequent calming of positive emotions was symmetrical around the peak that coincided with the “I feel …” affect labelling tweet. In contrast, the build up of negative emotions was longer and more gradual prior to the relevant “I feel …” tweet, followed by a faster decline to baseline levels.</p>
<p>Comparing between the genders, there was a suggestion that the calming power of affect labelling was more striking for women than men, especially for negative emotions.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged their approach has its drawbacks – for instance, to what extent are people’s emotional expressions on social media a performance rather than a true reading of their emotional state? It’s possible too that the findings would vary in other languages or cultures. Also, while analysing vast quantities of data gathered from social media offers many advantages (such as large sample sizes and real-life data), there is a loss of experimental control, and experts often disagree about the meaning of the data and how best to interpret it (see <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">here</a> for an example in a different context). It’s notable that in the current study there was no comparison with how positive and negative emotional states unfold in the absence of affect labelling (i.e. what, in an experimental set-up, would be the control condition).</p>
<p>These issues aside, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0487-0">an accompanying commentary</a> on the new research, Matthew Lieberman – a leading research on affect labelling – describes the findings as “remarkable”. He adds: “The authors took a creative approach to studying affect labelling out in the real world and produced some of the strongest and most comprehensive data in support of the role of affect labelling in dampening affective intensity.”</p>
<p>All of which raises an obvious but relatively unexplored question – why does putting our feelings into words lead to a dampening of those feelings? Hopefully future studies will address the relevant mechanisms, which Lieberman (in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1754073917742706">a recent review</a>) suggests could include a distracting effect, a reduction of uncertainty, and/or something to do with “symbolic conversion” – the distance and closure created by translating emotions into words.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2019/01/09/succeeding-woman-biomedical-engineering/">Succeeding as a woman in biomedical engineering</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/data2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Tell us a bit about your career as a scientist and Professor and what a typical day looks like for you. What is the most rewarding part of your role?</strong></p>
<p>As a scientist and a professor, my typical day is focused on teaching the younger generation of engineering students and expanding on my own research. I teach both undergraduate and graduate students in bioengineering as well as guide the students at my lab, aiming to help them improve their research and methodology skills, and their general understanding of bioengineering.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I communicate with different researchers and industrial leaders to perform innovative and collaborative research and to pioneer new technological advancements for the benefit of cancer patients. I hope to one day be able to aid these people in their battles with this illness.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory aspect of my role is the notion that my research and teaching will one day aid the future generation of engineers, fulfil their potential and dreams in this field and ultimately bring societal progress.</p>
<p><strong>What is it like being a woman in your field? Have you ever had any difficulties in your career due to your gender?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I strongly suggest that young women engineers are ambitious and actively seek out opportunities that can support their career development and fully grasp everything that is available to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Korea, it can be difficult to be a woman as an engineer in any of the engineering fields. In fact, the majority of the discipline is heavily outnumbered by men. Although sexual discrimination is gradually decreasing over time with improving awareness to social rights and gender equality, there are various difficulties that I have faced.</p>
<p>Following your dreams as a woman engineer and mother can be difficult, as you are expected to take care of your children while working. This is particularly challenging in Korea, where social support is lacking. In my case, there was no other engineer in my family, so I had to plan everything by myself and the absence of social support made it very difficult to develop my career. However, I expect a better outcome for younger generations of women engineers as there is a growing number of foundations, communities, and social structures coming into place with an aim to support young women engineers to follow their dreams.</p>
<p>I always admired the well-established network of male engineers, which easily enabled collaborative research. Therefore, I strongly suggest that young women engineers are more ambitious and actively seek out opportunities that can support their career development and fully grasp everything that is available to them.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve had an international career and you are currently affiliated with institutions in the US, China and South Korea. What is your experience working for these different regions?</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10750" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10750" height="201" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/woman-engineer-300x201.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Source: © Gawrav Sinha / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Regarding my international career and my affiliation to USA, China, and South Korea as a researcher, there are substantial differences in research methodology and skill level among these countries. USA is still the forerunner of pioneering research and possesses the largest number of global leaders within different academic disciplines.</p>
<p>The research environment in China is rapidly evolving and is becoming globally recognizable with the quality of research improving exponentially over the last two decades. Strong government support for research expansion and a large pool of engineers will provide strong foundation for China to become a leading figure in the future.</p>
<p>Lastly, Korea does not possess a similar level of resources as the US or China to perform or produce similar quantity of research. However, the Korean government is strongly backing their bioengineering industry and globally recognizable industry leaders have started to take more active involvement in the field. They have allocated their resource wisely and many of the researchers and engineers still perform outstanding research and development with a continuous trend of growth and improvement.</p>
<p><strong>What would be your advice for young women who are considering a career in science and engineering?</strong></p>
<p>With continuous growth in engineering field and improvements in social awareness for gender inequality, I strongly believe that there will be a brighter future for young women engineers. There are many globally recognized women engineers actively working in academia or industry, and these leaders can provide a good example for young women engineers to follow.</p>
<p>I’ve partaken in various support programs for woman engineers both at my home institution and abroad with a hope of aiding the career development of young women engineers. The growing trend for various supports and opportunities for networking and mentoring is available for young generations and they should utilize these resources to better prepare themselves within engineering field.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to once again emphasize for the future woman engineers to be ambitious, fully utilize any resources that are available to them, and to follow their dream as their dreams can come true with hard work.</p>

(b) new estimates of average myelin distribution using brain scan technology (independent of personality, red shows greatest myelination, blue the least). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12442">From Toschi and Passamonti, 2018</a></figure>
<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Researchers are getting closer to understanding the neurological basis of personality. For a new paper <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12442">in the <em>Journal of Personality</em></a>, Nicola Toschi and Luca Passamonti took advantage of a recent technological breakthrough that makes it possible to use scans to estimate levels of myelination in different brain areas (until fairly recently this could only be done at postmortem).</p>
<p>Myelin is a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibres and speeds up information processing in the brain – it tends to be thicker in parts of the cortex involved in movement and perception, while it is lighter in brain regions that evolved later and that are involved in more abstract thought and decision making.</p>
<p>The new findings, though preliminary, suggest that people with “healthier”, more advantageous, personality traits, such as more emotional stability and greater conscientiousness, may benefit during development from more enhanced myelination in key areas of the brain where the myelination process is particularly prolonged in humans, continuing through adolescence and into the twenties.</p>
<p><span id="more-35902"></span></p>
<p>The findings are based on brain scans of over 1000 young men and women (average age 29) who also undertook a personality test tapping the “Big Five” traits. Averaged across the entire sample, the researchers found a pattern of myelination through the cortex that closely matched the pattern first discovered over a hundred years ago (from investigation of post-mortem brains) by the German neuroanatomist Paul Flechsig – see image above.</p>
<p>Myelination was generally thicker in the sensory and motor cortices and lighter in frontal and parietal regions. The latter support “higher order” mental functions – the neural architecture in these regions tends to be highly complex, and, though lighter, the myelination process here is later and lengthier, continuing way beyond the teenage years.</p>
<p>While controlling for any differences in intelligence, as well as age, gender and brain volume, the researchers found several links between personality traits and myelination. For instance, lower emotional stability (i.e. higher neuroticism) was correlated with less myelination in the prefrontal cortex, a key brain region for emotional control; higher agreeableness was correlated with greater myelination in orbitofrontal cortex (specifically in the anterior region, previously implicated in prosocial behaviour); and higher conscientiousness correlated with greater myelination in part of the prefrontal cortex (the prefrontal cortex pole, which is associated with the human conscience, among other functions).</p>
<p>The aforementioned correlations suggest a straight-forward pattern whereby what we would usually consider as more advantageous traits are associated with greater myelination in key brain areas. However, the picture was more complicated than that. For example, both higher conscientiousness and higher trait openness were correlated with <em>less</em> myelination in another frontal brain area (the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in monitoring mistakes, among other things), and greater neuroticism with <em>more</em> myelination in a part of the occipital lobe (where the visual cortex is located – it’s not clear why this might be, though one could speculate this might be related to enhanced threat detection).</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the findings “improve our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of variability in common behavioral dispositions” Toschi and Passamonti wrote. Summarising their results, they added that “The personality‐related variability in the intra‐cortical myelin content … represent[s] an important proxy measure of the underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms that shape subject‐specific attitudes in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions”. It will be interesting to follow up these results with longitudinal research, to see how personality traits and patterns of myelination co-vary over time, and to investigate the factors, such as genes, diet and education, that may have an influence.</p>
