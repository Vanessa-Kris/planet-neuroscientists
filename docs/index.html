              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alaska-yukon-delta-visualization-climate-change-land-transition">A stunning visualization of Alaska’s Yukon Delta shows a land in transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The westward journey of the mighty Yukon River takes it from its headwaters in Canada’s British Columbia straight across Alaska. The river has many stories to tell, of generations of Indigenous people hunting on its banks and fishing in its waters, of paddle-wheeled boats and gold panning and pipelines.</p>



<p>Where it meets the Bering Sea, the river fans out into an intricate delta resembling cauliflower lobes of river channels and ponds. The delta has a story to tell, too — that of an increasingly green Arctic.</p>



<p>A composite image of the delta’s northern lobe, taken May 29 by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Landsat 8 satellite, shows willow shrublands lining river channels as they wind toward the sea. Farther inland, tussock grasses carpet the tundra. Grasslike sedge meadows populate low-lying wetlands, punctuated by ponds left behind by springtime floods along the riverbanks from snow and ice that have melted upstream.</p>



<p>In southern Alaska, such as in the Kenai Peninsula, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning">the Arctic has been getting noticeably greener</a> since the 1980s, as global temperatures climb (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>). Researchers observed this change using satellite measurements of red and near-infrared light reflected off the vegetation. Now, analyses of changing vegetation in the Yukon Delta and nearby Kuskokwim Delta show that<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/aop/EI-D-20-0025.1/EI-D-20-0025.1.xml"> more northern areas are getting greener too</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Earth Interactions</em>.</p>



<p>The increasing prevalence of tall willows, an important moose habitat, is one sign of these changes in the delta. Moose populations, too, are on the rise. But for the Yukon and other Arctic deltas — where higher floodwaters due to climate change are likely to deposit thicker sediment piles, supporting more greenery — many more changes are likely to come as the planet warms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781635574944">Wild Souls</a><br><em>Emma Marris<br>Bloomsbury, $28</em></p>



<p>On the Arctic Ocean’s fringe, polar bears stand on ice thinning from human-caused climate change. Without thick ice from which to powerfully pounce on seals, many of these symbols of the wild north can’t eat.&nbsp;Should we feed polar bears to right our wrongs? Or should we leave them alone, even if that means they starve to extinction?</p>



<p>Emma Marris’ <em>Wild Souls </em>prompts readers to grapple with this question and more. An absorbing and nuanced blend of philosophy and science, the book explores what we owe the nonhuman world. Like her 2011 book <em>Rambunctious Garden</em>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-rambunctious-garden-saving-nature-post-wild-world-emma-marris">challenged the notion</a> of “pristine wilderness” in a world where humans touch everything (<em>SN: 9/23/11</em>), <em>Wild Souls </em>questions the very concepts of wildness and nature. The result challenges readers to reconsider how they relate to nonhuman animals, from caged creatures to polar bears in the warming north.</p>





<p>Marris guides readers through a series of case studies, from Indigenous hunting practices to municipal zoos, all brought to life through attentive on-the-ground reporting. Running through these examples is a central ethical tension: How do we weigh the tangible moral value of an individual sentient creature who can suffer against the more abstract value of species or ecosystems, which are of course unfeeling but rouse such depths of emotion in us when they are threatened or lost?</p>





<p>Islands are a front line of this conflict, where life that’s blossomed in isolation is threatened by species we’ve introduced. Marris examines efforts, from the Galápagos to New Zealand, to kill (often painfully with poison) millions of individual mice, rats and other creatures in the name of preserving species deemed more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marris is frank on where she stands on certain issues, arguing, for example, that zoos are immoral. She also asks whether it’s ever right to save a species like the California condor — which once soared above most of North America but dwindled to just a handful of individuals in the 1980s — by caging them for captive breeding.</p>



<p>The book makes a clear case for the moral value of individual sentient creatures, providing a rundown of the latest science that dissolves the distinct line often drawn between humans and nonhumans. These include studies that suggest fish feel pain and that rats help fellow rats in need because they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscience-mice-may-catch-each-others-pain-relief-contagious">experience emotions</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Defining the objective, inherent value of species proves trickier. “There’s something precious in what we call ‘nature,’ in the flow of energy, in the will to survive,” she writes. “But I cannot present overwhelming arguments that this is true. I can only passionately assert it.”</p>



<p>In the end, Marris finds no set formula for making ethical choices about animals’ fates. Instead, readers may realize something profound: There are no perfect ways to act ethically toward all animals and all species when incommensurable values collide. As we try to mend the mess we’ve made of nature, all we can do is act with thoughtful humility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">3.42-billion-year-old fossil threads may be the oldest known archaea microbes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Threadlike filaments pressed in rock <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabf3963">may be the remnants of archaea</a> that burped methane near hydrothermal vents 3.42 billion years ago. &nbsp;If so, these strands in rock excavated in South Africa around a decade ago, would provide the earliest direct evidence of a methane-based metabolism, researchers report July 14 in <em>Science Advances.</em></p>



<p>Such ancient fossil filaments may contain clues about Earth’s early inhabitants and hint at where to look for extraterrestrial life. &nbsp;Scientists suspect that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">life on our planet</a> could have arisen in such an environment (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Biologists have deduced that metabolisms based on munching or belching methane evolved early on, but don’t know exactly when, says Barbara Cavalazzi, a geobiologist at University of Bologna in Italy. Previous research has found indirect evidence for methane-cycling microbes in the chemistry of fluid-filled pockets of ancient rocks from around 3.5 billion years ago. But that work didn’t find the actual microbes. With this fossil analysis, “what we find, basically, is evidence of about the same age. But this is a cellular remain — it’s the organism,” Cavalazzi says.</p>



<p>The newly identified fossil threads have a carbon-based shell. That shell is different structurally from the preserved interior, suggesting a cell envelope enclosing the cells’ insides, the authors write. And the team found relatively high nickel concentrations in the filaments. The concentrations were similar to levels found in modern methane-makers, suggesting the fossils’ metal may come from nickel-containing enzymes in the microbes.</p>





<p>“They can attribute a specific metabolic lifestyle to these early microorganisms,” says Dominic Papineau, a Precambrian biogeochemist at University College London, who was not part of the study and calls it “brilliant work.”</p>



<p>Yet the search for early life-forms has had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-fossil-biomorphs-more-common-ancient-rocks-real-fossils">its share of false signs</a> (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>) , and some researchers aren’t convinced these fossils are the real deal. In silica-rich hydrothermal environments, the ingredients for structures that mimic cells mingle and can form life look-alikes through chemistry, says Julie Cosmidis, a geobiologist at the University of Oxford. “They fossilize better than actual cells, so I think it could very well be what those things are,” she says, pointing out that nickel, common in the early Earth, clings easily to organic matter, whether it’s living or not. “We don’t understand enough [about] the processes that can create false biosignatures,” says Cosmidis, whose lab studies such questions.</p>



<p>But Cavalazzi and her colleagues contend that the different lines of evidence together support the living origin of the microfossils. Papineau also notes that “the evidence is very good,” but adds that it’s “not necessarily rock solid.” Other tests could strengthen the case for the earliest methane-using microbes, he says.</p>



<p>If the strands are ancient archaea, they’d become the earliest fossil evidence for this domain of life, predating specimens from less than 500 million years ago. And if such microbes evolved so quickly on Earth, within around 1 billion years of the planet’s origin, methane-cyclers may be more common than realized on other planets where liquid water has been around for a while, Papineau says.</p>



<p>This fossil comes from a time when Earth’s planetary ecosystem was likely very different than it is now, says Boris Sauterey, a paleoecologist at the University of Arizona in Tempe, who wasn’t involved with this study. Back then, Earth most likely shared similarities with some of the extraterrestrial worlds that we today would consider potentially habitable, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers looking for signs of early life on Earth have explored sediments of surface waters more than hydrothermal systems, where these fossils were found, Cavalazzi says. The discovery suggests, she says, that here and on other planets, researchers should keep scratching below the surface.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>During the pandemic, many of us were locked down with little face-to-face contact with anybody other than our partners. Considering the stress of the time and the intensely close quarters we were in, you would be forgiven for thinking this was a recipe for serious tension.</p>



<p>A new study, however, suggests the reality might not be so cut and dry. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506211022813">Writing in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em>, </em>a team led by Lisa A. Neff from The University of Texas at Austin found that the pandemic actually played an important part in people’s ability to deal with stress. When couples blamed their levels of stress on the pandemic, the team found, they were happier in their relationship.</p>



<span id="more-43014"></span>



<p>Participants were people living with their partner during the lockdown in the United States, who completed daily measures for 14 days during the April lockdown and then again seven months later (almost all couples were heterosexual, though several participants were non-binary).</p>



<p>In each questionnaire, participants indicated on a scale from one to five how much they blamed themselves, their partner, and the pandemic for their current levels of stress or problems. Next, participants were presented with eleven different parts of their life, from work to finances to household chores, and were asked to indicate how stressful or problematic that element of life had been that day. They also completed measures of relationship satisfaction, and indicated whether they had performed any negative behaviours towards their partner (e.g. criticising or directing anger towards their partner, or acting withdrawn or distant).</p>



<p>During both waves of the study, participants on the whole were more likely to blame the pandemic for feelings of stress than they were themselves or their partners. And blaming the pandemic seemed to be beneficial for their relationships, at least for the female participants: on days they found particularly stressful, women who blamed the pandemic for the stress reported greater satisfaction in their relationship than those who did not. They also reported behaving in fewer negative ways towards their partners, again suggesting that the act of blaming the pandemic acted as a buffering force in romantic relationships.</p>



<p>For female participants, the pandemic seemed to act as a “scapegoat”, as the team put it, which can protect relationships from undue stress. The team suggests that stress “spillover” — the spilling of external stressors like work into a relationship — was lessened due to heightened stress awareness and ability to blame a massive global event which was a very obvious source of stress. (Of course, it’s important to remember that many people <em>have</em> struggled with their relationships during the pandemic, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/16/im-grateful-for-our-intense-lockdown-split-what-has-the-pandemic-done-to-our-relationships">in some cases</a> the unique combination of factors thrown up by coronavirus really was a recipe for divorce.)</p>



<p>This spillover was also positioned as a reason why women participants were more likely to benefit from blaming the pandemic than men. Other research has suggested women experienced more distress during the pandemic, as well as more dissatisfaction with the allocation of tasks at home and their work-life balance. Women may therefore be more vulnerable to stress spillover — and this could be why they benefited more from blaming the stress on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Future work could look at periods of more intense stress. Although the pandemic as a whole was stressful for many, most participants in this study were experiencing low levels of stress on a daily basis; the daily diary method may also have felt labour intensive for those experiencing high levels of stress, leading them to drop out.</p>



<p>People may also have been blaming their stress on the pandemic precisely because it was caused by the pandemic: it’s not hard to imagine, for example, that stress and bad feelings have been triggered by pandemic-induced job insecurity, concerns about vulnerable relatives, or the monotony of lockdown. If that’s the case, it’s not a huge surprise that participants were happier in their relationship on days they blamed the pandemic — because there might not be anything wrong with their relationship to begin with.</p>



<p>On the whole, however, the findings suggest that relationships can thrive — or at least survive — when couples are aware of stress and feel able to discuss it openly: advice that probably holds outside of a pandemic as much as it does in.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-death-physics-electromagnetism-standard-model">With Steven Weinberg’s death, physics loses a titan</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mythology has its titans. So do the movies. And so does physics. Just one fewer now.</p>



<p>Steven Weinberg died July 23, at the age of 88. He was one of the key intellectual leaders in physics during the second half of the 20th century, and he remained a leading voice and active contributor and teacher through the first two decades of the 21st.</p>



<p>On lists of the greats of his era he was always mentioned along with Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann and … well, just Feynman and Gell-Mann.</p>



<p>Among his peers, Weinberg was one of the most respected figures in all of physics or perhaps all of science. He exuded intelligence and dignity. As news of his death spread through Twitter, other physicists expressed their remorse at the loss: “One of the most accomplished scientists of our age,” one commented, “a particularly eloquent spokesman for the scientific worldview.” And another: “One of the best physicists we had, one of the best thinkers of any variety.”</p>





<p>Weinberg’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/">Nobel Prize, awarded in 1979</a>, was for his role in developing a theory unifying electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. That was an essential contribution to what became known as the standard model of physics, a masterpiece of explanation for phenomena rooted in the math describing subatomic particles and forces. It’s so successful at explaining experimental results that physicists have long pursued every opportunity to find the slightest deviation, in hopes of identifying “new” physics that further deepens human understanding of nature.</p>



<p>Weinberg did important technical work in other realms of physics as well, and wrote several authoritative textbooks on such topics as general relativity and cosmology and quantum field theory. He was an early advocate of superstring theory as a promising path in the continuing quest to complete the standard model by unifying it with general relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity.</p>



<p>Early on Weinberg also realized a desire to communicate more broadly. His popular book <em>The First Three Minutes</em>, published in 1977, introduced a generation of physicists and physics fans to the Big Bang–birth of the universe and the fundamental science underlying that metaphor. Later he wrote deeply insightful examinations of the nature of science and its intersection with society. And he was a longtime contributor of thoughtful essays in such venues as the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.</p>



<p>In his 1992 book <em>Dreams of a Final Theory</em>, Weinberg expressed his belief that physics was on the verge of finding the true fundamental explanation of reality, the “final theory” that would unify all of physics. Progress toward that goal seemed to be impeded by the apparent incompatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the math underlying the standard model. But in a 1997 interview, Weinberg averred that the difficulty of combining relativity and quantum physics in a mathematically consistent way was an important clue. “When you put the two together, you find that there really isn’t that much free play in the laws of nature,” he said. “That’s been an enormous help to us because it’s a guide to what kind of theories might possibly work.”</p>



<p>Attempting to bridge the relativity-quantum gap, he believed, “pushed us a tremendous step forward toward being able to develop realistic theories of nature on the basis of just mathematical calculations and pure thought.”</p>



<p>Experiment had to come into play, of course, to verify the validity of the mathematical insights. But the standard model worked so well that finding deviations implied by new physics required more powerful experimental technology than physicists possessed. “We have to get to a whole new level of experimental competence before we can do experiments that reveal the truth beneath the standard model, and this is taking a long, long time,” he said. “I really think that physics in the style in which it’s being done … is going to eventually reach a final theory, but probably not while I’m around and very likely not while you’re around.”</p>



<p>He was right that he would not be around to see the final theory. And perhaps, as he sometimes acknowledged, nobody ever will. Perhaps it’s not experimental power that is lacking, but rather intellectual power. “Humans may not be smart enough to understand the really fundamental laws of physics,” he wrote in his 2015 book <em>To Explain the World</em>, a history of science up to the time of Newton.</p>



<p>Weinberg studied the history of science thoroughly, wrote books and taught courses on it. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-looks-back-rise-scientific-method"><em>To Explain the World</em></a> was explicitly aimed at assessing ancient and medieval science in light of modern knowledge. For that he incurred the criticism of historians and others who claimed he did not understand the purpose of history, which is to understand the human endeavors of an era on its own terms, not with anachronistic hindsight.</p>



<p>But Weinberg understood the viewpoint of the historians perfectly well. He just didn’t like it. For Weinberg, the story of science that was meaningful to people today was how the early stumblings toward understanding nature evolved into a surefire system for finding correct explanations. And that took many centuries. Without the perspective of where we are now, he believed, and an appreciation of the lessons we have learned, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/physicists-story-science-breaks-historians-rules">the story of how we got here “has no point.”</a></p>



<p>Future science historians will perhaps insist on assessing Weinberg’s own work in light of the standards of his times. But even if viewed in light of future knowledge, there’s no doubt that Weinberg’s achievements will remain in the realm of the Herculean. Or the titanic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">What experts know so far about COVID-19 boosters for immunocompromised people</a></h4>

              
                <p>People with weak immune systems don’t always mount strong defenses against the coronavirus, even after being fully vaccinated. A third COVID-19 vaccine dose might help protect some immunocompromised people, evidence suggests. But for now, there’s not enough data to say how much such a shot might help, experts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said July 22. As a result, the agency isn’t yet recommending a third dose and says that vaccinated people in this group should keep wearing masks.</p>



<p>With global COVID-19 cases on the rise, finding ways to protect millions of immunocompromised people who are at high risk for severe disease is crucial. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 percent of adults, or 6.8 million people, are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies suggest that until transmission of the coronavirus is squashed, millions of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852">organ transplant recipients</a>, cancer patients undergoing treatment and others are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, even if they are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">lucky enough to have access to shots</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). Of 45 vaccinated people admitted to 18 U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 from March 11 to May 5, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259776v1">twenty, or 44 percent, were immunocompromised</a>, according to data presented in a July 22 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. </p>

<p>A third dose of COVID-19 vaccines can boost coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the blood of some immunocompromised patients, laboratory studies suggest. But it’s still unclear whether specific groups might benefit more than others and how effective extra doses might be at preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system, for instance, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">more than antibodies in its arsenal to attack the coronavirus</a> and prevent severe disease (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). Studies from the real world would provide a clearer picture for how well additional doses might work, and for which groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the very least, an additional dose appears safe for immunocompromised individuals, epidemiologist Sara Oliver of the CDC said at the July 22 meeting. For example, a study that included patients on dialysis for kidney disease showed that “symptoms reported after the third dose were consistent with what has been seen after the second dose,” Oliver said. Most vaccine side effects — such as fatigue, pain at the injection site, chills or soreness — were mild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While U.S. officials are still discussing the benefits of the additional dose, some countries have already taken steps to get those doses to immunocompromised residents. Severely immunocompromised people in France, for instance, can get a third dose a month after their second dose, officials announced April 11. Officials in Israel announced July 11 that they too would begin giving immunocompromised individuals a third shot. And officials in the United Kingdom have proposed distributing additional doses between September and December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of what studies have found so far about the merits of an extra COVID-19 shot for the immunocompromised:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — either Pfizer’s, Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L21-0282">boosted the antibody levels</a> of some organ transplant recipients with previously weak responses to the vaccine, researchers reported June 15 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Of 30 vaccinated patients, six people had low levels of antibodies that recognized the coronavirus before getting a third dose. Another 24 did not have detectable antibodies. Two weeks after their third shot, all six patients with initially low antibody levels now had high amounts. Of the 24 people without antibodies, 16 still didn’t develop any, two had low levels and six developed high levels of antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Another study showed that 67 out of 99 organ transplant recipients vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108861">had detectable antibodies after a third dose</a>, researchers reported June 23 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That’s compared with four of 101 individuals after a first dose and 40 of 99 after a second. Of the 59 people who didn’t have antibodies after the second dose, 26, or 44 percent, mounted the immune proteins after the extra dose.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>More than 75 percent of blood, or hematopoietic, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01594-4/fulltext">stem cell transplant recipients had detectable antibodies after two doses</a> of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, researchers reported July 13 in the <em>Lancet</em>. Fifty-two of the 88 patients in the study had antibody levels above a threshold that corresponds to how well the immune proteins stop the coronavirus from infecting cells. Those who had received the transplant more than a year before getting vaccinated, and who had high numbers of pathogen-fighting white blood cells, were more likely to have lots of antibodies. Patients given treatments that suppressed their immune systems within three months of getting vaccinated, on the other hand, had low antibody levels, the team found. A third dose might be helpful for that group, but experts don’t know yet.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Third doses can also help some patients on dialysis for kidney disease, studies suggest. Of 12 dialysis patients who initially didn’t generate antibodies after two vaccine doses, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.21259913v1">half mounted an antibody response after an extra shot</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted July 6 at medRxiv.org. Forty-two percent, or<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfab193/6289996"> 5 out of 12 antibody-negative patients</a>, had antibodies after a third vaccine, another group of researchers reported May 31 in <em>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the United States, a recommendation for an additional dose for immunocompromised people probably won’t come unless the Food and Drug Administration permits extra doses under current emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or until the agency fully approves the vaccines for widespread use, CDC officials said during the meeting. For now, the health agency isn’t aware of any data submitted to the FDA that might support such a change to the emergency use authorizations, the officials said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, experts are keeping a close eye on emerging data about additional doses. “However, while we do that, we need to remember what we can do now,” Oliver said. That means immunocompromised people should continue to wear masks, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds or indoor spaces. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">How do scientists calculate the age of a star?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition.</p>



<p>To calculate a star’s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one variable scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.</p>



<p>“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “Everything else is bootstrapped up from there.”</p>



<p>Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019 when the red supergiant star Betelgeuse dimmed, astronomers weren’t sure if it was just going through a phase or if a supernova explosion was imminent. (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">Turns out it was just a phase</a>.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-less-magnetically-active-than-similar-stars">magnetically active</a> compared with other stars of the same age and mass. That suggests that astronomers might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.</p>





<p>Calculations based on physics and indirect measurements of a star’s age <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806">can give astronomers ballpark estimates</a>. And some methods work better for different types of stars. Here are three ways astronomers calculate the age of a star.</p>



<h3>Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams</h3>



<p>Scientists do have a pretty good handle on how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, stars burn through their hydrogen fuel, puff up and eventually expel their gases into space, whether with a bang or a whimper. But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle happens is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit those points after a different number of years. More massive stars die young, while less massive stars can burn for billions of years.</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with the idea to<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/hertzsprung-russell+diagram"> plot stars’ temperature against their brightness</a>. The patterns on these Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R, diagrams corresponded to where different stars were in that life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.</p>



<p>The caveat is that, unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters, or by comparing a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. “Nevertheless, it’s the best thing we’ve got.”</p>

<h3>Rotation rate</h3>



<p>By the 1970s, astrophysicists had noticed a trend: Stars in younger clusters spin faster than stars in older clusters. In 1972, astronomer Andrew Skumanich used a star’s rotation rate and surface activity to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...171..565S/abstract">propose a simple equation to estimate a star’s age</a>: Rotation rate = (Age)<sup> -½</sup>.</p>



<p>This was the go-to method for individual stars for decades, but new data have poked holes in its utility. It turns out that some stars don’t slow down when they hit a certain age. Instead they keep the same rotation speed for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>“Rotation is the best thing to use for stars younger than the sun,” Metcalfe says. For stars older than the sun, other methods are better.</p>



<h3>Stellar seismology</h3>



<p>The new data that confirmed rotation rate wasn’t the best way to estimate an individual star’s age came from an unlikely source: the exoplanet-hunting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler space telescope</a>. Not just a boon for exoplanet research, Kepler pushed stellar seismology to the forefront by simply staring at the same stars for a really long time.</p>



<p>Watching a star flicker can give clues to its age. Scientists look at changes in a star’s brightness as an indicator of what’s happening beneath the surface and, through modeling, roughly calculate the star’s age. To do this, one needs a really big dataset on the star’s brightness — which the Kepler telescope could provide.</p>



<p>“Everybody thinks it was all about finding planets, which was true,” Soderblom says. “But I like to say that the Kepler mission was a stealth stellar physics mission.”</p>



<p>This approach helped reveal the sun’s magnetic midlife crisis and recently provided some clues about the evolution of the Milky Way. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-feasted-smaller-galaxy-10-billion-years-ago">collided</a> with a dwarf galaxy. Scientists have found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">stars left behind by that dwarf galaxy are younger or about the same age</a> as stars original to the Milky Way. Thus, the Milky Way may have evolved more quickly than previously thought.</p>



<p>As space telescopes like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">NASA’s TESS</a> and the European Space Agency’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/a-new-mission-to-investigate-exoplanets-has-rocketed-into-space"> CHEOPS</a> survey new patches of sky, astrophysicists will be able to learn more about the stellar life cycle and come up with new estimates for more stars.</p>



<p>Aside from curiosity about the stars in our own backyard, star ages have implications beyond our solar system, from planet formation to galaxy evolution — and even the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>“One of these days — it’ll probably be a while — somebody’s going to claim they see signs of life on a planet around another star. The first question people will ask is, ‘How old is that star?’” Soderblom says. “That’s going to be a tough question to answer.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">A partial skeleton reveals the world’s oldest known shark attack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Somewhere off southeastern Japan’s coast around 3,000 years ago, a shark attacked and killed a man who was likely fishing or shellfish diving. Afterward, the victim’s fishing comrades presumably brought the body, minus its sheared off right leg and left hand, back to land for burial.</p>



<p>A new analysis of that unfortunate man’s partial skeleton, excavated around a century ago at a village cemetery near Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, has unveiled that grisly scenario. This individual from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/jomon-genes">Japan’s ancient Jōmon culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/97</em>) represents the oldest known human victim of a shark attack, say archaeologist J. Alyssa White of the University of Oxford and colleagues. Radiocarbon dating <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002777">places his death from 3,391 to 3,031 years ago</a>, the researchers report in the August<em> Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A roughly <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/caribarch/education/sharks/">1,000-year-old skeleton of a fisherman on Puerto Rico</a> previously displayed the earliest signs of a shark encounter.</p>



<p>White’s group documented at least 790 gouges, punctures and other types of bite damage mainly confined to the Jōmon man’s arms, legs, pelvis and ribs. A 3-D model of these injuries indicates that the victim first lost his left hand trying to fend off a shark. Ensuing bites severed major leg arteries, rapidly leading to death.</p>



<p>After the man’s body was recovered, his mutilated left leg probably detached and was placed on his chest when he was buried, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Numerous shark teeth found at some Jōmon sites suggest that sharks were hunted, perhaps by drawing them to blood while fishing at sea. “But unprovoked shark attacks would have been incredibly rare as sharks do not tend to target humans as prey,” White says.</p>

                <p>This month's episode features Mark Humphries, author of "<a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo">The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds."</a> We explore how the brain uses electrical signaling in surprising ways, beginning with a look at how an action potential (aka. "the spike") is produced. Then we consider what Humphries calls "the dark neurons," which are neurons that rarely generate spikes. We explore their role and also how it relates to the brain's spontaneous activity. One of the more surprising recent discoveries in neuroscience is that most of the brain's activity does not appear to be caused by external stimuli. It is not a passive receiver of information and this has profound implications for our understanding of things like how the brain generates conscious experience.</p> <p>This episode is for listeners of all backgrounds.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds</em></a> by Mark Humphries</li> <li><a href="https://www.humphries-lab.org" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Humphries Lab</a> at the University of Nottingham</li> <li>Please visit <a href= "http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additonal references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> Please Visit Our Sponsors: <ul> <li><a href= "https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=textexpander-July-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextExpander at textexpander.com/podcast</a></li> <li><a href="http://NordVPN.com/brainscience" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">NordVPN at nordvpn.com/brainscience</a></li> </ul> <p>Announcements:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/"><em>Brain Science</em></a> comes out on 4th Friday each month.</li> <li>Support <em>Brain Science</em> by buying <a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com/books"><em>Are You Sure?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">Marsquakes reveal the Red Planet boasts a liquid core half its diameter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars has had its first CT scan, thanks to analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander. Diagnosis: The Red Planet’s core is at least partially liquid, as some previous studies had suggested, and is somewhat larger than expected.</p>



<p>InSight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">reached Mars in late 2018</a> and soon afterward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-insight-lander-first-recording-marsquake">detected the first known marsquake</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/</em><em>18</em>; <em>SN: 4/23/19</em>). Since then, the lander’s instruments have picked up more than a thousand temblors, most of them minor rumbles. Many of those quakes originated at a seismically active region more than 1,000 kilometers away from the lander. A small fraction of the quakes had magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and the resulting vibrations have enabled scientists to probe Mars and reveal new clues about its inner structure.</p>



<p>Simon Stähler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues analyzed seismic waves from 11 marsquakes, looking for two types of waves: pressure and shear. Unlike pressure waves, shear waves can’t pass through a liquid, and they move more slowly, traveling side to side through solid materials, rather than in a push-and-pull motion in the same direction a wave is traveling like pressure waves do.</p>







<p>Of those 11 events, six sets of vibrations included shear waves strong enough to stand out from background noise. The strength of those shear waves suggests that they reflected off of the outer surface of a liquid core, rather than entering a solid core and being partially absorbed, Stähler says. And the difference in arrival times at InSight for the pressure waves and shear waves for each quake suggest that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abi7730">Mars’ core is about 3,660 kilometers in diameter</a>, he and colleagues report in the July 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s a little more than half of the diameter of the entire planet, larger than most previous estimates. The Red Planet’s core is so big, in fact, that it blocks InSight from receiving certain types of seismic waves from a large part of the planet. That, in turn, suggests that Mars may be more seismically active than the lander’s sensors can detect. Indeed, one of the regions in the lander’s seismic blind spot is the Tharsis region, home to some of Mars’ largest volcanoes. Volcanic activity there, as well as the motion of molten rock within the crust in that region, could trigger quakes or seismic waves.</p>

<p>While the newly analyzed data confirm the planet’s outer core is liquid, it’s not clear yet whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earth, says study coauthor Amir Khan, a geophysicist also at ETH Zurich. “The signal should be there in the seismic data,” he says. “We just need to locate it.”</p>



<p>In a separate analysis also published in <em>Science</em>, Khan and colleagues suggest that InSight’s seismic blind spot may also stem, in part, from the way that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf2966">seismic waves slow down and bend as they travel deep within the planet</a>. Changes in seismic wave speed and direction can result from gradual variations in rock temperature or density, for example.</p>



<p>Mars’ seismic waves also hint at the thickness of the planet’s crust. As they bounce back and forth within the planet, the waves bounce off interfaces between different layers and types of rocks, says Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, a seismologist at the University of Cologne in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In a separate study in <em>Science</em>, she and her team analyzed seismic signals that reflected off several such interfaces near Mars’ surface, making it difficult to determine the depth at which the planet’s crust ends and the underlying mantle begins, she says. The researchers concluded, however, that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf8966">the average thickness of the crust likely lies between 24 and 72 kilometers</a>. For comparison, Earth’s oceanic crust is about 6 to 7 kilometers thick, while the planet&#8217;s continental crust averages from 35 to 40 kilometers thick.</p>



<p>Together, these seismic analyses are the first to investigate the innards of a rocky planet other than Earth, Stähler says. As such, they provide “ground truth” for measurements made by spacecraft orbiting Mars, and could help scientists better interpret data gathered from orbit around other planets, such as Mercury and Venus.</p>



<p>The findings could also provide insights that would help planetary scientists better understand how Mars formed and evolved over the life of the solar system, and how the Red Planet ended up so unalike Earth, says Sanne Cottaar, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge. Cottaar wrote <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj8914">a commentary</a>, also published in <em>Science</em>, on the new research. “Mars was put together with similar building blocks” as Earth, she says, “but had a different result.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Pterosaurs may have been able to fly as soon as they hatched</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pterosaur hatchlings may have been able to fly right out of the shell — although the flight of those ancient baby reptiles might have looked a bit different from that of the adults.</p>



<p>A new analysis of the fossilized wing bones of embryonic, newly hatched and adult pterosaurs suggests the baby creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92499-z">were strong and nimble fliers</a> from the start, researchers report July 22 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs were a diverse group of ancient flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs from the Triassic to the Cretaceous periods, 228 million to 66 million years ago. The group includes <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature known to take wing, and <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em> (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">aka “Monkeydactyl”</a>) which had opposable thumbs that enabled it to climb trees (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists know relatively little about the early life history of pterosaurs, including whether their young could actively flap their wings or only glide — which might mean they stayed under parental care until they were flight-ready. But recent revelations increasingly point toward early independence, or “precociality,” for the reptiles, such as finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/429621a">flight membranes on the wings</a> of an embryonic pterosaur, and the discovery of a tiny <em>Pteranodon</em> juvenile that was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2017.84">capable of long-distance flying long before it had grown to adult size</a>.</p>





<p>“Baby pterosaurs almost certainly didn’t glide,” they flew, says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the new study. The three keys to flight, he says, are strong bones, sufficient muscle mass to stay in the air for a long time and sturdy keratin fibers in the skin of the wings, analogous to the feathers of birds. “We know little about the last two.”</p>



<p>So researchers turned to the bones. Darren Naish, a paleontologist at the University of Southampton in England, and his colleagues compared fossilized embryo and hatchling wing measurements with those of adults from two species, <em>Pterodaustro guinazui</em> and <em>Sinopterus dongi</em>. The researchers analyzed wingspans, the strength of wing bones and how much load the wings could carry. In particular, they zeroed in on one wing bone, the humerus. That bone is found on the limbs pterosaurs use to launch themselves into flight and offers key information on whether a pterosaur was capable of getting off the ground.</p>



<p>The hatchlings’ humerus bones were surprisingly stronger than those of many of the adults, the team found. The hatchlings also had shorter and broader wings than the adults, suggesting they might have been capable of nimbly changing direction and speed, if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-might-have-soared-10000-miles-nonstop">not flying long distances</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/10</em>).</p>



<p>Agile flying may have helped the hatchlings not only escape predators, but also chase tricky prey such as insects, all while navigating dense vegetation, the team suggests. Adult pterosaurs, less able to maneuver due to their size, may have then switched to more open habitats.</p>



<p>Among modern birds, the ability to fly immediately after hatching is almost unknown — with the notable exception of the maleo, a strange chickenlike bird that lives only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The maleo’s ability to take flight right away helps it avoid being snapped up by the island’s various predators, from monitor lizards to pythons.</p>



<p>Still, it isn’t unusual in most of the animal world for young to be able to fend for themselves, Padian says. “Precociality is the rule, not the exception, in vertebrates,” he says. Only animals with extended parental care — like songbirds or primates — can afford to be helpless for any extended period of time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/07/22/fast-scanning-triplet-states-and-photon-yield/">Fast scanning, triplet states and photon yield</a></h4>

              
                <p>In point-scanning microscopy like two-photon or confocal microscopy, a focused laser beam is scanned across the field of view and thereby sequentially recovers an image of the object. In this blog post, I will discuss the idea that scanning faster across the field of view would increase the total amount of collected fluorescence. This idea is based on the experimental finding that high-intensity laser light could induce long-lived and non-fluorescent triplet states of the fluorophore molecule while scanning the sample; when the laser is scanned only slowly across the sample, it would therefore try to image fluorophores that are already in their &#8220;dark&#8221; triplet states. Imaging dark fluorophores would result in an overall decreased fluorescence yield. I tested this hypothesis directly with resonant scanning two-photon microscopy in the living brain tissue together with typical fluorophores (GCaMP6f, OGB-1). The main result from these experiments is that I could not find a substantial effect of the triplet states under these realistic conditions, and therefore no advantage in terms of fluorescence yield gained by an increased scan speed.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Fluorophores are molecules that can re-emit light after absorbing a photon themselves. This effect of fluorescence can be described as a state change of the fluorophore from ground state to an excited state upon absorption of the incoming photon, and as a state change from an excited state back to the ground state, together with emission of the outgoing photon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">see this Wikipedia article</a>). The lifetime of the fluorescent state is often a few nanoseconds. However, there are often additional excited states that are more long-lived, such as so-called triplet states. The transition probabilities from ground state to triplet state (and vice versa) are very low due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersystem_crossing">exclusion principle</a> that derives from quantum spin mechanics. The lower transition probabilities make these states less likely to occur during fluorescence microscopy but also render the triplet state longer-lived once it is attained. These <strong>long-lived triplet states</strong> could have rather undesired consequences, since a fluorophore in the triplet state is unable to absorb or emit photons, therefore becoming &#8220;dark&#8221; or non-functional from the experimenter&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>When triplet states play a prominent role in laser-scanning microscopy, one can avoid their detrimental effects by simply scanning faster. Scanning slowly across the sample means that the same fluorophores are hit with light over and over within a short time window. In such a scenario, some of the fluorophores are already in a dark triplet states, resulting in lower overall fluorescence. Faster scanning avoids this problem, and it has been shown for confocal microscopy (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16878313/">Borlinghaus, 2006</a>) as well as STEP microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3481">Schneider et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14766">Wu et al., 2015</a>) that a large signal increase can be achieved simply by faster scanning.</p>



<p>For two-photon microscopy, the situation is less clear. It has been shown that scanning at all compared to non-scanning two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results in higher photon yield (<a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cphc.200700579">Petrášek and Schwille, 2008</a>), but this specific fluorescence configuration cannot be translated easily to two-photon imaging used by neuroscientists. However, there is one publication that demonstrated that <strong>microsecond-long triplet states</strong> do play a large role for two-photon microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth986">Donnert et al., 2007</a>). This paper has been cited as a standard reference to justify the advantages of fast scanning approaches (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10193">Chen et al., 2011</a>), and some two-photon microscopy approaches directly designed their scanning approaches to reduce triplet-induced reduction of fluorescence yield (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-4027">Gautam et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-12-5325">Castanares et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15618-w">Karpf et al., 2020</a>). However, another study showed an effect that seemed to be contradictory to the Donnert et al. results (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1175">Ji et al., 2008</a>), and the interpretation of both papers was discussed repeatedly, e.g., by <a href="https://brainwindows.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/pulse-shaping-for-2-photon-signal-enhancement/">Andrew Hires</a> and on <a href="http://labrigger.com/blog/2011/12/31/optimizing-pulse-frequency-for-2p-imaging/">Labrigger</a>. The consensus, if there was any, seemed to be that it probably depends on the sample. The experiments by Donnert et al. had been done with GFP fixed on a coverslip, but one can easily imagine that a fluorescent protein in vivo might behave differently.</p>



<p>So I decided to probe these results with typical samples and procedures used by neuroscientists &#8211; using video-rate calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain. I did not do this out of pure curiosity about photophysics, but because of the implications of these photophysics for the design of two-photon imaging modalities. If triplet states were indeed an important factor for two-photon imaging of such samples as suggested by Donnert et al., a slightly modified scanning scheme (or parallelized scanning schemes, as reviewed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037565/">Weissenburger and Vaziri, 2018</a>, Figure 3) or adapted laser repetition rates would have huge benefits for the total fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>The main finding of the Donnert et al. paper was the induction of dark triplet states by the scanning laser, and a key prediction was that faster scanning would decrease the probability that an imaged fluorophore is in a dark state; in short, that <strong>faster scanner would increase fluorescence yield</strong>. Therefore, I wanted to systematically understand whether fluorescence for two-photon microscopy depends on scan speed. To study this dependence experimentally in a typical in vivo sample , I used a resonant scanning microscope. For a resonant scanning microscope, the physical scan speed across the sample can be adjusted by changing the scan amplitude (often called the Zoom setting). High zoom would result in low scan speed across the sample, while low zoom would result in high scan speed, enabling a simple characterization of scan speed versus fluorescence yield. According to Donnert et al., higher scan speed would result in higher fluorescence yield compared to slower scan speed when imaging the same spot.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental approach</strong></p>



<p>For a resonant scanning microscope, the scan speed can be derived from the position x(t) of the laser beam focus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+x_0+%5Ccdot+sin%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) = x_0 &#92;cdot sin( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the resonant frequency (f = 8 kHz) and the amplitude (x<sub>0</sub> = 500 μm), which determines roughly the size of the field of view (FOV, here: 1000 μm). The scan speed v(t) is the derivative of the position x(t) with respect to time and therefore also follows a sinusoidal trajectory that reaches its peak in the center of the FOV:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%28t%29+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%5Ccdot+cos%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v(t) = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi &#92;cdot cos( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the speed at the center of the FOV given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_%7Bmax%7D+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v_{max} = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>For higher zoom values (i.e., a smaller FOV), the value is reduced by the same factor (at least in the microscopy software I used for these experiments!). Thereby, it is possible to test a wide range of scan speeds just be changing the zoom setting of the resonant scanner. Since the resonant scanner can span zoom levels between 1x to 20x (for much higher zoom settings, a resonant scanner can become unstable due to the small scan amplitude), a range of speeds between 25 μm/μs and 1.25 μm/μs is spanned.</p>



<p>This speed should be compared to the lateral resolution of the microscope, which is for the  microscope used in this experiment around 0.4 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum of the point spread function). To scan over this resolution-limited spot, the resonant scanner needs 0.016 &#8211; 0.32 μs. For a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 80 MHz with 12.5 ns between two pulses, this corresponds to 1.3 &#8211; 26 pulses per resolution-limited spot. Let&#8217;s call this number the <strong>cumulative pulse count per resolution-limited spot (CPC)</strong> from now on.</p>



<p>Intuitively, this means that each time a laser pulse tries to excite a fluorophore, this fluorophore has very recently already been hit by a number n of previous pulses, approximately n = CPC/2. If there is a chance that a pulse drives the fluorophore into a dark state that makes the fluorophore non-excitable for a handful of microseconds (e.g., a triplet state), then the CPC can be used to calculate the number of fluorophores remaining to be excited:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7Bremaining%7D+%3D+N_0+%5Ccdot+e%5E%7B-CPC%2F%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{remaining} = N_0 &#92;cdot e^{-CPC/&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>λ is a constant that depends on the applied laser intensity and the fluorophore itself. More concretely, the constant λ is the event rate of a fluorophore going into the dark state. The exponential decay with CPC should hold true as long as these events occur within a time window that is shorter than the recovery timescale of the dark state (for triplet states, this is ca. 1 μs). The main consequence is that the fluorescence yield is obviously proportional to the remaining number of excitable fluorophores, N<sub>remaining</sub>.</p>



<p>Therefore, if these events that generate dark triplet states were very unlikely (e.g., λ ~ 500), the effect of fast scanning would not really make a difference. However, if λ was ~1, the effects would be dramatic. How can we distinguish these scenarios?</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part I</strong></p>



<p>With a resonant scanning microscope, the experiment is easy to perform for a dye in a solution. You simply have to generate a homogeneous sample and image first with high zoom and low zoom, then compare the fluorescence in the central region where the scan speed is maximal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, biological samples are not homogeneous, and also not stationary in the case of calcium indicators in living neurons. To image in a biological but still rather homogeneous sample, I used a transgenic GCaMP6f zebrafish line. I imaged in an explant of a dorsal forebrain region that I knew was labeled very densely and very homogeneously (described by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">Huang et al., 2020</a>). But the neuronal somata with the nice nuclear exclusion of GCaMP generated a lot of <strong>undesired variability</strong>.</p>



<p>The solution to circumvent these sources of variability is <strong>systematic averaging</strong>. In a first approach, I took advantage of the fact that I had written large parts of the <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2016/12/01/matlab-code-for-instrument-control-of-a-resonant-scanning-microscope/">microscopy control software</a> myself. I wrote a helper program that performed continuous imaging but randomly moved the stage to different positions every few seconds, thereby averaging across all these inhomogeneously labeled FOVs:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After a minute, the program automatically changed the Zoom setting to a different, random value and recorded again the video with intermittent stage movements:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-1-1 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe width='640' height='640' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/XpuydgMR?preloadContent=metadata&amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1626817383'></script>
</div></figure>



<p>To see an effect, I performed these experiments with rather high laser power (50-80 mW below the objective) and at rather low wavelengths (typically 800 nm, which had been used previously by Donnert et al.).</p>



<p>In the following plot, each data point corresponds to one movie as shown above. Keep in mind that a zoom setting corresponds to a specific CPC. For example, a zoom setting of 1 corresponds to a CPC of 1.3. However, I could not see any dependence of the total fluorescence on the cumulative pulse count CPC (left), so it was not worth determining a numeric value for λ. Interestingly, the total fluorescence decreased slightly but clearly visible over time (right), but since the zoom setting sequence was randomized, this did not reflect any dependence on the CPC:</p>

<p>Next, I performed the same experiment with a different fluorophore. I injected OGB-1 into the homolog of piriform cortex of zebrafish. This is a large and relatively uniform region in the zebrafish forebrain that allows the dye to diffuse more or less homogeneously, at least if you&#8217;re lucky. When I analyzed the experiments, I found again no visible effect, no matter the laser power or the laser wavelength:</p>

<p>Together, these experiments strongly suggested that there is indeed no effect of triplet states and therefore no benefit of fast scanning to increase the fluorescence yield.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part II</strong></p>



<p>However, to convince myself more about this experimental finding that seemed to be at odds with my expectations from the Donnert et al. paper, I used a second, slightly more direct approach. Instead of comparing sequential recordings at different zoom levels, I thought it would be interesting to record the fluorescence while changing the zoom level continuously. This would enable me to measure the dependence of fluorescence on CPC more quickly and therefore also for a larger set of power settings and wavelengths. To continuously change the zoom setting, I used a DAQ board to generate a low-frequency sine signal that modulated the zoom level from 1 (peak of the sine) to ~20 (trough of the sine) with a period of ca. 13 seconds. (To keep track of the sine signal, I also connected the command signal with the second input channel of the microscope.) That&#8217;s how these experiments looked like:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Of course it is important to use not the entire FOV but only the central vertical stripe that remains more or less stationary. I used only a small vertical window of 7 pixels for the analysis. A single experiments resulted in a result such as shown below, plotting CPC (top) and fluorescence (bottom). The fluorescence clearly shows some variability stemming from active neurons (after all, we&#8217;re still dealing with a living brain here!):</p>

<p>In the plot above, no obvious relationship between CPC and fluorescence can be seen, and when I changed the power at 920 nm between 15 mW and 60 mW (this was the maximum that I could get with this system), I could not see any effect. I therefore show here all experiments performed at 920 nm, pooled across power settings and across two fish (total of ca. 30 recordings, each a few minutes):</p>

<p>For some experiments, the maximum zoom level was around 14, which I extended for a subset of experiments to something closer to 20.</p>



<p>I performed the same experiment also at 800 nm. I could also increase the laser power, simply because the laser provided more power at this wavelength range. However, these levels cannot go to arbitrary values. At a certain threshold that also depends on the duration of the exposure, all neurons across the zebrafish&#8217;s brain region become bright, resulting in a wave of high-calcium neurons that propagates through the brain. To avoid this, I used a maximum power of 75 mW at 800 nm. The result, again pooled across laser powers between 40 and 75 mW, showed an effect, albeit a bit subtle:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6879" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2-01b/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png" data-orig-size="953,849" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-2-01b" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=640" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=953" alt="" class="wp-image-6879" width="343" height="304" srcset="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=150 150w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></figure></div>



<p>Fluorescence was indeed slightly higher for very low CPCs. However, the effect was much smaller than expected from experiments in vitro by Donnert et al.. Overall, such a small effect which, in addition, only appeared at the less relevant wavelength of 800 nm, seemed of little relevance for practical purposes.</p>



<p>Therefore, with fluorescence depending on CPC only in minor ways and under non-typical imaging conditions, the suggested triplet states seem to be not relevant for in vivo calcium imaging situations; and as a consequence, one would be ill-guided to assume that faster scanning yields higher fluorescence yield for two-photon microscopy by avoiding these μs-long dark states.</p>



<p>As a side-note, when I tried to analyze the power-dependency of this weak effect observed at 800 nm, I came across a weird effect. There was indeed some sort of increased fluorescence at lower zoom levels. However, this increase came with a delay of several seconds during the above experiments, resulting in a hysteresis:</p>

<p>Due to this longer time-scale, this effect has nothing to do with the short-lived μs-triplet states but is something different entirely. Photophysics is really complicated! This additional observation made me stop experiments, because I realized that these things would be more difficult to figure out, on top of a very small and probably irrelevant triplet effect.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I did not find any evidence for a substantial effect of triplet states during typical conditions (calcium imaging of neurons with a Ti:Sa laser and &lt;100 mW power at the sample).<strong> I therefore do not see a benefit in terms of fluorescence yield by faster scanning. </strong>The triplet states on the timescale of few microseconds that had been observed by Donnert et al. for fixed samples do not seem to play a major role under the investigated conditions. It is always challenging to convincingly show the absence of an effect, but my experimental results convinced me to not further investigate fast scanning and multiplexing schemes as a means to increase fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Multiplexing or other modified distributions of excitation photons in time and space might still be able to increase fluorescence yield for certain fluorophores and conditions, but probably not under conditions similar to the ones I investigated.</p>



<p>The experiments described above are not fully systematic and cover only a specific parameter regime of excitation wavelengths, fluorophores and laser powers. However, anybody with a resonantly scanning two-photon microscope can easily reproduce these findings for any other scenario. <strong>Simply switch between high and low zoom settings and check whether the brightness in the center of the FOV changed substantially or not. </strong>Quantification of possible effects requires careful averaging, but a quick and qualitative confirmation or refutation of the above findings would be very easy to do for any experimenter.</p>

                <p>A coronavirus infection can mow down the forests of hairlike cilia that coat our airways, destroying a crucial barrier to keeping the virus from lodging deep in the lungs.</p>



<p>Normally, those cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus out of the airway and into the throat. To protect the lungs, objects that don’t belong — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-infection-lung-cell-images">including viral invaders like the coronavirus</a> — get stuck in mucus, which is then swallowed (<em>SN: 9/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the coronavirus throws that system out of whack. When it infects respiratory tract cells, the virus appears to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24521-x">clear tracts of cilia</a>, and without the hairlike structures, the cells stop moving mucus, researchers report July 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>That lack of cilia could help the virus invade the lungs and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-critically-ill-patient-double-lung-transplant">cause severe COVID-19</a>, says Lisa Chakrabarti, a viral immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (<em>SN: 6/11/20</em>). Understanding how the coronavirus invades different parts of the body can help researchers find ways to block it.</p>



<p>Chakrabarti and colleagues infected lab-grown human cells that mimic the lining of the respiratory tract with the coronavirus. Images showed short, stubby cilia on the surface of the infected cells rather than the long projections found on healthy cells. When the team added microscopic beads to the surface of infected cells to measure mucus movement, those beads largely stayed still — a sign that the cells wouldn’t move mucus through the respiratory tract and into the throat to be swallowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Normally, cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus away from the lungs, toward the throat where foreign objects are swallowed. But coronavirus-infected cells lose those cilia and no longer push mucus, eliminating a barrier that would normally help prevent the virus from invading the lungs. Here microscopic beads move around the surface of uninfected lab-grown cells first and then around infected cells, illustrating mucus movement. The colored lines show how fast the beads are moving, with blue indicating slower speeds and red noting faster speeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other viruses and bacteria can also damage the body’s ability to use mucus to trap and remove foreign invaders, Chakrabarti says. Some pathogens, like the coronavirus, just damage cilia, leaving the cells they protrude from intact. Other pathogens — like influenza — can kill ciliated cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, which typically causes colds, can do both: In adults, it destroys cilia; in children, it can kill the cells, which can be deadly. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars has seen its future, and it’s full of rocks. Lots and lots of rocks. After spending the summer trundling through Jezero Crater and checking out the sights, it’s now time for Percy to get to work, teasing out the geologic history of its new home and seeking out signs of ancient microbial life.</p>



<p>“We’ve actually been on a road trip,” project manager Jennifer Trosper, who is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said at a July 21 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66vjDLSt7kQ">news conference</a>. “And during it, we will take our very first sample from the surface of Mars.”</p>



<p>Percy is about 1 kilometer south of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">where it landed on February 18</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). After driving itself around a region of sand dunes, accompanied by its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">tagalong helicopter Ingenuity</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>), the robotic explorer has pulled up to its first sampling spot: a garden of flat, pale stones dubbed paver stones. “This is the area where we are really going to be digging in, both figuratively and literally, to understand the rocks that we have been on for the last several months,” said Kenneth Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech.</p>



<p>The team has been trying to figure out whether these rocks are volcanic or sedimentary. “We still don’t have the answer,” Farley said. Images taken a few centimeters above the surface show what the team is up against: The rocks are littered with dust and pebbles, probably blown in from elsewhere, and the smoother surfaces have a mysterious purplish coating. “All of these factors conspire to prevent us from peering into the rock and actually seeing what it is made out of,” he said.</p>





<p>In the coming weeks, Percy will bore a smooth cavity in one of those rocks and get below the surface crud. Instruments on its robotic arm will then move in close to produce detailed chemical and mineralogical maps that will reveal the rocks’ true nature. Then, sometime in mid-August, the team will extract its first sample. That sample will go into a tube that will eventually get dropped off — along with samples from other locales — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">for some future mission to pick up and bring to Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>Cameras scouting farther afield have turned up future sampling sites. A small far-off hill shows hints of finely layered rock that may be mud deposits. “This is exactly the kind of rock that we are most interested in investigating for looking for potential biosignatures,” Farley said.</p>



<p>And the way that rocks are strewn about an ancient river delta in the distance suggests that the lake that once filled Jezero Crater went through multiple episodes of filling in and drying up. If true, Farley said, then the crater may have preserved “multiple time periods when we might be able to look for evidence of ancient life that might have existed on the planet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-sponge-venus-flower-baskets-water-flow-fluid-dynamics">How intricate Venus’s-flower-baskets manipulate the flow of seawater</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Venus’s-flower-basket isn’t all show. This stunning deep-sea sponge can also alter the flow of seawater in surprising ways.</p>



<p>A lacy, barrel-shaped chamber forms the sponge’s glassy skeleton. Flow simulations reveal how this intricate structure <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03658-1">alters the way water moves around and through the sponge</a>, helping it endure unforgiving ocean currents and perhaps feed and reproduce, researchers report online July 21 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Previous studies have found that the gridlike construction of a Venus’s-flower-basket (<em>Euplectella aspergillum</em>) is strong and flexible. “But no one has ever tried to see if these beautiful structures have fluid-dynamic properties,” says mechanical engineer Giacomo Falcucci of Tor Vergata University of Rome.</p>



<p>Harnessing supercomputers, Falcucci and colleagues simulated how water flows around and through the sponge’s body, with and without different skeletal components such as the sponge’s myriad pores. If the sponge were a solid cylinder, water flowing past would form a turbulent wake immediately downstream that could jostle the creature, Falcucci says. Instead water flows through and around the highly porous Venus’s-flower-basket and forms a gentle zone of water that flanks the sponge and displaces turbulence downstream, the team found. That way, the sponge’s body endures less stress.</p>





<p>Ridges that spiral around the outside of the sponge’s skeleton also somehow cause water to slow and swirl inside the structure, the simulations showed. As a result, food and reproductive cells that drift into the sponge would become trapped for up to twice as long as in the same sponge without ridges. That lingering could help the filter feeders catch more plankton. And because Venus’s-flower-baskets can reproduce sexually, it could also enhance the chances that free-floating sperm encounter eggs, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s amazing that such beauty could be so functional, Falcucci says. The sponge’s flow-altering abilities, he says, might help inspire taller, more wind-resistant skyscrapers.</p>

And the sponge’s shape creates a gentle zone of slower water that forms immediately downstream, buffering the creature against turbulence. Vertical cross sections contrast the flow activity of the calm zone (nearer the sponge) and the turbulent zone (downstream).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101751">G.
