                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-identical-twins-dont-have-identical-dna-genetics">Some identical twins don’t have identical DNA</a></h4>

<p>Identical twins may not be carbon copies at the DNA level after all.</p>



<p>On average, identical twins <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00755-1">differ by 5.2 genetic changes</a>, researchers report January 7 in <em>Nature Genetics</em>. The finding is important because identical twins — also called monozygotic twins because they come from a single fertilized egg — are often studied to determine whether particular traits, diseases or conditions result from genetics or from environmental influences. Identical twins were thought to be genetically the same, so differences in their health were considered to be the product of their environment. The new finding suggests that some genetic changes could also account for differences between twins.</p>



<p>Researchers in Iceland deciphered the complete genetic makeup, or genome, of 381 pairs of identical twins. Of those, 38 pairs were genetic duplicates of each other, but most had some differences in DNA that probably arose very early in development, either just before one embryo split to form two or shortly after the split. Some of the twins had many genetic differences, including 39 pairs who had more than 100 changes between the twins.</p>



<p>Patterns of mutations among twins suggest that embryos don’t split neatly when twins form, the findings suggest. Some twins may arise when a single cell or a small group of cells splits off from the embryo. The number of cells that a twin originates from may determine how genetically different they are from their twin, with more uneven splits of the embryo leading to a greater number of differences between the twins.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-age-hunters-leftovers-may-have-fueled-dog-domestication">Ice Age hunters’ leftovers may have fueled dog domestication</a></h4>

<p>Sometime between around 29,000 and 14,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers navigating northern Eurasia’s frigid landscapes turned wolves into dogs by feeding them lean-meat leftovers.</p>



<p>That, at least, is a likely scenario that would have benefited both wolves and people, say archaeologist Maria Lahtinen of the Finnish Food Authority in Helsinki and colleagues. In harsh Ice Age winters, when game hunted by both species was lean and fat-free, prey animals would have provided <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78214-4">more protein than humans could safely consume</a>, the researchers conclude January 7 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. People could have fed surplus lean meat to captured wolf pups being raised as pets because the animals wouldn’t have had the same dietary limitations, the team proposes.</p>



<p>That idea is largely based on inferences from previous research on how ancient hunter-gatherers survived in arctic environments and new calculations suggesting that, for dietary reasons, Ice Age groups could not have eaten all of the lean meat that was hunted. Though far from the final word on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-pushes-back-timing-origin-dogs">the controversial origins of dogs</a> (<em>SN: 5/21/15</em>), Lahtinen’s group offers a novel take on how that process may have unfolded.</p>



<p>The researchers’ calculations assume that, like some arctic hunter-gatherers today, ancient humans acquired 45 percent of their calories from animal protein. Humans can’t eat a completely carnivorous diet because of the liver’s ability to generate only part of our energy needs from protein. Edible plants could have been stored for the winter as a source of carbohydrates, but supplies would have waned as the annual big freeze wore on, the scientists suspect. So Ice Age hunter-gatherers probably reached a point where they focused on hunting in order to extract fatty marrow and grease from the bones of prey to meet energy needs, the researchers argue, leaving plenty of lean meat untouched and available as wolf food.</p>



<p>Competition between humans and wolves for prey would have declined as generations of pet wolves gradually evolved into dogs, the team hypothesizes. Only then, the idea goes, were more docile canines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invaders-sees-dogs-key-modern-humans-success">trained to help people</a> (<em>SN: 3/21/15</em>).</p>

<p>This is not a new project, by any means, rather one of my long-running favorite projects – the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>. INCF has partcipated each year since 2011, and I have been the main org admin on ONCF’s behalf for all but the two first years.</p>



<p>I described GSoC in some detail in Swedish back in 2014 when I guest-blogged at Tidningen Curie (<a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/gastbloggar/malinsandstrom/en-snart-passerad-sommar-av-kod/">“En snart passerad sommar av kod”</a>). Many of the things I named as positive then are still true today;  it is in many ways a <em>fantastically</em> fun project to work with. The students are smart, motivated and enthusiastic over having the possibility to contribute to projects and tools that are needed and useful.  The mentors get a lot of development done for the price of regular mentoring, and the projects get new contributors – many continue to involve their students one way or another after the paid period, and some of them come back as mentors for the same project they started on. One former student, from 2018,  is even my co-org-admin! (Hi, <a href="https://arnab1896.github.io/">Arnab</a>!) As mentoring organization, we get the joyous task of helping our community members help each other; many of the participating software tool projects are developed an maintained on small or no funds by the researchers themselves. We know how many small gaps there are that need to be bridged to make community tools better, faster, and smarter. And all the developed and inproved resources are openly accessible for everyone to pick up and continue working on or extend. </p>



<p>January, now,  is the run up period – we have <a href="https://neurostars.org/t/incf-call-for-community-project-proposals-and-mentors-for-gsoc-2021-deadline-for-expressions-of-interest-january-15/17865">a call out for project suggestions and mentors</a>, and responses have just started trickling in. Usually the mentors/project owners come to us with specific, well-thought-out and well described ideas, and sitting at the other end reading them all is a great experience – it is a veritable fountain of scientific and technical creativity, and one of the high points of my year. Projects that are well scoped and described – nearly all the submissions – end up on our official Project Ideas List and form the most important part of our application (I think, nobody knows exactly what Google looks for). As soon as that list goes public, around the end of January/start of February, mentors start interacting with potential students, working out the students’ project proposals. But slowly. The real explosion in activity comes when Google announces the year’s accepted organizations, this year that announcement goes out on March 9 (usually pretty late in the day, since it is on US-compatible time). It is always a very nervous day.  </p>



<p>This year, Google has reshaped the program a bit, shortening the time spent coding and lowering the (high) threshold for participation. Which means we will get more students who are not hard core coders (yet) and need some support – which we as mentoring organization will be partly responsible for providing – and also the mentors and their community – all student projects start with an official community bonding period (genius idea). I distinctly remember being new to coding as a student, and hope that experience will help me be helpful. </p>

<p>The rate of anaphylaxis seen so far — 11.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses — is higher than for the flu vaccine, which is 1.3 cases per 1 million doses, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Jan. 6 news briefing. But the reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are “still exceedingly rare,” she said.</p>



<p>“These are safe and effective vaccines. We have good data to show that,” Messonnier said. The country’s surveillance systems for vaccine side effects are “incredibly robust,” she said, and “the only thing that we that have seen is these severe allergic reactions.”</p>



<p>Still, sites that administer COVID-19 vaccines need to be able to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis — which, if it occurs, would most likely happen shortly after vaccination — and be prepared to treat it, CDC officials said. And people who have a history of anaphylaxis as a result of any cause should be observed for 30 minutes after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>





<p>Anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening, requires emergency treatment with epinephrine. The United Kingdom, which began immunizing its population against COVID-19 with the Pfizer vaccine December 8, was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-authorize-pfizer-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic">first country to report cases</a> of the severe allergic reaction following vaccinations (<em>SN: 12/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>The CDC reported on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm?s_cid=mm7002e1_w">21 cases in the United States</a>, which cover vaccinations given from December 14 to 23, in a <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> study published online January 6. These first vaccinations were only with Pfizer’s vaccine. Officials don’t yet know what is causing the allergic reaction after immunization with the vaccine.</p>



<p>There were no deaths from anaphylaxis reported in the study. Nineteen of the 21 people were treated with epinephrine and four were hospitalized. Seven of the people in the report had experienced anaphylaxis in the past. CDC officials recommend that people with a history of anaphylaxis alert the person administering the shot before getting it.</p>



<p>The CDC is continuing to monitor for these reactions. Since the report’s data were analyzed, the total number of reported reactions in the United States has grown slightly to 29 cases, the agency said at the news briefing. Some of those new cases were tied to vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plague-bacteria-die-offs-ancient-siberians-genetics-dna">Plague may have caused die-offs of ancient Siberians</a></h4>

<p>Ancient people brought the plague to Siberia by about 4,400 years ago, which may have led to collapses in the population there, a new genetic analysis suggests.</p>



<p>That preliminary finding raises the possibility that plague-induced die offs influenced the genetic structure of northeast Asians who trekked to North America starting perhaps 5,500 years ago. If the result holds up, it, along with other newly uncovered insights into human population dynamics in the region, would unveil a more complex ancestry among those ancient travelers than has usually been assumed.</p>



<p>A team led by evolutionary geneticists Gülşah Merve Kilinç and Anders Götherström, both of Stockholm University, extracted DNA from the remains of 40 human skeletons previously excavated in parts of eastern Siberia. Among those samples, DNA from <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the bacterium that causes plague, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc4587">was found in two ancient Siberians</a>, the researchers report January 6 in <em>Science Advances</em>. One person lived around 4,400 years ago. The other dated to roughly 3,800 years ago.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how the plague bacterium first reached Siberia or whether it caused widespread infections and death, Götherström says. But he and his colleagues found that genetic diversity in their ancient samples of human DNA declined sharply from around 4,700 to 4,400 years ago, possibly the result of population collapse.</p>





<p>The new data coincide with evidence reported in June 2020 in <em>Cell</em> of <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30502-X"><em>Y. pestis</em> DNA in two ancient individuals from eastern Siberia’s Lake Baikal region</a>, dating to around 4,500 years ago.</p>



<p>The plague may well have reached Siberia by roughly 4,500 years ago, at a time when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plagues-plagued-bronze-age"><em>Y. pestis</em> infected people inhabiting other parts of Eurasia</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/15</em>), says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada who did not participate in the new study. </p>



<p>But it’s possible that the ancient Siberians were infected with a version of <em>Y. pestis</em> that wasn’t virulent. If so, the bacterium wouldn’t have killed enough people to alter the genetic structure of Siberians. Genetic data from only two individuals provides too little evidence to confirm that they possessed a virulent strain of <em>Y. pestis</em>, Poinar says.</p>



<p>The genetic findings do provide a glimpse of a series of previously unknown ancient population shifts in that region. Ancient individuals included in the new research dated from around 16,900 years ago, shortly after the last Ice Age peaked, to 550 years ago. The researchers compared those ancient Siberians’ DNA to DNA from present-day humans in different parts of the world and to previous samples of ancient human DNA — mainly from Europe, Asia and North America. The analyses showed that despite Siberia’s harsh climate, groups near Lake Baikal and regions further east mixed with various populations in and outside of Siberia from the Late Stone Age up to medieval times.</p>



<p>The two plague-carrying Siberians, in particular, came from regions that had experienced major population transformations during much of the sampled time period, the researchers say. Those events could have included migrations of plague-carrying people from outside Siberia. For instance, the 4,400-year-old skeleton was found just west of Lake Baikal, a region that witnessed the emergence of several distinct genetic groups — with roots mainly further to the west and southwest of Lake Baikal — between around 8,980 and 560 years ago.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-discipline-gap-black-students-punishment-race-bias">How schools can reduce excessive discipline of Black students</a></h4>

<p>Anne Gregory remembers the child’s fondness for the Dewey decimal system. He would write down a combination of numbers and letters on a scrap of paper and hunt down the desired book in the library. Details were his thing. He once wrote several pages outlining the sequence of moves needed to beat a video game, she says.</p>



<p>But at the elementary school where Gregory worked as a counselor, educators saw a different child. A troublemaker. One teacher told Gregory that the boy frequently wandered about mid-lesson. So the teacher moved his desk to the far corner of the room, and sometimes sent him to the principal’s office.</p>



<p>Outside the principal’s door, the boy joined a queue of almost all Black boys. But Black and Latino students together made up just over half of the school’s student population. Gregory brought up her concerns with the principal. Why was that little boy always in trouble? Why did that line of supposed troublemakers skew Black and male?</p>



<p>This was the mid-1990s, a time when educators and researchers knew Black students, on average, scored lower on standardized tests than white students. This “achievement gap” was, by then, a cause for concern. But how educators treated Black children was rarely part of the discussions. The principal told Gregory that her concerns, while potentially valid, were “too hot” to tackle.</p>





<p>“I could just see how much the school structure itself was squelching this African-American boy’s potential and all his strengths,” Gregory says. “That, accompanied with the silence around this at his school, demonstrated to me the absolute urgency, the need, to point this out.”</p>



<p>Gregory, now a psychologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., has devoted her career to pointing out the problem. In the January 2010 <em>Educational Researcher</em>, she and colleagues used the term “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0013189X09357621">discipline gap</a>” to characterize what she’d observed: Black students, particularly boys, were punished more frequently and severely than their white peers — despite a lack of evidence that the Black kids were committing more offenses. Those punishments ranged from teachers sending students to the principal’s office to expulsion. Black students’ disproportionate removal from school may well underlie the achievement gap, Gregory and others contend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I could just see how much the school structure itself was squelching this African American boy’s potential and all his strengths.</p><cite>Anne Gregory</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In 2015, President Barack Obama signed into law the Every Student Succeeds Act, in part to curtail practices that pull students from class. The act required each state to collect and report data on discipline, and school districts had to formulate alternatives to suspensions and expulsions. A handful of states and districts have banned suspensions for minor offenses, such as talking back to a teacher.</p>



<p>But President Donald Trump’s administration rolled back key requirements. And as of July 2020, no states were fully reporting disciplinary data, according to an October 11 report by the Civil Rights Project, a UCLA group that promotes social justice research. In addition, Black students in middle and high school <a href="https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/school-discipline/lost-opportunities-how-disparate-school-discipline-continues-to-drive-differences-in-the-opportunity-to-learn">were four times as likely to be suspended as white students</a>, based on federal data from the 2015–16 academic year.</p>



<p>Policy changes alone cannot close the gap, says Russell Skiba, a psychologist at Indiana University Bloomington who focuses on equity in education. Educators must also transform how they view Black students. “What we need are interventions that look at both a reduction in overall use of exclusionary discipline, but also focus on issues of implicit bias [and] structural racism,” Skiba says.</p>



<p>Removing Black students from the classroom robs them of a lifetime of opportunity, adds Daniel Losen, director of UCLA’s Center for Civil Rights Remedies and a coauthor of the October report. Compared with other students, punished students are more likely to fall behind academically, often by years, have lower test scores, drop out of school, earn less and end up in prison. “This is a massive civil rights violation,” Losen says.</p>

<h3>Unequal burden<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>Although U.S. middle and high school suspension rates have been dropping, the gap between Black and white students has remained relatively unchanged, federal data show. Elementary rates are lower, but rising for Black children. </p>

<h4>Punishing customs</h4>



<p>Punitive practices in U.S. schools are nothing new. Teachers commonly paddled or whipped students into the early 1900s. Corporal, or physical, punishment remains legal in many states to this day. By the 1960s, teachers and other educational leaders also began suspending students for misbehavior.</p>



<p>Harsh discipline in all forms was falling out of favor until the crack cocaine epidemic began ravaging Black communities in the 1980s. Politicians launched “a war on drugs” to wipe out that scourge. Violent crime also peaked in the early 1990s. Those twin forces led to policy changes in the 1980s and ’90s that made prison sentences for drug and violent crimes harsher, including mandatory minimum sentences for certain offenses. At the time, people believed that criminals thrive in chaotic, lawless environments, Losen says. So law enforcement began giving citations for even minor violations.</p>



<p>Those draconian practices reached the classroom. President Bill Clinton signed the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 mandating expulsion for a minimum of one year of any student who brought a weapon to school, no hearing necessary. States soon passed zero-tolerance laws that led to suspensions or expulsions for even minor offenses. Students have been removed from school for wielding “weapons,” such as nail clippers or rubber bands, or distributing “contraband” cough drops. Today, zero-tolerance policies account for about <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373716652728?papetoc=&amp;journalCode=epaa">10 percent of the racial discipline gap</a>, educational policy expert Chris Curran of the University of Florida in Gainesville reported in the December 2016 <em>Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Compared with other students, punished students are more likely to fall behind academically, often by years, have lower test scores, drop out of school, earn less and end up in prison.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Educators’ explicit or implicit biases against Black children also keep the gap wide, research suggests. Those biases are present even in preschools. In one study, researchers fit 132 early education teachers with eye trackers and asked the teachers to watch video clips of four children — a Black girl, a Black boy, a white girl and a white boy — seated around a table. The researchers told the teachers to look for misbehaviors.</p>



<p>In truth, none of the children misbehaved, but the eye trackers revealed that the <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/zigler/publications/Preschool Implicit Bias Policy Brief_final_9_26_276766_5379_v1.pdf">teachers spent more time gazing at the Black boy</a>. And in an accompanying questionnaire that asked which child required the most attention, 42 percent of respondents chose the Black boy, 34 percent chose the white boy, 13 percent chose the white girl and 10 percent chose the Black girl, researchers from Yale University wrote in a report to federal and state officials in September 2016.</p>



<p>Another study shows how such biases contribute to teachers disciplining Black students more harshly than white students. Researchers asked 191 teachers of K–12 students to imagine teaching at a middle school depicted in a photograph. The teachers then read a series of vignettes about a student who got in trouble twice, once for insubordination and again for disrupting class. Researchers told half the teachers that the student’s name was Darnell or Deshawn, stereotypically Black male names; for the other half, the boy was named Greg or Jake, stereotypically white male names.</p>



<p>After each incident, the teachers answered questions on a seven-point scale. Questions included, “How severe was the student’s misbehavior?” and “How severely should the student be disciplined?” After the first bad behavior, the teachers were equally lenient toward the Black and white boys. But after the second bad behavior, the teachers rated Black boys as 25 percent more troublesome than white boys and recommended 30 percent harsher disciplinary responses, reported social psychologists Jason Okonofua and Jennifer L. Eberhardt of Stanford University in 2015 in <em>Psychological Science</em>. The researchers called this finding <a href="https://edens.berkeley.edu/PDF/2strikes.pdf">the “two-strikes” paradigm</a>.</p>



<p>That study shows how bias can manifest in institutions, says Sean Darling-Hammond, a graduate student in education policy at the University of California, Berkeley, who collaborates with Okonofua, also now at UC Berkeley, to continue that line of research. After repeated misbehaviors, teachers were more lenient with white students, but penalized Black students.</p>



<h4>Color-blind corrections</h4>



<p>The October report provides the most up-to-date snapshot of the discipline gap. Data for the report come from the U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights Data Collection and include information on student enrollment, demographics and discipline for every public school in the country.</p>



<p>Overall suspension rates were declining under the Obama administration, probably in part because 15 states adopted laws discouraging suspensions. California, for instance, flags districts that suspend more than 6 percent of their students and assists in bringing those districts’ rates down.</p>



<p>When grades K–12 were lumped together, suspension rates fell from 4 percent to 3 percent for white students and 16 percent to 13 percent for Black students, between the 2009–10 to 2015–16 school years.</p>



<p>But with Black students still suspended at four times the rate of white students, the report also spotlights the shortcomings of relying solely on policy changes to close the gap. No policy can capture the myriad interactions that happen in a school, says educational policy researcher Kenneth Shores of the University of Delaware in Newark. Consider common scenarios — teachers praising white students while criticizing Black students, or calling mostly on white students.</p>



<p>Yet many current interventions aim to improve school climate while sidestepping issues of race. For instance, several programs rely on restorative justice. That concept is applied frequently in criminal justice settings, and brings victims and offenders together to discuss an incident and give all involved parties a voice.</p>



<p>Restorative justice practices can help teachers change how they handle discipline problems. Such approaches can also create school cultures based on trust and open communication, often in lieu of discipline. For instance, many schools use a multitiered system of support for students and staff. Tier one is preventive: Students come together in so-called community-building circles to discuss a prompt or question and listen to one another’s perspectives. At tier two, students involved in a minor dispute work together in “responsive circles” to solve the problem. And at tier three, everyone involved in a serious dispute participates in a “restorative conference” where a trained facilitator guides the dialog. If a student is still suspended, educators later welcome the student back to school and gauge his or her need for additional support to get caught up.</p>



<p>In 2006, the suspension gap between Black and white students in the large urban district of Denver was 12 percentage points: About 6 percent of white students had been suspended compared with 18 percent of Black students. By 2013, the gap had narrowed to 8 percentage points, researchers reported in <em>Closing the School Discipline Gap</em>, a 2015 book Losen coedited. Some of the drop may have been due to restorative justice training, which launched in the early 2000s.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, educators were still suspending more Black students — at a rate of 10.42 percent versus 2.28 percent for white students. In effect, the color-blind approach worsened the racial suspension gap from a threefold difference between Black and white students to more than fivefold.</p>



<p>“Interventions for reducing disparities in … discipline cannot be race neutral,” says Indiana’s Skiba.</p>





<h4>Addressing race</h4>



<p>Decades have passed since Gregory observed that elementary school boy waiting outside the principal’s office. Yet she is still grappling with how to help children like him.</p>



<p>Two years ago, for instance, Gregory and her colleagues piloted a program at one elementary, one middle and one high school in New York City to confront racism in schools. That program combines a race-conscious version of restorative justice with socioemotional learning. The latter helps children regulate their emotions by teaching self- and social awareness and responsible decision making. During 25 hours of training, teachers come together in circles similar to those used in Denver. The prompt, however, asks teachers to consider how structural racism hurts children. After that initial training, coaches also work with the teachers one-on-one.</p>



<p>This facilitated dialog around race has <a href="https://learningforward.org/journal/august-2018-vol-39-no-4/a-promising-path-toward-equity/">helped teachers speak freely about their worries</a>, Gregory noted in 2018 in the trade publication <em>The Learning Professional</em>. For instance, during the training circles, teachers often express concern that nonpunitive approaches are too soft or unstructured. When that happens, Gregory and her colleagues walk teachers through scenarios of alternative responses to students misbehaving.</p>



<p>Data collection is also key to the success of a new program, Gregory says. Crunching the numbers can illuminate disparities that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, the pilot middle school in Gregory’s study had a predominantly Black student population, making racial gaps in discipline less of a problem to begin with. School officials knew, however, that girls there had more behavioral problems than boys. Yet an examination of discipline data showed that teachers were punishing boys more frequently and more severely than girls.</p>



<p>In 2019, the team began scaling up the program to eventually reach 18 schools in Queens and Brooklyn. The researchers are also monitoring how school leaders are providing support, such as space for restorative circles and freeing up time for students to learn socioemotional skills. The pandemic, however, interrupted the expansion effort and the release of preliminary results, Gregory says.</p>



<p>But research in education and other fields shows that efforts to eradicate people’s biases rarely stick. So rather than targeting the bias itself, Darling-Hammond, Okonofua and UC Berkeley psychology graduate student Amanda Perez recently tried addressing its downstream consequences. That is, if harsh discipline is seen as the culmination of a process that begins with bias and ends with, say, expulsion, then what targets between those two points might be easier to change? The team identified activities that changed teachers’ thinking or helped them understand a misbehaving student’s perspective.</p>



<p>The two-strikes work from 2015 showed that educators were quick to label Black students as troublemakers. So the trio wondered if teachers could be convinced to adopt a “growth mind-set” — the belief that students and relationships could change. The team also theorized that once teachers adopted a growth mind-set, they would need time and space to get to know their students.</p>



<p>Okonofua and colleagues knew from the 2015 study that teachers recommended 30 percent harsher discipline for Black students than white students. So in a follow-up study, the team asked a different group of U.S. teachers to read vignettes about hypothetical students named Deshawn or Greg.</p>



<p>But this time teachers had extra vignettes to read. First, about half of the 243 teachers read a passage on the growth mind-set, specifically how teachers can change a student’s life. Second, the teachers read about how their relationship to students could grow. Third, they read about the student’s initial misbehavior. Fourth, they read about the student’s love of music and struggles outside school. And finally, the teachers read about the student’s second misbehavior, then answered a set of questions.</p>



<p>Teachers in a control group, meanwhile, read only the misbehavior vignettes interspersed with unrelated or subversive readings, such as a passage on how relationships cannot change.</p>



<p>The intervention made responses to both Black and white students more positive. Compared with teachers in the control groups, those who read the additional vignettes about Deshawn <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/42/eaba9479/tab-pdf">were less likely to label him as a troublemaker or expect him to get suspended</a> in the future, and were more likely to feel they could build a strong relationship with him, the team reported October 16 in<em> Science Advances</em>. Though those teachers were also less willing to see Deshawn receive harsh discipline, that finding did not reach statistical significance. Darling-Hammond now hopes to see these interventions tested outside of the lab.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Course correct </h3>



<p>Research suggests teachers are more lenient with white than Black students — a sign of implicit bias. Rather than tackle bias, a new study taught teachers how students and relationships can improve. The teachers also learned about the student. Those teachers were less likely than teachers who read unrelated text to label Black students as troublemakers.</p>

<h4>The virtual classroom</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, Losen and others worry that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could make shrinking the discipline gap even harder. Data collected during the pandemic are not yet available, but anecdotes of teachers punishing Black students for misbehaving during online classes have recently surfaced. Police arrived at the home of a 12-year-old in Colorado after his art teacher saw him playing with a neon green toy gun. The school later suspended the boy for five days. Police also visited a boy in New Jersey after a teacher saw him playing with a Nerf gun. School officials in Louisiana suspended a 9-year-old boy for having an unloaded BB gun visible in his bedroom.</p>



<p>During this pandemic, teachers have even less time and space to get to know what’s going on in their students’ lives. And everyone’s stress levels are at an all-time high, Losen says. “Unless we do something very different and really address needs in a way that we never have, we’re going to see a train wreck.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Racial discipline differences in police departments</h3>



<p>Differences in how Black and white people are disciplined exists in at least one type of workplace, new research suggests. Researchers don’t always have easy access to data on how companies discipline employees. But disciplinary records from several police departments have become available to researchers and the public.</p>



<p>Between 1991 and 2015, Black police officers in the Chicago and Philadelphia police departments <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.03.010">were formally disciplined more than white officers</a>, despite having similar numbers of misconduct allegations — including things like use of excessive force and verbal assault — filed against them by the public or coworkers, researchers reported online last April in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>.</p>



<p>Reviewing records from over 8,000 officers — women and men of various races — Sheri Walter, a management researcher at Indiana University Bloomington, and coauthors tallied the disciplinary actions taken against officers in the two police departments. In Chicago, Black officers were about twice as likely to have been disciplined than white officers. In Philadelphia, Black officers were almost 1.5 times as likely to have been disciplined.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear what’s causing the disparity, mainly because disciplinary decisions made in reaction to misconduct allegations often happen out of the public eye, says Bryan Stroube, a management researcher at the London Business School. His analysis of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959781830339X?via%3Dihub">discipline disparities within the Chicago Police Department</a> was published online September 1 in the same journal. “There’s just not a lot of visibility to this process,” he says. — <em>Curtis Segarra</em></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zinc-air-batteries-single-use-new-design-rechargeable">Zinc-air batteries are typically single-use. A new design could change that</a></h4>

<p>Zinc-air batteries have a lot going for them. They’re lightweight, compact and made of more sustainable, less flammable materials than other batteries. But they’re usually not rechargeable.</p>



<p>A new battery design could change that. By tweaking the building materials, researchers created a prototype of a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb9554">zinc-air battery that could be recharged hundreds of times</a>. Such long-lasting devices, described in the Jan. 1 <em>Science</em>, could one day power electric cars or other electronics.</p>



<p>Zinc-air batteries are one of many potential <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/better-batteries-charge-forward">next-generation batteries</a> that could hold more energy while being cheaper and safer than existing devices (<em>SN: 1/9/17</em>). Every zinc-air battery cell contains two electrodes — a zinc anode and a porous cathode — separated by a liquid called an electrolyte. In standard zinc-air cells, the electrolyte is a high-pH substance, containing ingredients like potassium hydroxide. Oxygen from the air enters the cathode, where the gas reacts with water from the electrolyte to form hydroxide. Hydroxide formed at the cathode surface travels to the anode and reacts with zinc to release energy that powers other devices.</p>



<p>“The problem is, this reaction is not very reversible,” says Wei Sun, a materials scientist at the University of Münster in Germany. And that makes it hard to recharge the battery. The caustic electrolyte in conventional zinc-air batteries can also degrade the cathode and anode.</p>



<p>To solve those problems, Sun and colleagues built a zinc-air battery using a new electrolyte that contains water-repellant ions. Those ions stick to the cathode, preventing H<sub>2</sub>O from the electrolyte from reacting with incoming oxygen at the cathode surface. As a result, zinc ions from the anode can travel to the cathode and react directly with oxygen from the air. This relatively simple reaction is easy to run backward to recharge the battery.</p>



<p>What’s more, the new electrolyte doesn’t degrade the battery’s electrodes, which helps the battery last longer. In lab experiments, Sun and colleagues were able to drain and recharge a new zinc-air battery cell 320 times over 160 hours.</p>

<p>It seems I have a lot going on this coming year, I was a bit surprised myself when I started counting out my projects and landed at 9 long before I was done. Here is a status update:</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1684">2021 projects, #1: social media critique</a><br />I have the book, digital now and paper on the way, but have not started yet.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/30/2021-projects-2-veganuary/">2021 projects, #2: Veganuary</a><br />Going well so far; veganizing breakfast was easy, quick work-from-home lunches depend mostly on what we ate the days before so they will veganize themselves in time. Dinner requires more adjustment, since I have two kids – relativley open to eating new things, but one of them is probably a supertaster. Most of my #veganuary updates will be posted on Instagram.</p>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/malinsandstrom.blog/1697">2021 projects, #3: test-knit a cardigan</a><br />Also going well, I have the yoke almost done. The only annoyance is my cable keeps unscrewing from the right hand needle, regardless of how hard I screw it stuck. Again and again. </p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-4-learn-something-new/">2021 projects, #4: learn something new</a><br />This project hit an unanticipated rock in the road – the Swedish AI course I joined, “Elements of AI”  in Swedish translation, which looked good at the start, turned out to be a disappointment. Weirdly formulated  problem statements – I supposed they aimed to be inclusive give simple questions, but missed the mark – and finnicky automated-response-checkers. Translation was great, though. The only term not well translated was Data Scientist.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-5-community-managers-resilience/">2021 projects, #5: community managers &amp; resilience</a><br />Community managers at large have been a positive force for good, this year. In late January, there will be a Community Manager Appreciation Day, themed “resilience”. Expect some posts on that.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-6-scouting-leadership/">2021 projects, #6: scouting &amp; leadership</a><br />We joined in late November, so the only scout meetings we have had so far took place on Zoom. But there are plans to be outside and DO things, which I look much forward to. And I am psyched to be a parent-leader; I have <em>so</em> many ideas for keeping the kids busy and entertained. </p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-7-books/">2021 projects, #7: books</a><br />This will be the most work, likely. All books in the apartment need to get sorted, a fair amount will be packed in boxes, and the equal amount of books will come up from the cellar storage. All books to be scanned and registered. And I need to go through, sort and tag all my 700 e-books.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/01/2021-projects-8-podcasts/">2021 projects, #8: podcasts</a><br />This project, I think, will be a main contributor to keeping me sane. I plan to take long walks and listen to interesting things. I have already found a few new favourites to add to my listening rota (which so far is mainly EscapePod): the ORIONScience podcast, and the Svenskan i Samhället (Swedish in Society) podcast.</p>



<p><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/">2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything</a><br />This is by far not my only upcoming work project. There will be Google Summer of Code, there will be INCF Working Groups, and literature search for the INCF Infrastructure Committee. And meeting new people, helping some people connect and collaborate… I will likely not have a boring moment.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/04/2021-projects-9-rrids-on-everything/">2021 projects, #9: RRIDs on everything</a></h4>

<p>This project is work-focused, but will surely frame my thinking and actions also beyond work. My latest work strategy meeting can pretty much be summed up in one sentence: RRIDs on <em>everythin</em>g (and if it doesn’t have an RRID yet, get one for it).</p>



<p>RRID is short for Research Resource ID, and is a type of identifier to inambiguously identify, mention and cite a research resource, taken broadly. Web portals, software tools, antibodies, cell/animal lines or bacterial strains. RRIDs grew out of the Research Resource Identification Initiative, whose key members also are part of the INCF community in the US, ands was launched as a recommendation in 2014, re-emphasized by successful trial results published in 2016.</p>



<p>If you have ever experienced an everyday name or identity collision – a similarly named classmate, a repeatedly mis-dialed phone number, getting emails meant for another person, having a neighbour or office colleague who gets your mail and you get theirs – you should already have a hunch about why identifiers are important, and what not having them means.</p>



<p>Simply put, identifiers give us a way to be more specific and precise than mere words can offer. There are existing identifiers for research papers (DOI:s, since old, ~2000s), people (ORCID:s, even older, Oct 2012), and research institutions (ROR in 2019, GRID in 2015). And since even longer, books have identifiers. ISBN, the International Standard Book Number, was published in <strong>1970</strong> as international standard ISO 2108. And identifiers typically are compact strings of characters, put together after a pattern, because you want them to be easy to use AND computer-readable .</p>



<p>But the existing set of identifiers did not cover all of research nearly enough: there were (and are still) problems with, for example: exactly and unambigously stating which antibod(ies) from which producer(s) you actually used. Or which breed of lab rat. Citing tools and specifying transparently which tools you use. Hence, RRIDs were conceived, and there is an ongoing campaign to get them broadly used.</p>



<p>Identifiers are useful on their own, but there are broader aspects – if you want to make science FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Internoperable, Reusable), <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/dint_a_00025">identifiers will be a part of your toolset</a>. They also need to be machine readable, because computers deal with thousands of data points a lot better than most humans do, and it would be nice to be able to automate identification and information gathering. They need to be persistent, i.e stay the same and not start meaning something different regardless of how tech develops. They also need to be resolveable – there needs to be a service at the other end, likely a database – storing the associated info.</p>



<p>The idea is, if everything has an RRID, it doesn’t matter if information is spread out like a box of dropped tooth picks all over the formal and informal scientific digital landscape in preprints, papers, posters, websites, blog posts, social media – it is still findable, as long as it is digital, attached to a PID, and available for indexing. So my mission is, simply, to find out which important-to-neuroinformatics research objects are not yet findable, and change that.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunstman-spiders-leaves-fake-shelters-frogs">These spiders may sew leaves into fake shelters to lure frogs to their doom</a></h4>

<p>On a sweltering afternoon in northeastern Madagascar, the coolness of a leaf’s shade is an attractive respite for a frog. But some of these oases may hide hungry architects: huntsman spiders.</p>



<p>New observations show that the gangly spiders partially attach two leaves together using silk, creating a leafy hollow. One of the arachnids was spotted eating a frog inside one of the pockets, suggesting that the spiders <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.7102">create the structures to lure and trap frogs</a>, researchers report December 11 in <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>. </p>



<p>In 2017 and 2018, biologist Thio Rosin Fulgence and colleagues were conducting an ecological survey in Madagascar when Dominic Martin, an ecologist at the University of Göttingen in Germany, spotted a large huntsman spider (<em>Damastes </em>sp<em>.</em>) eating a small Madagascar reed frog (<em>Heterixalus andrakata</em>). The spider was on a small tree, near a pair of overlapping leaves that had been attached together with spider silk to create a pocket. Upon approach, the spider backed into its leafy lair, amphibian prize in tow. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="huntsman spider feeds on Madagascar reed frog" class="wp-image-3094880" height="366" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/122320_jb_frog-eating-spiders_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094880">A huntsman spider feeds on a Madagascar reed frog inside a pocket built from leaves and spider silk.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094880">Dominic Andreas Martin</span></figure>



<p>“The first time that we found this phenomenon, we were very excited,” says Fulgence, of the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar. The next year, while conducting reptile and amphibian surveys in roughly the same region, Fulgence found three more of the spiders hiding in similar leaf retreats. These spiders weren’t spotted with prey, he says.</p>



<p>Some spiders are known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-tarantula-eating-weird-stuff-complex-amazon-food-webs">prey on larger and stronger vertebrates</a> such as a mouse opossum and even frogs, if given the opportunity (<em>SN: 2/28/19</em>). When that happens, the arachnids are commonly seen as winning the vertebrate jackpot. But huntsman spiders, in contrast, may be specifically targeting frogs as prey, the researchers say. By attaching the leaves together, the spiders are creating cool and dark microhabitats that would be desirable in a dry, searing environment with plenty of predatory birds, Fulgence says.</p>





<p>Still, these spiders could simply be hiding in the leafy retreats and ambushing prey passing by, not using the structures as traps, says Stano Pekár, a behavioral biologist at Masaryk University in Brno, the Czech Republic, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>That’s true, agrees Jose Valdez, a conservation biologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig. But “what makes me think otherwise is that not only did the researchers find [the leaf retreats] multiple times, but that the spider was weaving the edges of the leaves,” says Valdez, who was not involved with the study. “I would think there would be much easier places for these spiders to hide in a forest.”</p>



<p>Part of the reason for the uncertainty is that the spider spotted eating a frog was first seen outside its leaf pocket as the arachnid was consuming its prey. “Only detailed observations and experiments” can confirm if the leaves are a frog trap, says Rodrigo Willemart, a zoologist at the University of São Paulo, who also was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>If so, such a tool could be unique among spiders, Willemart says. “I don´t know of papers that have reported on traps built by spiders specifically for capturing vertebrates.”  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can healthcare implementation be understood through a political lens?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogers et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. explored the effect of micropolitics, the use of power, authority, and influence, on implementation processes in the healthcare context. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare teams, healthcare professionals have discipline-specific priorities and expectations. Thus, multidisciplinary teams must reach agreements in spite of their divergent organizational priorities.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rogers et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. sought to address how micropolitics influences implementation processes by utilizing a multiple case study design and a theoretical framework.</span></p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-12230 aligncenter" height="368" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/micropolitics-of-healthcare-300x156.jpg" width="707" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The qualitative analysis revealed that implementing change is an inherently political process in the healthcare context. Hierarchical systems were exemplified in both case studies; however, the impact of the hierarchy differed across settings. The first theme of the micropolitics of implementation was utilizing the hierarchy to exert influence. The physicians were identified as important “role models” in implementing change. Senior managers served similarly to senior physicians, though their role was perceived to have less influence on staff engagement. Additionally, clinical nurse managers played an important role as the “middle-man” to liaise between the disciplines. In one instance, the clinical nurse manager’s rejection of the intervention led to a lack of information amongst the team, negatively impacting implementation. In each instance, the hierarchy structure impacted how team members related to the intervention.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately le</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second theme that emerged was how traditional power structures constrained implementation. Teams often described a culture of “put up or shut up”. Staff articulated how the hierarchy made them feel “constrained” and “beaten down”, ultimately leading team members to fear expressing their personal opinions regarding the intervention. Furthermore, the hierarchy of the team impacted how the staff viewed the intervention relating to their influence on the decision. While some staff felt the intervention offered them an opportunity to participate as members of the team and to “have a voice”, which led to more consistent attendance throughout implementation, other members felt the implementation was irrelevant to their role, resulting in poor adoption of the intervention. Finally, silo working, or working in isolation rather than collaboration, negatively affected the dissemination of information within the medical team, limiting engagement. Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">us, the hierarchy also impacted cross-disciplinary interactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings ultimately apply the micropolitical concepts of power, authority and influence to the healthcare context in hopes of providing insight on how to develop more appropriate implementation strategies. The thematic analysis and knowledge of the “everyday politics” of healthcare will certainly help develop a framework for successful implementation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of the global opioid crisis, developing safe care parameters for people who use substances is essential. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urbanoski et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. conducted focus groups with a variety of individuals who use or used substances, focusing on the patient perspective of safe primary care. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants were recruited from peer-run organizations that provide support and advocacy to people who use substances. Participants were an average of 42.5 years, half identified as female and one quarter as Indigenous. Following several rounds of focus groups focused around the statement “I would feel safe going to the doctor if…”, the participants produced a cluster map as a “comprehensive and meaningful” representation of the data. The clusters can be summarized as the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Act to prevent stigma: Don’t treat me like crap!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This cluster deals with the external and internal stigma associated with substance use.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey I’m human. Treat me right!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Similar to Cluster 1, this cluster reflects the importance of humane and compassionate care.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uphold professional standards</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cluster 3 primarily focuses on professional competency, particularly around pain management and how providers can recognize patients’ experience of pain as legitimate.</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you care about me? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can physicians develop trust with their patients? This cluster speaks to the importance of personalized care, continuity of care, and developing rapport. </span></i></li>
<li><i>Maintain my confidentiality in a welcoming and comfortable environment</i>. Cluster 5 articulates concerns around the waiting room environment and clinic practices. Participants described crowded waiting rooms and limited privacy in conversation as chief stressors.</li>
<li><i>Be a champion for advocacy</i>. How can primary care providers address issues of accessibility and support to improve perceived safety in accessing care? Cluster 6 states examples such as allowing the presence of advocates or friends at appointments, providing care in discrete locations, etc.</li>
<li><i>Acknowledge and accommodate my needs and circumstances</i>. Cluster 7 identifies how circumstances impact plans of care. Participants indicated the desire for increased forgiveness of missed appointments, understanding fear of being criminalized for the disclosure of drug use, and more. Each of these statements asked primary care providers to recognize the “structural conditions” that impact accessing healthcare.</li>
<li><i>Don’t red flag me: Recognize addiction as a health issue</i>. The final cluster addresses how a physician’s view of addiction as a health issue, not a criminal behavior, helps people who use substances feel safe in seeking care.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, these focus groups provide a starting point for improving the delivery of compassionate primary care to people who use substances. This model provides concrete, patient-centered suggestions for improving primary care processes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposing a potential cohort effect for this trend, it is suggested sexual identities can be influenced by social attitudes and the legal environment of the time. Younger cohorts have spent their formative years within a time of higher acceptance of sexual identity and the willingness to disclose one’s identity. This cohort effect has the potential to impact future population surveys and the percentage of Australia’s known sexual minority population.  </span></p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t just a shock to the human immune system. It was also a shock to the Earth system, dramatically changing the air quality in cities around the globe.</p>



<p>As countries around the globe struggled to contain the disease, they imposed temporary shutdowns. Scientists are now sifting through data collected by satellite and on the ground to understand what this hiatus in human activities can tell us about the atmospheric cocktail that generates city pollution. Much of this preliminary data was shared at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting in December.</p>

<p>It was already known that peoples’ activities were curtailed enough to result in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-daily-co2-emissions">a dramatic drop in emissions of greenhouse gases</a> in April, as well as a dip in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-pandemic-lockdowns-seismic-noise-humans">seismic noises produced by humans</a> (<em>SN: 5/19/20; SN: 7/23/20</em>). That quiet period didn’t last, though, and carbon dioxide emissions began to climb back upward by the summer. April 2020 saw a drop of about 17 percent in global monthly <a>CO<sub>2</sub></a> emissions from fossil fuels, but by year’s end, <a href="https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/about/news_and_press/2020-12-11_global-carbon-budget-2020.html">annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the globe were only 7 percent lower</a> than they were in 2019. That reduction <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change">was too brief</a>, compared with the hundreds of years that the gas can linger in Earth’s atmosphere, to put a dent in the planet’s atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level (<em>SN: 8/7/20</em>).</p>





<p>But in addition to briefly reducing emissions of climate-warming gases, this abrupt halt in many human activities — particularly commuter traffic — also created an unprecedented experiment for scientists to examine the complicated chemistry of atmospheric pollutants in cities. By altering the usual mix of pollutants hovering over cities, the shutdowns may help scientists better understand another longstanding misery for human health: poor air quality in many cities.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that the pandemic has a silver lining, says Jessica Gilman, a tropospheric chemist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo. “Misery is no solution to our global environmental challenges.”</p>



<p>But there’s now a wealth of data from cities around the globe on how the pandemic altered regional or local concentrations of the precursors of ozone, a primary component of smog. Those precursors include nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds — both produced by traffic — as well as <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/webprogram/Paper713941.html">methane, produced by the oil and gas industry</a>. With satellites, scientists are also able to assess how levels of these pollutants changed around the globe.</p>



<p>Building a global picture of altered city pollution is no easy task, though. Researchers are finding that the pandemic’s impact on levels of various pollutants <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/webprogram/Paper665810.html">was highly regional, affected by differences</a> in wind and rain as well as by photochemical interactions with sunlight — the intensity of which also changes with the season.  </p>



<p>That stark variety of regional effects was evident in, for example, the different post-pandemic ozone levels in Denver and New York City. Nitrogen oxide gases produced by traffic are a powerful precursor to cities’ elevated ozone levels, which can damage the lungs and trigger respiratory ailments. The United States has made strides in reducing these gases over the last few decades — but there hasn’t been a corresponding drop in ozone levels, Dan Jaffe, an environmental chemist at the University of Washington Bothell, reported at the meeting on December 9.</p>

<p>The shutdowns gave researchers some insight into why, Jaffe says. From March 15 through July 23, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/webprogram/Paper769096.html">New York City had a 21 percent decrease in nitrogen dioxide</a>, one of several nitrogen oxide gases, in comparison with 2019 levels. Although the shutdowns were more stringent during the spring months, it turned out that summertime reductions in nitrogen dioxide were most strongly linked to the city’s change in ozone levels, the researchers found. “We see very strong reduction in summertime ozone this year,” Jaffe said at the meeting, citing unpublished data.</p>



<p>That’s because in the summer months, heat and sunlight react with the precursor gases in the atmosphere, like nitrogen dioxide, creating a toxic cocktail. This kind of insight can be a boon to policy makers in a non-pandemic year, suggesting that nitrogen oxide regulations should focus most strongly on the summer, Jaffe says. “It’s really good evidence that <a>NO<sub>x</sub> </a>reductions extending into July in 2020 had an important impact.”</p>



<p>In Denver, however, ozone didn’t drop so consistently — possibly because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">wildfires were beginning to rage across the U.S. West</a> by the end of the summer (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>). The fires produce nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and fine particles that can also help to increase ground-level ozone.</p>



<p>“There are different patterns in different cities,” Jaffe says. “There are a lot of factors to sort out, and a lot of work to be done.” Armed with a wealth of new data from 2020, scientists hope to be able to make some headway.</p>

<p>Today was the informal start of our Veganuary. I went shopping for core vegan staples and a few upcoming easy meals, and we made our first vegan lunch: vegan gyros in pita bread, with oat créme fraîche, vegetables, hummus, roasted onion flakes, and vegan feta.  Everyone was postively surprised – the vegan gyros was tender and flavourful, the fraîche was to everyone’s liking, and the feta was eerily much like the original. </p>



<p>We also discussed implementation and focus, and came to agreement: 1) major focus: sustainability and being planet friendly. No flight transports or unneccessarily long transports if local alternatives exist. 2) secondary focus: health. We might as well diversify our carbohydrates while changing things around. More beans and lentils. 3) Needs to be family compatible. The kids will sometimes get their usual fare, but will be encouraged to try alternatives.</p>



<p>In addition, I aim to take a generally more planet-friendly month, focused on re-use and DIY, aiming for second hand and pre-used where available. </p>

<p><em>How does the brain work and how can we understand it? I want to make it a habit to report some of the thoughts about the brain that marked me most during the past twelve month at the end of each year – with the hope to advance and structure the progress in the part of my understanding of the brain that is not immediately reflected in journal publications.

<p>Doing experiments in neuroscience means opening Pandora’s box. On a daily basis, you’re confronted with the vexing fact that the outcome of experiments is not only slightly, but much more complex and variable than any mental model you could come up with. It is rewarding and soothing to read published stories about scientific findings, but they often become stories only because things which did not fit in were omitted or glossed over. This is understandable to some extent, since nobody wants to read 379 side-notes on anecdotal and potentially confusing observations. But it leads to a striking gap between headlines with clear messages, and the feeling of being overwhelmed by complexity when doing experiments or going through a raw dataset. It is possible to overcome this complexity by nested analysis pipelines (‘source’ extraction, unsupervised clustering, inclusion criteria, dimensionality reduction, etc.) and to restore simplicity. But the confusion often comes back when going back to the raw, unreduced data, because they contain so much more complexity.</p>



<p>In this year’s write-up, I want to address this complexity of the brain from the perspective of self-organized systems, and I will try to point out lines of research that can, in my opinion, contribute to an understanding of these systems in the brain.</p>



<p><strong><em>Complex systems</em></strong></p>



<p>Two years ago, I have been writing about the limitation of the human mind to deal with the brain’s complexity, and the reasons behind this limitations (<a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/09/15/entanglement-of-temporal-and-spatial-scales-in-the-brain-but-not-in-the-mind/">Entanglement of temporal and spatial scales in the brain but not in the mind</a>). This year, I again have been thinking quite a bit about these issues. During summer, in the bookshelf of a friend, I noticed the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(novel)">Jurassic Park</a>, which my friend, to my surprise, recommended to me. The book, more so than the movie, tells the story of how a complex system – the Jurassic Park – cannot be controlled because of unexpected interactions within the system that were thought to be separated by design. This perspective is represented in the book by a smart-ass physicist who had worked on chaos theory. He not only predicts that all will be going downhill from the start, but also provides lengthy rants about the hubris of men who think they can control complexity.</p>



<p>This threw me back to the days when I studied physics myself, actually also with a focus on complex systems: non-linear dynamics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, chaos control and biophysics. So, with some years in neuroscience behind me, I went back to the theory of complex systems. I started to go through a very easy-to-read book on the topic by Melanie Mitchell: <a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/2/reviews/3.html">Complexity: A Guided Tour</a>. <a href="https://melaniemitchell.me/">Melanie Mitchell</a> is herself a researcher in complexity science. She did her PhD work with Douglas Hofstadter, famously known for his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>. Mitchell summarizes the history and ideas of her field in a refreshingly modest and self-critical way, which I can only recommend. As another bonus point, the book was published in 2009, just before deep learning emerged as a highly dominant idea – which also suppressed and overshadowed many other interesting lines of thought.</p>

<p>For example, Mitchell brings up John von Neumann’s idea of self-organization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a>, Douglas Hofstadter’s work, Alan Turing’s idea of self-organization in simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern">reaction-diffusion systems</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine">cybernetics</a> movement around Norbert Wiener, Hermann Haken’s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken)">Synergetics</a>, and Stephen Wolfram’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science">A New Kind of Science</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of these ideas about complex systems were intellectually inspiring, and certainly influenced many people; but at the same time they often did not really hold their promise and did not have a similar real-work impact outside of the philosophical realm, in contrast to for example the development of semiconductors or the backpropagation in neuronal networks. On one side, ideas around self-organization like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">Autopoiesis</a> concept invented by Montana and Varela were riddled with ill-defined concepts and often connected to ideas like “emergence”, “cognition” or “consciousness” in very vague ways. On the other side of the spectrum, many very influential researchers like Douglas Hofstadter or Stephen Wolfram had a very strong mathematical background and therefore were fascinated by beauty and simplicity rather than truely high-dimensional chaos. I think it’s fascinating to proof that a cellular automaton like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is Turing-complete (i.e., it is a universal computer), but wouldn’t a practical application of such an automaton be more convincing and useful than a theoretical proof?</p>



<p>It is therefore tempting for an experimentalist and natural scientist to simply trash the entire field as verbal acrobatics that will not help to understand complex systems like the brain. However, in the next section I’d like to make the point why I think the concept of self-organized systems should still be considered as potentially central when it comes to understanding the brain.</p>



<p><strong><em>Self-organized systems</em></strong></p>



<p>Over the last years, I have become more and more convinced that complex systems cannot be easily understood by simply describing their behavior. Even for very simple complex phenomena like the Lorenz equations, where the behavior of the system can be described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor">strange attractors</a>, this description can only provide a low-dimensional description which allows to predict the behavior of the system, but it does not tell much about the generative processes underlying the respective phenomena.</p>



<p>Low-dimensional descriptions of brain activity are one of the most active areas of current research in neuroscience. This can range from a description of brain dynamics in terms of oscillatory regimes, to default mode networks of the human brain, or more recently to attempts to break down the population activity of thousands of neurons into a low-dimensional manifold. These are beautiful  descriptions of neuronal activities, and it is certainly useful to study the brain with these approaches. But does it provide us with a real understanding? From one perspective, one could say that such a condensed description (if it exists, which is not yet clear) would be a form of deep understanding, since any way to compress a description is some sort of understanding. But I think there should be a deeper way of understanding that focuses on the underlying generative processes.</p>



<p>Imagine you want to understand artificial neural networks (deep networks). One way would be to investigate information flows and how representations of the input evolve across different layers and become less similar to the input and more similar to the respective target label. This is an operative and valuable way to understand of what is going on. In my opinion, it would however allow for a deeper understanding to simply bring up the very organizing principles which underlie the generation of the network: back-propagation of errors during learning, the definition of the loss function and the deep feed-forward network architecture.</p>



<p>Similarly, I think it would be equally more interesting in neuroscience to understand the generative and organizing principles which underlie the final structure of the brain, instead of studying the representations of information in neuronal activity. It is clear that a part of the organization of the brain is encoded in the genome, for example as guidance cues for axonal growth or as the program of sequential migration of cell types, and in addition also the coarse specific connectivity across different cell types. However, the more flexible, and possibly also more interesting part, is probably not organized by an external designer (like a deep network) and also not directly organized by the genome. In the absence of an external designing instance, there must be self-organization at work.</p>



<p>Once we accept that this part of the generative principles underlying the brain structure and function is self-organization, it becomes immediately clear that it might be useful to get inspired by complexity science and the study of self-organized systems. This connection between neuroscience is probably evident to anybody working on complex systems, but I have the impression that this perspective is sometimes lost by systems neuroscience and in particular experimental neuroscience.</p>



<p><strong><em>Self-organizing principles of neuronal networks: properties of single neurons</em></strong></p>



<p>I believe that the most relevant building blocks of self-organization in the brain are single neurons (and not molecules, synapses or brain areas). A year ago, I have argued why I think this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective (<a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">Annual report of my intuition about the brain (2019)</a>), and I argued why would be interesting to understand the objective function of a single cell: so-to-speak the single-cell specific generative principle that underlies the self-organization of biological neuronal networks.</p>



<p>Realistically speaking, this is too abstract a way of exploring biological neurons. What would be a less condensed way to describe the self-organizing principles underlying single neurons that are analogous to back-propagation and loss functions for deep networks? I would tend to mention main ingredients: First, the principles that determine the integration of inputs in a single neuron. Second, the principles that determine the way that neurons connect and modify their mutual connections – which is basically nothing but plasticity rules between neurons. I am convinced that the integrative properties of neurons and the plasticity rules of a neuron when interacting with other cells are the main ingredients that are together the self-organizing principles of neuronal networks.</p>



<p>This is a somewhat underwhelming conclusion, because both plasticity rules and integrative properties of neurons have been studied very intensely since the 1990s. The detour of this blog post about self-organization basically reframes what a certain branch of neuroscience has been studying anyway. However, in addition it makes – in my opinion – also clear why the study of population dynamics and low-dimensional descriptions of neuronal activity aims at a different level of understanding. And it makes the point that the deepest understanding of biosimilar networks can probably be achieved by studying the aspects of self-organizing agents, plasticity rules and single-cell integrative properties, and not by studying the pure behavior of animals or neuronal networks.</p>



<p><strong><em>Studying self-organized neuronal networks and plasticity rules</em></strong></p>



<p>So, how can we study these principles of self-organized agents? Unfortunately, the last 30 years have made it quite clear that there is not simply a single universal plasticity rule. Typical plasticity rules (spike-time dependent plasticity; fire-together-wire-together; NMDA-dependent potentiation) usually explain only a small fraction of the variance in the experimental data and can often be only studied in very specific experimental conditions, and in most cases only in slice work. Usually, the conditions of the experiment (number of presynaptic action potentials to induce plasticity, spike frequency, etc.) are tuned to achieve strong effects, and absence of effects in other conditions are not systematically studied and often go unreported. In addition, plasticity rules <em>in vivo</em> seem to be somewhat different. Neuromodulation and other state-dependent influences might affect plasticity rules in ways that make them almost impossible to study systematically. In addition, it is very likely that there is not a single plasticity rule that governs the same behavior across all all neurons, since diversity of properties has been shown in simulations to provide robustness to neuronal circuits at many different levels. And evolution has would be a fool not to make use of this property that is so easy to achieve – evolution does not care about being hard to reverse engineer. This however makes it merely impossible (although still very valuable!) to dissect these principles systematically in experiments.</p>



<p>That is why I think that simulations – not experiments – could be the best starting point for understanding these self-organized networks.</p>



<p>There is indeed a large body of work going into this direction. If you google for “self-organizing neuronal networks”, you will find a huge literature which goes back to the 60s and is often based on very simplistic models of neurons (still heavily inspired by condensed matter physics), but there are also some interesting more recent papers that directly combine modern plasticity rules with the idea of self-organization (e.g. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.10.023.2009/full">Lazar et al., 2009</a>). And there are not few computational labs that study plasticity rules and their effect on the organization of neuronal networks, which is also some kind of self-organization, e.g. the labs of <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=m0v2CxEAAAAJ">Henning Sprekeler</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=jy5yBV4AAAAJ">Claudia Clopath</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=RsHPZroAAAAJ">Tim Vogels</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?hl=en&amp;user=_IxvO8QAAAAJ">Friedemann Zenke</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2HXsblgAAAAJ">Richard Naud</a>, all of them influenced by <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=dqBH37QAAAAJ">Wulfram Gerstner</a>; or  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ">Sophie Deneuve</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-4z7V1oAAAAJ">Christian Machens</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2WpvdH0AAAAJ">Wolfgang Maass</a> – to name just few out of many people who work on this topic. I think this is one of the most interesting fields of theoretical neuroscience. However, I would be personally very satisfied to see this field shift towards a better inclusion of the self-organizing perspective.</p>



<p>To give a random example, in a study from this year, Naumann and Sprekeler show how specific non-linear properties of neurons can mitigate a well-known problem associated with purely Hebbian plasticity rules (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/12/2020.02.11.944082">Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitationin the face of plasticity, 2020</a>). They basically take an experimental finding that has been made quite some time ago (pre-synaptic inhibition of the axonal boutons via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors) and builds a model that explains how this could make sense in the light of plasticity rules. This is a very valuable way of doing research, also because it takes biological details of neurons into account and gives the experimentalists a potential context and explanation of their findings. However, this approach seems to be the perspective of a designer or engineer, rather than the approach of somebody who aims at an understanding of a self-organized system. What would be an alternative approach?</p>



<p><strong><em>From engineered organization to self-organization</em></strong>  </p>



<p>I think it would be useful to take the perspective of a neuron, and in addition also an evolutionary perspective. Let’s say, a neuron with certain properties (rules on when and how to connect) joins the large pool of a recurrent network. The question which must be solved by the neuron is: How do I learn how to behave meaningfully?</p>



<p>I’d like to give an analogy on how I think this neuron should ideally behave: A human person that interacts with others in a social network, be it in real life or in the virtual world, must adjust their actions according to how they are received. Shouting loud all the time will isolate them, because they are blocking the receiving channels of others, and being silent all the time will let others equally drop the connections. To adjust the level of output and to adjust the appropriate content that will be well-received, it is crucial to listen to feedback.</p>



<p>This is what I think could be the central question from this self-organized perspective of neuronal circuits: How does the neuron get feedback on its own actions? And with feedback, I do not mean global error signals about the behavior of the organism via neuromodulation channels, but  feedback on the neuron’s action potentials and its other actions. Where does this feedback come from?</p>



<p>If we reduce the complex network to a single cell, we can immediately see the answer to this question, the feedback comes from the external world. A spike of this “neuron” has a direct impact on the world, and the world in return acts back upon the “neuron”. It is not clear how this scales up to larger networks, but I think that this inclusion of the external world, as opposed to a machine learning-style input-output task, could be the most important ingredient that makes the step from engineered network organizations to self-organized networks.</p>



<p>(There are many loose connections from here to reinforcement learning using learning agents and also to predictive processing, but let’s not go into that here.)</p>



<p><strong><em>Conclusion and summary</em></strong></p>



<p>The conclusions of this write-up might sound trivial from some perspective; and again others might say that these ideas will not lead anywhere, similar to many previous suggestions in the field of complex self-organized systems.</p>



<p>I’m glad to become convinced otherwise, but today I think that a very promising way to achieve a deep understanding of the brain could consist of the following ingredients, as motivated above:</p>



<p>1) To regard the brain as a at least partially self-organized network,</p>



<p>2) To use simulations together with evolutionary algorithms to explore the generative / self-organizing principles,</p>



<p>3) To consider properties and actions on the level of single neurons as the main parameters that can be modified during this evolutionary process and</p>



<p>4) To include an external world to transition from an externally organized to a self-organized system.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2021/01/01/2021-projects-8-podcasts/">2021 projects, #8: podcasts</a></h4>

<p>Podcasts have been growing quickly in numbers during the last years, and I didn’t really clue in to that until I re-joined LinkedIn in the middle of the year for other work purposes – and suddenly, it seemed whoever I checked and followed had a podcast. Or had just started a podcast – it is apparently the Professional Thing To Do in the 2020’s.</p>



<p>Currently, my life mostly lacks quiet time to sit down (or go for walks) and listen to podcasts, so I have been amassing an ever-growing long list of interesting, possible podcasts to listen to; it is very low effort to follow more podcasts now that they are available on Spotify.</p>



<p>I used to listen to a lot of podcasts some years ago, when the kids were still small enough to need daily long walks in a stroller. It was mainly <a href="https://escapepod.org/about-us/">EscapePod</a> and a few different Swedish Radio pods, and a very nice podcast with some of my favourite authors chatting about different things, the <a data-id="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/" data-type="URL" href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/sf-squeecast-elizabeth-bear-paul-cornell-ruFYCBDg8Gi/">SFSqueecast</a>,  but it ended long ago.</p>



<p>So, my project for 2021 is: take the looong list of podcasts I currently subscribe to, and trial them to see which ones are worth keeping long term.  I have one nominee for the list already, the <a href="https://www.orion-openscience.eu/publications/training-materials/201902/podcasts">ORION Open Science podcast</a>.</p>

<p><em>Science News</em> drew over 22 million visitors to our website this year. Our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">COVID-19 coverage</a> was most popular. Here’s a recap of the other most-read news stories and long reads of 2020.</p>



<h4>Top news stories</h4>



<p><strong>1. In a first, a person’s immune system fought HIV — and won</strong></p>



<p>Scientists analyzed billions of cells from two people with HIV who don’t require medication to keep the virus under control. What the team found was astonishing: One person had no working copies of HIV in any of the cells, while the other person had just one working copy. What’s more, that one copy was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-immune-system-elite-controllers">imprisoned in tightly wound DNA.</a></p>





<p><strong>2. The first room-temperature superconductor has finally been found</strong></p>



<p>Up to 15° Celsius, a material made of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen can conduct electricity without resistance. While the room-temperature superconductor works only at high pressures, the discovery brings scientists a step closer to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">realizing a more energy-efficient future</a>.</p>



<p><strong>3. Astronomers have found the edge of the Milky Way at last</strong></p>



<p>Computer simulations and observations of nearby galaxies have revealed that the Milky Way stretches 1.9 million light-years across. The measurement could help tease out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-found-edge-milky-way-size">how massive the galaxy is and exactly how many galaxies orbit it</a>.</p>



<p><strong>4. More ‘murder hornets’ are turning up. Here’s what you need to know</strong></p>



<p>An invasion of Asian giant hornets into North America could spell trouble for honeybees. But the threat that the world’s largest hornet species <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada">poses to people is minimal</a>.</p>



<p><strong>5. A star orbiting the Milky Way’s black hole validates Einstein</strong></p>



<p>The odd orbit of a star around the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way’s center confirms Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Rather than tracing out a single ellipse, the star’s orbit rotates over time — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-orbiting-milky-way-giant-black-hole-confirms-einstein-was-right">the result of the black hole warping spacetime</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. New fleets of private satellites are clogging the night sky</strong></p>



<p>SpaceX and other private companies are planning to launch thousands of internet satellites into orbit around Earth. Hundreds of the satellites already in outer space are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3094583">obstructing the view of ground-based telescopes and interfering with astronomers’ research</a>.</p>



<p><strong>3. It’s time to stop debating how to teach kids to read and follow the evidence</strong></p>

Those findings could help resolve <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balanced-literacy-phonics-teaching-reading-evidence">a long-standing debate that pits phonics against methods that emphasize understanding the meaning of words</a>.</p>



<p><strong>4. To fight discrimination, the U.S. census needs a different race question</strong></p>



<p>The U.S. census has failed to accurately count certain minority groups. As a result, some sociologists are calling for more nuanced census questions that better reflect how respondents view themselves, as well as how society views them — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/census-2020-race-ethnicity-questions">a clearer metric for measuring discrimination</a>.</p>



<p><strong>5. What lifestyle changes will shrink your carbon footprint the most?</strong></p>



<p>Individual actions around shelter, transportation and food can create ripple effects in society to help mitigate the effects of climate change. But to have the most impact, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-actions-reduce-carbon-footprint">people need to tailor their efforts to their own circumstances</a>.</p>





<h4>Pandemic post</h4>



<p><em>Science News</em> has reported on the COVID-19 pandemic since it began, but none of those stories were included in our most-read lists of 2020. That’s because we think the coverage is in a league of its own.</p>



<p>Stories about when, during an infection, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">the coronavirus is most contagious</a> and debunking the claim that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature">virus was made in a lab</a> are among our most-read stories of all time. Readers also were drawn to stories about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">how the coronavirus spreads</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety">C­OVID-19 v­accines</a>.</p>



<p>As Feedback editor, I review every e-mail we receive from <em>Science News</em> readers. In 2020, more than a third of the thousands of e-mails that filled our inbox were about COVID-19. Hunger for information, for certainty in an uncertain time, has been insatiable.</p>



<p>We’ve strived to answer readers’ pandemic-related questions accurately, given the rapid pace of scientific research into the coronavirus and its effects. Some of those questions have been featured in the pages of this magazine, as well as in the <em>Science News </em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/special-newsletter">Coronavirus Update newsletter </a>— a weekly e-mail that highlights the l­atest research, data and articles on the c­oronavirus and COVID-19.</p>



<p>Everyone at <em>Science News</em> thanks you, our readers, for your sharp, insightful comments and your continued support. We look forward to answering your many science questions, coronavirus-related and not, in the year ahead. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://malinsandstrom.blog/2020/12/31/2021-projects-7-books/">2021 projects, #7: books</a></h4>

<p>I own a lot of books. Nowadays, I mostly buy Kindle books, since the bookshelves had to go when we got twins. I now own about 700 books on Kindle, of which 400+ are read at least once. This is the result of one single Twitter account (mostly), <a href="https://twitter.com/sfsignal">@SFSignal</a>, that tweets sales of SF and other fantastic fiction, under the tag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sff_eBookDeal?src=hashtag_click">sff_eBookDeal</a>. Some of the books go for as low as $1-$2, and that’s where the majority of my digital library comes from.</p>



<p>I also own a lot of actual, physical SFF books. Nearly all paperbacks. We used to have a high shelf for my books along the walls of our entry hall, but when we switched apartments a few years back, that had to go. It swallowed at least 150 books, that now lying in boxes in the cellar storage.</p>



<p>When we started the Matmolekyler project, we started out with buying useful books. I have a bunch of those in my bookshelves (including some I got myself, or as gifts: several books by HaroldMcGee, two priced *signed* books by Gordon Shepherd). Since then, I try to buy food-science-related books when I find them at reaonable prices. That collection is now about 50 books.</p>



<p>I also went through a period where I was thinking a lot about food and cooking history, so I tried to find some of the earlier real cookbooks (and school household training books) from the early 1900s. There are typically cheap and abundant at used book stores, so by now I have quite a few. Including one I got at a museum, which is a copy of a 1800s cookbook along with a companion book written by a historian). And a set of two old ~1800s household encyclopedias in a new edition from a Swedish agricultural society (I had to order them special and pick them up in person). Let’s say, another 40 or so books.</p>



<p>For 2021, I hope to rearrange all of our (mine, really) bookshelves so that I have more SFF books accessible (since I want to re-read them anyway). I hope to inventory and index all books, and maybe even get rid of some. I need to find some good book inventory software – I have Goodreads but haven’t really used it for sorting books yet.</p>

<p>My kids wanted to join the Scouts, so we put them in the queue for our local Scoutkår, Adolf Fredriks. Kids whose parents agree to help with (co)leading get boosted higher in the queue, and I do have earlier experience, so I indicated my willingness to help. And then we waited.</p>



<p>Not for long, it took maybe a month or so. No regular meetings were held, but we tried to meet up on Zoom each week (and if you have ever wondered why Zoom etiquette is needed, try meeting with a group of eight-year-olds and try to get them to follow a program).</p>



<p>There have been no outside activities yet, but that is our likely next step, so we have gone over what outdoor equipment we have and what we need. Black Friday let us buy two good sleeping bags for a good price. The kids’ great-grandmother gave them each a good outdoor backpack. I found myself hiking boots, outdoor trousers and a decent size backpack (~50 l ) on sales. Rainjackets, -trousers and boots/waterproof shoes we already have, because of Stockholm winters. We also got two pairs of skates and helmets for the kids, because one of the possible future activities is the skating ice frozen in the nearby Vasaparken, arranged every winter season by the local authorities.</p>



<p>So for the next year at least, I will be the co-leader of a troop of 8-year-old scouts (who will turn 9 during the year).  I have so many ideas for fun stuff to do, based on my own years in the Mjölby scoutkår at home.</p>

Like everyone else, it seems, we here at Retraction Watch are more than ready to put 2020 to bed. It was a bittersweet year to celebrate our tenth anniversary and reflect on what we’ve learned. But the work never stops, so as we’ve done every year since 2010, we’ll take a look at the most … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/31/a-look-back-at-retraction-news-in-2020-and-ahead-to-2021/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A look back at retraction news in 2020 — and ahead to 2021</span></a>

<p>The CMX holiday letter states: “<em> I just reviewed the data with the research team and one thing is crystal clear: community has become an irreplaceable part of business. In a year where a lot of businesses struggled, and there were many layoffs, community teams actually grew. And companies of all sizes, in all industries, are going to be investing in community in a big way next year</em>.”</p>



<p>I have a standing alert for community-related position ads on LinkedIn, and see clearly a parallell increase in community positions offered in science &amp; academia.  Where ads earlier have been implicit about the community aspects, hiding it under terms such as ‘field knowledge’, nearly everyone knows and admits to some degree that in academia, it is impossible to succeed without community support. It is built into the system that your peers will (hopefully) acknowledge you and lift your work up – this mechanism is seen in such academic pillars as peer review, recommendation letters, and hiring committees, to name some examples.</p>



<p>Since I did my AAAS Community Fellowship in 2017, a training program that ran twice and which has now transformed into an independent organisation called CSCCE, <a href="https://www.cscce.org/">Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement</a> , I have been an active member in the community that surrounds CSCCE. We have a lot of interesting activites and projects around community management – interest groups (I’m in the Open Science SIG and lurking in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion SIG), projects (I’m in one we started in 2017, aiming to describe and pin down community manager skillsets), and Working Groups (I’m in the Community Champions WG).</p>



<p>The theme for the <a href="https://cmxhub.com/announcing-this-years-community-manager-advancement-day-theme-resilience">2021 Community Manager Advancement Day</a>, which takes place on January 25, is resilience. A very fitting theme, after this Covid year. Resilience of self, when the world stops around you; resilience of communities to chaos and changes; resilience of organizations and society – where community has a huge part.</p>

<p>I have always sought out situations where I think I could  learn something interesting. 2021 will not be different. Many of the tings I have learned over the past decade are by Brownian motion and absorption  – spend enough time in a community, you will pick up their interests. So I thought it would be a nice thing to learn something in a more structured fashion.</p>



<p>If there is one thing – something <em>not</em> Covid – which has popped up repeatedly in the space around me this year, it is AI and machine learning. Many papers with new neuro tools using deep learning and other ML approaches. That fantastic protein folding study. The Semantic Scholar search enginge’s new amazing TLDR:s of papers. And I attended a very interesting webinar on the possible applications of AI in music (I think it was a <a href="http://stockholm.ai/about/">Stockholm AI</a> event, but their event calendar is bugging out on me currently, so I can’t verify).</p>



<p>What entices me is the amazing creativity I see in many approaches – there are obviously a wide range of AI applications that I had not been able to imagine. </p>



<p>So I have signed up for two courses, one translated into Swedish – mostly to pick up the Swedish terms if they even exist yet, also because the translation is fantastic – and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone">one in English from Coursera</a>.</p>



<p>My 2020 project was to learn Python. Since I effectively started it in September, I haven’t come that far yet (I am at the NumPy stage), so this will be a continuing project in 2021. Also, I was gifted my friend Benjamin Auffart’s new book on ML in Python, the <em><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FArtificial-Intelligence-Python-Cookbook-next-generation%2Fdp%2F1789133963%3F%26linkCode%3Dwey%26tag%3Dbenman1-21&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0ZSTs0sOY9ztyF5csoepmuE1rgQ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence in Python Cookbook</a></em>, so I have resources to make this another branch of the AI learning project.</p>

<p>I have knit a ton of things over the last 15 or so years, but I have never tested someone else’s pattern, yet benefited from others testing patterns I then bought and used. This is sort of the knitting world’s equivalent to peer review – you invest your input in the system and it pays back to you (eventyally and indirectly).</p>



<p>I decided to start off easy, so when my friend Helena (who designs and knits <a data-id="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/helena-fredenbergs-ravelry-store/patterns" data-type="URL" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/helena-fredenbergs-ravelry-store/patterns">awesome and pretty complex sweaters</a> and hats) sent out a call for testers of a new cardigan, the Gunhild cardigan, I hopped on. In thick, wooly Alafoss Lopi – a much quicker knit than what she usually designs, and much esier as a starting point.</p>



<p>The test knit came out beutifully – exactly the right number of rows and stiches measured over 10 x 10 cm (the standard way; each pattern has/should have this info). But it required cable needles, and despite more than a decade of hoarding needles, I didn’t have enough of that kind in that precise size.</p>



<p>Ordering stuff online just before Christmas is no fun, but I found a new-to-me Swedish company that had the right needles and order the most expedited freight option. Then an excruciating week of waiting, before they finally arrived late last night. Which puts this project sqarely into 2021!</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-science-superlatives-oldest-highest-grossest-discoveries">2020’s science superlatives include the oldest, highest and grossest discoveries</a></h4>

<p>From the biggest merger of black holes to the world’s oldest string — fashioned by Neandertals, no less — discoveries in 2020 set new records that amazed and inspired.</p>



<h4>Highest-temperature superconductor</h4>



<p>After more than a century’s wait, scientists have found the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">first superconductor that works near room temperature</a>. Superconducting up to about 15° Celsius (59° Fahrenheit), it’s made by squeezing carbon, hydrogen and sulfur between two diamonds and zapping the compound with a laser (<em>SN: 10/14/20</em>). The new material allows current to flow without any energy loss, but only at high pressures, which means practical applications are still a distant vision.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="a material being squeezed between the tips of two diamonds" class="wp-image-3094774" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_superlative_inline_superconductor.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094774">To make the first superconductor that works near room temperature, physicists squeezed to high pressure a material between the tips of two diamonds. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094774">Adam Fenster</span></figure>



<h4>Oldest, biggest Maya monument</h4>



<p>Underneath a previously unexplored site in Mexico called Aguada Fénix, archaeologists uncovered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico">an enormous raised ceremonial structure</a> (<em>SN: 6/3/20</em>). Built about 3,000 years ago and featuring a 1,400-meter-long rectangular plateau with a platform longer than four American football fields, the discovery shows that the Maya civilization built big from its beginnings.</p>

<h4>Best evidence for anyons</h4>



<p>Theoretical physicists have long predicted the existence of anyons, a type of bizarre quasiparticle resulting from the movements of electrons that together behave as a particle. In a mind-twisting discovery, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-braided-quasi-particles-anyons">physicists braided anyons</a>, which exist only in two dimensions, by looping them around one another within complex layers of materials (<em>SN: 7/9/20</em>). The resulting disturbances observed in the 2-D sheets of material suggest that the quasiparticles are real.</p>





<h4>Earliest modern bird</h4>



<p>The nearly 67-million-year-old fossilized “Wonderchicken” (also known as <em>Asteriornis maastrichtensis</em>) is the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wonderchicken-fossil-earliest-known-modern-bird">oldest modern bird</a> ever found, meaning that its descendants survived the asteroid impact that wiped out nonavian dinosaurs and led to the birds we see today (<em>SN: 3/18/20</em>). Wonderchicken did indeed look something like a chicken, if it were crossed with a duck and shrunk to the size of a quail.</p>



<h4>Grossest discovery</h4>



<p>For the first time, researchers observed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snake-kills-toad-rips-stomach-organs">a snake gnawing a hole in a toad’s belly</a>, slithering inside and gorging on the innards — all while the toad was alive (<em>SN: 10/2/20</em>). The snake may have been avoiding poison that the toad releases from its neck and back, or finding a way to eat a meal too big to swallow whole.</p>

Bringsøe et al/Herpetozoa 2020</span></figure>



<h4>Oldest string</h4>



<p>Not only was this scrap of cord handmade more than 40,000 years ago, but the hands that made it belonged to Neandertals, close human relatives who don’t often get props for creativity. The string, made from bark fibers, was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-made-oldest-known-string">found clinging to an ancient tool</a> discovered in France (<em>SN:4/9/20</em>).</p>



<h4>Biggest black hole merger</h4>



<p>A detection of gravitational waves from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">two colliding black holes led to a bevy of records</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). It’s the first definitive evidence that midsize black holes — those with a mass between 100 and 100,000 times that of the sun — exist. The resulting merger is the most massive spotted so far using gravitational waves, as well as the farthest (17 billion light-years from Earth) and the most energetic: It radiated the equivalent in energy of about eight times the sun’s mass.</p>

<h4>Record-breaking animals</h4>



<p>This year saw several record-breaking animal achievements, from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-american-mouse-world-highest-dwelling-mammal">highest-living mammal</a> — a yellow-rumped leaf-eared mouse found 6,739 meters above sea level in South America (<em>SN: 7/29/20</em>) — to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cuviers-beaked-whale-longest-record-dive">longest dive by a marine mammal</a>, a nearly four-hour plunge by a Cuvier’s beaked whale (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). There was also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hummingbirds-black-metaltail-cold-torpor">the coldest bird</a>, the black metaltail hummingbird, which chills to about 3° Celsius (37° Fahrenheit) overnight to conserve energy (<em>SN: 9/8/20</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Researchers captured a yellow-rumped leaf-eared mouse (<em>Phyllotis xanthopygus rupestris</em>) at a record altitude of 6,739 meters, or 22,100 feet, above sea level. Jay Storz, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, and mountaineer Mario Pérez Mamani discovered the animal at the summit of Volcán Llullaillaco, a dormant volcano on the border of Chile and Argentina.</figure>

<p>There is an international movement, started in the UK and calling themselves <a href="https://veganuary.com/">Veganuary</a>, who aim to inspire people to go vegan for a month, on a try. Internationally, it is big, with more than a million people in total signed up since 2014. In Sweden, it is probably still more of a fringe movement – but still involving tens of thousands of people –  supported by Djurens Rätt.</p>



<p>I have signed up for the international version. I already have a general ongoing ‘project’ to eat more vegetables, both in larger amounts and more varieties, so this should fit right in. I am mostly doing this for climate reasons, so expensive imported-by-flight ingredients are out. </p>



<p>I’ll be doing this in conjunction with needing to cook for and feed two kids, aged 8, omnivores. Wish me luck.</p>

<p><em>A message to the community from Dr. John Ngai, Director of the NIH BRAIN Initiative.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2932"></span></p>
<p>Dear BRAIN Community,</p>
<p>I am pleased to inform you that the recently authorized <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf">Omnibus</a> Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2021 provides $42.9 billion for NIH, an increase of $1.25 billion (or 1.5%) above fiscal year 2020. <strong>This appropriation includes $560 million for the NIH BRAIN Initiative</strong>, a $60 million increase over last year’s $500 million appropriation. We are deeply grateful for Congress’s strong and continuing support of our mission.</p>
<p>The spending bill includes $404 million of appropriated funds authorized in the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/cures">21st Century Cures Act</a>. The Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, allocates funding to NIH each year through 2026, for a total of $4.8 billion across all projects described in the Act. The BRAIN Initiative was one of four highly innovative scientific initiatives designated to receive multi-year funding through the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research-training/initiatives/nih-cures-innovation-plan.pdf">Innovation Fund of the Cures Act</a>, reflecting enthusiasm for the Initiative and its goals. This funding must be appropriated each year by Congress.</p>
<p>The $560 million appropriation for the NIH BRAIN Initiative includes $100 million in Cures Act funds. This legislation reflects strong bipartisan Congressional support for biomedical research, and will provide NIH with the resources needed to continue to work towards the goals in BRAIN’s strategic plan, which was initially outlined by the <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/brain2025_508c.pdf"><em>BRAIN 2025 report</em></a> and recently updated and enhanced through the BRAIN 2.0 <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdf">neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/bns_roadmap_11_october_2019_sent_to_acd_for_oct_2019_revised_10282019_508c.pdf">neuroethics</a> reports. Importantly, this generous allocation for 2021 will accelerate the launch of two transformative projects outlined in those reports that “stand out in for their importance to human health and technical viability,” specifically: $40 million for the Human Brain Cell Atlas and $20 million for the Armamentarium for Brain Cell Access. Collectively, this funding will help accelerate BRAIN’s mission to develop and apply innovative tools and neurotechnologies, as well as to support researchers as they seek new ways to treat, cure, and ultimately prevent brain disorders.</p>
<p>In addition to the increased funds for the BRAIN Initiative, the Omnibus Bill:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides $1.25 billion, available until September 2024, to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally;</li>
<li>increases funding by $300 million, to a total of $3.12 billion in fiscal year 2021, for <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Disorders/Alzheimers-Related-Dementias">Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias research</a>;</li>
<li>includes no less than $270 million for the <a href="https://heal.nih.gov/">HEAL Initiative</a> targeted at opioid misuse and addiction, and expands the uses of these funds to include research related to stimulant misuse and addiction;</li>
<li>directs NIH to require its grantees to notify it when key personnel are removed for concerns of harassment, an essential step toward addressing the findings of the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/sexual-harassment-in-academia">2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on sexual harassment in academia</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

</ul>
<p>The spending bill will fund the government until the end of the current fiscal year on September 30, 2021.</p>
<p>With gratitude and best wishes for a healthy and prosperous new year,</p>

<p>The year will not be remembered as a good one for human health. But some notable bright spots did shine through.</p>



<h4>Ebola outbreak ends</h4>



<p>The second biggest Ebola outbreak in history is officially over. Beginning in 2018, the virus surged in eastern Congo, infecting 3,470 people and killing about two-thirds of them (<em>SN Online: 6/25/20</em>). The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/congo-second-worst-ebola-outbreak-ever-officially-over">outbreak was declared done in June</a> thanks to an aggressive public health response involving testing, isolating sick people and contact tracing — the same measures that could slow COVID-19’s spread.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="man receives an Ebola vaccine" class="wp-image-3094594" height="408" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_health_inline-ebola.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094594">A man receives an Ebola vaccine in Bosolo village, Congo.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094594">L. Mackenzie/WHO</span></figure>



<p>A vaccine, delivered to more than 300,000 people during the outbreak, and experimental drugs also helped. On October 14, one antibody-based treatment, Inmazeb, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ebola-virus-first-treatment-fda-approval-antibodies">became the first Ebola drug approved</a> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<em>SN Online: 10/15/20</em>). With that approval, U.S. supplies of the drug may become more readily available for Ebola patients. (The drug’s maker, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is a major donor to the Society for Science &amp; the Public, which publishes <em>Science News</em>.)</p>



<h4>HIV’s elite controllers</h4>



<p>Most people with HIV take antiretro­viral drugs to keep the virus in check. But in one rare person, the immune system seems to have wiped out the virus all on its own. Among over 1.5 billion blood cells taken from this once-infected person, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-immune-system-elite-controllers">not a single working copy of HIV turned up</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/20, p. 6</em>). In another patient, researchers found only one functional copy of HIV in more than a billion blood cells. Learning how these people, part of a select group called elite controllers, fought off HIV may lead to better treatments for others.</p>

<h4>Peanut allergy protection</h4>



<p>In January, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-first-drug-peanut-allergies">FDA approved the first drug for curbing peanut allergies</a> in children and teens (<em>SN: 2/29/20, p. 16</em>). Called Palforzia, the drug contains peanut proteins and is given in escalating amounts, so the body gradually learns that these proteins aren’t dangerous. The drug doesn’t go as far as eliminating peanut allergies, but it can help people tolerate an accidental peanut encounter. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-spacex-crew-launch-mars-satellites-2020">Here are the highlights from a busy year in space launches</a></h4>

<p>So many things launched into space this year: Six humans traveled aboard commercial crew vehicles, three spacecraft began journeys to Mars and several hundred distractingly shiny satellites took to the sky.</p>



<h4>Commercial crew</h4>



<p>On May 30, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spacex-nasa-astronaut-launch-milestone-commercial-spaceflight">SpaceX ferried a pair of astronauts</a> to the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral, Fla. It was the first human launch on a commercial spacecraft and the first time astronauts flew from a U.S. launchpad since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 (<em>SN: 6/20/20, p. 16</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="SpaceX rocket launch" class="wp-image-3094587" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_space_spaceX-launch.jpg" width="1440" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094587">SpaceX launched a four-person crew from U.S. soil on November 15.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094587">Official SpaceX Photos/Flickr (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">CC BY-NC 2.0</a>)</span></figure>



<p>As part of its Commercial Crew Program, NASA funded private spaceflight companies, including SpaceX and Boeing, to develop ways to carry astronauts to and from the space station so the agency would no longer have to rely on the Russian Soyuz craft.</p>



<p>When the astronauts returned safely to Earth on August 2, the test of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft was deemed a success. The next flight, which launched November 15, took four astronauts. “I think you can say we’re really no longer dependent on the Soyuz,” says astrophysicist and space historian Jonathan McDowell of Harvard &amp; Smithsonian’s Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>

<h4>Journey to Mars</h4>



<p>Three spacecraft that left for Mars in July are due to arrive in February 2021. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">Perseverance rover</a>, NASA’s fifth Martian rover (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 30</em>), will search a dry river delta for signs of ancient life and collect rock samples that a future mission will bring to Earth.</p>



<p>China and the United Arab Emirates hope this year’s missions will mark their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mission-mars-launch">first successful voyages to the Red Planet</a> (<em>SN Online: 7/30/20</em>). After entering Mars’ orbit, China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft is expected to drop a lander and rover onto the planet’s surface in April. China plans to bring samples back from Mars in the next decade, and Tianwen-1 is a tech demo for that mission. The rover will also look for hidden pockets of water beneath the surface and explore Mars’ geology and chemistry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="NASA’s Perseverance rover" class="wp-image-3094585" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_space_mars.jpg" width="1440" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094585">The United States, China and the United Arab Emirates all launched missions to Mars in July. NASA’s Perseverance rover (illustrated) will search for signs of ancient life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094585">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figure>



<p>The UAE space agency was founded only in 2014 and launched its first satellite in 2018, making a Mars mission an ambitious leap. The country’s Hope orbiter will gather evidence to address one of Mars’ biggest unsolved mysteries: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">How does Martian weather work</a> (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 24</em>)? By being the first spacecraft to orbit the planet’s equator, Hope will provide a new view of how Mars’ atmosphere changes daily, seasonally and at different altitudes.</p>



<h4>Mega-constellations</h4>





<p>SpaceX isn’t just sending astronauts into orbit. The company has launched hundreds of satellites as part of its Starlink project to bring high-speed internet around the globe. Other companies plan to launch similar “mega-constellations.” If all goes according to various companies’ plans, there will be about 100,000 satellites in low orbits.</p>



<p>“That’s a lot of satellites,” McDowell says. As of August 1, just 2,787 operational satellites doing all kinds of jobs orbited the Earth. Scientists fear that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starlink-spacex-satellites-amazon-oneweb-global-internet-astronomy">impending satellite surge could spoil the night sky</a> for astronomy by reflecting extra light down at earthly telescopes (<em>SN: 3/28/20, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>By mid-October, SpaceX had already launched more than 900 Starlink satellites. The company tested a dark coating meant to make the satellites less reflective, but that didn’t help enough. So now SpaceX is launching satellites with small visors to reduce reflectivity, which helps a bit, McDowell says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="internet satellites" class="wp-image-3094588" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_space_starlink.jpg" width="1440" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094588">SpaceX and other companies want to launch thousands of internet satellites (illustrated) into orbit. Astronomers worry those reflective objects will mar observations of the night sky.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094588">Nicolle Rager Fuller</span></figure>



<p>The good news is that astronomers and space companies are discussing the problem. At a meeting in the summer, scientists presented <a href="https://planet4589.org/jcm/pubs/space/papers/2020/SATCON1-Report.pdf">simulations of the worst-case scenarios</a>. The impact of these mega-constellations will depend on how many satellites actually launch, and what kind of astronomy you’re considering, McDowell says. Some of the worst effects will be on observations to detect near-Earth asteroids.</p>



<p>“We might miss the rock that’s coming to kill us all because the satellite streaks got in the way of calculating its orbit,” McDowell says.</p>



<p>One thing that would help is government regulations about the characteristics of satellites that can be launched, McDowell says. Companies are “making all the right noises about wanting to help,” he says, but noises and actions are not the same thing.</p>



<p>“I think with additional work and mitigations, we’ll get to a point where it isn’t fatal to ground-based astronomy, but it’s still a huge impact,” McDowell says. “We may not know the full consequences until we’re really in it.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">To say that 2020 was challenging is an understatement. A world laid low by a pandemic. Racial inequities laid bare through social protests. Regions laid waste in the wake of extreme natural disasters. Yet science often rose to tackle these challenges.</p>



<p>We started the year knowing next to nothing about the novel coronavirus. Huge <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-questions-2020">questions remain</a>, but thanks in part to extraordinary efforts to develop vaccines that appear effective, we enter 2021 with glimmers of hope.</p>



<p>Hope is also emerging from a gut-wrenching reckoning with racial inequities, sparked by police killings of unarmed Black men and women in the United States. Through #BlackInSTEM and similar social movements, scientists are using their voices to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-researchers-diversity-equity-science-stem">shine light on a lack of diversity</a> in their fields and to drive change.</p>



<p>It is harder to find any positive angles to 2020’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">record-breaking fires, hurricanes and extreme Arctic heat</a>. Yet science played a role here, too, helping us see the connections between our actions and our changing world.</p>





<p>In this year-end issue, we at <em>Science News</em> also felt the need to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-stories-sparked-joy-2020-space-life-physics">spark some joy</a> and spotlight the thrill of discovery, whether it’s finding the edge of the Milky Way or the fossil of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3094770">oldest known modern bird</a>, delightfully dubbed “Wonderchicken”. — <em>Macon Morehouse, News Director</em></p>

<p>In August, a massive wildfire tore through the San Lorenzo Valley north of Santa Cruz, Calif., destroying almost 1,500 structures and exposing many others to extreme heat. Before the fire was even out, lab tests revealed <a href="https://www.slvwd.com/sites/g/files/vyhlif1176/f/uploads/memo_update_on_lab_reports_9.11.2020_cb_approved_0.pdf">benzene levels</a> as high as 9.1 parts per billion in residential water samples — nine times higher than the state’s maximum safety level.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time the carcinogen has followed wildfires: California water managers <a href="https://awwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aws2.1183">found unsafe levels of benzene</a> and other volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, in Santa Rosa after the Tubbs Fire in 2017, and in Paradise after the Camp Fire in 2018.</p>



<p>Scientists suspected that, among other possibilities, plastic drinking water pipes exposed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/technology-natural-hazards-natech-disasters-lightning-wildfire">extreme heat released the chemicals</a> (<em>SN: 11/13/20</em>). Now, lab experiments show that’s possible.  </p>



<p>Andrew Whelton, an environmental engineer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and colleagues subjected commonly available pipes to temperatures from 200° Celsius to 400° C. Those temperatures, hot enough to damage but not destroy pipes, can occur as heat radiates from nearby flames, Whelton says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="burned plastic pipe and meter box" class="wp-image-3094871" height="400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/122120_ms_pvc-wildfires_inline_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094871">A plastic water pipe (left) and meter box (right) recovered from homes in Paradise, Calif., after the Camp Fire scorched the community in 2018 reveal the degree to which plastics can melt when exposed to high temperatures.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094871">Andrew Whelton/Purdue University (CC-BY-ND)</span></figure>



<p>When the researchers then submerged the pipes in water and cooled them, <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/EW/D0EW00836B#!divAbstract">varying amounts of benzene</a> and VOCs — more than 100 chemicals in some tests — leached from 10 of the 11 types of pipe into the water, the team reports December 14 in <em>Environmental Science: Water Research &amp; Technology</em>.</p>



<p>“Some contamination for the past fires likely originated from thermally damaged plastics,” says Whelton. It’s impossible to do experiments in the midst of a raging fire to pinpoint the exact source of the contamination, he says, but inspecting damaged pipes after the fact can suggest what temperatures they may have experienced.</p>



<p>Benzene exposure can cause immediate health problems, including skin and throat irritation, dizziness, and longer-term effects such as leukemia. The team suggests testing drinking water if fire comes anywhere near your property and, if possible, replacing any plastic in a home’s water system with heat-resistant metal. </p>

<p>Discoveries about the cosmos and ancient life on Earth tantalized scientists and the public in 2020. But these big claims require more evidence before they can earn a spot in science textbooks.</p>



<h4>Cloudy with a chance of life</h4>



<p>The scorching hellscape next door may be a place to look for life. Telescopes trained on Venus’ clouds spotted traces of phosphine in quantities that suggest <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">something must be actively producing the gas</a> (<em><em>SN: 9/14/20</em></em>). On Earth, phosphine is emitted by certain bacteria or industrial processes, leading some astrobiologists to speculate that microbes may be living in Venus’ relatively temperate upper atmosphere. But other research teams’ analyses suggest <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-phosphine-possible-sign-life-doubts-how-science-works">the phosphine detection was a misread</a> — perhaps the result of a fluke in data processing (<em><em>SN: 10/28/20</em></em>).</p>



<h4>Flashback</h4>



<p>For the first time, astronomers may have glimpsed a fast radio burst in the Milky Way. Even more intriguing, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">source of the super-bright boost of radio waves</a> appears to be a magnetar — a type of neutron star with an intense magnetic field (<em><em>SN: 6/4/20</em></em>). But it’s too soon to claim that magnetars caused any of the dozens of previously detected fast radio bursts, as those flashes came from galaxies too far away to trace the bursts back to a source.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="an illustration of a magnetar" class="wp-image-3094718" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_bigif_inline_MilkyWayFRB.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094718">A bright radio burst generated by a magnetar (one illustrated) in the Milky Way suggests that these highly magnetic neutron stars may be responsible for other fast radio bursts previously observed.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094718">L.

Researchers speculate that organisms living inside <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tube-dwelling-creatures-may-be-earliest-known-parasites">the tubes swiped food from their filter-feeding hosts</a> (<em><em>SN: 6/2/20</em></em>). That the tubes were never found alone or on other fossils in the outcropping suggests that the organisms could not survive on their own. But some critics question whether the relationship was truly parasitic, given that the tubed-up brachiopods didn’t seem any worse off than their tube-free counterparts.</p>

<h4>Found: ordinary matter</h4>



<p>Only about half of the universe’s expected amount of ordinary matter has ever been cataloged. But this year, astronomers claimed that the other half is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-missing-matter-found-fast-radio-bursts">hiding out in intergalactic space</a> (<em><em>SN: 5/27/20</em></em>). That conclusion is based on an analysis of how a small sample of fast radio bursts from other galaxies were distorted by particles on the way to Earth. Before the case of the missing matter can be closed, though, more of these bright blasts of radio waves need to be examined.</p>

<h4>Start your cosmic engines</h4>



<p>A ghostly subatomic particle may have been revved up by a star’s destructive encounter with a black hole. Sensed by the IceCube detector in Antarctica, the neutrino carried 200 trillion electron volts — about 30 times as much energy as that of a proton accelerated by the Large Hadron Collider. Scientists matched the neutrino detection to a flash of light in the sky caused by a black hole shredding a star. The probability of the neutrino and the flash coinciding by chance is just 0.2 percent. If the finding holds up, it would be only the second time a high-energy neutrino has been traced to its source, and the first direct evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-black-hole-high-energy-neutrino">shredding a star can accelerate neutrinos to high energies</a> (<em><em>SN: 5/26/20</em></em>).</p>

<h4>On the move</h4>



<p>The long-running debate over when humans first traveled to and from the Americas rages on. One group of researchers reported that people arrived to North America more than 15,000 years earlier than generally thought, based on the discovery of roughly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cave-mexico-stone-artifacts-humans-americas-early">33,000-year-old stone tools unearthed in Mexico</a> (<em><em>SN: 7/22/20</em></em>). Some archaeologists, however, doubt that the artifacts are even stone tools and say they instead are just naturally broken rocks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img alt="a photo of what might be an ancient stone tool" class="wp-image-3094721" height="579" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_bigif_stone-tool.jpg" width="1028" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094721">If confirmed as stone tools, this object and others unearthed in a cave in Mexico suggest humans arrived in North America by at least 33,000 years ago.  </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094721">Ciprian Ardelean</span></figure>



<p>Another research group reported that Indigenous South Americans crossed thousands of kilometers of open ocean and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-americans-may-have-traveled-polynesia-800-years-ago">reached eastern Polynesia more than 800 years ago</a>, not long after settlers from Asia initially colonized the islands (<em>SN:<em> 7/8/20</em></em>). That conclusion rests on genetic evidence suggesting the intrepid South Americans mated with ancient Polynesians. But some anthropologists question whether early South American groups had the equipment or seafaring skills necessary for the journey. Ancient Polynesians, who were expert navigators, may have traveled to South America, bringing new DNA with them on a return trip home.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-europa-landing-terrain-future-spacecraft">How future spacecraft might handle tricky landings on Venus or Europa</a></h4>

<p>The best way to know a world is to touch it. Scientists have observed the planets and moons in our solar system for centuries, and have flown spacecraft past the orbs for decades. But to really understand these worlds, researchers need to get their hands dirty — or at least a spacecraft’s landing pads.</p>



<p>Since the dawn of the space age, Mars and the moon have gotten almost all the lander love. Only a handful of spacecraft have landed on Venus, our other nearest neighbor world, and none have touched down on Europa, an icy moon of Jupiter thought to be one of the best places in the solar system to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-distant-moon">look for present-day life</a> (<em>SN: 5/2/14</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers are working to change that. In several talks at the virtual American Geophysical Union meeting that ran from December 1 to December 17, planetary scientists and engineers discussed new tricks that hypothetical future spacecraft may need to land on unfamiliar terrain on Venus and Europa. The missions are still in a design phase and are not on NASA’s launch schedule, but scientists want to be prepared.</p>







<h4>Navigating a Venusian gauntlet</h4>



<p>Venus is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">notoriously difficult world to visit</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>). Its searing temperatures and crushing atmospheric pressure have destroyed every spacecraft lucky enough to reach the surface within about two hours of arrival. The last landing was over 30 years ago, despite increasing confidence among planetary scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-once-possibly-habitable-study-suggests">that Venus’ surface was once habitable</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/16</em>). That possibility of past, and perhaps current, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-phosphine-possible-sign-life-doubts-how-science-works">life on Venus</a> is one reason scientists are anxious to get back (<em>SN: 10/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>In one of the proposed plans discussed at the AGU meeting, scientists have ridged, folded mountainous terrain on Venus called tessera in their sights. “Safely landing in tessera terrain is absolutely necessary to satisfy our science objectives,” said planetary scientist Joshua Knicely of the University of Alaska Fairbanks in a talk recorded for the meeting. “We have to do it.”</p>



<p>Knicely is part of a study led by geologist Martha Gilmore of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., to <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/reports/Venus-Flagship-Mission_FINAL.pdf">design a hypothetical mission to Venus</a> that could launch in the 2030s. The mission would include three orbiters, an aerobot to float in the clouds and a lander that could drill and analyze samples of tessera rocks. This terrain is thought to have formed where edges of continents slid over and under each other long ago, bringing new rock up to the surface in what might have been some version of plate tectonics. On Earth, this sort of resurfacing may have been important in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-may-have-started-earlier-than-we-thought">making the planet hospitable to life</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="tessera on Venus" class="wp-image-3094812" height="634" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121820_lg_landingsurfaces_inline.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094812">Ridged, folded mountainous terrain on Venus called tessera (bright region in this false-color image from NASA’s Magellan spacecraft) might have formed through long-ago tectonic activity.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094812">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figure></div>



<p>But landing in these areas on Venus could be especially difficult. Unfortunately, the best maps of the planet — from NASA’s Magellan orbiter in the 1990s — can’t tell engineers how steep the slopes are in tessera terrain. Those maps suggest that most are less than 30 degrees, which the lander could handle with four telescoping legs. But some could be up to 60 degrees, leaving the spacecraft vulnerable to toppling over.</p>



<p>“We have a very poor understanding of what the surface is like,” Gilmore said in a talk recorded for the meeting. “What’s the boulder size? What’s the rock size distribution? Is it fluffy?”</p>



<p>So the lander will need some kind of intelligent navigation system to pick out the best places to land and steer there. But that need for steering brings up another problem: Unlike landers on Mars, a Venus lander can’t use small rocket engines to slow down as it descends.</p>



<p>The shape of a rocket is tailored to the density of air that it will push against. That’s why rockets that launch spacecraft from Earth have two sections: one for Earth’s atmosphere and one for the near-vacuum of space. Venus’ atmosphere changes density and pressure so quickly between space and the planet’s surface that “dropping a kilometer would go from the rocket working perfectly, to it’s going to misfire and possibly blow itself apart,” Knicely says.</p>



<p>Instead of rockets, the proposed lander would use fans to push itself around, almost like a submarine, turning the disadvantage of the dense atmosphere into an advantage.</p>



<p>The planet’s atmosphere also presents the biggest challenge of all: seeing the ground. Venus’ dense atmosphere scatters light more than Earth’s or Mars’ does, blurring the view of the surface until the last few kilometers of descent.</p>



<p>Worse, the scattered light makes it seem like illumination is coming from all directions at once, like shining a flashlight into fog. There are no shadows to help show steep slopes or reveal big boulders that the lander could crash into. That’s a major issue, according to Knicely, because all of the existing navigation software assumes that light comes from just one direction.</p>



<p>“If we can’t see the ground, we can’t find out where the safe stuff is,” Knicely says. “And we also can’t find out where the science is.” While proposed solutions to the other challenges of landing on Venus are close to doable, he says, this one remains the biggest hurdle.</p>



<h4>Sticking the landing on Europa</h4>



<p>Jupiter’s icy moon Europa, on the other hand, has no air to blur the surface or break rockets. A hypothetical future Europa lander, also discussed at the AGU meeting, would be able to use the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/curiosity-lands-safely-mars">“sky crane” technique</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/12</em>). That method, in which a platform hovers above the surface using rockets and drops a spacecraft to the ground, was used to land the Curiosity rover on Mars in 2012 and will be used for the Perseverance lander in February 2021.</p>



<p>“The engineers are very excited about not having to deal with an atmosphere on the way down,” said spacecraft engineer Jo Pitesky of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in a recorded talk for the meeting.</p>



<p>Still, there’s a lot that scientists don’t know about Europa’s surface, which could have implications for any lander that touches down, said planetary scientist Marissa Cameron of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in another talk.</p>



<p>The best views of the moon’s landscape are from the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s, and the smallest features it could see were half a kilometer across. Some scientists have suggested that Europa could sport jagged ice spikes called penitentes, similar to ice features in the Chilean Andes Mountains that are named for their resemblance to hooded monks with bowed heads — although more recent work shows Europa’s lack of atmosphere <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0496-2">should keep penitentes from forming</a>.</p>



<p>Another mission, the Europa Clipper, that’s already underway will take higher-resolution images when the orbiter visits the Jovian moon later this decade, which should help clarify the issue.</p>



<p>In the meantime, scientists and engineers are running elaborate dress rehearsals for a Europa landing, from simulating ices with different chemical compositions in vacuum chambers to dropping a dummy lander named Olaf from a crane to see how it holds up.</p>



<p>“We have a requirement that says the terrain can have any configuration — jagged, potholes, you name it — and we have to be able to conform to that surface and be stable at it,” says John Gallon, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. (The dummy lander was named for his 4-year-old daughter’s favorite character in the movie <em>Frozen</em>.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>Olaf, a scale model of a possible Europa lander, is helping NASA engineers test different strategies for landing on the icy moon of Jupiter. The rover is named for the snowman in the movie <em>Frozen</em>.</figure>



<p>Over the last two years, Gallon and colleagues have tested different lander feet, legs and configurations in a lab by suspending the lander from the ceiling like a marionette. That suspension helps simulate Europa’s gravity, which is one-seventh that of Earth’s.</p>



<p>Without much gravity, a massive lander could easily bounce around and damage itself when trying to land. “You’re not going to stick the landing like a gymnast coming off the bars,” Gallon says. His team has tried sticky feet, bowl-shaped feet, springs that compress and push into the surface and legs that lock to help the lander stay put on various terrains. The lander might crouch like a frog or stand stiff like a table, depending on what type of surface it lands on.</p>



<p>Although Olaf is hard at work helping scientists figure out what it will take to build a successful Europa lander, the mission itself, like its Venusian counterpart, remains only on some planetary scientists’ wish lists for now. Meanwhile, other researchers dream about voyages to entirely different worlds, including Saturn’s geyser moon Enceladus.</p>



<p>“Some people will pick favorites,” Cameron says. “I just want to land someplace we’ve never been to that’s not Mars. I’d love that.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread">The new U.K. coronavirus variant is concerning. But don’t freak out</a></h4>

<p>Coronavirus infections in part of the United Kingdom have rapidly taken center stage in the COVID-19 pandemic after researchers identified a variant of the virus that may be behind a recent spike in cases there.</p>



<p>On December 14, U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock first announced that the variant, called B.1.1.7, might be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55308211">linked to faster spread</a> that officials were seeing among people. In the days since, evidence supporting that hypothesis has emerged, prompting officials to put stricter public health measures in place to curb new infections — including restricting gatherings of people who don’t live in the same household.</p>



<p>Then on December 29, Colorado officials reported the first known case of a person in the United States who is infected with the U.K. variant. The man has no travel history and is in isolation, according to <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqb0ng6U0AAGmlY.jpg">a tweet</a> from the office of Colorado Governor Jared Polis.</p>



<p>Experts are closely monitoring the new variant, but they say, there’s no cause for alarm as of now. Here are a few things to know about B.1.1.7.</p>





<h4>It’s common for new variants of viruses to appear.</h4>



<p>Variants of viruses, including the novel coronavirus, are always popping up. As viruses replicate in cells and make <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-mutations-strains-variants">error-prone copies</a> of their genetic blueprints, the viruses naturally accumulate mutations (<em>SN: 5/26/20</em>).</p>



<p>Some rare mutations do change how a virus behaves, but most don’t. Instead, researchers primarily use variants as “fingerprints” to track disease spread, says Stephen Goldstein, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.</p>



<h4>The new U.K. variant seems to spread rapidly, but scientists don’t know for sure.</h4>



<p>The U.K. variant does have more changes compared with its closest relative than most other coronavirus variants. “Nothing of what I’ve seen … is the single definitive, killer piece of evidence that this is definitely more transmissible,” says Aris Katzourakis, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Oxford. “But there is so much circumstantial stuff all pointing in that direction.”   </p>



<p>For example, people who are infected with B.1.1.7 tend to pass the virus on to more people on average and have <a href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/338928724/SARS-CoV-2+variant+under+investigation%2C+meeting+minutes.pdf/962e866b-161f-2fd5-1030-32b6ab467896?t=1608470511452">higher amounts</a> of the coronavirus’s genetic material in the body than people with other variants of the virus, according a Dec. 18 meeting summary from the U.K. New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. Such evidence is, as Katzourakis says, circumstantial. To know for sure, researchers need additional proof from experiments done in animals or more data from people.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Studies have also shown that one of the variant’s mutations, called N501Y, might make B.1.1.7 more contagious — perhaps by helping it bind better to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sars-new-coronavirus-target-same-cellular-lock-infect-cells">ACE2</a>, a host protein that lets the virus into cells (<em>SN: 2/3/20</em>). It’s unclear, however, whether all the observations together stem from a more transmissible virus, which could be harder to control.     </p>



<p>It’s also possible that the spike in coronavirus cases could be due to human behavior, Katzourakis says. “We have recently come out of a lockdown, so a lot of that increase in case numbers could be due to the relaxation of social distancing measures.” Which scenario is more plausible should become clear in about a week or longer, he says.   </p>



<h4>It’s unknown if it causes more severe or milder disease.</h4>



<p>A mutation in B.1.1.7 leads to a shorter version of a viral protein called ORF8 than what’s seen in other variants. But it’s unclear what ORF8 does during an infection. Some modifications in ORF8 have actually been associated <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)31757-8/fulltext">with less severe COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>There’s currently no evidence to suggest the variant causes more severe disease.</p>



<h4>There’s also no evidence that vaccines would be less effective against it.</h4>



<p>The U.K. variant is missing two amino acids that are targets of neutralizing antibodies, immune proteins that stop the virus from making it into a host cell. That, among a slew of other mutations in the B.1.1.7’s spike protein, could help the virus hide from some immune responses, including those induced by a vaccine.</p>



<p>But our bodies can attack a wide variety of surfaces on the coronavirus to control the infection, Goldstein says. So, for now, immune protection from vaccines should still be effective. Vaccines may need to be updated in the future, but perhaps not for a few years.</p>



<p>COVID-19 vaccine developers Pfizer and Moderna are reportedly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/22/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html">running tests</a> to make sure their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval">newly authorized</a> vaccines work against the new variant (<em>SN: 12/18/20</em>).</p>



<h4>Scientists don’t know where it came from.</h4>



<p>Although the new variant was first detected in the United Kingdom, where exactly it arose is a mystery. </p>



<p>In general, coronaviruses are similar to other viruses in that their genetic material rapidly accumulates errors or changes. But they are also different in that they are among a select group that have a viral version of spell check. Such a correction system means that coronaviruses change more slowly over time than other viruses that also use RNA as their genetic blueprint, such as influenza. B.1.1.7, though, has far more mutations that change or remove amino acids in viral proteins than experts would expect when compared with the most closely related coronavirus variant.  </p>

<p>One possibility is that B.1.1.7 arose in someone who had a weak immune system, which allowed the virus to replicate for a much longer period of time than usual and gather lots of mutations, Katzourakis says. “It seems like that was a kind of leap, something that essentially gave evolution a helping hand.” Researchers have previously seen the coronavirus change after an infection in immunocompromised patients. Such cases might help the virus pick up mutations that it might not otherwise during infections in people with stronger immune systems. </p>



<h4>A coronavirus variant from South Africa shares some of the U.K. variant’s changes.</h4>



<p>The United Kingdom is not the only country to report a variant with the N501Y mutation. Such a variant is also on the rise in <a href="https://www.krisp.org.za/publications.php?pubid=315">South Africa</a>. Both versions acquired the change independently of one another, researchers say.    </p>



<p>The fact that coronavirus variants in different parts of the world independently evolved the same mutation suggests that it might have some beneficial effect for the virus, Goldstein says. Some variants may be successful at spreading in the population by chance alone — an infected person hopped on a plane and spread the virus after arriving at his or her destination. But in this case, the rapid spread of B.1.1.7 in the United Kingdom and of its distant relative in South Africa hints that the change might help the variants transmit, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers around the world should examine coronavirus genetic material from as many infected people as possible to monitor for similar variants, experts say. That would help officials pinpoint whether the new or similar variants are spreading in other countries as well.</p>



<h4>The variant may very well be spreading in the United States, but that’s also unclear.</h4>



<p>On December 29, Colorado officials reported the first known case of a person in the United States who is infected with the U.K. variant. The man has no travel history and is in isolation, according to <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqb0ng6U0AAGmlY.jpg">a tweet</a> from the office of Colorado Governor Jared Polis.  </p>



<p>Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had said in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus/live-updates/California-governor-quarantine-covid/?id=74837900#74858060">an interview</a> with <em>Good Morning America</em> on December 22 that it was possible that the variant was already in the United States. The fact that the man has no known travel history suggests the variant may be spreading here, but to what extent is unknown.</p>



<p>Some people <a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.N501?c=gt-S_501,69&amp;label=mlabel:20B/C5388A&amp;p=grid">outside the United Kingdom</a> have been infected with the U.K. variant, including in Denmark and Australia, but there is no evidence that it is spreading broadly in those countries yet. </p>



<h4>Public health measures like masks will still help prevent the variant from spreading.</h4>



<p>Even if it becomes clear that B.1.1.7 is more contagious than other versions of the coronavirus, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-control-increasing-cases">wearing masks and social distancing</a> are still going to be crucial tools to curb its spread (<em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). Officials “may have to think about introducing additional measures, but it’ll be the same kind of measures — potentially more often and more stringent,” Katzourakis says. </p>



<p>For example, while there is now evidence suggesting that another coronavirus variant with a mutation, called D614G, that emerged after the pandemic began and spread around the world is more contagious than variants without the change, “it hasn’t prevented countries like Vietnam or Taiwan or South Korea or New Zealand from being able to contain the virus,” Goldstein says.</p>



<p>“I think it shows us that although there may be small differences in transmission efficiency, it doesn’t mean that the virus is all of a sudden uncontainable.”  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-iron-based-catalyst-converts-carbon-dioxide-into-jet-fuel">A new iron-based catalyst converts carbon dioxide into jet fuel</a></h4>

<p>Today, airplanes pump a lot of climate-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But someday, carbon dioxide sucked from the atmosphere could be used to power airplanes.</p>



<p>A new iron-based catalyst <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20214-z">converts carbon dioxide into jet fuel</a>, researchers report online December 22 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Unlike cars, planes can’t carry batteries big enough to run on electricity from wind or solar power. But if CO<sub>2</sub>, rather than oil, were used to make jet fuel, that could reduce the air travel industry’s carbon footprint — which currently makes up 12 percent of all transportation-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>



<p>Past attempts to convert carbon dioxide into fuel have relied on catalysts made of relatively expensive materials, like cobalt, and required multiple chemical processing steps. The new catalyst powder is made of inexpensive ingredients, including iron, and transforms CO<sub>2</sub> in a single step.</p>



<p>When placed in a reaction chamber with carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas, the catalyst helps carbon from the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules separate from oxygen and link up with hydrogen — forming the hydrocarbon molecules that make up jet fuel. The leftover oxygen atoms from the CO<sub>2</sub> join up with other hydrogen atoms to form water.</p>



<p>Tiancun Xiao, a chemist at the University of Oxford, and colleagues tested their new catalyst on carbon dioxide in a small reaction chamber set to 300° Celsius and pressurized to about 10 times the air pressure at sea level. Over 20 hours, the catalyst converted 38 percent of the carbon dioxide in the chamber into new chemical products. About 48 percent of those products were jet fuel hydrocarbons. Other by-products included similar petrochemicals, such as ethylene and propylene, which can be used to make plastics.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/murder-hornet-apocalypse-rumors-exaggerated">Rumors of a ‘murder hornet’ apocalypse may have been exaggerated</a></h4>

<p>As if 2020 needed an extra disaster, the year also brought us “murder hornets.”</p>



<p>When two Asian giant hornets (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>) were spotted in Washington and nearby British Columbia in May, news headlines heralded their “arrival” with a strange mix of horror and glee. Never mind that the invaders had been spotted in the state the year before; somehow it felt that they belonged in 2020.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> has tried to calm the buzz with facts. For one, the invasion is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada">not as apocalyptic as some headlines have suggested</a>, life sciences writer Susan Milius reported (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 14</em>). Not only is this not the first big hornet to invade the United States, the predatory insects hunt for honey­bees, not people. And the hornets are not exactly taking over. Scientists have mounted an extensive effort to eradicate them — officials in Washington found and destroyed their first nest in October — and a map released this year suggests that swaths of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornets-new-map-habitat-united-states">challenging habitat might make it hard for the hornets to sweep across America</a> (<em>SN: 11/7/20, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped people all over the country from thinking they’ve found one. “Suddenly, overlooked local wasp and hornet species … hanging around in corners of people’s backyards for millennia become the subjects of panic-driven calls,” says Gale Ridge, an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven. Ridge has been taking those calls.</p>





<p>Concerned readers have reached out to <em>Science News</em>, too. We shared with Ridge the half dozen photographs of suspected murder hornets we received. She spotted European hornets, bald-faced hornets (technically yellow jackets) and robber flies. No murder hornets.</p>



<p>“In the public mind, the hornets are ‘here,’ ” Ridge says. She patiently explains to her frazzled callers that the hornets are being intercepted nearly 3,000 miles away across an entire continent.</p>



<p>“The combination of half-listening and overdramatization of the facts by the media creates an anxiety-driven stew,” Ridge says. She combats that anxiety by teaching local residents about New England’s insects, such as European hornets and cicada-killer wasps that are often mistaken for Asian giant hornets. “One creates a fresh storybook of information on which callers can relax, feel comfortable and thrive,” she says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>This year has been like no other. The coronavirus pandemic has affected pretty much all aspects of our lives — so it’s no surprise that psychological research looked a bit different in 2020. At <em>Research Digest</em>, we’ve examined much of this emerging work on the effects of the pandemic, from studies exploring the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/10/the-process-of-psychological-recovery-begins-while-a-stressful-event-is-still-going-on-according-to-study-of-early-stages-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">process of psychological recovery</a> to those looking at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/02/coping-with-remote-working-during-covid-19-the-latest-research-digested/">how to cope with the new reality of home working</a>.</p>



<p>But we’ve also tried to continue providing the broad coverage of psychology research that our readers have come to enjoy. And as we look back at our most popular posts of the year, it’s clear these stories about the human experience continue to educate and entertain, even in the midst of this <em>annus horribilis</em>.</p>

<p><strong>10) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/22/heavy-coffee-drinkers-want-coffee-a-lot-more-than-they-actually-like-it/">Heavy Coffee Drinkers Want Coffee A Lot More Than They Actually Like It</a></strong></p>



<p>This study has been all over the papers this month — but we first covered it way back in June. I suspect that many people’s coffee consumption has shot through the roof during the pandemic (I know mine has), so it’s perhaps not surprising that this was one of our most read pieces of the year.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong> 9) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/30/heres-how-our-personality-changes-as-we-age/">Here’s How Our Personality Changes As We Age</a></strong></p>



<p>Personality was once believed to be stable, changing very little after the age of 30 or so. But recent work shows that our personalities actually shift throughout our lives. This study examined how the “Big Five” personality traits of tens of thousands of people changed through middle age and into older age.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>8) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/">Cold Days Can Make Us Long For Social Contact — But Warming Up Our Bodies Eliminates This Desire</a></strong></p>



<p>The idea that temperature can affect our social perceptions — that being physically warm leads us to feel “warm” towards others — is contentious. In fact, this kind of social priming research is often at the centre of controversies about psychology’s replication crisis. But this year, a study suggested one possible explanation for the inconsistencies in past work: the researchers rarely take into account the <em>ambient</em> temperature while they’re conducting their experiments.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>7) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/19/why-some-people-find-it-harder-to-drag-themselves-to-bed-at-night/">Why Some People Find It Harder To Drag Themselves To Bed At Night</a></strong></p>



<p>Why do so many of us suffer from “bedtime procrastination”? Intriguingly, it might be related to the beliefs we have about our willpower. This study found that people who think that willpower is a limited resource that needs to be replenished are <em>more</em> likely to put off going to bed on a stressful day, perhaps because they feel they need more time to recover from their day before sleeping.</p>

<p>Our posts containing practical tips often attract a lot of readers, and this one was no different. Many lab-based studies have identified strategies for more effective studying — but this was a rare case of looking at these approaches in an actual educational setting.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>5) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/22/heres-how-long-distance-runners-are-different-from-the-rest-of-us/">Here’s How Long-Distance Runners Are Different From The Rest Of Us</a></strong></p>



<p>What kind of person decides to run 50 or 100km — or even more? Well, it turns out that ultramarathon runners are actually pretty similar to everyone else. They do seem to be more resilient and better at using certain emotion regulation strategies — but whether that’s the cause or consequence of being a long-distance runner remains unclear.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>4) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">How Psychology Researchers Are Responding To The COVID-19 Pandemic</a></strong></p>



<p>The start of the first lockdown feels like a lifetime ago now. But as the world was learning to adjust to new routines, many psychologists launched projects to study the effects of the crisis and to inform our response to it. We looked at several of these projects in this story in March.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/07/psychology-research-in-the-coronavirus-era-a-high-stakes-version-of-groundhog-day/">follow-up feature in July</a> didn’t receive quite the same number of readers, but to my mind was more important. This time we explored the worries voiced by many researchers that in “crisis mode”, psychologists were falling for the old methodological pitfalls that the field has long been trying to move on from.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>3) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/23/musicians-and-their-audiences-show-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity/">Musicians And Their Audiences Show Synchronised Patterns Of Brain Activity</a></strong></p>



<p>If you cast your mind back to a time when it was possible to attend a concert, you might remember experiencing a feeling of connection with the musicians as they played. That connection can happen even at the neural level, according to a study which found “inter-brain coherence” between a musician and their audience (essentially a correlation in patterns of blood flow in the brains of performer and observer). What’s more, this synchronisation was stronger during the pieces the listeners found more enjoyable. Another study this year found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/03/parents-have-more-synchronised-patterns-of-brain-activity-when-theyre-together/">parents also show patterns of synchrony</a> with each other.</p>

<p><strong>2) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/20/memory-complaints-are-more-common-among-older-adults-with-particular-personality-traits/">Memory Complaints Are More Common Among Older Adults With Particular Personality Traits</a></strong></p>



<p>A second story about personality and age proved popular this year. In this post, we looked at a study on the link between personality and cognitive complaints in older adults. One factor stood out as predicting <em>fewer </em>cognitive complaints: openness to experience, a trait that entails a liking for intellectual and artistic pursuits and a willingness to try new things.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>1) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/09/first-generation-university-students-are-at-greater-risk-of-experiencing-imposter-syndrome/">First-Generation University Students Are At Greater Risk Of Experiencing Imposter Syndrome</a></strong></p>



<p>The competitive nature of STEM classes at university can lead many students to feel like they are an imposter — but first-generation students seem to be at particular risk of imposter syndrome. This, only the second story that we posted in 2020, clearly struck a chord: it was the most popular post of the year.</p>

Bowing to legal pressure from the supplement maker Herbalife, Elsevier earlier this year retracted — and then removed — a paper which claimed that a young woman in India died of liver failure after using the company’s products. The move has led to more legal threats. In August 2018, a group of researchers in India … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/22/after-legal-threats-from-herbalife-elsevier-journal-retracts-and-then-removes-a-paper/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">After legal threats from Herbalife, Elsevier journal retracts — and then removes — a paper</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clearing-land-feed-human-population-2050-threat-species">Clearing land to feed a growing human population will threaten thousands of species</a></h4>

<p>Humankind’s growing need for food is running up against thousands of other species’ need for space.</p>



<p>By 2050, humans may need to clear an additional 3.35 million square kilometers of land for agriculture. Converting these largely natural habitats, collectively about the size of India, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00656-5">would squeeze more than 17,000 vertebrate species from some of their lands</a>, researchers report December 21 in <em>Nature Sustainability</em>. </p>



<p>But changing how, where and what food is grown can minimize the impacts, says conservation scientist David Williams of the University of Leeds in England. “We can feed the planet without screwing it up too badly.”</p>



<p>To figure out how, Williams and colleagues first identified habitats most likely to be cleared for cropland. The team then calculated the amount of food needed to sustain projected human population growth for 152 countries and mapped where crops would likely be grown in each, based in part on past land use changes. By 2050, the world’s 13 million square kilometers of cropland would need to increase by 26 percent, the team found. That growth is largely concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia.</p>





<p>The researchers then overlaid these estimates on distribution maps of nearly 20,000 species of birds, amphibians and mammals. While almost all of these species would lose some habitat, the team estimates that 1,280 species would lose at least 25 percent of their ranges, and 96 species would lose at least 75 percent.</p>



<p>Overhauling the global food system could nearly erase these biodiversity losses, the team says. Among the changes: improve crop yields, transition to more plant-based diets, halve food loss and waste and increase food imports for countries where agricultural expansion threatens the most species. Implementing all four tactics would actually shrink the world’s cropland area by 3.4 million square kilometers by midcentury and result in just 33 species losing more than a quarter of their natural range, the team found.</p>



<p>Achieving that may be politically unfeasible, Williams says, but less aggressive changes could still have big impacts. The world needs to feed a growing population, but it can be done more sustainably, he says. “It’s a no brainer.”</p>

<p class="">Every night, Steven spends over an hour preparing for bed. For many of us, preparing for bed involves routines like putting on pajamas, going to the bathroom, and brushing our teeth. But for Steven, his preparation doesn’t truly begin until after he has already done these things. </p><p class="">Once Steven is ready to get into bed, he goes downstairs. He turns out the lights, locks the door, and checks to make sure the stove hasn’t been left on. But he does more than just look at the stove; he also gently touches the dials to confirm they are in the “off” position. Then, he stares at the dials for 30 seconds to convince himself that touching them didn’t accidentally move them into the “on” position—even though this seems like it would be impossible with such a light touch. </p><p class="">Finally, he goes upstairs to get into bed. But he is stopped by the thought that maybe he forgot to make sure the door was locked. </p><p class="">He thinks he remembers doing this, but the memory isn’t as clear as he would like it to be. Regardless, there’s always the chance he might not have turned the lock completely. So, he goes back to check the lock again. The short amount of time that has passed suggests maybe he should check the stove one more time, too. So he does.</p><p class="">Once he gets into bed, he immediately begins to question if he turned off the lights. Or, maybe he brushed up against the dials of the stove on his way back upstairs, unintentionally turning it back on. The uncertainty is almost unbearable, and it would only take a short walk downstairs to relieve his anxiety. Thus, he goes through the whole process again. He’ll repeat these steps about 15-20 times before finally feeling like he’s able to stay in bed and go to sleep.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>OCD symptoms</h2><p class="">Steven has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a surprisingly common condition that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30946823/" target="_blank">affects up to 3% of the general population</a>. People with OCD are plagued by persistent, intrusive thoughts called <em>obsessions</em>. The obsessions are typically linked to <em>compulsions</em>, which are acts a patient feels compelled to do in order to mitigate the distress caused by obsessive thoughts. For some, compulsions involve observable behaviors (like Steven’s stove-checking), but for others they might consist of mental acts like praying, reviewing past events, counting, etc.</p><p class="">OCD obsessions often follow common themes like: fears of contamination (e.g., by germs), a preoccupation with symmetry, taboo thoughts (e.g., pedophilia, incest), and concerns about harming oneself or others. </p><p class="">It’s important to note that people with OCD are very unlikely to actually have taboo desires, or to intentionally hurt someone. Instead, they’re tortured by the fact that these types of thoughts can even appear in their consciousness. They go to great lengths, represented by their compulsions, to try to keep the thoughts from becoming reality.</p><p class="">OCD symptoms occur on a spectrum, and the disorder can look quite different from case to case. One patient may seem to be outwardly healthy but suffer from obsessive thinking that disrupts her ability to concentrate, sleep, and maintain relationships. Another patient may be clearly debilitated by the disorder. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26165310/" target="_blank">One teenage girl</a>, for example, was afraid that pinworms might enter her mouth. To ward off the danger, she stopped speaking for 10 months and shunned eating until she needed to be hospitalized.</p><p class=""> </p><h2>OCD and the brain</h2><p class="">Neuroscientists are still uncertain about what happens in the brain to cause OCD, but one popular hypothesis suggests it involves brain circuits that connect the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/frontal-lobe" target="_blank">frontal cortex</a> with a collection of structures called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia" target="_blank">basal ganglia</a>. </p>

<p class="">According to this perspective, OCD symptoms begin with activity in a part of the frontal cortex called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/orbitofrontal-cortex" target="_blank">orbitofrontal cortex</a>, or OFC. The OFC sits just above the eye sockets (aka the orbits), and has diverse functions—most of which are still poorly understood. Research, however, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9829024/" target="_blank">suggests that areas of the OFC are highly active when we notice something dangerous or threatening </a>in the environment.</p><p class="">After we recognize that a threat is present, pathways that connect the OFC to the basal ganglia are activated. The basal ganglia are best known for their role in movement, but they are also involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional functions. They are especially important to: facilitation of goal-directed actions, development of habitual responses, and switching to a new behavior when it’s deemed necessary. The circuitry of the basal ganglia can be divided into two opposing pathways: the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/direct-pathway" target="_blank">direct pathway</a>, which facilitates action, and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/indirect-pathway" target="_blank">indirect pathway</a>, which inhibits it. (See <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia" target="_blank">this article</a> if you want more details on how these basal ganglia circuits work.)</p><p class="">Let’s look at how a simplified version of this OFC-basal ganglia circuit might work in a healthy individual. First, they notice something in the environment that could be identified as dangerous, and the OFC is involved in recognizing it as a potential threat. Let’s say they touch a door handle in a public restroom, which of course carries a risk of exposure to germs. The OFC interacts with the basal ganglia via the direct pathway to initiate an action to mitigate the threat. This leads to the person using a few squirts of hand sanitizer. At this point, the indirect pathway kicks in and inhibits further action.</p><p class="">In someone with OCD, the pathway from the OFC to the basal ganglia tends to be overly excitable. OCD patients are hyper-aware of things in the environment that might pose a threat, and that level of awareness is linked to high levels of OFC activity. Thus, in the OCD patient, a threat might be detected not only when they touch the door handle in a public restroom, but also when they brush up against any surface that hasn’t recently been sanitized—even if it’s a countertop in their own home.</p><p class="">This extreme vigilance is associated with over-excitation of the direct pathway. When the direct pathway is activated, the individual is prompted to clean their hands. But the high level of activity in the direct pathway drowns out the inhibitory action of the indirect pathway, and the patient has a difficult time switching to a different behavior. Additionally, each time the threat is temporarily alleviated, the individual feels a transient sense of relief—which reinforces the response. All of this leads to compulsive behavior, and the hand-washing must be repeated a number of times before the patient is satisfied.</p><p class=""> </p><h2>Not the whole story</h2><p class="">This model of OCD is supported by a wealth of studies. Some have found increased activity among the circuits mentioned above in OCD patients, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24840803/" target="_blank">others have found a reduction in that activity in response to the most common treatments</a> for OCD (which include cognitive behavioral therapy and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris" target="_blank">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a>). </p><p class=""><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138231/" target="_blank">More recent research</a>, however, suggests that this model is too simplistic (a common refrain in neuroscience). For example, one problem is that the OFC is not a homogenous brain area, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138231/" target="_blank">while some OFC regions are hyperactive in OCD, others appear to be hypoactive</a>. Additionally, research indicates that other parts of the brain (like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/amygdala" target="_blank">amygdala</a>, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/hippocampus" target="_blank">hippocampus</a>, and other regions) also play important roles in the manifestation of OCD symptoms, suggesting the model outlined above is incomplete.</p><p class="">Thus, although the OFC and basal ganglia seem to play important roles in OCD, the original model describing their interaction to produce OCD symptoms is likely only part of the story. Neuroscientists hope that further research will elucidate the neural circuitry behind OCD, and lead to better ways to help patients like Steven manage a disorder that can completely upend someone’s life.</p><p class=""> </p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Menzies L, Chamberlain SR, Laird AR, Thelen SM, Sahakian BJ, Bullmore ET.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What makes for a happy family? The answer — whether you’re talking about a couple or a family with kids — is psychological “flexibility”, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301952?dgcid=rss_sd_all">according to a new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science</em>. Based on a meta-analysis of 174 separate studies, Jennifer S. Daks and Ronald Rogge at the University of Rochester conclude that flexibility helps — and inflexibility hinders — our most important relationships.</p>



<span id="more-41079"></span>



<p>The pair analysed data from 203 separate samples, comprising almost 44,000 participants in total. They homed in on measures of psychological flexibility and inflexibility within these studies (which often gathered other data, too), and how they related to measures of family and relationship functioning.</p>



<p>A psychologically flexible person is characterised by a set of attitudes and skills: they are generally open to and accepting of experiences, whether they are good or bad; they try to be mindfully aware of the present moment; they experience difficult thoughts without ruminating on them; they seek to maintain a broader perspective when faced with a challenge; they continue to pursue important goals despite setbacks; and they maintain contact with “deeper values”, no matter how stressful a day might be (so, for example, a parent confronted with a screaming child who holds the value of being a kind, compassionate parent is able to bear this in mind when choosing how to react to the child). Psychological inflexibility describes the opposite of these thoughts and attitudes, and also entails feeling judged or shameful for holding negative thoughts and feelings.</p>



<p>The pair identified a host of specific links between aspects of flexibility or inflexibility and family functioning. For example, they found that inattention to the present moment and a tendency to respond to challenging experiences in a rigid, inflexible way were linked to weaker family bonds. These factors were also linked to lower levels of satisfaction with romantic relationships, and less “adaptive” parenting, suggesting that such an inflexible parent “might have a more difficult time responding to their children’s misbehaviour in sensitive, compassionate and responsive ways.” (In contrast, greater flexibility was strongly linked to more adaptive parenting). A lack of awareness of the present moment was also associated with more shouting and violence among couples and, along with some other measures of inflexibility, to stronger feelings of insecurity in relation to the relationship.</p>



<p>It’s important to note, however, that the overwhelming majority of links were correlational, so the direction of cause-and-effect is not clear. It could be the case that consistently poor child behaviour drives parental inflexibility, for example — or that the two exacerbate each other. The researchers themselves highlight this issue, calling for longitudinal studies to explore the direction and strength of the associations that they report.</p>



<p>But Daks and Rogge also point to potential practical implications of their findings. It might not seem especially surprising that psychological flexibility has emerged as being good for relationships. But in the past, research on flexibility has tended to focus on how it enhances an individual’s wellbeing, rather than the quality of romantic or familial relationships. In revealing the links between flexibility and family functioning, the work suggests a possible target for new interventions. A form of therapy called <a href="https://contextualscience.org/act">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</a> encourages the development of flexibility, and there is plenty of evidence that it improves an individual’s own functioning, the pair notes. Perhaps, given the new results, it could help family functioning, too — especially if a parenting-focused ACT intervention were to be developed. Since links between greater psychological flexibility in parents and in their children have been reported, such an intervention might in theory have benefits that transmit down through generations.</p>

<img alt="Photograph showing a shadowy woodland scene with autumn leaves covering the ground" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/Photo-long-covid-patient-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As we celebrate the significant milestone of the first person in the UK to receive an effective vaccine against Covid-19, it is easy to forget the devastation this virus has caused for so many lives. Yet, tens of thousands of people in the UK are still battling symptoms, months after their initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Press articles and television documentaries have revealed the daily struggles of these ‘long Covid’ sufferers, but up to now, there has been little published research on the lived experience of this illness.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-06001-y">new study</a><strong> </strong>by a team of Oxford University academics, who worked in collaboration with 114 people from across the UK with long Covid, has systematically explored the story of this novel disease and the challenges its sufferers face.</p>
<p>In addition to the symptoms and their effect on people’s daily lives, the research reveals significant questions about the availability and consistency of NHS care. It identifies important lessons that must be learned in order to reduce the long-term impact on individuals and their families, the healthcare system, and the wider economy.</p>
<h3><strong>What is long Covid?</strong></h3>
<p>Long Covid is the name patients gave to COVID-19 symptoms that don’t resolve within the expected 4-week time frame. The number of people who develop it is contested, since many people who had Covid-19 were not formally tested, were not admitted to hospital (or even assessed in A&amp;E) and their continuing suffering remains undocumented.</p>
<p>Importantly, long Covid can affect anyone, even working-age individuals who were previously fit and well. Symptoms are diverse and confusing. Breathlessness, overwhelming fatigue, and muscle pains are common. Many people suffer problems with attention or memory, chest pains, persistent cough, blood clots, gastric reflux, tingling sensations, rashes, and other ‘surprising’ problems.</p>
<p>Some or all of these symptoms may be due to underlying organ damage, therefore patients should be properly assessed and receive appropriate tests where needed. However, many individuals have normal basic tests e.g. blood tests and X-rays and the underlying cause for their problems remains unknown. The causes and best treatments for many are still unclear.</p>

<h3><strong>What did the study team do?</strong></h3>
<p>Led by <a href="https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh">Professor Trish Greenhalgh</a>, the study team recruited 114 patients with long Covid using social media. They facilitated individual interviews and focus groups where participants shared their experiences of the illness’ invasion of their lives and their encounters with the NHS and healthcare professionals.</p>
<h3><strong>What did the study find?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Long Covid is a serious, uncertain and confusing illness with fluctuating, sometimes severe, symptoms in every part of the body</p></blockquote>
<p>Long Covid is a serious, uncertain and confusing illness with fluctuating, sometimes severe, symptoms in every part of the body. Many people were trapped in cycles of small improvements and crashing relapses and struggled to come to terms with the uncertainty and debilitation caused by the disease.</p>
<p>One participant captured the devastating impact on his personal life and occupational prospects:</p>

<blockquote><p>Long Covid sufferers found it complicated, difficult and exhausting to access NHS care</p></blockquote>
<p>Long Covid sufferers found it complicated, difficult and exhausting to access NHS care. They experienced confusion between the GP and 111 services, difficulty with remote or online consultations, a lack of continuity, and uninformed clinicians. Patients therefore often found themselves with no choice but to manipulate or seek out their own pathways for accessing care – often private or through personal contacts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some long Covid patients reported care with concerning levels of quality and safety</p></blockquote>
<p>Some long Covid patients reported care with concerning levels of quality and safety. Many had experienced encounters with ignorant or disbelieving clinicians, who dismissed their concerns. For example, a near heart-breaking account recounted how the participant was so breathless he called his GP whilst lying prone on his living room floor only to be told he didn’t sound very breathless and should take medication for anxiety. However, some participants did describe empathic, warm, caring clinicians who were supportive, and helpful, listening to their stories and sharing their distress – companions in their dreadful journeys.</p>
<h3><strong>Suggested quality principles for long Covid services</strong></h3>
<p>Channeling the anger, frustration, fear, and hopelessness expressed by participants, the study team worked closely with a small group of sufferers to identify what would make for a high quality long Covid service: <strong>the ABCDEF of long Covid.</strong></p>

<p>These include <strong><u>A</u></strong>ccess to appropriate care that is not overly <strong><u>B</u></strong>urdensome for patients and families, with <strong><u>C</u></strong>linical responsibility held by one clinician. An individualized, multi-<strong><u>D</u></strong>isciplinary approach should be followed using <strong><u>E</u></strong>vidence-based standards with <strong><u>F</u></strong>urther development of knowledge and services in collaboration with patients.</p>
<p>As one of the authors described, ‘It’s been a humbling and emotional experience to work with such a committed group of patients with such powerful stories to tell. It’s sadly too late to change many of their experiences but hopefully, our suggestions could contribute to improvements for future long Covid patients.’</p>

<p>En av mina tidigaste julförberedelser är att koka kola. Jag vill hinna med några sorter innan jul, och det finns ingen(?) som orkar dela och slå in mer än en sats kola per helg (~100 st).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Ingen fotobeskrivning tillgänglig." src="https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/131984082_10159202852743615_5419744557807913794_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=2&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=4XU4M64MGnAAX9wi4ok&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-arn2-1.xx&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=960159d35a15a057d83b06b9ea68ba68&amp;oe=60025BBC" /></figure>



<p>I år har jag hittills kokat bergamott-kola, chokladkola med lavendel, och lakritskola (ovan).</p>



<p>Till bergamott-kolan använde jag Mitt Köks recept på <a data-id="https://mittkok.expressen.se/recept/citronsmorkola/" data-type="URL" href="https://mittkok.expressen.se/recept/citronsmorkola/">citronsmörkola</a>, av Michael Hoffman, fast med finrivet bergamottskal och -saft. Det <em>viktiga</em> att tänka på när man smaksätter med citrusskal är att ha i det absolut sist, precis innan man häller upp kolan. Annars försvinner mycket av smaken.  Bäst är därför att riva skalet riktigt fint på ett zestjärn, så det inte blir märkbara bitar i kolan.</p>



<ul><li>4 dl vispgrädde</li><li>4 dl strösocker</li><li>2 dl ljus sirap</li><li>150 g smör (normalsaltat eller osaltat)</li><li>Smaksättning alt 1 – citrus<ul><li>1 st ekologisk bergamott eller annan citrusfrukt, finrivet skal + saft</li><li>1 krm salt (eller mer, om smöret var osaltat)</li><li>Saften kan blandas med övriga ingredienser i början av koket, men det rivna skalet ska blandas i allra sist.</li><li><strong>Garnering</strong>: en eller ett par sorters fint strössel, gärna mindre bitar tex minipärlor + lite flingsalt</li></ul></li><li>Smaksättning alt 2 – choklad<ul><li>2 rågade msk/ 0.5 dl bra kakao, t ex Monbana.</li><li>en halv tesked salt (eller mer, om smöret var osaltat)</li><li>en halv tesked malt kaffe</li><li>en halv tesked malt lavendelsalt</li><li>ett kryddmått anchopeppar</li><li><strong>Garnering</strong>: en eller ett par sorters fint strössel, gärna mindre bitar tex minipärlor + lite flingsalt + finrivet limeskal</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Resultatet av receptet blev så bra att jag använde samma recept som utgångspunkt till chokladkolan, men med lite ändringar och tillsatser. Viktigaste ingrediensen i chokladkolan är riktigt bra, mörk kakao (nej, <em>inte</em> Ögonkakao). Jag gillar <a href="https://www.apotea.se/monbana-chocolaterie-kakaopulver-i-metallbox-200g">den här från Monbana</a> som brukade vara omöjlig att få tag i förr, men som nu finns på apoteket. Jag tog två väldigt rågade matskedar. Sedan spetsade jag chokladsmaken med att förstärka åt lite olika håll med (pyttelite) lavendel, ancho, (pyttelite) kanel, lite salt, och lite vanligt malt kaffe. Limeskal och flingsalt ovanpå – och lite snöflingeströssel – när jag hällt upp kolan i formen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Ingen fotobeskrivning tillgänglig." src="https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/129634821_10159171046903615_1562108794168781291_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&amp;ccb=2&amp;_nc_sid=8bfeb9&amp;_nc_ohc=KVpM7d9G2G0AX_63Od4&amp;_nc_oc=AQk5TT1NKZKJIg83CxMkJggCN6l1JknnYkyiBKRmy5_T6ugMNI19EuaxaY-vUL5ykXw&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-arn2-1.xx&amp;tp=6&amp;oh=9e13df3dd742a98bbc133c653bc33290&amp;oe=60031388" /></figure>



<p>Till lakrits-kolan fick jag experimentera lite mer. Jag utgick ifrån <a data-id="https://www.kokaihop.se/recept/lakritskola-3" data-type="URL" href="https://www.kokaihop.se/recept/lakritskola-3">det första receptet</a> jag hittade som nämnde lakritsstång, ett från 2011 på Koka ihop postat av Anneli i Örnsköldsvik (som angav Apoteket som receptkälla), men eftersom jag ville bli av med två hela 3dl paket grädde skalade jag upp allt med 20%. Och från tidigare år mindes jag att en lakritsstång inte riktigt räckte, så jag tog två. Sedan hade jag också i en cup (~2.5 dl) melass för att bredda lakritssmaken lite grann. Och en halv tesked salt. Det blev en gigantisk hög kola, nästan 120 rätt stora bitar (dvs ~20 bitar per dl grädde).</p>



<ul><li><s>5</s> <strong>6</strong> dl grädde</li><li><s>500</s> <strong>600</strong> gram socker</li><li><s>5</s> <strong>6</strong> msk sirap ljus</li><li><s>2</s> msk <strong>2.25</strong> msk (34ml) flytande glykos</li><li><s>50</s> <strong>60</strong> gram smör</li><li><s>50</s> <strong>2*50</strong> gram lakritsstång</li><li><strong>2.5</strong> dl melass</li></ul>



<p>Det är jättelätt att starta ett kolakok, och använder man termometer rakt igenom är det inte stressigt heller. Det är efterarbetet – skära och slå in – som tar tid och ansträngning. För kokningen väntar man bara tills det är “klart”, en dryg halvtimme på 2/3 av maxvärme, och så tar man grytan av värmen. Stektermometer som kan ligga i smeten hela tiden gör det lätt som en plätt, se till bara att den inte nuddar botten på kastrullen. Det kan vara bra att röra runt lite då och då när temperaturen börjar gå över 120-125 grader, då börjar kolan vara trög och kan bränna vid i bottnen. Särskilt viktigt är det att röra om man har kakao i kolasmeten. <br /><br />Och när är “klart”? Det varierar med hur mjuk kola man vill ha. ICA har en bra och rättvisande <a data-id="https://www.ica.se/buffe/artikel/temperatur-kola/" data-type="URL" href="https://www.ica.se/buffe/artikel/temperatur-kola/">temperatur-guide</a>, jag citerar:</p>



<ul><li>Vid 122-125°C är knäck- eller kolasmeten lagom kokt för mjuk kola.</li><li>Vid 140-145°C får man hårda kolor som är lite sega mitt i.</li><li>Vid 160°C är smeten karamellfast.</li></ul>



<p>“<strong>Mjuk kola</strong>” är inte vad jag siktar på, precis. Jag tycker den blir flottig och obehaglig. Däremot är den klart lättast att skära.<br /><br />“<strong>Hård kola</strong>” vill jag inte <em>riktigt </em>ha, men ganska nära. Vid 140-145 grader blir kolan dessutom nästan omöjlig att skära om man väntar för länge, då får man skära kvickt när den svalnat lagom mycket och inte för mycket (~10-minutersintervall).</p>



<p>“<strong>Lagom kola</strong>” – ungefär 130 grader – brukar jag sikta på. OBS att chokladkola med kakao blir hårdare än vanlig kola och behöver vara några grader mindre varm när man slutar koka den.<br /><br />Bäst blir nog resultatet när man *precis* låter kolan passera 131 grader och häller upp den genast. En stek-termometer som sitter i smeten hela tiden (men INTE nuddar botten) är som tidigare nämnts en bra hjälp. OBS också att man bör  passa på att skära kolan innan den svalnat helt. Lägg de nyskurna bitarna separat med ett par millimeters mellanrum, annars flyter de ihop (om du t ex lämnar dem över natten). OBS att chokladkola med kakao blir hårdare än vanlig kola och  behöver vara några grader mindre varm när man slutar koka den.</p>

De flesta klarade sig, men några fick jag skära isär nästa morgon. </figure>



<p>Det är bra att förbereda en form. Antingen smord eller fodrad med bakplåtspaper (INTE smörpaper), eller hängsle-och-bälten style: smort bakplåtspapper. Jag rekommenderar baksprej, det är jättesmidigt. Annars funkar neutral olja, t ex solrosolja, bra – fukta ett hushållspapper och sprid ut olja tunt över bakplåtspappret. Kolan blir lite fet på ytan (= fastnar inte längre) när den svalnat, men medan den är smält fastnar den obönhörligt i alla ytor som inte är smorda, och sitter som järnet när den stelnat. Vi har förlorat minst en tallrik på för hård (lakrits)kola som fastnat och inte ville lossna.</p>



<p>Kola kokt som jag vill ha den blir riktigt hård och svårhanterlig när den svalnar, lite som glas men förstås inte lika hett. Kokar du till ~130 grader som jag rekommenderar jag att strategiskt skära kolan tvärs över några gånger medan den svalnar, sedan skära i de halvfyllda skårorna –  eller klippa isär, jättesmidigt med bra sax – det skårade kolaflaket till ~3-4 cm breda kola-remsor, sedan skära remsorna i ca 1-1.5 cm breda bitar. De måtten blir en lagom bit för antingen<br />*    lyx-varianten: färdiga kolapapper, finns dyrt på Panduro  (59kr/50 st). Billigare på andra ställen, leta i webbaffärer som <a href="https://www.lyckasmedmat.se/bakning/6124-sweet-kitchen-godispapper-cellofan.html">Lyckasmedmat.se</a> (25kr). Eller<br />*    budget-varianten: vik ett bakplåtspapper (<em>INTE</em> smörpapper) i fyra på längden, klipp i remsor, klipp remsorna i lagom stora bitar. Prova på en kolabit innan du klipper många bitar, det går åt lite mer papper än vad man tror om man ska snurra prydliga knut-rosetter i båda ändar på kolan.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Authors submitting their work to arXiv for the first time undoubtedly have questions. What file types are accepted? What licenses are available? How to format metadata properly? And what is metadata anyway?</p>
<p>Now, arXiv’s new Author Guide offers researchers helpful tips and information throughout the submission process.</p>
<p>Authors activate the guide by simply clicking a button from their <a href="https://arxiv.org/user/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">user account page</a> or on subsequent pages of the submission process. Once launched, the guide highlights and explains elements likely to be unfamiliar to new arXiv authors — and also provides links to more detailed information in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">help section of arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_843" style="width: 1024px;"><img alt="SCreen shot of Author Guide button on user page" class="wp-image-843 size-large" height="330" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/Author-Guide-Screen-Shot--1024x330.png" width="1024" />The Author Guide can be activated from the user account page or any page of the submission process.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Initial feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Data collected regarding guide usage shows that authors who use the tool are more likely to successfully complete the submission process. In responses to a survey built into the guide, users described it as clear, helpful, user-friendly, detailed, and efficient. And, nearly three quarters of survey respondents indicated that they expected to use the Author Guide again in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><b>“The submission process was much easier than before because of the Author Guide.” </b></p>
<p><b>“I think it is a positive add-on to the submission process.”</b></p>
<p><b>“It’s very useful to speed up the submission process.”</b></p>
<p>-Anonymous survey respondents</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Some authors suggested ideas for improvements, and that feedback will be considered for future iterations of the guide.</p>
<p>arXiv aims to help make authors’ lives easier, and the Author Guide is just one feature released recently to do just that.</p>

<p><em>This week, a series of daily blog posts highlight 28 new and reissued BRAIN Initiative funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) for 2021. Today’s post summarizes four award opportunities focused on developing, improving, and advancing our understanding of neural recording, modulation, and stimulation methods in animals and humans.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2867"></span></p>
<p>The first two FOAs aim to enhance our knowledge of the brain by funding research to develop and apply tools for neural recording, modulation, and stimulation. The awards build upon one another but fund separate projects. Proposed projects should involve invasive and/ or non-invasive <em>in vivo</em> technologies useable in behaving animals (vertebrates and invertebrates), and eventually in humans. Applications should include plans to develop new large-scale recording methods, develop tools for circuit manipulation, and/ or link brain activity to behavior.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This FOA supports proof-of-concept testing and development of new technologies and approaches for large-scale neural recording and modulation. This award encourages applicants to creatively address major challenges in this area of research. Proposed projects are expected to be high-risk and can incorporate diverse types of signaling beyond neuronal electrical activity, and may use modalities such as optical, magnetic, acoustic, and genetic recording/ manipulation. Applications are due on <strong>May 4, 2021.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-019.html">RFA-NS-18-019</a> <strong>Optimization of Transformative Technologies for Large Scale Recording and </strong><strong>Modulation in the Nervous System </strong>(Reissue of RFA-NS-17-004; U01)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This FOA aims to optimize existing and emerging technologies related to recording and modulating neural activity. Funding is intended for the iterative refinement of tools that have already gone through proof-of-concept testing (see <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-18-020.html">RFA-NS-18-020</a>). Projects can utilize various modalities for neural signal recording and modulation. This award can support hardware/ software development and the broad dissemination of tools into regular neuroscience practice. Applications are due on <strong>May 4, 2021.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Despite recent advances in neurotechnologies, we know little about how they affect the brain at a basic cellular or circuit level. The next FOA funds research to study the biological effects of novel neural perturbation technologies, or invasive and non-invasive tools that stimulate, inhibit, or modulate neural activity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-20-006.html">RFA-NS-20-006</a> <strong>Biology and Biophysics of Neural Stimulation </strong>(Reissue of RFA-NS-18-018; R01)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This FOA seeks to systematically characterize, model, and validate the membrane, cellular, circuit, and adaptive biological responses of neuronal and non-neuronal cells to neural perturbation. Proposed projects to advance our understanding of the biological and bioinformatic content of these signals are also encouraged. Funding can support experiments designed to characterize responses in several model systems, including <em>in vitro</em>, animals, and humans. Proposals to develop new technologies, therapies, and disease models are not applicable to this FOA. Application due dates are <strong>February 2, June 1, </strong>and <strong>October 1, 2021.</strong></p>

<p>Loes Janssen and Marie-Louise Kullberg used their ongoing Parent-Adolescent Interaction study as a baseline to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">investigate the well-being of Dutch</a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240962" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">adolescents and parents</a> in April 2020, about one month after the participants were initially subject to local lockdown procedures. I spoke with the two researchers about the biggest surprise of their study, the need for diverse coping strategies, and one lesson that they hope the general public can take from their paper as lockdowns continue. </p>



<p><strong><em>How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?</em></strong></p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we suddenly had to work from home and pause the data collection of our PhD research project (‘RE-PAIR’). Within the RE-PAIR project, we already collected ecological momentary assessments (EMA) on mood and parenting behaviors in healthy adolescents and their parents during the past few years. Not being involved in any data collection due to the pandemic could mean having a lot of time to write papers… However, we both like to have some variation in the types of tasks we need to do. As for many researchers from all kind of disciplines—from immunologist to historians—the beginning of March also felt as an opportunity for us, psychologists, to investigate the impact of these exceptional circumstances.</p>



<p>Within our research group, we decided to repeat the EMA to investigate the impact of the pandemic on mood and parenting in daily life, as we already had nice and complete baseline data of our families. By assessing mood and parenting at multiple moments per day, we were able to gain fine-grained insight into the impact of the pandemic on well-being in daily life.</p>



<p><strong><em>Were any of your findings particularly surprising or were the results of your study relatively in line with your expectations?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, we were partly surprised by our findings. We expected that the COVID-19 pandemic would have had a more negative impact on well-being of parents, adolescents and parenting behavior, and we only found support for this regarding negative affect of parents. We also expected that a person’s intolerance of uncertainty would predict an increase in their negative affect and a decrease in their positive affect. This was not the case in our study.</p>



<p>However, we did expect and found individual differences among our participants: for some parents, negative affect increased, while for others it remained the same or even decreased. This makes sense, since spending more time together as a family could also have positive effects for some families. Moreover, our sample consisted of a fairly healthy group of parents and adolescents, living in favorable circumstances, which might make the situation more bearable as compared to families who struggle with mental or physical health problems or living in less fortunate environments.</p>



<p><strong><em>While the struggles that the parents and adolescents in your study face tend to differ (ex. the adolescents struggled with boredom whereas the parents did not), some of the coping mechanisms (watching tv-shows and online contact with friends and relatives) were effective for both groups. Why do you think that was the case with some but not all coping mechanisms?</em></strong></p>



<p>We feel it is important to acknowledge that persons from different ages/stages in life (as parents versus adolescents in our study) cope differently with negative situations and emotions: Adolescents are in a phase that they start to spend more time with friends and being away from their family, whereas parents often like to keep the family close and, for instance, cook and dine together. Nonetheless, almost everyone brightens up from some social contact (even online) or behavioral activation (e.g. cooking, walking, painting etc.), as can be seen in the image below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-18575" height="572" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/Janssen_graph-1024x572.jpg" width="1024" /></figure>



<p><strong><em>The manuscript ends with advice for policy makers regarding the “one size does not fit all” effectiveness of coping strategies. Since this study occurred in April, have you noticed any improvements to the availability and diversity of coping strategies?</em></strong></p>



<p>Within the Dutch policy to control Corona outbreaks, regulate hospital admissions and protect vulnerable people, the government emphasizes to remain healthy, also by doing sports, for instance. Also, even though the numbers of corona-infected cases increased during a few weeks the past months (Fall 2020), schools remained open. As we know from recent research as well, this is important as children and adolescent friendships predict resilient functioning (van Harmelen et al., 2020). Going to school enables them to easily meet their friends.</p>



<p>However, we feel policy makers could inform citizens more on practical coping strategies for families to foster mental well-being. We know for instance that staying active and exercising can boost your mood, but without a regular commute to work and regular sports activities, it is good to provide some alternative strategies which fit all different levels of lockdown.</p>



<p><strong><em>Several potential factors that could be further studied are mentioned in the article, but do you think applying your methodology to other populations of people or during a different 2-week stretch of the pandemic would provide useful data?</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, we believe that applying the methodology of EMA to other populations could provide us with useful information on which groups of people are struggling in the current situation. For instance, gaining insights in how parents or adolescents with psychological problems, such as anxiety or depression, are affected by the pandemic. </p>



<p>The timing of our study is also of importance. We have collected data during the first part of the lockdown in the Netherlands, without any prospect of relaxation of the regulations. If we would study mental well-being now, during the current—less strict but still prolonging—lockdown, we might get different results.</p>



<p><strong><em>If the general public were to take one lesson from your study, what should that be?</em></strong></p>



<p>As we will still spend a lot of time at home, conflicts and irritations among household members could make it hard to keep the atmosphere at home comfortable, a piece of practical advice to families is to cherish small positive interactions with each other on a regular basis. For instance, ask each other which person you admire and why, or go for a short walk together. Even those small activities or conversations could improve the overall family atmosphere. Above all, we need to keep in mind that all families are different, so within the possibilities, find what suits your family best to remain sane together.</p>

In a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02242/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_1456740_69_Psycho_20201013_arts_A%5C">new paper</a>, in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>, Alessandro Ansani at Roma Tre University, Italy, and colleagues report work aimed at filling in some of the gaps.</p>



<span id="more-41061"></span>



<p>The team recruited 118 online participants who each watched a video clip that was just under two minutes long. It showed a man slowly walking towards tall windows in the columned corridor of an old building. The seaside was visible through the windows, in the distance. As the researchers describe it, he “walks, looks outside, stops, and moves out of the frame.” </p>



<p>At the same time, some of the participants heard the ambient sound that was recorded during the filming, while some heard an extract of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbbtmskCRUY&amp;ab_channel=Variatio24">The Isle of the Dead</a>” by Sergei Rachmaninov (a “dogged and anxious” orchestral piece), and the rest heard “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFoapxPvZy4&amp;ab_channel=DrMabuse05">Like Someone in Love</a>” by Bill Evans (a “soft, melancholic” piano jazz solo). The participants then filled in questionnaires that asked about their perceptions of the man’s emotions, thoughts and personality, and how pleasant they thought the environment was .</p>



<p>Compared with the other groups, those who’d heard the jazz reported feeling more empathy for the man, and perceived him to be more introverted. The Rachmaninov group felt him to be more conscientious, however. Participants who heard either music soundtrack perceived him to be more agreeable than those who only heard ambient sounds. Those who’d heard the jazz were also more likely to feel that the man was remembering a pleasant event in the past compared with the Rachmaninov listeners, who were more inclined to think that he was planning something. The jazz group also perceived his environment to be cosier. A second study with a batch of 92 students largely replicated these findings.</p>



<p>These findings highlight “the multifaceted influence of the soundtrack on the interpretation of a scene,” the researchers write. We humans have an incessant need to search for knowledge everywhere, they add, and to fill in gaps using inference and imagination. “To understand the plot of a novel or movie, we need to know the characters’ goals and personalities, and if we have no information whatsoever, we try to take advantage of any cue to guess them.” Music, it seems, can act as a complex cue, allowing us to build up a picture of a person and a scene.</p>



<p>Though the original group watched the film out of the lab, the results may not extend to typical viewers of movies. While the participants did consistently report particular impressions of the man’s personality and thoughts when asked to do so, that doesn’t necessarily mean that people spontaneously form such impressions unprompted while watching a blockbuster on their sofa. However, though we would all probably expect movie soundtracks to have an impact on us, this research does help to address a previous criticism that actual research in this field has been sparse.</p>

<p><strong>Neurobiology of Pain and Endogenous Opioids</strong></p>
<p>BRAIN aims to understand how neural circuit activity translates to sensory, emotional, and cognitive functions, all of which are closely related to or controlled by pain circuits and/ or endogenous opioid systems. Pain conditions and the opioid crisis are important national public health concerns. As such, the BRAIN Initiative is now funding projects to elucidate the basic neurobiology and circuits of pain processing, analgesia, and the brain mechanisms implicated in opioid use.</p>
<p>Please see notices <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-18-008.html">NOT-NS-18-008</a> (pain) and <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-18-046.html">NOT-DA-10-046</a> (opioids) for more details.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Data Science and Standardization</strong></p>
<p>The BRAIN Initiative and neuroscience as a whole are generating massive amounts of data that span modalities, spatiotemporal scales, and species. Largely driven by recent innovations in high-throughput -omics profiling, optical microscopy, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging, brain data is rapidly growing. The FOAs below support new approaches to analyze, archive, and standardize the collection of these data. For all awards collaborations with scientists from other disciplines are encouraged. </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The “tragedy of the commons” was popularised in the 1960s as a way of explaining how public or shared resources which we’re incentivised to use can become depleted or ruined by individual self-interest. And because we have <em>shared</em> ownership of public resources we feel we have less responsibility for them and therefore less of an impetus to contribute time, energy or money to keeping them going.</p>



<p>As we become more aware (and more concerned) about threats to the environment, the tragedy of the commons seems even more pertinent. How do we keep parks, rivers, lakes and other local resources well-maintained? According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022242920952084">new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Marketing, </em>it might come down to a sense of ownership — the more we feel a property or resource is ours, the better we’ll take care of it.</p>



<span id="more-41056"></span>



<p>The focus of the first study was a lake, where 135 participants had rented kayaks. The rental service largely catered to those with no experience of the lake, meaning they were unlikely to have any sense of ownership of the area before their visit. Some of the kayak renters were asked to think of and write down a nickname for the lake, while others were not; all renters were then told that they should pick up objects or trash they found floating in the lake.</p>



<p>Two experimenters then watched the participants and recorded any attempts to pick up floating objects (which had been planted in the lake by the team). When the participants returned their kayaks, they indicated whether or not they had picked up any rubbish and how much ownership they felt toward the lake.</p>



<p>Those who had given the lake a nickname reported significantly higher levels of psychological ownership of the lake than those who had not. They were also more likely to actually take care of the lake: 41% attempted to pick up the floating objects, compared to just 7% of those in the control condition.</p>



<p>In the second study, participants imagined walking in a park, seeing a sign that said either “welcome to the park” or “welcome to <em>your</em> park” (emphasis added). Participants were then asked how much responsibility they felt for the park, how obligated they felt towards the park, how accountable they felt for it, and whether or not they would pick up rubbish in the park. Participants were also asked how much of $100 they would donate to the park.</p>



<p>Again, boosting feelings of ownership by highlighting that it was “your” park increased participants’ perceived responsibility for the park. This led these participants to say they would be more likely to pick up rubbish, and to increase their intended donation amount by an average of $8. </p>



<p>The third study, back in the real world, looked at cross country skiers. When renting skis, participants were offered a map of the park: some were asked to plan their route on the map before they set out, while others were not. All renters were then asked whether or not they wanted to add a dollar to the rental fee to help the park, before indicating how likely they would be to volunteer for the park, donate in the future, or engage with the park on social media. Participants who planned their route again reported greater responsibility for the park, and were also more likely to say they’d donate to the park and volunteer in future.</p>



<p>A final study, lab-based study found that a commonly used device — an attendance sign which highlighted that a participant was the 22,452th visitor of the week — reduced the beneficial effects of boosting feelings of psychological ownership. This suggests that when people see themselves as just one individual in a larger group, they felt less responsibility towards the environment.</p>



<p>While the results do suggest clear interventions that could benefit publicly owned goods, the whole point of such resources is that they’re <em>shared</em> — the fact they’re collectively owned is exactly why we’re able to enjoy their many benefits. So should we be encouraging people to think of them as their <em>individual</em> property? Collectivism puts an emphasis on group collaboration and shared interests — factors that could play a part in preserving local resources. </p>



<p>Further research could look into interventions that seek to increase feelings of local collectivity, exploring how that, rather than individualism, might change people’s relationship with their surroundings.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Shreyah Iyer will talk about her project "Speech Emotion recognition using deep neural networks using Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Speech is a very important context in understanding human emotions for example
in psychology and criminology as the effects of emotions in voice can be
recognized by all people irrespective of the language of speech. In this
presentation I will talk about an ongoing KTP Project on Speech Emotion
Recognition system.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to build a system which can interpret the underlying
emotion from an audio/speech signal. So far, I have worked on using Deep
Learning architectures, i.e CNN’s with most widely used features for emotion
detection such as MFCC’s and Mel-spectrograms. I have especially investigated
what the best way is to use the coefficients extracted from MFCC’s. I have
worked on are two publicly available Speech Emotion Corpus i.e., TESS and
RAVDESS. Results conducted on these experiments show that the MFCC’s features
with an optimal stack length supersedes the other CNN architectures used.</p>
<p>In this presentation I will also talk about the challenges and future work for
this project.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Awe, compassion, love, gratitude… research papers and media stories about these emotions abound. Indeed, the past decade has seen an explosion in work on positive emotions — essentially, emotions that involve pleasant rather than unpleasant feelings. However, very little has been done to explore which distinct feelings, thoughts and motivations characterise each one, argue Aaron Weidman and Jessica Tracy at the University of British Columbia. In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-54608-001">new paper</a> in <em>Emotion, </em>they report their detailed investigation into these subjective experiences — an investigation that has led them to drop some commonly accepted positive emotions from their master list.</p>



<span id="more-41050"></span>



<p>Weidman and Tracy began with 18 positive emotions, all of which had been studied in recent papers. These were: admiration, amusement, attachment love, awe, compassion, contentment, empathy, enthusiasm, gratitude, happiness, hope, interest, love, nurturant love, romantic love, schadenfreude, sympathy and tenderness. (Pride has been studied down to the level of its subjective elements in work previously led by Tracy, so wasn’t included in the new research.)</p>



<p>The pair sorted these emotions into five thematic groups: “other-appreciation” (e.g. gratitude), caring (e.g. empathy, compassion), enjoyment (e.g. happiness, contentment) and loving. A total of 150 undergraduate students were each presented with one of the five groups and asked to report up to 10 subjective “elements” of each emotion in that group. For example, participants wrote “I felt concern for someone” as a subjective element of sympathy, and listed “I was on top the world” as an element of enthusiasm.</p>



<p>By identifying elements that seemed to best capture unique aspects of each emotion, the pair whittled more than 1,000 frequently experienced subjective elements to a list of 475, covering the five thematic groups. A fresh batch of participants were then asked to reflect on how they had felt during a given emotion, and to identify elements that best matched those feelings from the relevant group list. Using their responses, Weidman and Tracy homed in on yet smaller lists of elements that best matched each individual emotion.</p>



<p>However, it was not possible to create a distinct set of elements for every emotion. In one striking example, no unique element stood out to separate “compassion” from “empathy” and “tenderness” — and so compassion was dropped from their list of positive emotions. Neither could the pair clearly differentiate between the subjective elements of “happiness” and “contentment”, which went into the next round as “happiness/contentment”. “Love” also failed to make the cut, because it was not distinguishable from its sub-types, which had their own unique elements — in fact, Weidman and Tracy found clear support for a sub-type of “attachment love” (involving a close, secure bond with someone), as well as “nurturant love” (more to do with being dedicated to helping someone else to grow) and “romantic love”.</p>



<p>To shrink the element lists to a number practical for use in a scale — and also in a bid to check for agreement between people from different backgrounds — the pair then recruited a fresh batch of more than 1,000 participants. This group comprised men and women who identified as White or East Asian, and who were born either in the US or Canada or in another country. As in the second study, they were asked to rate how relevant various elements were to each emotion.</p>



<p>The researchers found that the six participant groups tended to agree about their subjective experiences of the now 15 emotions. They then used a statistical technique to prune their responses into the final product: 5- to 8-item self-report scales for each of these positive emotions.</p>



<p>The pair argue that their work has various implications. Firstly, though they did find some overlap between elements associated with the different emotions (which will need investigating further), the work supports the relatively modern idea that we experience a range of discrete positive emotions. Also, the research supports the argument that love is not a unitary construct.</p>



<p>Some of their other conclusions will be more controversial, however. For example “happiness” and “contentment” are often conceptualised as distinct emotions, but this is not what they concluded. Neither did they find support for the idea that “joy” and “elation” are independent, discrete emotions — items that reflected both these concepts fell readily under the “happiness/contentment” heading. The loss of “compassion” from the list of positive emotions will be contentious, too.</p>



<p>The new scales clearly need more testing — and it’s important to note that all the participants, no matter where they were born, were living in the US or Canada, which limits generalisability. However, one of the problems with existing work on positive emotions is that different teams often use different measures, making it hard to compare results. If these scales can be accepted, they will help to make work in the field more standardised.</p>



<p>The pair certainly acknowledge that there’s much still to be done, however: “We hope that this work marks a first step in the development of a taxonomy of subjectively experienced positive emotions,” they write — “a model of exactly how many positive emotions are experienced as subjectively distinct, as well as the distinguishing set of subjective elements, causal antecedents, and functional consequences that characterize each of these states.” </p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What do you do if your child comes home with a lower score on a test than you both expected? Do you praise their efforts and focus on what they got right? Or do you home in on the answers that they got wrong, hoping this will help them to do better in future?</p>



<p>Research shows that the first, “success-oriented” response is more common in the US than in China, where parents more often opt for “failure-oriented” responses instead. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-59134-001">Recent studies in both countries </a>have found that success-oriented responses tend to encourage psychological wellbeing but not necessarily academic success, whereas failure-oriented responses can foster academic performance, but with a cost to the child’s wellbeing.</p>



<p>Jun Wei at Tsinghua University, China, and colleagues wondered what might drive these observed relationships: do different response styles lead children to form different concepts about what their parents want for them — and is this what produces the opposing impacts on wellbeing? In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-79116-001">new paper</a>, published in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>, the team report some intriguing answers to these questions.</p>



<span id="more-41039"></span>



<p>The researchers studied 447 American children from three schools in the US and 439 children from a school in southern China. The children were in the same grade of school and were, on average, 13 at the start of the study. They completed a batch of initial surveys, and then a further batch a year later.</p>



<p>In one of the initial surveys, the children were asked to imagine that they had done very well and then very poorly on a school test, and indicate the extent to which they thought their parents would emphasise the successful aspects of their performance, or the negatives (e.g.  “My parents would talk about why I didn’t get an even higher score” if they had done well, or “My parents would talk about how I had not worked hard” if they had done poorly).</p>



<p>Along with surveys of general wellbeing and symptoms of anxiety and depression, the children also answered questions about their perceptions of their parents’ goals for them. Responses to statements such as “How important is it to your parents for you to believe in your abilities?” were used to probe parental goals relating to self-worth, while statements such as “How important is to your parents for you to always try to overcome your weaknesses?” explored the extent to which the children thought that their parents held “self-improvement” goals for them.  </p>



<p>The team found that, in both countries, children who felt that their parents were more success-oriented in their responses were more likely to feel that their parents held self-worth goals for them, and statistically speaking, this went a long way to explaining higher levels of general wellbeing in this group a year later. In the US only, stronger perceptions that parents held self-worth goals were also associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression a year on. Why wasn’t this seen in the children in China, too? It might be because children in China are subject to more academic stress, because of the format of the school examination system, the team suggests — and the impact of this on symptoms of anxiety and depression overwhelms any variations relating to parental response style.</p>



<p>In both the US and China, the team also found that the more parents used failure-oriented responses, the more the children felt that their parents held self-improvement goals for them — and in China only, the more they felt their parents were concerned about their self-worth too. This may be “because Chinese parents convey their belief in their children’s potential by urging them to strive to do better”, the researchers write.</p>



<p>However, failure-oriented responses from the parents were also associated with decreased wellbeing among the American children, and higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms in kids from both countries.  “It could be that when parents highlight the negative aspects of their children’s performance, adolescents feel incompetent, regardless of whether they perceive their parents as wanting them to constantly strive to self-improve,” the researchers write. “The thwarted need for competence may dampen adolescents’ psychological functioning.”</p>



<p>The team did home in only a few dimensions of the parent-child relationship, which is, of course, complex. For parents everywhere, it would certainly be interesting to know whether the positive academic effects of a failure-oriented response style could be gained without a cost to wellbeing — could an emphasis on praising successes with a dash of observation of any failures of effort work best, perhaps? I know that as parent, that’s what I aim for. But only future research will reveal if it’s actually a good strategy for my children.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/DNA-Seq_29464384_C-Mopic-fotolia.de-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When BMC published its first journals back in 2000, it made high quality research open to anyone who wanted to access and use it. By making open access sustainable, it changed the world of academic publishing. Amongst the first disciplines to successfully embrace open access was genetics and genomics, with BMC launching a number of journals in this important field in its first year</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, BMC continues to recognize the importance of genetics and genomics with a number of our community-specific journals celebrating their 20th anniversaries, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genetics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As we reflect on our long-standing reputation as an open access pioneer, we remain passionate about promoting open science practices and responding to researcher’s needs in this vital field. One aspect that we view as central to this mission is the sharing of research data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that research data often lie hidden until shared via a repository and/or through a research article that uses the data to support conclusions and analyses. We understand that not all valuable research is suited to traditional research articles and are committed to making visible research that would otherwise be hidden away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this commitment, we are delighted to announce that </span><a href="https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genetics</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be renamed in 2021 as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genomic Data, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the goal of promoting open science through the sharing of genomic and genetic data. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genomic Data, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">built on the firm foundations of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genetics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will welcome submissions of genetic and genomic datasets, descriptions of data and manuscripts that analyse existing or new datasets. By providing a dedicated home for content </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that may not meet the criteria for a traditional research article</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we hope to better serve the evolving needs of the genetics and genomics community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a core offering of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genomic Data,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we are particularly excited to introduce our new ‘data note’ article type, designed specifically for descriptions of genetic and genomic datasets. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By encouraging the sharing, describing and citing of data, we hope to make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genomic Data</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a home for genomic and genetic datasets, data-focused research, and key developments in open data in general – going forward we will welcome opinions on how this journal can lead the way in open and reproducible science.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genomic Data </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is supported by an international editorial board, bringing with them a wealth of knowledge and expertise in genomic data and all published articles published will undergo rigorous peer review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to working with you in advancing data sharing in this important field and offering you a home for all your research, whatever format that may take. </span></p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>Psychology is arguably the poster child for the replication crisis, but other fields suffer from similar issues too</strong>. At <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/psychology-s-replication-crisis-inspires-ecologists-push-more-reliable-research">Cathleen O’Grady examines the efforts by ecologists to tackle their own field’s reproducibility problems</a>, and how they are learning from the experience of psychologists.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have created a safer version of the psychoactive drug ibogaine, and it seems to improve behaviours associated with addiction and depression in rats.</strong> Past work had suggested that ibogaine may help treat drug addictions — but it can also have fatal side-effects, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/09/944572325/progress-toward-a-safer-psychedelic-drug-to-treat-depression-and-addiction">reports Jon Hamilton</a> at <em>NPR</em>. So in the new work, scientists tweaked the structure of the molecule to create a substance that is safer but which still has beneficial properties. It remains to be seen whether it works for humans.</p>

<p><strong>The shortest day of the year is nearly upon us <strong>—</strong> but if you’ve found yourself taken aback by the dark evenings, you’re not alone. </strong>Even though we experience dark winter nights every year, there are psychological reasons why we might “forget” about them and find it unsettling when they come around again, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxvm8/why-we-forget-how-early-it-gets-dark-every-year">explains Shayla Love</a> at <em>Vice</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>The uncertainty of 2020 has been difficult for a lot of us. </strong>But some people find it particularly challenging to deal with feelings of uncertainty, <a href="https://theconversation.com/learning-to-cope-with-uncertainty-during-covid-19-151420">writes Jayne Morriss</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. Greater “intolerance” of uncertainty can leave people feeling distressed and make even good outcomes appear less satisfactory <strong><strong>—</strong></strong> but, Morriss explains, there are a number of strategies which may help to reduce this “uncertainty distress”.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>Scientists have <strong>implanted an array of electrodes into the visual cortex of two macaques, which allow the monkeys to “see” shapes corresponding to the pattern of stimulation</strong>.</strong> The work holds promise for restoring some amount of sight to people who are blind and whose optic nerve is damaged. But it is harder to access the relevant brain regions in humans, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2261853-brain-stimulation-device-lets-monkeys-see-shapes-without-using-eyes/">explains Michael Le Page</a> at <em>New Scientist </em><strong><strong>—</strong></strong> and fairly crude artificial vision is not necessarily desired by the blind community.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>People with “dark” personality traits are manipulative and self-centred <strong><strong>—</strong></strong> but does that actually help them get ahead? </strong>In some lab-based tasks, perhaps, <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed">write Craig Neumann and Scott Barry Kaufman</a> at <em>Psyche</em>, but when it comes to real life they actually have limited success.</p>

<p><strong>This weekend, the Cosmic Shambles Network is hosting a 24 hour online show, “<a href="https://cosmicshambles.com/ninelessons">Nine Lessons and Carols for Socially Distanced People</a>“, with profits going to charity. </strong>The line-up looks fantastic, with comedians, authors, actors, musicians, and scientists all taking part — including a bunch of psychologists and neuroscientists (such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/podcast/">PsychCrunch podcast</a> presenter Ginny Smith!).</p>

A team of researchers in England has retracted a 2014 paper after a graduate student affiliated with the group found a fatal error while trying to replicate parts of the work — and which might affect similar studies by other scientists, as well.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ggtXoRqpVeM/">Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future: Essay Challenge</a></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.healthra.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Health Research Alliance</a> (HRA) and the <a href="https://plos.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS) have partnered to launch the <strong>Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future </strong>Essay Challenge.</p>



<p>The biomedical research enterprise experienced a year of reckoning in 2020. Global cooperation to create a COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented pace shows the promise of research. Yet the pandemic, the resulting economic and social uncertainties, and the urgency of addressing systemic racial and regional inequities all add to longstanding concerns about the sustainability of the biomedical research enterprise. We need a new vision for a healthier future. The <strong>Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future </strong>Essay Challenge is your opportunity to propose systemic changes that re-commit to serving society and achieving an equitable, diverse, and creative environment for <strong>all </strong>those working to advance scientific discovery and improve human well-being.</p>



<h3><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>



<p>We invite you to submit a 1500-word essay following these <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vg4rQ26IOuBmY_cC8C1CRmQFlISIr3UU/view?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a>. The winning essay will be published in either <em>PLOS Biology</em> or <em>PLOS Medicine, </em>and will also receive a US $5,000 prize. There will also be recognition for up to four essays receiving honorable mentions.</p>



<p>We encourage you to think critically about the current state of biomedical research, globally. We hope our challenge stimulates you to confer with colleagues and consider submitting an individual or multi-authored essay that will propose and elaborate new ideas addressing the challenges for the field – for example:</p>



<ul><li>Innovative ways to move away from contemporary and reductive metrics of success and towards efforts that measurably improve everyday lives (e.g. advances in diagnostics, therapy, drug discovery, health services, and novel solutions to reduce health inequities).</li><li>Bold ideas to realign incentives for behaviors that advance discovery, support healthcare decision makers, and benefit society.</li><li>New ways to frame transparency and rigor as Open Scholarship values, not just checklists or hurdles, to improve societal trust in science.</li><li>Strategies to build an equitable, open, and transparent research ecosystem that values, empowers, and nurtures diversity. </li><li>Approaches that depend on creativity and innovation and not on the need for “more” (e.g.  more money, more data, more publications, etc.)</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Winner, and Honorable Mentions</strong></h3>



<p>The winning essay judged to have the most potential for inspiring change will be published either in <em>PLOS Biology</em> or <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, whichever is deemed by PLOS the most appropriate venue for the essay. It will also be awarded US $5,000.</p>



<p>Up to four essays will be recognized by an honorable mention, and these will be published on the PLOS Blogs Network and will each receive a US $2,500 prize.</p>



<h3><strong>Symposium</strong></h3>



<p>The authors of the winning essay, and authors from honorably mentioned essays, will be invited to present their ideas in a <strong>Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future </strong>Symposium hosted by HRA and PLOS in September 2021. </p>



<h3><strong>Deadline: March 11, 2021</strong></h3>



<p>This date is the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic. It has been chosen to honor those who have experienced so much suffering during this pandemic, and to help convey the real-world importance of this reimagining.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Anyone who’s been invested in an election result will understand the close relationship between politics and emotion — something that is perhaps even more affecting when that result is disappointing. After the 2016 presidential election, for example, articles appeared in the US press describing a “<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/09/trump-induced-anxiety-is-a-real-thing.html">national nervous breakdown</a>” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/opinion/depressed-by-politics-just-let-go.html">offering tips</a> to deal with so-called “political depression”, and empirical <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178117320322?via%3Dihub">studies</a> indicated that the same event had caused psychological distress.</p>



<p>But while it would be hard to deny that politics can have a serious impact on our mood, is it correct to call that “depression”? Almog Simchon at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and team ask this question in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-27301-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology </em>— and while they find <em>self-reported</em> “Trump depression” in liberal Americans post-election, the empirical data suggests this isn’t an enduring or even clinically significant experience.</p>



<span id="more-41011"></span>



<p>In the first part of the study, participants indicated which political party they felt the greatest identification with, as well as which presidential candidate they had voted for in 2016; they then indicated how down, depressed and hopeless they had felt for the year before the election, the two weeks before the election, and from the election until the day of the survey, which took place in May 2018. As expected, those who identified as Democrats reported feeling more depressed after the election, with the opposite effect to be found in Republicans.</p>



<p>The team then repeated the experiment with new participants — only now all references to the election were omitted, with questions instead focusing purely on the timeframes involved. This time, there was no evidence of a post-election increase in depression among Democrats. This suggests that the emotional valence of certain events can change the stories we tell about ourselves and our lives.</p>



<p>The next study looked more broadly at liberal American responses to the election using real time data about people’s moods at the time of the election. To do this, the team used a machine learning algorithm originally designed to detect depression from social media users’ posts. The team analysed over 10 million tweets posted between October and November 2016, and while there <em>was</em> an effect on Democrats’ moods in the first few days after the election, this response was not long-lived: by November 13th, moods had returned to their pre-election baseline. A similar analysis of Google searches, looking for terms such as “depression”, “depression symptoms”, and “depression test” also found no indication that the election had caused a significant increase in depression.</p>



<p>Social media <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">may not be the best gauge</a> for understanding the long-term impact of an event on mental health — Twitter in particular is fast-moving and responsive to ongoing events, and not necessarily so good at capturing deeper or more persistent effects. But the findings do suggest, again, that emotional responses to the election were more ephemeral than the term “depression” might suggest.</p>



<p>Two final studies looked at real world attempts to seek help for depression. The first looked at state-level antidepressant consumption on Medicaid between 2016 and 2017, and the second at the number of people seeking treatment for depression before and after the election, using a data set that also contained daily information about depression and political affiliation.</p>



<p>For the state-level data, the team found that the state’s political affiliation — Democratic or Republican — had no bearing on changes in antidepressant usage from before to after the election. And in the second study, there was no evidence that the depression levels of liberal Americans increased after the election.</p>



<p>So it seems that reports of “Trump depression” are not quite accurate: in every study other than the first — in which participants were specifically reminded of the election — there was no evidence at all that depression had increased after the election.</p>



<p>The team suggests that self-reports of post-election depression could be somewhat performative, signalling group identity and ideological beliefs. This might not tell the whole story, though — there’s no evidence here that the feelings of distress or hopelessness felt by liberals after the election were false or purely performative, just that they weren’t clinically significant or persistent enough to be considered depression per se.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to look further into the traits and demographics of those reporting feelings of distress. If you’re a wealthy person with liberal politics, for example, then an election win for a pro-austerity party might be distressing but is unlikely to have as significant an impact on the material conditions of your life as that of someone on a low wage or in precarious work. Would the latter party be more likely to experience depression? And what protective factors are at play when it comes to weathering political distress?</p>



<p>The team partly puts the use of the term “Trump depression” down to “concept creep”, an expanding or overgeneralisation of the terminology of mental illness or trauma. It therefore seems important to develop a way to talk about distress — political or otherwise — outside of such terms, which can often be stigmatising or lacking in nuance. Using clinical terms unnecessarily might seem validating, but only serves to diminish both the experiences of those living with serious mental illness and the range of normal emotions that we experience across our political, social and personal lives. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> released <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/">a new feature empowering arXiv authors to link their Machine Learning articles to associated code</a>. Developed in an <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration with <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/about">Papers with Code</a>, the tool was met with great enthusiasm from arXiv’s ML community.</p>
<p>Now, we’re expanding the capability beyond Machine Learning to arXiv papers in every category. And, to better align with our arXiv communities, <a href="https://medium.com/paperswithcode/papers-with-code-is-expanding-to-more-sciences-5d375d10ca3a">PwC is launching new sites</a> in computer science, physics, mathematics, astronomy and statistics to help researchers explore code in these fields.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/"><img alt="Screenshot of abstract page with code tab highlighted" class="wp-image-710 size-full aligncenter" height="782" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png" width="924" /></a></p>
<p>As part of this expansion, PwC is indexing 600,000 additional papers, automatically detecting and linking to the code libraries for papers in categories beyond Machine Learning and also continuing to identify code, results, and methods within ML.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.paperswithcode.com/"><img alt="Image of Papers with Code portal sites" class="wp-image-830 size-medium alignleft" height="300" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/PwC-Portals-222x300.png" width="222" /></a>Authors can sync their code to display on arXiv abstract pages from either their <a href="https://arxiv.org/user/">arXiv user account page</a> or the <a href="https://portal.paperswithcode.com">Papers with Code</a> interface, if the code is not automatically detected.</p>
<p>This expansion was driven by the broader research community’s demand. After the October release, researchers beyond ML expressed a desire for easy access to relevant code. Researchers in physics, astronomy, and other fields began adding their work to PwC. To answer the popular demand, we worked together with PwC to formally support additional fields.</p>
<p>arXiv authors and readers value speed and openness, and instant access to publicly available code supports both.</p>

If the paywall sites are going to attract more consumers, and provide them safe harbor from the free-news vortex, then Radcliffe says they’ll need to make a better case for why it’s worth the money. That means letting people know the actual cost of producing journalism, and what’s at risk if you don’t financially support it. Otherwise, big publications will only serve a minority of the population, small publications will struggle to survive, and people who have grown accustomed to free news will continue to seek it out, even if it ends up not really being news at all.

<p>As a short modeling session for an electrophysiology course at the University of Zurich, I made a  tutorial for students to play around with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in a Colab Notebook / Python, which does not require them to install Python. You’ll find the code online on a small Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Hodgkin-Huxley-CC-VC" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Hodgkin-Huxley-CC-VC</a></p>



<p>Using the code, the students can not only play around with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, but also replicate in silico the experiments they have done when patching cells in slices (including voltage clamp experiment).</p>



<p>It is really rewarding to be able to reproduce current clamp (recording the membrane potential) and voltage clamp experiments (recording the currents while clamping the voltage to a constant value), because this also allows to replicate computationally the experiments and plots generated experimentally by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/">Hodgkin and Huxley</a>.</p>



<p>Below, you see a part of the code, the result of a simulation of a Hodgkin-Huxley model. The top configuration was run in current clamp, with a current pulse injected between 40 and 80 ms, which triggered a single action potential. The lower configuration was run in voltage clamp, with the holding potential stepping from -70 mV to -30 mV between 40 and 80 ms. You can clearly see the active conductanves (deactivating sodium conductance in blue and non-deactivating potassium conductance in orange):</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>When it comes to memory for music, humans show an interesting quirk: we’re better at remembering melodies that are sung by voice, compared to those played on an instrument. Even a melody sung without any lyrics — just a series of <em>la la las</em>, for instance — becomes lodged in our memory in a way that a tune played on the piano, say, does not.</p>



<span id="more-40981"></span>



<p>Now a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720303334">new study published in <em>Cognition</em></a> has looked into <em>why </em>our memory is so much better for sung melodies. Researchers have suggested that listening to a voice singing a melody leads us to perform “subvocalisations” — internal speech that involves tiny movements of the muscles involved in speaking (you’re probably doing it right now as you read this text). But we can’t mimic an instrumental piece in the same way. After all, it’s easy to repeat “la la la” in your head, but not to reproduce the sound of piano keys.</p>



<p>Psychologists already know that this kind of silent rehearsal boosts memory for words — and that memory is impaired if we speak or make movements of the mouth and tongue, which interferes with these subvocalisations. So, theorised Michael Weiss and colleagues at the University of Montreal, if a similar process is responsible for our superior memory for vocal melodies, then people’s memory should be compromised if they make other mouth movements or sounds while listening.</p>



<p>In the first study, the team asked 38 participants to listen to 24 melodies, which were based on British and Irish folk tunes. Half of the tunes were played on the piano, and half were sung (as “la la la”). While listening to the melodies, half of the participants chewed gum vigorously, while the others squeezed a bean bag with their hand.</p>



<p>After taking a break to fill in questionnaires, the participants then completed a surprise recognition task, in which they heard the same 24 melodies as well as 24 new ones. They simply had to indicate whether or not they had heard each tune previously.</p>



<p>Similar to the findings of past work, participants were better at recognising the vocal melodies than the piano ones. But this “voice advantage” was the same whether participants had been chewing gum or squeezing the bean bag while listening. That is, the chewing motion — which uses the same muscles as articulating a word— had no effect on participants’ memory, suggesting that silent rehearsal <em>wasn’t</em> responsible for their superior recognition of the sung tunes.</p>



<p>Still, chewing gum is considerably different from actually mouthing words or making sounds, so might not be enough to interfere with any subvocalisations. So next, the team asked a new group of participants to either mouth “la” over and over again (without making any noise), or make a humming sound. In a subsequent study, participants whispered “la la la”.</p>



<p>In both studies, participants still recognised the vocal melodies better than the piano ones, despite making mouth movements or sounds. This again suggested that silent rehearsal of the sung melodies wasn’t responsible for boosting participants’ memories.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that there wasn’t a control group in either of these studies, which makes it hard to completely rule out the possibility that making mouth movements or sounds could have <em>reduced</em> memory for vocal melodies, even if it didn’t entirely get rid of the memory advantage over instrumental tunes. However, the team did compare their results with an earlier study, in which participants listened to vocal and instrumental melodies <em>without</em> doing a task, and found no difference in memory performance between the two papers.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the studies suggest that our superior memory for sung melodies isn’t down to internal, silent rehearsal of the tunes. So what could explain the effect? Well, perhaps it’s just that humans are more attuned to voices than other sounds, the authors say. “The best current account of the voice advantage in memory remains that the voice is special, by virtue of being a conspecific, communicative, and biological signal, which is more engaging or distinctive to listeners than instrumental sounds,” they conclude.</p>

<p><em>Improving two-color calcium imaging… Surprising evolutionary changes in interneuron types… Exploring how the basal ganglia multitasks behavior… Using mathematical models to study bat echolocation…</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2826"></span></p>
<p><strong>A new variant of the calcium indicator improves two-photon imaging</strong></p>
<p>Two-photon (2P) calcium imaging has emerged as the leading method for <em>in vivo</em> brain imaging. However, the light sources commonly used (titanium-sapphire lasers and parametric oscillators) are quite costly, require frequent maintenance, and lack output power. One solution is to use inexpensive and powerful industrial lasers that have wavelengths around 1,000 nm. But to use these inexpensive lasers, new biosensors that excite above this wavelength are needed. To these ends, researchers have been working on creating new genetically encoded calcium indicators by taking advantage of mutations that can occur in green fluorescent protein (GFP) that convert it to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/podgorski-lab">Dr. Kaspar Podgorski<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and his team have created jYCaMP1 — a redshifted variant of jGCaMP7 — an optimized calcium indicator. Dr. Podgorski’s lab is a part of the Janelia Research Campus at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Their recent <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32451475/">paper shows that jYCaMP1 outperforms jGCaMP7 in both mice and flies and enables improved two-color calcium imaging with red fluorescent protein-based indicators</a>. When the researchers visualized activity within the mouse visual cortex, compared to jGCaMP7s, recordings from jYCaMP1s-labeled neurons were 1.8-fold as bright. Flies were also studied for a comparative analysis. When activity in the medulla of the optic lobe of flies was visualized, jYCaMP1s-labeled neurons showed 2.3-fold increases in brightness under 1,030 nm excitation compared to the jGCaMP7s-labeled neurons. One of the most exciting results of this study is that this new calcium indicator improves two-color imaging. This is because the shifted excitation spectrum of jYCaMP1 greatly improves the overlap with red genetically encoded fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, such as jRGECO1a, while still retaining well-separated emission with red sensors. This is critical because this new calcium indicator now allows for dual color 2P Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with a single excitation laser. Technological advances like this are, without a doubt, the future of <em>in vivo </em>imaging of neural activity.</p>

<p><strong>Evolution and the innovative variation of interneurons across species</strong></p>
<p>While primates and rodents had a common evolutionary ancestor approximately 90 million years ago, profound differences exist in both behavior and cognitive capacity between primates and rodents. However, the cellular basis for these differences is unknown. Moreover, rodents such as mice are frequently used to understand cell types within the brain. Until now, it has been unclear whether or not these cell types have been conserved or if they have changed across evolution. In the present study, researchers sought to systemically characterize interneuron cell-type RNA expression across a variety of species. This study was led by senior researcher and professor at Harvard University, <a href="http://mccarrolllab.org/">Dr. Steven McCarroll<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong>. Dr. McCarroll and his team used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile RNA expression in 188,776 individual interneurons across homologous brain regions of three primate species (i.e., human, macaque, and marmoset), mice, and ferrets. This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32999462/">paper shows that homologous interneuron types, readily identified by their RNA-expression patterns, varied in both abundance and RNA expression among ferrets, mice, and primates</a>. As expected, this variance was lower among primates. Researchers predicted that the primate caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) – a subcortical progenitor zone that gives rise to interneurons during neurodevelopment – would contain greater evolutionary novelties among interneurons because the CGE produces a larger proportion of these cells in primates than in rodents. However, they found that the divergence in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the primate species all involved interneurons for which RNA-expression patterns indicated they originated from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) domain, which is evolutionarily older than the CGE domain. Further, the team found a primate interneuron cell-type that has no homologous counterpart in mice or ferrets in the striatum, and not the cortex. Overall, this research is important because it broadens our understanding of the evolution of interneurons. Further, these findings will facilitate research for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illnesses by helping scientists identify the species that best models cell types in the human brain.</p>

<p><strong>Projections of the basal ganglia: beyond an integrative hub</strong></p>
<p>There are primarily two models to explain the function of the basal ganglia, which are important nuclei involved in decision making and motor control. One model suggests this set of nuclei is a site of integration, whereas the second model suggests that projections from the basal ganglia are divided into topographical channels, each controlling a distinct behavior. The lab of <a href="https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Bernardo Sabatini<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> investigated the latter hypothesis by using a unique experimental approach. One part of the basal ganglia, the striatum, has functionally discrete roles along the medial–lateral axis, with dorsal medial striatum and dorsal lateral striatum involved in goal-directed and habitual behaviors, respectively. Dr. Sabatini’s new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989293/">paper suggests that this dichotomy might arise, at least partially, from distinct anatomical projections from the basal ganglia that allow parallel modulation of behavior</a>. In other words, rather than integrating behavior on their own, the basal ganglia multitask through multiple feedforward projections to other regions. Researchers first used anterograde tracers to map the projection pathways of the basal ganglia. Next, using an optogenetic approach, they confirmed that specific regions within the striatum triggered a single behavior (licking or locomotion). Further, when the locomotion-inducing striatal region was stimulated while mice were licking, this did not interfere with licking. These findings support the canonical parallel model of basal ganglia activity, but also suggest that the integration and competition of information associated with specific behaviors occurs largely outside of the basal ganglia. Altogether, this work extends our understanding of the basal ganglia as a complex brain region with distinct neural projections that function independently. Understanding the functional composition of these circuits is a critical step toward a better understanding of basal ganglia-related disorders, such as Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>It is well established that bats use echolocation to track moving auditory objects, such as prey, within their environment. But are bats actually using predictive tracking strategies to anticipate the future? <a href="https://batlab.johnshopkins.edu/index.html">Dr. Cynthia Moss</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and her team at Johns Hopkins University study comparative neural systems and behavior using the big brown bat (<em>Eptesicus fuscus)</em> as a model organism. Dr. Moss and her “Batlab” team show in their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33139550/">new paper that bats integrate information across echo sequences to anticipate a target’s future position in a three-dimensional environment</a>. To show this, the Batlab created a carefully controlled laboratory environment. They first trained bats to sit on a platform in this lab environment while the researchers manipulated the path of the insect the bats would chase. In this setting, the researchers could control the speed at which the insect moved, and high-speed cameras were used to track the movement of the bats. Then, they measured the direction of the bat’s head (i.e. sonar beam aim) and echolocation call rate as it tracked the moving target within its sonar field. The team then used four separate mathematical models to determine whether or not the bats used predictive tracking behaviors while chasing the insect target. Indeed, they found that bats use a predictive internal model to update tracking of a moving target. The results held true even when tested in a more naturalistic environment that included an object that the moving target could hide behind temporarily. By studying bats and other unique model organisms, we can better understand how humans and other animals use their own sensory information in order to make predictions about the future. Research such as this can have important implications about how individuals who are blind navigate within their environment and how we can create better devices to assist the visually impaired.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmucker will talk about a paper "A comparison between mouse, in silico, and robot odor plume navigation reveals advantages of mouse odor-tracking".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Localization of odors is essential to animal survival, and thus animals are
adept at odor navigation. In natural conditions animals encounter odor sources
in which odor is carried by air flow varying in complexity. We sought to
identify potential minimalist strategies that can effectively be used for
odor-based navigation and asses their performance in an increasingly chaotic
environment. To do so, we compared mouse, in silico model, and Arduino-based
robot odor-localization behavior in a standardized odor landscape. Mouse
performance remains robust in the presence of increased complexity, showing a
shift in strategy towards faster movement with increased environmental
complexity. Implementing simple binaral and temporal models of tropotaxis and
klinotaxis, an in silico model and Arduino robot, in the same environment as
the mice, are equally successful in locating the odor source within a plume of
low complexity. However, performance of these algorithms significantly drops
when the chaotic nature of the plume is increased. Additionally, both
algorithm-driven systems show more successful performance when using a strictly
binaral model at a larger sensor separation distance and more successful
performance when using a temporal and binaral model when using a smaller sensor
separation distance. This suggests that with an increasingly chaotic odor
environment, mice rely on complex strategies that allow for robust odor
localization that cannot be resolved by minimal algorithms that display robust
performance at low levels of complexity. Thus, highlighting that an animal's
ability to modulate behavior with environmental complexity is beneficial for
odor localization</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>No matter how much you love your partner, there are always going to be things about them that get on your nerves. These can be fairly superficial — not liking the way they fold the laundry, for example, or hating their favourite TV show. Other problems can be more serious — fundamental failures to communicate or disagreements on big decisions like having children. There’s also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/02/new-romantic-relationships-may-end-up-following-the-same-patterns-as-previous-ones/https:/digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/02/new-romantic-relationships-may-end-up-following-the-same-patterns-as-previous-ones/">evidence</a> that we continue to repeat these patterns in new relationships, even when we hope to see a change.</p>



<p>But while all couples argue, they don’t all do it in the same way. Techniques for managing conflict have been explored by François Bogacz and team from the University of Geneva in a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00622-8#Sec1">study</a> published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communication</em>. The study’s findings suggest that mediation — negotiation facilitated by a neutral third party such as a therapist or counsellor — may be the best way for couples to resolve serious conflict.</p>



<span id="more-40971"></span>



<p>Participants were heterosexual romantic couples who had been in a relationship for more than one year. About a month before the experiment started, participants filled in a number of measures. The “Dyadic Adjustment Scale” was used to measure the quality of relationships, with participants indicating how often they disagree with their partner on issues ranging from religious matters, sex, and life philosophy to housework and leisure time. The scale also covered how often participants thought about separating from their partner and how often there were significant disagreements.</p>



<p>The researchers also measured participants’ emotional competence (i.e. how well a person understands their own and others’ emotions) as well as dispositional mindfulness (i.e. how present someone is able to be in the moment). Finally, participants indicated how they respond before, during and after conflicts with people in their life. These answers revealed how much participants used four different styles of conflict: active-constructive (good at taking others’ perspectives), passive-constructive (delaying and considering a response to conflict), active-destructive (openly expressing anger) and passive-destructive (avoiding conflict altogether).</p>



<p>Immediately before the experiment, participants also rated their mood, and indicated how close they felt to their partner at that moment. Next, they were invited to select a topic for discussion from those most commonly reported as sources of disagreements.</p>



<p>Those in the control condition were then asked to discuss the controversial topic for an hour without any guidance and under the watch of a silent observer, while those in the mediation condition had their discussion facilitated by a neutral third party using a facilitative mediation model, in which partners reach a collective solution through exploring each other’s interests, feelings and outlooks.</p>



<p>After the experiment, participants rated the level of disagreement at the end of their discussion, their level of satisfaction with the discussion and their level of satisfaction with the <em>process</em> of the discussion, and indicated whether or not they had actually achieved a resolution on the topic at hand.</p>



<p>The team found that couples in the mediation condition were more likely to come to a resolution: 36 of the 38 participants in the mediation condition reported reaching an agreement compared to 26 of 38 in the control condition. Participants who had gone through the mediation process also felt closer to their partners after the discussion, while there was no change in closeness for those in the control condition.</p>



<p>How participants reported dealing with conflict also related to other aspects of their personality and their feelings about their relationships. Active-constructive and passive-constructive profiles were positively associated with mindfulness, while those who were passive-destructive were less likely to be mindful and present in the moment. Participants who rated themselves as more emotionally competent also tended to report being more satisfied in their relationship. </p>



<p>Whether couples would have responded in the same way in a naturalistic setting is unclear. The presence of a silent observer may have affected how participants in the control condition dealt with the conflict — screaming at your partner about their very worst qualities is likely to be pretty uncomfortable and inhibited in front of somebody else in a way it may not be at home.</p>



<p>Further research could focus on <em>why</em> mediation works, as well as looking at different types of facilitative relationship. There are also interesting avenues to explore around the <em>content </em>of conflicts. While on the surface an argument may appear to be about who does the dishes more, it’s likely that there are other factors at play, the washing up merely a stand-in for deeper issues about compatibility, personality or politics.</p>



<p>What is clear from the study is that certain personality traits or skills can help resolve conflict. These aren’t impossible things to master — emotional competence is a focus in many types of individual therapeutic intervention. But for those who <em>don’t </em>happen to have those traits or struggle to foster them, mediation seems like a hopeful option.</p>

<p><strong>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Publisher, Open Research</strong></p>



<p>To support increased sharing of open research methodologies — and in an exciting extension to our partnership with <strong>protocols.io</strong> — we are announcing two new peer-reviewed article types in <em>PLOS ONE</em> in 2021: <strong>Lab Protocols </strong>and <strong>Study Protocols</strong>. </p>



<p>Please <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sign-up</a> to receive updates on launch.</p>



<p>These new article types are intended to address three issues familiar to researchers: the rigor and reproducibility of research, efficiency in getting feedback, and recognition for developing and sharing diverse research contributions.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Lab Protocols</strong> </strong>have been developed in close collaboration with researchers and the protocols.io team. They describe <em>verified</em>, reusable methodologies including computational techniques, and consist of two interlinked components:</p>



<ol><li>A step-by-step protocol posted to protocols.io, utilizing specialized tools for communicating methodological details, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts–an array of features that facilitate the direct use of the protocol at the bench. </li><li>A peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations, expected results and sample datasets from using the protocol.</li></ol>



<p>We are also introducing <strong>Study Protocols</strong>,<strong> </strong>an established article type that allows researchers to share detailed plans and proposals for funded research projects that have not yet generated results. </p>



<p>Both <strong>Lab Protocols</strong> and <strong>Study Protocols</strong> will be open to research in all fields of study within <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s inclusive scope.</p>



<h3><strong>Why protocols, why now?</strong></h3>



<p>Many researchers share <strong>Lab Protocols </strong>informally with peers and, in our work to better understand researcher needs, we learned that a motivation for sharing protocols is to seek feedback to improve them. The importance of methods development and sharing also deserves increased recognition, via a peer-reviewed publication. Understanding the exquisite details that make methods work is also essential for reproducibility and for accelerating science. Researchers who develop methods, especially those early in their careers, deserve more recognition than a footnote in a research article.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Study Protocols</strong> </strong>are important for improving rigor and transparency by sharing a study’s design, recruitment and analysis plans before research has been carried out. This practice is especially important — and already common — in healthcare research, including systematic reviews. Study Protocols complement our offering of Registered Reports. Researchers are not required to submit the results of their Study Protocol  to the same journal, which  provides more researchers with Open Access options to share their peer-reviewed research plans.</p>



<p>These article types in <em>PLOS ONE</em> offer new ways to share research according to the principles of open science, bolstering transparency, reproducibility, and accelerating research. We also hope that they provide opportunities for researchers who have experienced lab closures in 2020 to remain engaged with their research, and explore more ways to demonstrate their productivity and contributions.</p>



<h3><strong>Beginning a roadmap for improved methods papers</strong></h3>



<p>After iterative development with researchers of a new format for <strong>Lab Protocols</strong>, which includes prominent reciprocal linking between platforms, we will be launching the article type as a pilot in 2021. By partnering with a specialist platform in protocols.io we can offer authors enhanced functionality for sharing and displaying their protocols in actionable ways alongside the features of a peer-reviewed publication. Researchers will also benefit from dynamic functionality of protocols.io, for modifying and sharing new versions of protocols in the future.</p>



<p>As another unique feature, authors of <strong>Lab Protocols</strong> at <em>PLOS ONE</em> who are new users of the protocols.io platform can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols">upload and format their protocols</a> as part of the publication process in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>During 2021 we will gather more feedback to inform potential future directions for the article format and author workflow. The launch of the pilot is the first phase of exploring continuous improvement of the experience of publishing and reading protocols.</p>



<p>PLOS and protocols.io are committed to developing our services and future plans based on community feedback. And we want to hear the full spectrum of feedback from different communities around the globe. If you have questions, feedback, or ideas please reach out to Iain Hrynaszkiewicz (ihrynaszkiewicz@plos.org) or Emma Ganley (emma@protocols.io), or leave a comment below.</p>

Kidneys are vital for the whole body to work properly. Therefore, when a person has CKD, they may also have problems with the functioning of the rest of their body.  Some of the common complications of CKD include anemia, bone disease, heart disease, high potassium, high calcium and fluid accumulation.</p>
<p>CKD is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in older people, and it is associated with a huge economic burden. High income countries generally spend more than 2-3% of their annual budget on the treatment of end-stage renal disease, although people receiving such treatments represent less than 0.03% of the total population. <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55004-7/fulltext">https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55004-7/fulltext</a></p>
<p>Although the prevalence of CKD is increasing and the importance of early diagnosis to prevent complications such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well established, screening programmes in Europe are highly heterogeneous and fragmented. Health system planning requires careful evaluation of the epidemiology of CKD, but data on morbidity and mortality of this disease are scarce or non-existent in many countries. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30045-3/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30045-3/fulltext</a></p>
<p>The SCOPE (Screening for CKD among older people across Europe) H2020 project implemented in  seven European Countries plus Israel includes an observational prospective study with a 2-year follow up, recruiting 2426 older people aged 75+, to investigate whether and to which extent currently available screening methods may identify older people at risk of worsening kidney function.</p>
<p>Preliminary results from the baseline database of the SCOPE Project was made available in the <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-20-supplement-1">BMC Geriatrics Special Issue</a> by Dr Fabrizia Lattanzio et al.</p>
<p><strong>CKD and Quality of Life</strong></p>
<p>Quality of life (QoL) refers to the physical, psychological, social, and medical aspects of life that are influenced by health status and functions. The SCOPE team investigated the QoL among older in early stage of CKD, to identify the factors that influence this relationship. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01697-3">The study</a> results showed that CKD and its severity may be significantly associated with impaired QoL among community-dwelling older people.</p>
<p><strong>Is kidney function associated with cognition and mood in late life?</strong></p>
<p>The prevalence of CKD and cognitive impairment is growing as a result of the aging population. CKD, cognitive impairment, and mood disorder share common risk factors. Whether a decreased kidney function is associated with cognitive and mood disorders in the oldest old is not completely clear. Therefore, the SCOPE team has investigated for the first time the possible association between kidney function, cognition and mood. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01707-4">The study</a> results showed that the prevalence of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms  does not increase among older people in more advanced stages of CKD.</p>
<p><strong>Is CKD a predictor of falls?</strong></p>
<p>Falls are a serious negative health outcome in older persons. In facts, the fall rate rises with increasing age. However, the impact of CKD on falls in older community-dwelling persons is not well investigated yet, especially in relation to the urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The SCOPE team studied the impact of CKD and LUTS on falls as well as on injurious falls. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01698-2">The study</a> results showed that lower urinary tract symptoms are a predictor of falls and injurious falls, while the association between CKD and falls needs to be prospectively investigated.</p>
<p><strong>CKD and sarcopenia</strong></p>
<p>Loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) may be more pronounced in older adults with CKD, wherein the protein albumin is abnormally present in the urine (albuminuria). The SCOPE team investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults according to kidney function and albuminuria levels. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01700-x">The study</a> results showed that sarcopenia is common among older adults, especially those in more advanced CKD stages, even if the estimated prevalence slightly differs depending on the equation used to assess estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR); likewise, sarcopenia seems to be widespread among older people with higher albuminuria levels.</p>
<p><strong>Association between kidney function and nutritional status</strong></p>
<p>Different mechanisms connect the nutritional status with the occurrence and the course of CKD. Existing literature shows that especially during end-stage renal disease, there are complications that lead to malnutrition (undernutrition). However, the SCOPE team has further investigated this relationship between kidney function and nutritional status. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01699-1">The study</a> results showed that population of community-dwelling 75+ with CKD show general features of overweight and obesity with a small prevalence of malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>CKD in multimorbidity patterns</strong></p>
<p>CKD is known to be associated with several co-occurring conditions. The SCOPE team has explored multimorbidity patterns, as well as the impact of physical performance and CKD severity among an older community-dwelling people. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01696-4">The study</a> results showed that CKD contributes significantly to multimorbidity patterns in a population of older outpatients and it was rarely observed without any co-occurring diseases. Moreover, CKD may cluster with hypertension and sensory impairments, but its contribution to multimorbidity pattern may be affected by CKD severity.</p>
<p>These scientific results prompt to further improve the screening methods for CKD in the older population and the models of assistance and care through longitudinal studies. The early diagnosis of CKD represents a priority issue to be addressed to prevent / slow its progression among older patients and, at the same time, to reduce the need for long-term care and the related cost for the healthcare system.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What happens to a narcissistic woman when she becomes a mother? Can someone with an unmet desire for attention, love and recognition — which characterises all narcissists — adapt well to having a baby to care for? The answer, according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-74084-001">new study </a>in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment,</em> is that it really depends what type of narcissist the mother is. And even, then, the conclusions were based on self-reports, which should probably be received with caution.</p>



<span id="more-40960"></span>



<p>Narcissism is generally thought to come in two types. Grandiose narcissists crave admiration, lack empathy, feel more envy than is typical, and have an inflated sense of their own self-worth and entitlement. Vulnerable narcissists share some of these traits, but, in contrast, they are fundamentally insecure, often expressing a sense of inadequacy, and more negative emotions, including shame and hostility to others.</p>



<p>Anat Talmon at Stanford University and colleagues studied 385 Israeli woman, recruited via general online forums dedicated to pregnancy and the transition to motherhood. The participants completed a battery of tests while they were pregnant, and also two months after giving birth. These tests assessed both types of narcissism, along with participants’ general psychological wellbeing, how they felt about their bodies, their own evaluations of their adequacy as a mother (and their predictions of this, before the birth), perceived attachment and bonding with their babies, and also their levels of positive and negative emotion.</p>



<p>The team found that the women who ranked relatively high on the grandiose narcissism scale also reported high levels of wellbeing in the transition to motherhood. Vulnerable narcissism, however, was associated with higher levels of distress.</p>



<p>It’s possible that grandiose women are more inclined to view their baby as an extension of themselves, the researchers write — so feel more positively about it. This idea is perhaps supported by their finding that this group reported stronger attachment to their babies, and that it was this sense of attachment that seemed to lead to greater wellbeing among these women. The team also found that grandiose women tended to have a relatively poorer body experience during pregnancy, however (perhaps because of fatigue or weight gain, for example) but more positive attitudes to their body after giving birth. This particular effect “may be attributed to the grandiose experience of bringing a child into the world,” the researchers observe.</p>



<p>The results showed that women with vulnerable narcissism clearly fared less well, however. They reported relatively more negative feelings about their own bodies, more distress, lower anticipated and actual efficacy as a mother, and greater difficulty bonding with their newborn.</p>



<p>“To the best of our knowledge, our findings provide the first evidence of how the two components of narcissism respond differently to the adjustment to motherhood,” the team writes.</p>



<p>There are, though, some limitations to their study. Most notably, all of the data came from the women’s own self-reports. This raises various questions, such as: did the grandiose mothers really form stronger attachments to their babies — or did they just like to think that they did? Indeed, other studies have found that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280102005_THE_RELATIONSHIP_BETWEEN_PARENTAL_NARCISSISM_AND_CHILDREN'S_MENTAL_VULNERABILITY_THE_MEDIATION_ROLE_OF_THE_REARING_STYLE">narcissistic parents show lower levels of care for their children</a> (who are then at higher risk of developing anxiety and depression) and are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-015-9672-3">more likely to physically abuse their children</a>. As the authors themselves write, “The idea that a grandiose individual might tend to be somewhat disconnected from her actual mental state could shed light on the report of increased levels of wellbeing during this challenging transitional period.”</p>



<p>Still, the work certainly does contribute to research on how a woman’s personality contributes to her feelings about herself, and her baby, during and just after pregnancy. The “unique contribution made by each type of narcissism highlights the nuanced way in which we should observe individuals,” the team notes.</p>

[This is the abstract for just one of seven presentations.]

Abstract:  Over the last decade, the digital humanities community has become increasingly concerned with the ongoing sustainability of digital projects. This anxiety stems in part from the realization that not all digital humanities projects have identical expectations of longevity. Several prominent works in the literature, such as Bethany Nowviskie and Dot Porter’s “Graceful Degradation Survey Findings: How Do We Manage Digital Humanities Projects through Times of Transition and Decline?” (2010) and Geoffrey Rockwell et al.’s “Burying Dead Projects: Depositing the Globalization Compendium” (2014), have been central to this intellectual exchange about the benefits of creating sustainability plans for projects that do not necessarily assume a default permanence, but that instead proactively consider each project’s most suitable longevity strategy.

 

With this realization has come a concomitant expectation: each digital humanities project must create its own customized sustainability plan, designed with its particular requirements in mind. And yet, few digital humanists have access to direct training on the process of creating and implementing professional-grade digital preservation and sustainability practices for their own work. To support the process of designing and implementing digital sustainability plans for this work, a team of scholars housed in the Visual Media Workshop at the University of Pittsburgh has created the Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap (STSR; http://sustainingdh.net). The STSR is a structured, process-oriented workshop, inspired by design thinking and collaborative learning approaches. This workshop, which may be implemented in a variety of institutional contexts, guides project stakeholders through the practice of creating effective, iterative, ongoing digital sustainability strategies that address the needs of both social and technological infrastructures. It is founded on the fundamental assumption that, for sustainability practices to be successful, project leaders must keep the changing, socially-contingent nature of both their project and their working environment(s) consistently in mind as they initiate, maintain, and support their own work. For this panel, we contextualize and describe the STSR, and provide reflections based on our experiences facilitating Sustaining DH: An NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities.

Instead of weighing the risk of contrast administration on a case-by-case basis, there seems to be a default to a recommendation against the use of contrast. This has resulted in patients with kidney disease not getting the necessary studies leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p>

The variable definitions for diagnosis and the previous use of high osmolar agents resulted in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2017.03.003">high incidence of acute kidney injury</a>. Keep in mind, this diagnosis was often based on the labs and clinical scenario without confirmatory kidney biopsy findings. Biopsies may show features of acute tubular necrosis, but there is no distinguishing feature to implicate iodinated contrast exposure.</p>
<p>Review of larger administrative databases cannot reproduce the higher rates of acute kidney injury. In a larger series, using propensity scores comparing 116,694 who received contrast for CT scans with 40,446 who did not receive contrast. There was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015154044">no increase in absolute risk of kidney injury</a>. Another review of an administrative inpatient database of 5.9 million individuals with comorbidities by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2016010021">Wilheml-Leen <em>et al.</em></a> demonstrated the risk of acute kidney injury was nearly the same regardless of the use of IV contrast.</p>
<p>The use of iso-osmolar/low molecular weight agents has resulted in lower rates of contrast-induced kidney injury. Identification of factors such as underlying CKD stage 4 or 5, use of higher osmolar agents, intra-arterial administration of the contrast, concomitant hemodynamic instability, use of a large volume of contrast, and pre-existing volume depletion would help practitioners better predict the risk of contrast use. The risk for an individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> receiving iodinated contrast for a CT scan of the chest to evaluate a pulmonary nodule is not the same as the individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> who presents with acute myocardial infarction and hemodynamic instability needing an emergent cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p>Our recommendations for contrast use in these two cases should not be the same. Contrast-induced nephrotoxic injury can occur but the risk is not the same for all situations. Our approach should be a more thoughtful review of the individual clinical situation and an assessment of whether the benefit of the information gained from the study outweighs the risk. Additionally, there should be a dialogue with patients about the decision-making process rather than simplified guidelines.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>A huge variety of factors are related to memory, from mood to personality to what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/30/amsterdam-coffee-shop-study-explores-the-effects-of-cannabis-on-eye-witness-memory/">substances have been consumed</a>. One recent study, for example, found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/20/memory-complaints-are-more-common-among-older-adults-with-particular-personality-traits/">older adults with higher openness to experience also experienced fewer cognitive complaints</a> each day; other work has found a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629149/">relationship between self-reported memory and traits</a> including neuroticism and extraversion.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620953883">study published in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>, Emily F. Hittner from Northwestern University and team have looked at the relationship between memory and positive affect — the experience of pleasant emotional states like enthusiasm, pride or joy. And they found less memory decline over time in those participants with higher levels of positive affect.</p>



<span id="more-40944"></span>



<p>The team analysed data from 991 participants who had taken part in a longitudinal study of households in the United States. At the first time point, when participants were an average of 55 years old, they had reported  their levels of positive affect using two scales, which asked how often during the last month they had felt enthusiastic, active, peaceful, satisfied and so on. They also completed measures of depression and negative affect, as well as personality trait scales.</p>



<p>Participants also took part in a memory assessment. In this test, they were read a list of 15 unrelated words and then had to recall as many as they could immediately (immediate recall) and, in a test they were not warned about, after fifteen minutes (delayed recall). Then, nine years later, participants completed this memory test again.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, people who reported more positive affect at the first time point showed less memory decline over these nine years. Particular facets of positive affect were also associated with less memory decline — greater enthusiasm, cheerfulness, pride, and feelings of calm and peace were all related to slower memory decline, while greater attentiveness or satisfaction were not. Importantly, all the analyses took into account other factors like participants’ <em>negative</em> affect, personality traits and age, suggesting that these weren’t responsible for the results.</p>



<p>Why positive affect is related to a slower rate of memory decline, however, was less clear. The team suggests a number of pathways that could link the two: if you have a positive outlook on life, for example, you might be more inclined to engage in adaptive health behaviours or to foster beneficial social relationships. Positive affect in and of itself may not be the crucial factor, in other words, instead acting as the source of behaviours that improve or protect health.</p>



<p>Memory loss can be devastating, particularly in older adults — forgetting to take vital medication, for example, has serious consequences, and the emotional and social ramifications of forgetting the names or faces of acquaintances can also be severe. Memory decline can also predict the onset of dementia. Developing ways to predict (and prevent) memory loss is an important task. Screening for positive affect as a way of predicting potential memory decline, as the team suggests, could therefore have implications for cognitive as well as mental health, helping improve wellbeing across the board.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper "Cliques and cavities in human connectome".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges
captures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted
as humans order relations, concepts naturally expressed in the language of
algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study mesoscale network
structures that arise from the arrangement of densely connected substructures
called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We detect cliques
(all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average structural
connectomes of 8 healthy adults scanned in triplicate and discover the presence
of more large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring
minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform
rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different
dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging
patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those
observed in null model networks, and - importantly - link regions of early and
late evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in
controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that
techniques from algebraic topology offer a novel perspective on structural
connectomics, highlighting loop-like paths as crucial features in the human
brain’s structural architecture.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Covid-19 has changed our working lives, perhaps for good. Home-working is now common, and many of us have been doing it for months. With changing rules and guidelines, some of us have even gone from home-working to socially distanced office-working, to working back at home again. So what do we know about how these changes are affecting our mental health — and what can we do to make our new working lives better?</p>



<span id="more-40935"></span>



<p><strong>How are we feeling?</strong></p>



<p>In January 2019 (pre-Covid-19), 35% of <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/work/trends/goodwork/covid-impact">UK employees surveyed for the CIPD</a> (a professional human resources body) reported that work had a positive impact on their mental health, while 27% said that work had a negative impact. By summer 2020, those figures had shifted to 34% and 26% respectively. On these measures, at least, Covid-19 had no obvious impact. </p>



<p>In this second survey, employees did report high levels of anxiety about contracting the virus at work — but despite this, half of those who were working remotely were looking forward to returning to their workplace. Almost half of all of the people surveyed also reported that social connections at work had worsened. Clearly, although the impact of work itself on our mental health hadn’t changed, altered work circumstances were — and are — causing difficulties, which are being further explored…</p>



<p><strong>How bad is home-working?</strong></p>



<p>“It can be argued that the crisis has led to the most significant, intensive social experiment of digital, home-based working that has ever occurred.”</p>



<p>This statement is from the website of the ongoing <a href="https://www.workingathome.org.uk/project-overview/">Working@home project</a>, led by Abigail Marks at Stirling University, which seeks to understand the impact of this “experiment”. As the team points out, some commentators have suggested that home-based work is emancipatory, and improves work flexibility. However, the team also notes, “this new world order, where the home becomes a multi-occupational, multi-person workplace… not only challenges boundaries but also conceptions of the domestic space.” So how is it making us feel?</p>



<p>Overall, not great, according to their initial survey of home workers. One in three reported sharing their home working space, 37% reported that home conflicts have increased, and almost one in four said that they were doing poorly or very poorly in terms of general health. The most commonly cited trigger for household conflict was “interrupting or being noisy while you work”.</p>



<p><strong>Keys to coping at home</strong></p>



<p>Yanmengqian Zhou at Penn State University and colleagues studied symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as coping strategies among American adults during the first few months of the pandemic. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/17/6315">Their study</a>, published in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>, revealed that levels of “social strain” — someone else making demands, giving criticism or just getting on your nerves — was the most consistent predictor of these symptoms of poor mental health. Anyone who’s working at home with their partner is certainly more likely to experience this kind of strain, especially if you have to share the same room. </p>



<p>But the team did also identify helpful strategies for working in the time of Covid-19. They recommend keeping a consistent schedule, reminding yourself that things will get better, finding activities to distract yourself and taking care of others who need help. None of these strategies will stop you irritating each other, but they might at least ease the strain a little.</p>



<p>Based on their own research, Kristen Shockley and Malissa Clark at the University of Georgia also <a href="https://www.siop.org/Research-Publications/Items-of-Interest/ArtMID/19366/ArticleID/3454/Work-Family-Balance-Struggles-in-the-Time-of-COVID-19">recommend some kind of work-life/home-life boundary activity </a>to replace the lost commute. Just a walk near your home at the start and end of the work day can make it easier to switch between roles, they say.</p>



<p><strong>Overcoming “presence privilege”</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266131/">a recent issue of Occupational Health Science</a>, ten experts were invited to comment on work-related issues associated with Covid-19. Larissa K. Barber at San Diego State University argues that as remote working is now common, it’s time to get rid of the “physical presence privilege”.</p>



<p>Traditionally, Barber writes, “in-person meetings are preferred over web-conferencing, driving in over logging in”. Being physically present in the workplace is also conflated with work attention and productivity, she adds. Now that remote working is common, Barber thinks it’s high time that organisations shift their thinking and also devote energy and resources to making this style of working better for employees.</p>



<p>One way to do this is to respect technological boundaries in the same way that we traditionally respect physical boundaries. “Barging into a coworker’s office, family dinner or even bedroom for an immediate work response is antisocial. Yet we tolerate and encourage similar behaviours in electronic communications,” Barber notes (something that anyone who’s ever had a demanding email from their boss outside work hours will appreciate). Clearly, this is not a new problem — but perhaps with a mass shift to remote working, organisations will now feel obliged to set clear technological ground rules, for the benefit of us all.</p>



<p><strong>Regaining control</strong></p>



<p>The pandemic, and the lockdowns associated with it, have profoundly challenged our autonomy — our sense of being in control of our actions and also seeing an alignment between our behaviour and our personal values and goals (an aspect of autonomy often called “authenticity”). Autonomy is widely considered to be important for wellbeing. Unsurprisingly, then, there have been a number of studies exploring how Covid-19 has affected it, and how we’ve felt as a result.</p>



<p>One recent paper, published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, found that while there were spikes in feelings of powerlessness and inauthenticity in the early days of the pandemic, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/10/the-process-of-psychological-recovery-begins-while-a-stressful-event-is-still-going-on-according-to-study-of-early-stages-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">these increases actually started to subside quite rapidly</a>. The team concludes that because a sense of autonomy is so important to us, the participants were making changes in their lives to restore it, even in the face of ongoing stress and restrictions. All kinds of strategies, such as deciding to spend what used to be work commute time on a hobby or exercise, or even just revelling in the sudden ability to wear whatever they wanted for work (below the belt, at least, during Zoom meetings) could have helped.</p>



<p>Other researchers, including Adam Butler at the University of Iowa, in that recent special issue of Occupational Health Science, point to studies finding that higher perceptions of control are associated with reduced stress among nurses. All of this suggests that whatever employers can do to enhance employee autonomy at “work”  — and home working brings its own challenges, of course — should be good for their mental health.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you’re preparing to receive a flu vaccine — or even a COVID-19 vaccine — this winter, you’ll be interested in the results of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-88213-001">new study</a> that investigates whether it’s better to smile or grimace your way through the pain of an injection.</p>



<p>The idea that manipulating our facial expressions can affect our emotions has a long and storied history. There are many advocates of this “facial feedback hypothesis”, and many critics, too. Indeed, one of the classic findings in the field — that<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-25514-001"> people find cartoons funnier if they hold a pen between their teeth</a>, inducing a smile — recently <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616674458">failed to replicate</a>. This mixed research background was well known to Sarah D. Pressman and Amanda M. Acevedo at the University of California, Irvine, who led the new work, published in <em>Emotion</em>.</p>



<span id="more-40930"></span>



<p>The team randomised 231 student participants to hold either a neutral expression, a regular smile (which involves the cheek muscles), a Duchenne smile (which also recruits muscles by the eyes, resulting in creasing around the eyes) or a grimace (which recruits both these sets of muscles, plus those which allow us to wrinkle our brows).</p>



<p>To induce these expressions, the participants (who thought they were taking part in an investigation of multi-tasking) were given chopsticks to hold in one of four positions between their teeth, and asked to imitate an example photo. Each participant then held their assigned facial position while they received an injection of saline solution into the upper arm, designed to mimic a flu jab. Their heart rates and skin conductance were measured throughout, as objective markers of their stress levels, and they also reported on levels of pain (anticipated and then actual) and other emotions, such as being jittery or relaxed.</p>



<p>The researchers found some interesting differences between the groups. The Duchenne smiling and grimacing groups gave lower pain ratings than the neutral group while waiting for the injection, during the injection, and immediately after it. The regular smiling group fell somewhere in between. Notably, the Duchenne group reported 40% less pain during the needle insertion than the neutral controls, and the grimace group reported 39% less pain. These were clinically meaningful results, the team stresses, equivalent to pain being “very much improved”. In addition, the Duchenne group had the lowest heart rates during the study, while the grimacing group reported feeling the lowest levels of stress.</p>



<p>Smiling and grimacing recruit some of the same key facial muscles, and both are seen in people undergoing negative experiences, including pain. The facial feedback hypothesis would hold that both these facial configurations act to regulate feelings of pain and stress. In the case of Duchenne smiling, it might be that we associate this expression with feeling positive emotions, and this reduces perceived pain. With grimacing, it’s possible, the team suggests, that intense activation of muscles around the eye and forehead has a more direct effect on pain and/or levels of physiological arousal, and stress, perhaps via stimulation of the trigeminal nerve in the face. But the nature of this mechanism, if it exists, is certainly not clear.</p>



<p>In relation to their grimacing findings, the team writes: “To our knowledge, this is the first experimental test showing that this natural response to pain is helpful in improving the subjective pain experience.” However, they also add: “Whether we grimace during pain because it is similar to smiling or whether we smile during stress because it is like a grimace warrants further investigation and replication.”</p>



<p>This is a controversial field of research. And there’s plenty more that needs to be done to understand the effects reported in this study. However, the pain-reducing effects of either Duchenne smiling or grimacing are dramatic, and as the team also notes: “With 10% of the [global] population estimated to be needle-phobic and 16 billion injections occurring every year, the benefits of this simple method could be far-reaching.”</p>

Two of the articles discuss the relatively established pursuits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroesthetics" target="_blank">neuroaesthetics</a> (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30818-7" target="_blank">Iigaya et al., 2020</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorality" target="_blank">neuromorality</a>/moral decision-making (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30820-5" target="_blank">Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2020</a>). </p><p></p><p>Another article outlines the bare bones of an ambitious search for the neural correlates of collective memory, or the “Cultural Engram” (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30816-3" target="_blank">Dudai, 2020</a>):<br /></p><p></p><blockquote>I consider human cultures as biocultural ‘‘supraorganisms’’ that can store memory as distributed experience-dependent, behaviorally relevant representations over hundreds and thousands of years. Similar to other memory systems, these supraorganisms encode, consolidate, store, modify, and express memory items in the concerted activity of multiple types and tokens of sub-components of the system.  . . .  ...the memory traces are encoded in large distributed assemblies, composed of individual brains, intragenerational and intergenerational interacting brains, and multiple types of artifacts that interact with brains.</blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>The concept of the “Cultural Engram” is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4iUOi2lHgC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22cultural+engram%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ENSeCJafjS&amp;sig=ACfU3U2r91u7aeTeQa3SLcNk4Z7mGzjz-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjP1v6ci6ztAhXHpJ4KHaymACMQ6AEwC3oECBQQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20engram%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://issuu.com/vladimirmuhvich/docs/pro_engrama_p_trad_2017_english" target="_blank">new</a>, but a research program that incorporates an animal model for cultural memory is indeed novel (regardless of its potential validity): <br /></p><p></p><blockquote>The search for the cultural engram ... must be paired with productive model systems.

<p><em>Chapter 7 of </em><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/family-guide-to-mental-illness-and-the-law-9780190622220?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Family Guide to Mental Illness and the Law</a></em><em> is titled “When Police Are Called to Help” and deals with two types of circumstances: those involving people with mental illness as victims of crime and those in which families seek help from police during a mental health crisis. This blog post contains one small excerpt from that chapter.</em><em> </em></p><p>When you call 911 for assistance with someone whose mental health symptoms are out of control:</p><h2>1. Ask for the Crisis Intervention Team</h2><p>Specifically ask for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officers with mental health training. Tell the dispatcher that the person you are calling about has a diagnosed mental illness and is experiencing a mental health crisis and explain what that illness is.</p><h2>2. Help prepare the police officers for the scene</h2><p>Then after setting that foundation help prepare the officers for the scene by giving the 911 operator all of the details about the current behavior.</p><ul><li>Does this person have a weapon?</li><li>Is the person athletic or trained in martial arts?</li><li>Give facts about their size.</li><li> At this moment, is the person delusional, depressed, hallucinating, manic, spastic, or agitated?</li><li>Provide very quick context for any statements that the person is making.</li></ul><h2>3. Flag down the police officers upon arrival</h2><p>To help make the police encounter as safe as possible for everyone present, you or someone else should go outside to flag down the police and tell them where the building entrances are and where the event is happening inside the building.</p><h2>4. Give the on-scene police officers an update</h2><p>Even though you told everything to the dispatcher, give a quick descriptive update to the on-scene police as soon as you can. For example:</p><ul><li>“My bipolar thirty-year-old son, Steve, threw me down the stairs. I don’t know if he took his medicine. He is shaking all over and won’t talk to any of us.”</li><li>“My twenty-five-year-old sister, Kay, is delusional. She is pulling everything off of the shelves and throwing it on the floor. I ran next door. Nobody else is in the house with her.”</li><li>“My husband, Ted, is depressed. He locked himself in the upstairs bathroom and is crying about an old business failure. He keeps saying angry things about Bob, but Bob is long gone. There is no reason to worry about Bob.”</li></ul><h2>5. Stay out of the way</h2><p>Once the officers begin to work the scene, stay out of the way! Do not talk unless an officer asks you a question or calls on you to say something but stay close enough that the officers can communicate with you if they need to. The CIT officers know how to interact with people suffering from specific mental disturbances; they do not need you to translate for them. All police officers are trained to stabilize situations, so even if there is not a CIT officer present you should not interfere once you’ve oriented the officers to the situation.</p><p> </p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/ZXqE31D8TEk">Davey Heuser</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/how-to-call-for-the-police-crisis-intervention-team/">How to call for the police Crisis Intervention Team</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/639355027/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/639355027/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-jeremiah-barker-papers-medicine-as-practiced-200-years-ago/" rel="nofollow">The Jeremiah Barker Papers: medicine as practiced 200 years ago</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-case-for-investing-in-wind-energy/" rel="nofollow">The case for investing in wind energy</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>While puberty is not the easiest time of most people’s lives, the onset of early puberty is a notable public health issue which can lead to a higher risk of developing mental, emotional, and physical health conditions, such as depression, eating disorders, substance use, risky sexual activities, early sexual debut, and underage pregnancy.</p>
<p>A study by Aghaee <em>et al.</em> explored the impact of household intactness (defined as the child living with both parents until at least the age of 6, with this being checked during approximately a dozen healthcare visits between the ages of 0 and 6) on pubertal trajectories, focusing on filling the knowledge gap with regards to racial/ethnic minorities, as the majority of previous studies have been conducted using predominantly White cohorts. Their study included 26,044 girls born at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical facility between 2003 and 2010.</p>
<p>This study found that early life exposure to household non-intactness was associated with early pubertal timing in the girls included in this study, and that this association may vary between race/ethnicity, strongest among Black girls. While it goes without saying that the conditions of the family home cannot be modified by healthcare professionals, this knowledge can help facilitate conversations with the caregivers of young girls, who can work with providers to pinpoint areas of home life that can be improved through social and family services, hopefully avoiding the risk of early puberty.</p>

<p>In the US, immigrants who lack citizenship face significant barriers to accessing health care. From undocumented immigrants who are less likely to have medical insurance, to those with temporary status who are ineligible for federally-funded public insurance, and even lawful permanent residents (such as green card holders), immigrants face barriers compared to individuals with citizenship.</p>
<p>In recent years, state policy makers have increasingly enacted restrictive immigrant policies, referred to as criminalization policies based on their punitive treatment of noncitizens though surveillance and policing, linking immigration to the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>A study by Young <em>et al.</em> noted that these criminalization policies reinforced the marginalization of non-citizens, also producing health inequity between the states in the US. Advancing policies that de-criminalize or buffer immigrants from federal enforcement is critical to promote immigrants’ access to care and well-being.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect of clinical research is the informed consent of participants, a process which is rendered even more complex when a trial involves patients nearing the end of life where the research promises them little clinical benefit.</p>
<p>A study by Murphy <em>et al.</em> aimed at gaining greater understanding of how these patients make decisions regarding clinical trial participation. They interviewed non-curative cancer patients in the UK who had previously been invited to participate in a clinical trial, as well as some of the healthcare professionals involved in their care, oncologists and clinical research nurses.</p>
<p>Both the patients and healthcare professionals indicated that “nothing to lose” was a core aspect of the decision making process, from the part of a patient as a search for a life-line, and for the healthcare professionals as a way to maintain hope for the patients. Generally, the patients and healthcare professionals were found to have similar perspectives. Informed consent is critical to ensure patients are fully informed of the trial requirements and potential outcomes, a task which is both more difficult and more important considering the vulnerability of this particular population.</p>

<p>The transcriptome remains a vastly under explored space despite its significance as a foundation for biology. The current challenges in annotating eukaryotic transcriptomes are biological complexity, RNA preparation, limitations of sequencing technologies and sequence analysis. Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can provide additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to differentiate from sequencing noise.</p>
<p>Kuo <em>et al.</em> have developed the Transcriptome Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software, aiming to leverage the power of long read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current processing pipelines. TAMA uses long read transcript data and high-quality reference genome assemblies to produce accurate and informative transcript models, improving transcript model prediction accuracy and increase transcriptome discovery with transparent and traceable steps.</p>
<p>TAMA, along with other commonly used tools, were used to analyse publicly available sequencing data (the Universal Human Reference RNA UHRR Sequel II Iso-Seq data), noted to have high read depth and long read accuracy. The use of parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. The authors found long read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read RNA sequencing data.</p>

<p>In the UK, the number of overweight and obese men is higher than the number of women, however, men are less likely to participate in weight management programmes. In fact, little is known as to how to best recruit men to weight management programmes.</p>
<p>McDonald <em>et. al</em> sought input from both patients and the public in their pre-trial decisions in order to try and successfully recruit male participants for a men-only weight management intervention. Various aspects of the recruitment process were discussed, from recruitment materials, to the study’s catchy name: “Game of Stones”, chosen by popular vote.</p>
<p>The authors of this study concluded that no single strategy appealed to all men, but their mixed methods approach highlighted factors which contributed to successful recruitment, among them the importance of language and adopting a sensitive approach to recruit the men. Recruitment strategy decisions should be evidence based and involve input from target group members, and further work is required to examine how these strategies could be implemented and sustained in practice.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We tend to think of empathy as a wholly positive thing, a trait that’s not only favourable to possess but that we should actively foster. Books and courses promise to reveal secret wells of empathy and ways to channel them; some people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/24/superpower-empaths-paid-read-mind-empathy">even charge</a> for “empathy readings”, a service that seems to sit somewhere between a psychic reading and a therapy session.</p>



<p>It would be easy to assume, therefore, that people who express empathy are generally well-liked. But a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-69773-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology </em>finds that our feelings towards “empathisers” depends on <em>who</em> they are empathising with. While empathisers were considered warmer overall, participants judged people who expressed empathy for those with troubling political views more harshly — suggesting that we don’t always interpret empathy as a pure moral virtue.</p>



<span id="more-40920"></span>



<p>In the first study, 464 participants were shown a scenario in which Ann (the “target”) and Beth (the “responder”) were meeting for the first time. In one condition, Ann worked for a children’s hospital; in the other, she worked for a white supremacist group.</p>



<p>Participants then read a conversation between the pair, with Ann telling Beth about a stressful experience at work planning an event for a large group of people. Those in the “empathic response” condition heard that Beth empathised with Ann, while other participants read that Beth gave a non-committal response. Finally, participants indicated how much they liked, respected, trusted and would like to be friends with Beth as well as how caring, kind and understanding they felt she was.</p>



<p>As expected, participants respected and liked Beth more, and considered her more warm, when she answered empathetically in the scenario where Ann worked at a hospital. When Ann worked for a white supremacist group, however, participants did not like Beth more or less depending on her response — though they did perceive her as slightly warmer when she was empathetic. These results were replicated in a second study in which Ann was presented as pro- or anti-vaccination. And in a third, participants liked Beth <em>less</em> when she empathised with a positive experience recounted by white supremacist Ann.      </p>



<p>In the next study, participants saw the same information from the first studies, including the same empathetic response from Beth. But this time, the non-empathetic response was actively condemning: participants heard that Beth told Ann that it “sounds to me like you’re getting what you deserve”. And participants liked and respected Beth more when she gave this negative response to white supremacist Ann (though she was still considered warmer when responding empathetically). This was also the case in a follow-up study replacing Ann and Beth with male figures, suggesting that the effect is not gendered.</p>



<p>“Empathy towards white supremacists isn’t favourably looked upon” isn’t hugely shocking news. But the study does shed some light on the way we think about empathy in general. As noted, empathy is often depicted as an uncomplicated moral good — something we should unconditionally strive for. But the results suggest a more complex situation, where empathy is morally relative rather than absolute. This is also evident in assessments of warmth, another seemingly straightforward trait — even when participants didn’t like or respect Beth, they still considered her warm.</p>



<p>Further research could look at how this impacts behaviour — that is, are we less likely to be friends with or act positively towards someone who has empathised with a group or person we dislike? And how does this affect processes like voting or endorsing particular political candidates?</p>



<p>Though we tend to think of empathy as something that exists between two people or groups, we rarely think about the third party observers witnessing it. But as the study shows, understanding the broader social context of empathy may help us better understand its true effects.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Criminals are often characterised in the popular press as <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Nb7eAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">“animals” or “cold-blooded”</a>. Such adjectives effectively dehumanise them, and there’s no end of research finding that if we deny fully human emotional and thinking capacities to other people, we are less likely to treat them in a humane way. But how long does prisoner dehumanisation last? Is it a life sentence? Or, wondered the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220911496">new paper</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, does it depend on how long a prisoner has left to serve?</p>



<span id="more-40913"></span>



<p>Jason C. Deska at Ryerson University in Canada and his colleagues ran a series of seven studies to investigate this. In each, participants viewed a series of 20 mugshots of White men imprisoned in Florida. Though the mugshots were of real prisoners, the team manipulated the accompanying information, so that each man’s sentence was stated as being around 1,460 days (four years), and they had either served around one month or had only about one month left in prison.</p>



<p>The first two studies, on 148 students and then 155 adults recruited online, revealed that the participants ascribed greater mental sophistication to the prisoners who were about to be released than to those who had only just started their sentences. These prisoners were credited with having greater emotional and cognitive faculties as well as greater agency — an ability to act according to their own individual intentions. They were, in other words, subject to less dehumanisation.</p>



<p>In the next five studies, the researchers further explored what they called the “time-to-serve effect”. They investigated the potential role of the participants’ beliefs about the four primary functions of incarceration, as identified by laypeople as well as experts in criminal justice. These are: rehabilitation, retribution, deterrence (from committing another crime) and incapacitation (removing criminals from society, to prevent them from harming anyone else). In each study, fresh batches of online participants viewed the same 20 mugshots, along with sentencing information. But as well as completing the Mind Attribution Scale, which measured any dehumanisation, participants also rated the extent to which they felt that the prisoner had either been rehabilitated, punished, deterred or incapacitated. (Each study included just one of these mini-scales.)</p>



<p>Soon-to-be-released prisoners were seen as being more rehabilitated, more adequately punished, and more likely to have been deterred from committing future crimes. These perceptions in turn led people to view the prisoners approaching the end of their sentence as more “human”. The researchers stress that they are not arguing that prison is an effective deterrent, or that punishment causes prisoners to gain mental sophistication — rather, that beliefs about how well the functions of prison have been met seem to affect levels of dehumanisation of prisoners.</p>



<p>In the final study, participants completed all three of these scales, rather than just one. This time, only beliefs relating to levels of rehabilitation and deterrence — and not retribution — emerged as being important for driving the “time to serve” effect.</p>



<p>As the team notes, deterrence and retribution both involve the infliction of pain on the individual, but only deterrence seeks to <em>change</em> that person. Effective rehabilitation and deterrence both entail changes in the prisoner’s mental state, and, it seems, either less dehumanisation by others, or a restoration of ascriptions of typical human capacities.</p>



<p>“Prisoners are a chronically dehumanized social group,” the team notes. Given work finding that dehumanisation of prisoners “both impedes successful rehabilitation and facilitates inhumane treatment”, it’s clearly important to understand the circumstances and beliefs that can affect these kinds of views.</p>



<p>“Although our data cannot speak to how effective incarceration is for actual rehabilitation and deterrence, they do suggest that emphasising these functions of incarceration may be especially important for interventions designed at integrating ex-convicts back into society,” the team concludes. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/29/researchers-assume-white-americans-are-more-representative-of-humankind-than-other-groups-according-to-analysis-of-psychology-paper-titles/">Well, they do if that society comprises mostly White Americans</a>, and if the prisoners are all White males, as was the case here. As the researchers themselves note, “Future work would do well to examine how diverse participants in non-WEIRD cultures dehumanize prisoners across the course of their prison term.” Different cultural attitudes, and also the nature of a prisoner’s crime (in these studies, the crimes were deliberately not identified) could clearly affect prisoner dehumanisation, too. But these are interesting first steps to a deeper understanding of which beliefs lead us to dehumanise prisoners, and how they might be modified.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about a paper "Complex Dynamics in Simplified Neuronal Models: Reproducing Golgi Cell Electroresponsiveness".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Brain neurons exhibit complex electroresponsive properties – including intrinsic
subthreshold oscillations and pacemaking, resonance and phase-reset – which are
thought to play a critical role in controlling neural network dynamics. Although
these properties emerge from detailed representations of molecular-level
mechanisms in “realistic” models, they cannot usually be generated by simplified
neuronal models (although these may show spike-frequency adaptation and
bursting). We report here that this whole set of properties can be generated by
the extended generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (E-GLIF) neuron model. E-GLIF
derives from the GLIF model family and is therefore mono-compartmental, keeps
the limited computational load typical of a linear low-dimensional system,
admits analytical solutions and can be tuned through gradient-descent
algorithms. Importantly, E-GLIF is designed to maintain a correspondence between
model parameters and neuronal membrane mechanisms through a minimum set of
equations. In order to test its potential, E-GLIF was used to model a specific
neuron showing rich and complex electroresponsiveness, the cerebellar Golgi
cell, and was validated against experimental electrophysiological data recorded
from Golgi cells in acute cerebellar slices. During simulations, E-GLIF was
activated by stimulus patterns, including current steps and synaptic inputs,
identical to those used for the experiments. The results demonstrate that E-GLIF
can reproduce the whole set of complex neuronal dynamics typical of these
neurons – including intensity-frequency curves, spike-frequency adaptation,
post-inhibitory rebound bursting, spontaneous subthreshold oscillations,
resonance, and phase-reset – providing a new effective tool to investigate brain
dynamics in large-scale simulations.</p>

I posted a plea for help on the Internet Archive blog: Can You Help us Make the 19th Century Searchable? and we got many social media offers and over 50 comments the post– maybe a record response rate.

The OAPEN Foundation is delighted to announce that Niels Stern has been appointed as Director of OAPEN Foundation. Niels will take over from Eelco Ferwerda on the 1st of January, as Eelco will retire at the end of this year. Niels will also join Pierre Mounier as a member of the Executive Board of DOAB Foundation. And at the same time, Ronald Snijder will be appointed as Deputy Director of OAPEN.

 

The appointment comes at an exciting time for OAPEN, ten years after the launch of OAPEN Foundation and a few months after the launch of our newest resource, the OAPEN OA Books Toolkit. At the same time, we are migrating DOAB to an open source platform as part of the ongoing OPERAS-P project. And last but not least, OAPEN and DOAB were jointly deemed essential open science services by SCOSS, the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services, and are seeking support from the open science community in the current SCOSS funding cycle.

On behalf of the Board of the OAPEN Foundation, chairman Bas Savenije said: “In the past 10 years Eelco Ferwerda has successfully transformed OAPEN from a project to an organisation which is recognised internationally as an important player in open access book publishing. Important steps towards a sustainable organisation have been made and we are confident that Niels Stern is the right person to continue Eelco’s work and to shape the future development of OAPEN. The Board thanks Eelco for his accomplishments and we wish him the very best.”

“I feel very privileged to continue the great work that Eelco Ferwerda and his team have delivered for a decade now,” said Niels Stern. “OAPEN and DOAB are key services for scholarly open access book publishing. The number of books and their usage on the new platform is increasing rapidly, and both OAPEN and DOAB are deeply engaged in many exciting projects and networks, e.g. the OPERAS network. The momentum for OA books is rising. Being part of the SCOSS campaign adds to this momentum for OAPEN and DOAB. I look very much forward to contributing to the further development of OAPEN and DOAB to the benefit of the community for scholarly book publishing.”

Eelco Ferwerda said: “I have been very fortunate to have had a role in the development of OAPEN and DOAB and it has been a joy to work with so many people from all over the world with a passion for open access. I am thrilled that Niels is taking over and can’t imagine anyone better suited to lead OAPEN and DOAB in the years ahead. Although I am now retiring, I do hope to remain involved in OAPEN and DOAB in new ways, and do new things in the area of OA books.”

SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) works to enable the open sharing of research outputs and educational materials in order to democratize access to knowledge, accelerate discovery, and increase the return on our investment in research and education. As a catalyst for action, SPARC focuses on collaborating with other stakeholders—including authors, publishers, libraries, students, funders, policymakers and the public—to build on the opportunities created by the Internet, promoting changes to both infrastructure and culture needed to make open the default for research and education.
