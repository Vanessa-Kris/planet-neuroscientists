Women working in sex work are vulnerable to violence from multiple perpetrators –including their own intimate partners, customers, law enforcement, and pimps. Experiencing violence can lead to a range of detrimental health and mental health outcomes, including HIV/STI exposure, substance use, physical injuries, unwanted pregnancies, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicide.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8249" style="width: 223px;"><img alt="Feliciano Guimarães" class="size-medium wp-image-8249" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/woman-213x300.jpg" width="213" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Feliciano Guimarães</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Researchers and practitioners have looked to microfinance programs as one approach to promote economic security and reduce sexual risk behavior of women working in sex work. However, concern exists about the impact of microfinance participation on women’s risk for violence. Some research studies have found that participating in microfinance programs heightens women’s risk for violence, while others have found that microfinance participation protects women from violence. The impact of microfinance participation on women’s experiences of violence appears to vary per the cultural context. Most of these prior studies focus on violence from intimate partners, but not have looked at the effect on violence from customers among women in sex work.</p>
<p>In our study, we implemented an HIV/STI risk reduction training with women working in sex work. With approximately half of these women (selected at random), we also provided a microsavings program. Microsavings refers to a branch of microfinance which focuses on helping low-income persons build savings for future use. We used a microsavings model instead of a microcredit (i.e. loan-based) model because we did not want to burden women with high loan repayment interest rates or foster over-reliance upon debt.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8246" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="www.moolanomy.com/" class="size-medium wp-image-8246" height="224" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/money-300x224.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">www.moolanomy.com/</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We tested the impact of participating in microsavings on women’s experiences of violence from their customers. When we compared the two groups (i.e. women who participated in only the HIV/STI training vs. women who participated in both the HIV/STI training and microsavings), we found that over time women in both groups experienced less violence from their customers. Before the program, 44% reported experiencing recent violence from their customers, compared to 12% of women 6 months after the program finished. However, participating in the microsavings program did not significantly impact women’s risk of paying partner violence even though this intervention was effective in transferring women’s income from sex work to other sources.</p>
<p>What can we learn from this study? One explanation for the reductions in violence in both groups is that women may have learned ways to protect themselves from violence from customers in the HIV/STI risk reduction training. Alternatively, it is possible that the provision of social support from peers and program staff could have contributed to this reduction in violence, as many women reported minimal support from social services and high levels of stigma prior to joining our program. The study demonstrates that it is possible to engage a vulnerable group of women in a microsavings intervention without increasing reported experiences of violence from customers.  With proper planning, it is possible to implement microfinance interventions with women in sex work without placing them at greater risk for experiencing violence. While more work remains, this study offers a critical step in understanding how to implement microfinance interventions while prioritizing women’s safety.</p>

<p>It feels like this year there has been a big increase in people’s tendency to make a show of their political allegiance, to believe passionately in the superiority of their chosen group’s position, and to be ultra-vigilant to any potential incoming slight or insult toward the group. This kind of behaviour shows signs of “collective narcissism”, which like individual narcissism, is characterised by outward confidence compensating for deep-rooted insecurity.</p>
<p>Collective narcissists say they believe that their group is special and superior, yet when asked what others think of their group, or when tested on implicit measures, such as how quickly they associate in-group symbols with positive words, there is evidence of collective doubt. Worryingly, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/per.2067/abstract">a series of new studies</a> in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em> shows how collective narcissism can foster inter-group conflict. The results suggest it is important that responsible politicians and journalists do what they can to prevent rather than encourage this dangerous group mentality.</p>
<p><span id="more-15011"></span></p>
<p>Across five studies, Agnieskzka Golec De Zavala and her colleagues surveyed hundreds of participants in Turkey, Portugal and Poland. The most important measure was of the participants’ feelings of collective narcissism, as revealed through their agreement with statements like “My [national] group deserves special treatment”; “I will never be satisfied until my group gets all it deserves”; and “If my group had a major say in the world, the world would be a much better place”. The researchers found that high scores on collective narcissism tended to go hand in hand with feeling that one’s group had been insulted or derogated in some way, and in turn, wishing for direct or indirect revenge against the out-group.</p>
<p>For instance, after reading a news story about Turkey’s failure to become part of the EU, Turkish participants who scored highly in collective narcissism were more likely to say they interpreted this as a national humiliation, and were more likely to say they found pleasure in the EU’s recent economic woes.</p>
<p>After reading about the EU financial bailout of Portugal in 2011 (and related austerity measures seen by many as imposed principally by Germany), Portuguese participants who scored highly in collective narcissism were more likely to believe that Germany was a threat to Portugal (for example, believing that the EU legal system shows favouritism toward Germany), and in turn were more likely to express intentions to harm, injure, humiliate or intimidate Germans given the chance.</p>
<p>Other similar studies with Polish participants showed that high collective narcissism was related to finding a controversial film (about Polish pogroms) insulting, and wishing for revenge against the film-makers; and there were similar findings related to finding insult in an actor’s jokes at the expense of the Polish political system.</p>
<p>In all studies, collective narcissism was found to be the strongest, and in some cases unique, correlate of the likelihood of perceiving insults or humiliations towards one’s national group, and thence wishing for retribution. For instance, the researchers also measured individual narcissism but this did not have these same associations, possibly because individual narcissists tend to pick and choose group identities as and when they work in their favour. Note too that when separated from any signs of collective narcissism, a positive, patriotic (but not grandiose) attitude towards one’s national in-group actually acted as a buffer against perceiving insults and wishing for vengeance towards other groups.</p>
<p>Where does collective narcissism come from? This is only part of the story, but based on measures of participants’ self-esteem, there was some evidence that collective narcissism may act as a compensation for low individual confidence and low self-worth. Lacking confidence in themselves, people can find comfort in aligning closely with a larger grouping, and seeing this group as somehow special and great. In turn, they are then highly defensive of their chosen group’s status, ultra-sensitive to possible slights, and keen to derogate any threatening groups.</p>
<p>“The present results suggest that there will always be a proportion of the population, which is responsive to the framing of intergroup situations as insulting to an in-group,” the researchers said. “Such a framing is likely to mobilise support for hostile actions towards the alleged perpetrators of the imagined in-group offences.” For this reason, the researchers said that collective narcissism, as and when it arises, could be part of a dangerous social psychological process that fosters intergroup tensions and even extremist activities.</p>
<p>The new findings suggest that any politician who ferments in their followers a grandiose belief in the in-group, combined with encouraging them to believe the in-group is being insulted or slighted by others, is arguably fostering collective narcissism and sowing the seeds for future conflict and hostility. One positive way to intervene might be to see if collective narcissists can be encouraged to channel their envy and sensitivity toward constructively helping their in-group rather than harming out-groups.</p>
<p>“[B]etter understanding of the cultural, economic, educational or societal contexts that encourage versus discourage collective narcissism may inspire new ways to deescalate intergroup tensions and discourage radicalization towards intergroup violence,” the researchers concluded.</p>

Demonstrated benefits from pet ownership include reduced <a href="http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/12/6/236">stress</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12271103">improved physical health</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12271173">increased social interaction</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11111505">reduced loneliness</a>. Loneliness and isolation are key concerns for those living with mental health problems and having <a href="http://www.clahrc-wessex.nihr.ac.uk/theme/project/37">a support network in place is important for living everyday life</a>. During difficult emotional periods people report losing relationships with friends and family as well as connections with valued activities which maybe difficult to reconnect with. Emphasis is often placed on the importance of family, friends and interaction with other people. However, the role of pets within this support network is relatively under explored.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We examined the role of pets within the personal communities of those living with a mental health condition by analyzing interviews with 54 participants, 25 of whom had a pet. Participants were asked to map personal networks using a diagram, which consisted of three concentric circles. Interviewers started the interview by asking <em>‘Who or what do you think is most important to you in managing your mental health?’</em></p>
<p> </p>
<img alt="pet-blog-image-cc-the-authors" class="aligncenter wp-image-8189 size-full" height="540" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/Pet-blog-image-CC-The-authors.jpg" title="The Authors CC" width="720" />
<p>Participants could place network members in either the central circle considered most important, the middle circle, considered important but not as important as the central circle or the outer circle, considered important but not as important as the two more central two circles. Identified network members included friends, family members, health professionals pets, hobbies, places, activities and objects.</p>
<p>The majority of pets were placed in the central, most valued circle of support within network diagrams. Pets were of increased importance where relationships with other network members were limited or difficult.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pets were implicated in the management of mental health through the provision of secure and intimate relationships not available elsewhere. Given the consistency of presence and a close physical proximity, pets were an instant source of calming, therapeutic support for their owners.</p>
<p><em>“So with my pets I suppose although my Mum and Dad are very significant figures they’ve also got their own lives and lots of other things going on so I’m only one aspect of that life and I feel that the pets I suppose they depend on me and also I have daily contact with them and they also give me a sense of wellbeing which I don’t get from any [one else] because most of these interactions with my Mum, Dad, [friend], are all by telephone rather than physical contact and that’s the big difference is the empathetic physical presence”. <strong>(ID 21, 10 birds, first circle)</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>I feel that the pets I suppose they depend on me and also I have daily contact with them and they also give me a sense of wellbeing which I don’t get from any [one else] </em></p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Pets helped their owners manage feelings by distracting them from symptoms and upsetting experiences such as hearing voices and suicide ideation and provided a form of encouragement for activity.</p>
<p><em>“But if I’m here and I’m having…having problems with voices and that, it does help me in the sense, you know, I’m not thinking about the voices, I’m just thinking of when I hear the birds singing” <strong>(ID 2, 2 birds, first circle)</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Participants in this study had more difficult relationships with others and experienced greater levels of stigma than those included in a study exploring the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3785224/">role of pets in the management of chronic physical conditions</a>.</p>
<p><em>“I think it’s hard really when you haven’t had mental illness to know what the actual experience is for someone who has had the experience. There’s like a chasm, deep chasm between us – a growing canyon. They’re on one side of it and we’re on the other side of it. We’re sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don’t always”.<strong> (ID 1, 1 cat, first circle)</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s like a chasm, deep chasm between us – a growing canyon. They’re on one side of it and we’re on the other side of it. </em></p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Pets helped their owners to manage this stigma directly by providing acceptance without judgment.</p>
<p><em>“But he, his [the cat’s] love for me and acceptance of me never changed”. <strong>(ID 7, 1 cat, second circle)</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Participants described the various, different ways that pets connected them to others in, and beyond, their personal networks or to the wider social environment.</p>
<p><em>“You know, so in terms of mental health, when you just want to sink into a pit and just sort of retreat from the entire world, they force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved with the world”. <strong>(ID 5, 2 cats, first circle)</strong></em></p>

<p>Having two dogs myself, I can certainly identify with the characteristics attributed to pets in our study. I very rarely get down the road now without a neighbor or friendly stranger stopping to ask me about them and it’s true what they say that ‘there’s nothing better to come home to than a dog’s welcome’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was surprised though by the <em>range </em>and <em>depth </em>of roles pets played in the management of mental health problems from the perspectives of participants. Interestingly, for the people included in this study despite their potential value, pets were also not considered or included in discussions about their mental health care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Given that service users currently feel distanced from healthcare and uninvolved in discussions about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243762">services generally</a>, taking more creative approaches to service provision including the discussion of pets, may be one way of addressing this because of the value, meaning and engagement that individuals have with their pets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We think that our study provides the mental health community with possible areas to target intervention and potential ways in which to better involve service users in service provision through the discussion of valued experiences.</p>

<p>Imagine a person is terrified of dogs because they once suffered a terrible bite. Following long-established techniques, their psychologist might gradually expose them to dogs in a safe setting, until their fear gradually faded away. This “exposure therapy” can be effective but it has some serious drawbacks, including the fact that the person might at first find it traumatic to be close to dogs again.</p>
<p>What if there were a way to remove this person’s fear of dogs at a subconscious level, without the need for any traumatic exposure? Such an approach has now come much closer to clinical reality thanks to a <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0006">new study</a> reported recently in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>. The findings suggest that neurofeedback can be used to unlearn a fear by pairing relevant non-conscious neural activity with a reward, such as money. Significant technical hurdles remain before this becomes a real-life treatment, but it’s an exciting breakthrough. <span id="more-14871"></span></p>
<p>Ai Koizumi at ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Japan and her colleagues trained 17 participants (11 men) to fear two colourful grating patterns presented on a computer screen by repeatedly pairing the patterns with safe but unpleasant electric shocks. Toward the end of this session, measures of the participants’ electrodermal response (skin sweatiness) to the sight of the two patterns confirmed that they now found them aversive. Prior to the fear-induction, the researchers had also scanned the participants’ brains while they looked at these two patterns, so the researchers knew what neural activity tended to accompany the mental representation of each one. After the fear-induction process, one of the patterns (the “target”) was chosen as the learned fear to be removed, the other acted as a control.</p>
<p>Next, over three days, the participants undertook several sessions of neural feedback training, during which the researchers monitored their brain activity. This involved the participants looking at a grey grating pattern and then trying to use any mental strategy they liked to try to get a small disc on the screen to increase in size. If the participants succeeded, they were rewarded with small amounts of money.</p>
<p>At the first session, the participants found this challenge impossible, but gradually and subconsciously they improved at the task. Unbeknown to the participants, their success was dependent on their displaying a particular form of brain activity (hence why this was a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofeedback">neurofeedback</a> training). More specifically, what made the disc grow was the participants’ visual cortex exhibiting neural activity previously associated with representing the target grating pattern. In other words, whenever the participants’ brains showed non-conscious neural activity related to the target feared pattern – which they did occasionally – the disc grew, and they were rewarded with money.</p>
<p>During the training, the participants showed no experience of fear, either subjectively or based on their electrodermal response (the sweatiness of their skin), suggesting the fear-related brain activity was entirely non-conscious. And quizzed after the training, it was clear the participants had no idea what had been going on at a subconscious level – they didn’t know what they had been doing mentally to increase the disc size and receive money, and they didn’t know which grating they had been trained not to fear and which one was the control. So while the researchers were busy training the participants’ brains to like one of the patterns that they’d previously learned to fear, the participants themselves were blissfully ignorant of what was going on.</p>
<p>Of course the key test was what happened when, after the neurofeedback training, the researchers subsequently re-exposed the participants to the two colourful grating patterns. As hoped, the participants showed a much weaker fear response (again, based on their skin sweatiness) to the sight of the target grating, as compared with the control grating. In fact, the magnitude of this fear reduction was similar to that seen for conventional exposure therapy. The researchers also scanned the participants’ brains during this testing phase (as they had done during the fear-induction phase) and this showed that the participants’ amygdala activity was now lower in response to the target grating compared with the control grating. The amygdala is involved in fear processing so this provides more evidence that the fear-removal process had worked.</p>
<p>So what are some of the technical hurdles before this kind of approach reaches your local psych clinic? Let’s return to our imaginary individual who is terrified of dogs. For the subconscious neurofeedback training to work, we’d need to know what kind of brain activity pattern this person shows when she encounters dogs, in order that we could pair this activity, at a subconscious level, with a reward. But this dog-related brain activity will be more far more complex than the neural activity associated with a simple grating pattern on a computer screen. And to find out what it looks like, we’d of course need to scan the person’s brain while we exposed him or her to dogs – defeating the whole object of the cunning neurofeedback approach!</p>
<p>There may be a way around this, the researchers suggested – for example, by extrapolating from other people’s dog-related brain activity or by decoding dog-related brain activity based on showing our client subliminal dog images (I’m running with the dog example here but the same principles would apply whatever it is that a client feared). “Despite these challenges,” Koizumi and her colleagues concluded, “the present results hopefully represent an initial step towards a potential new avenue for treatment.”</p>

            <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinical therapy, involving the surgical
implantation of electrodes into disorder specific nuclei, used to treat
the symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson¹s disease and
essential tremor (ET). The mechanisms through which the electrical
stimulation leads to the observed clinical improvements remain unclear, to
the extent that it is unknown how stimulation changes neuronal excitation.
If we better understood these mechanisms, we could optimise the parameters
setting process and minimise unwanted side effects. To study the effect of
stimulation on the firing activity of axons, single neurons, and networks
of neurons, I take a multi-level computational modelling approach. First I
create a finite element model to calculate the distribution of electric
potential induced by DBS and then applied the potential as an
extracellular stimulus to multicompartment axon or neuron models. I have
previously shown that such models can reveal detailed spatial effects of
stimulation in the vicinity of the electrode. To study network level
changes, I model the network proposed to be involved in generating
pathological synchronous activity via a Wilson-Cowan approach. The
parameter space of such a model can be explored to uncover regions which
produced oscillatory thalamic activity in the typical ET frequency range
(4-12Hz). Taken together, these models demonstrate a method of
quantitatively assessing neuronal changes induced by DBS, to maximise
therapeutic benefit and minimise unwanted side effects.</p>

This means there are almost one billion people who face everyday inequality, marginalization, and discrimination through inequitable opportunities, as compared to persons without disabilities. Moreover, persons with psychosocial disabilities face disparate access to healthcare and social services worldwide, along with systemic discrimination, structural inequalities, and widespread human rights abuses. People with psychosocial disabilities face particularly acute social challenges and continue to be subjected to human rights violations worldwide. The stories of discrimination, mistreatment, and exclusion are harrowing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Approximately 15% of the world’s population lives with disabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, many people have looked to international human rights law to help address mental health challenges. On December 13, 2006, the United Nations formally adopted the landmark Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) – the first human rights treaty of the 21st century and the fastest ever negotiated.</p>
<h3><strong>CRPD implementation in Canada</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-016-0103-1">article</a> published in <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC International Health and Human Rights</em> </a>assesses the CRPD’s potential impact on mental health systems and presents a legal and public policy analysis of its implementation in one high-income country: Canada. As part of this analysis, we undertook a critical review of the CRPD’s implementation in Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence related to mental health.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that while the CRPD remains conspicuously absent from Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence, the country’s ratification of the Convention (which took place on March 11, 2010) has facilitated an important shift in the social and cultural paradigms surrounding psychosocial disability in Canada. As a result, this new international human rights treaty may be aiding the everyday struggles of persons living with psychosocial disabilities – even in the wealthiest countries – by facilitating larger changes in social norms and expectations around such disabilities.</p>
<h3><strong>Barriers to implementation</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>CRPD remains conspicuously absent from Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Convention is clearly an important step forward, there remains a divide, even in Canada, between the Convention’s goals and the experiences of Canadians with disabilities. Its implementation is perhaps hindered most by Canada’s reservations to Article 12 of the CRPD on legal capacity for persons with psychosocial disabilities.</p>
<p>The overseeing CRPD Committee has stated that Article 12 only permits “supported decision-making” regimes, yet most Canadian jurisdictions maintain their “substitute decision-making” regimes. This means that many Canadians with mental health challenges continue to be denied legal capacity to make decisions related to their healthcare, housing, and finances. But changes are afoot: new legislation has been introduced in different jurisdictions across the country, and recent court decisions have started to push policymakers in this direction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the success of the CRPD and other international laws related to mental health depends on the extent to which they are domestically implemented and followed by its state parties.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of explicit implementation, the CRPD has helped to facilitate a larger shift in social and cultural paradigms of mental health and disability in Canada. But mere ratification and passive implementation are not enough. Further efforts are needed to implement the CRPD’s provisions and promote the equal enjoyment of human rights by all Canadian citizens – and presumably for all other people too, from the poorest to the wealthiest countries.</p>

<p>We know from twin and family studies that our personality is to a large degree – probably around 40 per cent – inherited. Geneticists are busy trying to find the specific gene variants involved, but because each one on its own only exerts a modest influence, this is challenging research requiring huge samples. A <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3736.html">new study</a> in <em>Nature Genetics</em> has made a significant contribution, using the technique of Genome Wide Analysis to look for genetic variants that correlate with personality. The researchers led by Min-Tzu Lo at the University of California, San Diego have identified variations in six genetic loci that correlate with different personality trait scores, five of which were previously unknown. In a separate analysis, the researchers also showed that many of the genetic variants involved in personality overlap with those involved in the risk of developing mental health disorders.</p>
<p><span id="more-14758"></span></p>
<p>The researchers analysed the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people, including clients of <a href="https://www.23andme.com/en-gb/">23andMe</a> – a commercial service that promises to inform customers about their ancestry and health based on their DNA (usefully for present purposes, the company also asks its clients to complete personality questionnaires). Among the genetic loci the researchers identified as being linked with personality, the most influential correlated with Neuroticism scores and was on a region of chromosome 8 (specifically 8p23.1) that is known to be involved in nervous system development and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Another that was linked with extraversion scores was on a region of chromosome 12 (specifically 12q23.3) that has also been highlighted in genetic research into bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The researchers also compared the gene/personality correlations in their massive data sets with similar records previously obtained by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium to look for genetic influences on mental health disorders. This showed substantial genetic correlations between personality and psychiatric disorders – that is, many of the genetic influences on personality are also implicated in the risk of developing various mental health disorders. This makes sense given what we already know about the influence of personality on mental health – for instance, high scorers on Neuroticism are at increased risk of anxiety and depression, while high scorers on Extraversion and Openness to Experience are more likely than others to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The genetic findings largely matched this picture. For instance, in terms of shared genetic influences, the trait of Openness to Experience, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia tended to cluster together, as did Neuroticism and Depression, and Extraversion and ADHD.</p>
<p>Another test the researchers were able to do was to see what proportion of the variation in the participants’ personality traits could be traced to differences in their genome – in other words to estimate the genetic heritability for each of the Big Five traits. Based on an analysis of over one million genetic variants (<a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp">single-nucleotide polymorphisms</a>; SNPs) present in the 59,000+ clients of 23andMe, the researchers found that Extraversion was the most strongly heritable trait with 18 per cent of variation in this trait traceable to differences in the genome (the estimates for Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness were 8 per cent, 9 per cent, 11 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively). As expected, these heritability estimates for personality are lower than those found in twin and family studies – among the reasons for this is the fact the researchers were only able to look at a fraction of the genetic variants that may play a role in personality, and were unable to explore ways that genes interact with the environment.</p>
<p>The researchers said that overall their results are consistent with the idea that “maladaptive or extreme variants of personality may contribute to the persistence of, or vulnerability to, psychiatric disorders and comorbidity”. They ended with a note about keeping things in perspective. “Personality traits are probably influenced by many genetic variants and gene-environment interactions,” they said. “Researchers are only beginning to understand the  genetics of personality and their relation to psychiatric disorders.” In other words, these are important findings, but they are just one small piece in a growing genetic jigsaw puzzle that might one day contribute to improving people’s mental health.</p>

 The fact that the identity of the cells that initiate metastasis in most human cancers is unknown hampers the development of antimetastatic therapies. Here we describe a subpopulation of CD44bright cells in human oral carcinomas that do not overexpress mesenchymal genes, are slow-cycling, express high levels of the fatty acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes, and are unique in their ability to initiate metastasis. Palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically boosts the metastatic potential of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells in a CD36-dependent manner. The use of neutralizing antibodies to block CD36 causes almost complete inhibition of metastasis in immunodeficient or immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of human oral cancer, with no side effects. Clinically, the presence of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells correlates with a poor prognosis for numerous types of carcinomas, and inhibition of CD36 also impairs metastasis, at least in human melanoma- and breast cancer-derived tumours. Together, our results indicate that metastasis-initiating cells particularly rely on dietary lipids to promote metastasis.

 Chemokines and their G-protein-coupled receptors play a diverse role in immune defence by controlling the migration, activation and survival of immune cells. They are also involved in viral entry, tumour growth and metastasis and hence are important drug targets in a wide range of diseases. Despite very significant efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop drugs, with over 50 small-molecule drugs directed at the family entering clinical development, only two compounds have reached the market: maraviroc (CCR5) for HIV infection and plerixafor (CXCR4) for stem-cell mobilization. The high failure rate may in part be due to limited understanding of the mechanism of action of chemokine antagonists and an inability to optimize compounds in the absence of structural information. CC chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) activation by CCL25 plays a key role in leukocyte recruitment to the gut and represents a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease. The selective CCR9 antagonist vercirnon progressed to phase 3 clinical trials in Crohn’s disease but efficacy was limited, with the need for very high doses to block receptor activation. Here we report the crystal structure of the CCR9 receptor in complex with vercirnon at 2.8 Å resolution. Remarkably, vercirnon binds to the intracellular side of the receptor, exerting allosteric antagonism and preventing G-protein coupling. This binding site explains the need for relatively lipophilic ligands and describes another example of an allosteric site on G-protein-coupled receptors that can be targeted for drug design, not only at CCR9, but potentially extending to other chemokine receptors.

 CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is one of 19 members of the chemokine receptor subfamily of human class A G-protein-coupled receptors. CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and T-cell subpopulations, and mediates their migration towards endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL2 (ref. 1). CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in numerous inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer. These disease associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials (see http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the CCR2–chemokine axis. To aid drug discovery efforts, here we solve a structure of CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric (BMS-681 (ref. 6)) and allosteric (CCR2-RA-[R]) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by occupying the orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode. CCR2-RA-[R] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most intracellular allosteric site observed in class A G-protein-coupled receptors so far; this site spatially overlaps the G-protein-binding site in homologous receptors. CCR2-RA-[R] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking activation-associated conformational changes and formation of the G-protein-binding interface. The conformational signature of the conserved microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2 resembles the most inactive G-protein-coupled receptor structures solved so far. Like other protein–protein interactions, receptor–chemokine complexes are considered challenging therapeutic targets for small molecules, and the present structure suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to overcome obstacles in drug design.

 The Yorkie homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1), effectors of the Hippo pathway, have been identified as mediators for mechanical stimuli. However, the role of YAP/TAZ in haemodynamics-induced mechanotransduction and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains unclear. Here we show that endothelial YAP/TAZ activity is regulated by different patterns of blood flow, and YAP/TAZ inhibition suppresses inflammation and retards atherogenesis. Atheroprone-disturbed flow increases whereas atheroprotective unidirectional shear stress inhibits YAP/TAZ activity. Unidirectional shear stress activates integrin and promotes integrin–Gα13 interaction, leading to RhoA inhibition and YAP phosphorylation and suppression. YAP/TAZ inhibition suppresses JNK signalling and downregulates pro-inflammatory genes expression, thereby reducing monocyte attachment and infiltration. In vivo endothelial-specific YAP overexpression exacerbates, while CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Yap knockdown in endothelium retards, plaque formation in ApoE−/− mice. We also show several existing anti-atherosclerotic agents such as statins inhibit YAP/TAZ transactivation. On the other hand, simvastatin fails to suppress constitutively active YAP/TAZ-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells, indicating that YAP/TAZ inhibition could contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin. Furthermore, activation of integrin by oral administration of MnCl2 reduces plaque formation. Taken together, our results indicate that integrin–Gα13–RhoA–YAP pathway holds promise as a novel drug target against atherosclerosis.

 Endogenous viral elements are increasingly found in eukaryotic genomes, yet little is known about their origins, dynamics, or function. Here we provide a compelling example of a DNA virus that readily integrates into a eukaryotic genome where it acts as an inducible antiviral defence system. We found that the virophage mavirus, a parasite of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV), integrates at multiple sites within the nuclear genome of the marine protozoan Cafeteria roenbergensis. The endogenous mavirus is structurally and genetically similar to eukaryotic DNA transposons and endogenous viruses of the Maverick/Polinton family. Provirophage genes are not constitutively expressed, but are specifically activated by superinfection with CroV, which induces the production of infectious mavirus particles. Virophages can inhibit the replication of mimivirus-like giant viruses and an anti-viral protective effect of provirophages on their hosts has been hypothesized. We find that provirophage-carrying cells are not directly protected from CroV; however, lysis of these cells releases infectious mavirus particles that are then able to suppress CroV replication and enhance host survival during subsequent rounds of infection. The microbial host–parasite interaction described here involves an altruistic aspect and suggests that giant-virus-induced activation of provirophages might be ecologically relevant in natural protist populations.

 Changes in gamma oscillations (20–50 Hz) have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)1–40 and Aβ 1–42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Aβ. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer’s-disease-associated pathology.

 The internal mechanics of proteins—the coordinated motions of amino acids and the pattern of forces constraining these motions—connects protein structure to function. Here we describe a new method combining the application of strong electric field pulses to protein crystals with time-resolved X-ray crystallography to observe conformational changes in spatial and temporal detail. Using a human PDZ domain (LNX2PDZ2) as a model system, we show that protein crystals tolerate electric field pulses strong enough to drive concerted motions on the sub-microsecond timescale. The induced motions are subtle, involve diverse physical mechanisms, and occur throughout the protein structure. The global pattern of electric-field-induced motions is consistent with both local and allosteric conformational changes naturally induced by ligand binding, including at conserved functional sites in the PDZ domain family. This work lays the foundation for comprehensive experimental study of the mechanical basis of protein function.

 The most prevalent route of HIV-1 infection is across mucosal tissues after sexual contact. Langerhans cells (LCs) belong to the subset of dendritic cells (DCs) that line the mucosal epithelia of vagina and foreskin and have the ability to sense and induce immunity to invading pathogens. Anatomical and functional characteristics make LCs one of the primary targets of HIV-1 infection. Notably, LCs form a protective barrier against HIV-1 infection and transmission. LCs restrict HIV-1 infection through the capture of HIV-1 by the C-type lectin receptor Langerin and subsequent internalization into Birbeck granules. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV-1 restriction in LCs remains unknown. Here we show that human E3-ubiquitin ligase tri-partite-containing motif 5α (TRIM5α) potently restricts HIV-1 infection of LCs but not of subepithelial DC-SIGN+ DCs. HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5α was thus far considered to be reserved to non-human primate TRIM5α orthologues, but our data strongly suggest that human TRIM5α is a cell-specific restriction factor dependent on C-type lectin receptor function. Our findings highlight the importance of HIV-1 binding to Langerin for the routeing of HIV-1 into the human TRIM5α-mediated restriction pathway. TRIM5α mediates the assembly of an autophagy-activating scaffold to Langerin, which targets HIV-1 for autophagic degradation and prevents infection of LCs. By contrast, HIV-1 binding to DC-SIGN+ DCs leads to disassociation of TRIM5α from DC-SIGN, which abrogates TRIM5α restriction. Thus, our data strongly suggest that restriction by human TRIM5α is controlled by C-type-lectin-receptor-dependent uptake of HIV-1, dictating protection or infection of human DC subsets. Therapeutic interventions that incorporate C-type lectin receptors and autophagy-targeting strategies could thus provide cell-mediated resistance to HIV-1 in humans.

            <p>What makes someone a psycopath? Nature or Nurture? And can we stop at risk children from growing up into dangerous adult psycopaths? One of the oldest queries in psychology — Nature Vs Nurture — asks if what makes us who we are is predisposed by our DNA, or by life experiences. It is a pretty poignant question when it comes to psychopaths, who are estimated to account for up to 50% of all serious crimes in the US. </p>
<p>Clinically known as anti-social personality disorder in the DMS-V, some troublesome psychopathic traits include:</p>
<p>• an egocentric identity<br />
• an absence of pro-social standards in goal-setting<br />
• a lack of empathy<br />
• an incapacity for mutually intimate relationships<br />
• manipulativeness<br />
• deceitfulness<br />
• callousness<br />
• irresponsibility, impulsivity and risk taking<br />
• hostility</p>
<p>Although these characteristics may be unpleasant, not all psychopaths are dangerous or criminals, and not all dangerous criminals are psychopaths. Counter-intuitively there are pro-social psycopaths too. Nonetheless, some psychopaths do pose a genuine threat for the safety of others.</p>
<p>The real unsolved problem when it comes to psychopathy is how to treat the personality disorder. Although certainly not to be considered impossible with the malleable brains we have even as adults, Dr. Nigel Blackwood, a leading Forensic Psychiatrist at King’s College London, has stated that adult psychopaths can be treated or managed, but not cured. Curing adult psycopathy is considered a near-impossible challenge. </p>
<p>Therefore, understanding when and how psychopathy develops from child to adult is an important part of the research engine that will hopefully identify what parents, caregivers and governments can do to prevent an at risk child from growing up to be a dangerous psycopath.</p>
<p><strong>Development of psycopathic personalities is mainly due to genes</strong><strong>  </strong></p><strong>
<p>Enter new psychopathy research published in <em>Development and Psychopathology</em> by lead author Dr. Catherine Tuvblad from the University of Southern California. Her research was a twin-based study designed to overcome many previous drawbacks and limitations. Ultimately, the study was designed to provide a more reliable indication of the extent to which genes or the environment, that is nature or nurture, is responsible for the development of psychopathic personality features as a child grows into a young adult.  </p>
<p>In the study, 780 pairs of twins and their caregivers filled out a questionnaire that allowed for measuring features of child psychopathy at ages 9–10, 11–13, 14–15, and 16–18. This included measuring psychopathic personality features indicative of future psychopathy, such as high levels of callous behavior towards peers and problems adhering to social norms.</p>
<p>The changes in the childrens’ psychopathic personality features between age groups was considered to be:</p>
<p>• 94% due to genetics between the ages of 9-10 and 11-13, and 6% environmental<br />
• 71% due to genetics between the ages of 11–13 and 14–15, and 29% environemental<br />
• 66% due to genetics between 14-15 and 16-18&lt;, and 44% environmental

This suggests that environmental factors may gradually play a greater part in changing the levels of psychopathic features a child develops in later teenage years, which is very promising for the development of future interventions for the prevention of psychopathy.

It should be noted that while the childrens' test results pointed to the environment around them becoming increasingly important to their psycopathic behavior, their parents almost exclusively thought that the psycopathy they observed in their children was purely genetic. Considering parents are largely responsible for their child's environment, its not that surprising. 

<strong>Nurture is important at key developmental stages in psychopathy development</strong></p>
<p>The analysis also revealed that there may be a key turning point in the development of psychopathy during the age range studied. The authors considered this turning point to be caused by the onset of puberty, when gene-environment interactions that are highly significant in inhibiting or promoting the development of psychopathy are at play. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the data also indicates that if these rapid gene-environment based changes in psychopathic traits occur early on (e.g. 11-13), any later additional environmental changes to psychopathic traits would be minimal. In other words, once the psychopathic personality traits are set during puberty, they tend to last into later years.</p>
<p>Other research has found that there may be other key turning points on route to becoming a psychopath much earlier in life. One study found that the total number of early negative life events between the ages of 0-4 were positively correlated with the emotion-based aspects of psychopathy. The findings suggest that early environmental factors could have important implications for the development of psychopathic traits and may also impact attachment to parents for children with genetic potential for psychopathy.</p>
<p>So although psychopathy is largely genetic, where it’s mostly down to if you have the right combination of genes needed to become a psychopath or not, life experiences during puberty and early infant years could make or break a potential psychopath. </p>
<p><strong>The cure for psychopathy is love?</strong></p>
<p>So what does science suggest as a successful environmental antidote to developing psychopathy? Believe it or not, love!</p>
<p>One neuroscientist, Dr. James Fallon, made a shocking discovery that on paper he is a psychopath. For example, he had a version of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene that is linked with violent crime and psychopathy. Also known as the warrior gene, MAOA encodes an enzyme that affects the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>His brain scans also resembled those of a psychopath. He had low activity in certain areas of the frontal and temporal lobes linked challenges with empathy, morality and self-control. In his family tree, there were also seven alleged murderers. </p>
<p>Although Dr. Fallon, in his own words, is obnoxiously competitive, kind of an asshole and won’t even let his grandchildren win games, he was certainly not a dangerous psychopath. So why not? His genes and even his brain screamed potential for antisocial psychopathy.</p>
<p>His answer was that the love he received from his mother led to him becoming a pro-social psycopath. And a newly published study tends to agree with him. OK love in itself is not enough. But, how a mother expresses that love in guiding the child’s pro-social behavior and in setting good examples of pro-social behavior might be the real key.</p>
<p>A new discovery coming from research on adopted infants suggests this is the case. Researchers found that the development of one of the largest child risk factors for psychopathy, that is highly heritable from biological mothers with severe antisocial behaviors — callous-unemotional behavior — was inhibited by high levels of positive reinforcement at 18 months by the adopted mother. </p>
<p>Further research will hopefully identify a whole repertoire of ways parents, schools and governments alike can lovingly nurture the development of at risk children through these key developmental stages. Ultimately, this could stop a large amount of future violent criminals literally in their diapers, before they even start.</p>

<p><em>Bernadette Ann-Marie O’Hare, Delan Devakumar, and Stephen Allen</em></p>
<p>Health professionals in low-income countries spend much of their professional lives dealing with the consequences of deficiencies in human rights for children, but have little influence over many factors that impact on this. Bernadette Ann-Marie O’Hare et al. discussed a framework in their article within which healthcare workers can carry out an audit and be agents for change at a local level. Looking at basic rights such as access to clean water, sanitation, food, shelter, education, and health, O’Hare et al. notified that such audits can provide information on the proportion of children living in a catchment who do not have access to their basic rights, and achieve several objectives. Aside from raising awareness on basic human rights and their importance to health, the audits could give the healthcare worker an informed voice to advocate at forums such as district councils, and legitimise their role as agents for change. Results could also help negotiations with international and non-governmental organizations that often arrive in a district with a predetermined set of objectives.</p>

<h3><strong>Maternity care and Human Rights: what do women think?</strong></h3>
<p><em>Andrea Solnes Miltenburg, Fleur Lambermon, Cees Hamelink, and Tarek Meguid</em></p>
<p>Andrea Solnes Miltenburg et al. explored women’s perspectives and experiences of maternal health services through a human rights perspective in Magu District, Tanzania. By conducting 36 semi-structured interviews with 17 women, a series of important themes emerged surrounding the topic of maternity care. These included dignity, autonomy, equality, and security. Miltenburg et al. concluded that while Tanzanian women are aware that substandard care was present, the same women are able to voice what basic human rights principles mean to them as well as their desired applications in maternal health service provision.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence against women engaged in sex work</strong></h3>
<p><em>Laura Cordisco Tsai, Catherine E. Carlson, Toivgoo Aira, Andrea Norcini Pala, Marion Riedel, and Susan S. Witte</em></p>
<p>Women who engage in sex work are at risk of experiencing violence from numerous perpetrators, including paying partners. Laura Cordisco Tsai et al. moved away from existing literature, which looks at the impact of microfinance interventions on women’s experiences of intimate partner violence, and towards the impact of microfinance among women engaged specifically in sex work and at risk of violence from paying partners. Looking at Mongolia as a case study, Laura Cordisco Tsai et al. concluded that participation in a microsavings intervention did not reduce exposure to paying partner violence despite it reducing the reliance on sex work from income in participants. This is contrary to previous studies that have found microfinance participation to be protective from violence and follow up work is needed to better understand the reasons for this.</p>

<h3><strong>Mental Health Laws and Policies in High-Income Countries</strong></h3>
<p><em>Steven J. Hoffman, Lathika Sritharan, and Ali Tejpar</em></p>
<p>Steven J. Hoffman et al. questioned to what extent the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has an impact on high-income countries. Using Canada as a case study, Hoffman et al. concluded that there remains a divide between the Convention’s goals and the experiences of Canadians with disabilities. Canada’s reservations to the CRPD are seen most prominently through Article 12, on legal capacity for persons with psychosocial disabilities. Though a divide between Canadians and the CRPD does exist, Hoffman et al. remarked that the CRPD has helped to facilitate a larger shift in social and cultural paradigms of mental health and disability in Canada, seen through new legislation in various jurisdictions.</p>

<h3><strong>Criminalization of in-call venues and managers on migrant sex workers</strong></h3>
<p><em>S. Anderson, K. Shannon, J. Li, Y. Lee, J. Chettiar, S. Goldenberg, and A. Krüsi</em></p>
<p>Our final article by S. Anderson et al. looked at the correlation between the impact of criminalization and policing of managers and in-call establishments on HIV/STI prevention among sex workers. Drawing on 46 qualitative interviews with migrant sex workers, managers and business owners, Anderson et al. concluded that criminalization and policing undermine the health and human rights of migrant sex workers working in in–call venues. Criminalization limits the sex workers access to free contraception, sexual health information, and HIV/STI testing. Looking at these results as part of the wider context, this research supports growing evidence-based calls for the decriminalization of sex work in general.</p>

<p>To maintain pleasant public spaces requires that we all implicitly agree to certain civil behaviours, like pocketing our chocolate wrappers rather than leaving them strewn on the pavement, or turning the stereo down after eleven. But when these implicit agreements are too frequently ignored they can lose their force entirely, jeopardising the social order. To keep things together, one or more of us need to hold any miscreants to account… but who wants that hassle? A <a href="http://rss.sagepub.com/content/28/3/299">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Rationality and Society</em> explores real-life littering norm enforcers, taking us from the streets of Switzerland to the New York underground.</p>
<p><span id="more-14735"></span></p>
<p>The sociologists Joël Berger and Debra Hevenstone convened at various crowded city transit stops, and waited for a transit service (a tram in Bern, Switzerland or a New York subway train) to deposit a load of commuters. Then one researcher would perform an act of littering in front of the commuters, tossing an empty bottle near, but not into, a rubbish bin, while the other researcher observed how people responded.</p>
<p>Berger and Hevenstone were particularly interested in whether there would be any instances of social sanctioning – that is, a commuter directly confronting the offending researcher – an act also sometimes labelled “costly punishment”, because the individual has to inconvenience themselves to enforce the social rules. Social sanctioning has been studied frequently in laboratory conditions but only rarely in “the wild”.</p>
<p>Replicating one of the few examples of previous field research on littering, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292112001316">conducted on the streets of Athens</a>, Berger and Hevenstone found that littering provocations did produce measurable responses in bystanders, although at lower levels than those found in the lab, and that passive-aggressive grumbles outnumbered direct confrontation. The research also revealed two further factors that affected the likelihood of commuter intervention: context and culture.</p>
<p>Any performance needs a set, and in this case the researchers alternated between two: sometimes trashing up the bin’s surroundings by arranging refuse bags around it, and in other cases making it as pristine as possible. In grubby surroundings, less than three per cent of littering events were met with a direct challenge – “Are you going to pick that up?” – versus nearly eight per cent in a clean environment. The environment had an even greater influence on whether bystanders tidied up after the loutish experimenter – in 16 per cent of cases when clean, but little more than 1 per cent when grubby. This effect calls to mind the (still controversial) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/12/23/signs-of-petty-crime-such-as-litter-and-graffiti-really-do-encourage-more-serious-law-breaking/">Broken Windows</a> criminology theory, which argues that run-down environments encourage further violations because potential perpetrators reckon their actions will go unpunished. The new research suggests that while violations may go up in run-down environments, challenges to violations may also go down, truly the ingredients for a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>As well as local conditions, cultural factors appeared to play a role. In Switzerland, nearly half of acts were met with some kind of response – a quarter of cases by subtle disapproval (head-shaking or muttering to friends), tidying up in 13 per cent of cases, and a direct intervention in 10 per cent of cases. Meanwhile in New York, the rates were always lower – only a third of cases provoked a reaction, with direct intervention four per cent of the time.</p>
<p>Berger and Hevenstone recount an anecdote: “in Bern, we even had difficulties in maintaining the litter condition. Twice people wanted to remove the bag of garbage. This never happened in NYC.” As Bern is a lot smaller than New York, they made another run in larger Zürich to see if it resembled the American city, but the data showed Zürich inhabitants even more likely to tidy up the bottle at 26 per cent, and similar to Bern in rates of direct action (subtle disapproval wasn’t measured in this study). The Zürich findings suggest a national tidiness culture rather than a size of city effect.</p>
<p>This fieldwork bears out the idea that city inhabitants care enough about their environment to intervene when someone makes it worse… sometimes. That sometimes becomes a seldom when conditions have already deteriorated. If that applies to your neighbourhood, and you care enough to do something about it, you may need to invest energy to turn things around, so that others become re-engaged with policing the quality of their environment. Sometimes, you need to start with a clean sweep.</p>

For 16 years the <em>BMC</em> series has had the aim of making scientific knowledge widely available, through open access, open data and ensuring that all publishable research across biology, health sciences and medicine has a home. These goals remain as important to us as they were 16 years ago; they are who we are and where we come from. To emphasize the importance of these principles and what they mean to us, we have clarified the description of our editorial threshold for the subject-specific journals in the <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC</em> series</a>.</p>
<h2>A home for all publishable research</h2>
<p>Of the 67 journals in the <em>BMC</em> series, 63 have a focus on a serving a particular research community such as <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/">public health researchers</a>, <a href="http://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/">plant biologists</a> or <a href="http://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/">nephrologists</a>. These subject-focused journals form the <a href="http://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/">backbone</a> of the series and publish a wide variety of research. The editorial threshold of these journals is to publish all scientifically valid research, without making editorial decisions on the basis of the perceived interest or impact of the results.</p>
<p>It has become apparent to us over the last year that although our aim has always been to have an editorial threshold which is inclusive, our messaging to our communities has not always been as clear as we would like. It is important for our authors to know what to expect from the journals and for our reviewers and editors to know exactly what criteria they are using to assess articles. Therefore, we have clarified the description of the editorial threshold for the subject journals. Our updated wording is:</p>
<p>The <em>BMC</em>-series subject-specific journals do not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. Studies must be scientifically valid; for research articles this includes a scientifically sound research question, the use of suitable methods and analysis, and following community-agreed standards relevant to the research field. Specific criteria for other article types can be found in the submission guidelines.</p>
<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<p>For some years now, the problems of publication bias in research have been a focus of discussions at conferences and in the blogosphere. A quick search brings up examples from <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.d7762">the <em>BMJ</em></a>, the blogs of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/blogs/publication-bias-again">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> and <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2015/02/27/reducing-publication-bias-animal-research/">BioMed Central</a> and many more. The result of this is the over-emphasis of positive results and researchers struggling to publish null results or results which reproduce (or don’t reproduce) established ideas. Our approach on the <em>BMC</em> series is important in addressing this, as we ensure that all findings which are useful and which provide knowledge, information or data to the research community can be published. If a research question was worth asking, then the results should be part of the published record.</p>
<p>Addressing the problems of publication bias needs more than just a clear editorial threshold and the <em>BMC </em>series takes a variety of approaches to address this. The medical journals in the series have a policy of open peer review, with signed reports published alongside the article providing a more transparent review process, and we are also piloting a <a href="http://www.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/new--results-free--peer-review-process-to-be-piloted-for-academic-publishing/10713562">results-blind peer review</a> model on <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a><em>. </em>This pilot will test whether review of the methods alone reduces bias by preventing reviewers from judging a study on the basis of its outcome.</p>
<p>As well as reducing publication bias, our approach to being inclusive has an impact on many aspects of how we interact with our authors. We want to support authors who have produced scientifically valid work but for whom language or presentation could be a barrier for publication by giving them opportunities to revise, giving clear advice about how to present and format their manuscripts, and where appropriate directing them to suitable language editing services. We encourage our editors to provide constructive comments if they believe that there are scientific flaws which would prevent publication, to support their assessment and help authors improve their work.</p>
<p>Of course, being inclusive means considering the work which is exciting too, the research which will have a huge impact, and we work with our authors to ensure that their work reaches the widest possible audience. We promote research published with us through <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/">this blog</a>, the journal <a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/">homepages</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/BMC_series"><em>BMC</em> series twitter account</a> and working closely with our PR and marketing teams in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32117019">highlighting content</a> to a <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3886124">wide audience</a>.</p>
<h2>What does it mean for research to be scientifically valid?</h2>
<p>A criticism aimed at scientific publishing in recent years is that the proliferation of content means that some of what is published is not of sufficient quality for other members of the research community to trust. Ensuring that work is scientifically valid through rigorous peer review processes is important to us. Being scientifically valid requires that a valid research question has been addressed appropriately using suitable methods and analysis. It means that the conclusions are based clearly on the data provided and any limitations in the study are clearly described. It also means that the research meets the standards set by that community, in terms of the techniques used as well as in placing the research in the context of what is already known.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the work published in the <em>BMC</em> series can be trusted to have met this standard of scientific validity we work closely with our academic Section Editors and Associate Editors who provide invaluable expertise. The in-house Editors and Assistant Editors also work closely with the BioMed Central <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/who-we-are/research-integrity-group">Research Integrity Group</a> to ensure that our rigorous <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies">editorial policies</a> are followed.</p>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>At the end of the Oscar Wilde play, the protagonist finds out to his delight that he is who he thought he was all along. On the <em>BMC</em> series, we have always known who we are and what we stand for. Our hope is that our updated editorial threshold for the subject-specific journals will help to make this clearer to our authors, editors and reviewers, across all the research communities who we serve and work alongside to ensure that scientific knowledge is available to all.</p>

            <p>Keeping messages brief and simple is more effective when trying to encourage patients to complete a health care program, according to new research. </p>
<p>In a study that analyzes six years of data, a team of researchers found small “nudges” in the right direction were a simple, inexpensive, and effective way to increase completion of health care programs, leading to a 16 percent jump in the completion rate for an already fastidious audience.</p>
<p>Dr. Dolores Albarracin, a professor of psychology and business administration at the University of Illinois and one of the co-authors of the study said that: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Retention and completion are critical components of the effectiveness of health care interventions in real-world conditions, so a 16 percent increase in completion is significant.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She noted that most health care intervention programs — for example, 10 sessions with a counselor — are expensive to implement and deliver: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients start but they often drop out, which is not beneficial and is a huge deadweight loss of resources for everyone. That’s why increasing retention rates is vital for public health, because multi-session behavioral interventions or a series of appointments with a health care provider are more efficacious when completed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the study, a randomized control trial with more than 700 eligible patients in Florida was conducted to identify a simple, effective intervention to increase the completion of an HIV-prevention counseling program delivered at the Duval County Department of Health.</p>
<p>The study involved two factors: One representing an instrumental message and the other an empowering message. The messages were brief videos played immediately after the counseling program.</p>
<p>The instrumental message reminded participants that they could discuss issues other than HIV with their counselor. The empowering message was designed to make them feel free, independent and in charge of their decision to return — a strategy that doubled enrollment in programs in other work by the same team, according to the study.</p>
<p>The idea was to use brief, simple marketing messages not for a commercial product. As Albarracin explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>“health programs to get people to complete interventions that change detrimental behavior. These messages were designed to either empower clients as agents responsible for their own change or to highlight the instrumental outcomes of the intervention in terms of participants’ lives by addressing health concerns other than HIV, such as employment or education.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Results indicated that the instrumental message alone produced more completion than either the empowering message alone or combined with the instrumental message.</p>
<p>The success of the simple, post-session message, which the researchers termed “meta-intervention,” comes down to the power of the nudge as a “gentle reminder to do something,” Albarracin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The word ‘nudge’ has such a nice connotation to it because it reminds us that we need to find strategies that are simple and cost-effective. In a health care setting, you need something that’s practical, implementable and inexpensive. This is that kind of approach.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For people who are vulnerable or disadvantaged, repeated contact with the health care system is important, according to Albarracin.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Contact with the public health system is often the front door to accessing a lot of other public services — mental health services, career and employment services, and other forms of social assistance,” she said. “So the public health system might design a program with health in mind, but the audience who is buying into the program has multiple goals in mind, not just health.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Having a good job or access to other services is just as important, which is why you have to sell the benefits of the program from the perspective of the audience, not of the provider, according to Albarracin:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Social marketing is a marriage between psychological approaches and an approach that has the consumer in mind. Make it recipient- and patient-centered, not provider-centered. The instrumental message capitalizes on that.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Psychologists have become very interested in the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/05/peoples-belief-in-free-will-is-lower-when-they-need-to-urinate-or-desire-sex/">causes</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/05/students-who-believe-they-have-more-free-will-do-better-academically/">consequences</a> of our beliefs about free will.  For instance, many consider that progress in neuroscience is likely to undermine our belief in free will (though <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/23/neuroscience-does-not-threaten-peoples-sense-of-free-will/">this has been challenged</a>). And in terms of consequences, less belief in free will has been shown to affect our own behaviour and judgments, for example increasing <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/02/26/morality-under-threat-as-science-debunks-our-sense-of-free-will/">our tendency to cheat</a>, and making us more lenient towards other people’s criminal culpability.</p>
<p>One unexplored issue is how experiencing deep, romantic love is likely to affect our belief in free will – or indeed vice versa. A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810016302744">new series of online studies</a> in <em>Consciousness and Cognition </em>has made a start, looking at whether thinking about a more passionate versus less passionate relationship is linked with a greater or lesser belief in free will and, separately, stronger or lesser belief in determinism (the idea that the future is pre-determined and beyond our control). The answer, it turns out, is both. Thinking about a more intense passionate love affairs tends to go hand in hand with stronger beliefs in free will and stronger beliefs in determinism. <span id="more-14640"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, led by Jordane Boudesseul at the University of Grenoble, surveyed hundreds of Americans and Indians across three studies conducted using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website. The format was generally the same for each study, but using slightly different questionnaires. Participants answered questions about the intensity of a past or present romantic relationship, and they answered questions about their belief in free will (such as whether they agreed “People have complete control over the decisions they make”) and their belief in determinism (such as whether they agreed “My future has already been determined by fate”). Some answered the love questions first then the philosophy questions, others did things the other way around.</p>
<p>The more intense the passionate romantic relationship that participants brought to mind, the more strongly they tended to endorse the idea that we have free will. Similarly, though to a weaker extent, the more passionate the love, the more strongly they also stated a belief in determinism.</p>
<p>These somewhat paradoxical results suggest that when it comes to the way we think about love and free will, we are “philosophical compatabilists” – that is, we seem to think it’s possible to be free and for life to be determined at the same time. Boudesseul and her colleagues said this makes sense if you consider that being in love can make people feel happy and empowered, as if anything is possible, yet at the same intense passion also goes hand in hand with a loss of liberty, such as being unable to stop thinking about the object of one’s love, or feeling drive to be with him or her.</p>
<p>Another less interesting possibility is that some people in the studies were simply more inclined to agree with any statements placed in front of them, whether about free will or determinism or passion – the so-called “acquiescence bias” – but the researchers don’t think this is the case (and it also wouldn’t explain why passionate love was more strongly correlated with free will beliefs than determinism beliefs).</p>
<p>Assuming the findings are real and not just a response bias, they are still difficult to interpret because they are purely correlational – we can’t tell if free will/determinism beliefs affect the intensity of our passion, or vice versa, or if some third factor, such as self-esteem, is affecting both philosophical beliefs and passion intensity. There is just a small clue, in that among those participants who recalled a particularly passionate relationship, those who answered questions about this love affair first tended to score higher in belief in free will than those who answered the questions about free will before answering questions about the relationship.</p>
<p>We certainly need more research to explore these causal dynamics further, but for now these interesting findings suggest many of us are willing to entertain a nuanced philosophical approach to life and love.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys memory and cognitive function and there are currently very limited treatment options.  This article, published in <em>BMC Systems Biology,</em> describes the development of a mathematical model of Alzheimer’s disease that maps the neurological environment of the diseased brain. The model can be used to explore the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents that may slow the progression of the disease. An example combination therapy is applied, demonstrating how the model can be used to optimise a treatment regimen that could then be tested in a clinical trial.</p>
<p><strong>Public health: <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3764-8">Can mental attitude affect your physical health?</a></strong></p>
<p>An 11-year cohort study has revealed that mental attitude and personality traits may affect the likelihood of dying from coronary heart disease (CHD). Participants were surveyed at the start of the study to determine their levels of optimism and pessimism and after 11 years the status of the participants was re-examined, with the number who had died from CHD recorded. It was found that those who had died of CHD were more pessimistic at the start of the study, with the effect seen in both men and women. This study suggests that the level of pessimism could be used as a non-invasive tool, along with the measurement of other known risk factors, for determining the risk of CHD-induced mortality.</p>

<p>Cognitive decline in the elderly is a growing problem worldwide as the life expectancy in many countries increases. Understanding how this decline happens and ways to slow or prevent it is therefore of paramount importance. This study, published in <em>BMC Geriatrics</em>, provides evidence that being able to speak more than one language leads to increased mental capacity in older individuals. Participants were Mexican-American immigrants who speak both English and Spanish and represent a more culturally homogeneous group compared with those analysed in previous studies. This allowed the researchers to identify improved performance in cognitive screening tests amongst the bilingual participants compared to their monolingual counterparts.</p>

<p>The so called ‘Freshman 15’ refers to the weight gain that many North American students experience during their first year of college. This study, published in <em>BMC Obesity</em>, aimed to shed light on whether British students also experience similar changes in weight at the start of university. The study measured changes in weight amongst around 200 students over their first academic year and found that half of the students were weight gainers, experiencing a mean increase in weight of 3.5 kg by the end of the year. Interestingly, the study also found that 25% of participants lost more than 0.5 kg over the year with a mean weight loss of around 3 kg. This study sheds light on some of the trends that occur in weight changes at British universities with a majority of students undergoing a meaningful weight change in their first year.</p>
<p><strong>Neuroscience: <a href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-016-0308-1">The molecular mechanisms underlying epilepsy</a></strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting around 65 million people worldwide and is characterised by excessive hyperexcitablility of neurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still being uncovered. This review, published in <em>BMC Neuroscience, </em>provides a summary of the role of two regulatory pathways that control the expression of proteins involved in the development of epilepsy; the mTOR and MAPK pathways. Activation of these pathways is linked to increased expression of proteins involved in synaptic transmission, thereby causing the neuronal hyperexcitability characteristic of epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious diseases: <a href="http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2005-1">The epidemiology of a rare fungal disease in children</a></strong></p>
<p>Mucormycosis is a rare but often fatal invasive fungal disease. An up to date record of the epidemiology of the disease, its clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, microbiology, treatment and outcome in children is lacking and so this study aimed to analyse data collected over a ten year period from a range of different countries. The analysis revealed that the majority of children who were diagnosed with Mucormycosis had an underlying health condition and that the most effective treatment regimen was the use of active antifungal agents alongside surgery. This study provides valuable information on the diagnosis and treatment of this rare but devastating fungal disease.</p>

<p>Persistently elevated blood pressure is known to impair cognitive function, although there is some uncertainty about the best treatment options for those with high blood pressure for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction. In this review, the authors explore the current evidence for the role of blood pressure in the development of cognitive impairment and dementia and summarise the findings from several clinical trials assessing treatment options for hypertension. They highlight the importance of developing effective methods for the control of blood pressure in order to reduce the burden of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly population.</p>

 Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis and is the key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses. However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in dietary restriction longevity and suggest that modulation of specific spliceosome components may prolong healthy ageing.
