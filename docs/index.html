                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/04/aspiring-to-be-rich-may-damage-your-relationships/">Aspiring To Be Rich May Damage Your Relationships</a></h4>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Daydreaming about an ideal life, it can be easy to slip into fantasies about wealth <em>—</em> there’s a reason, after all, that “winning the lottery” is the ultimate dream for so many people. The <em>reality</em> of being rich, however, often doesn’t match that dream, with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/04/people-who-prioritise-time-over-money-are-happier/">some research</a> suggesting that people who prioritise time are much happier than those who prioritise money.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220910872">new study in the <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a> drives home the message that money really isn’t everything. The team finds that “financially contingent self-worth” <em>—</em> self-esteem based on financial success <em>—</em> can leave people feeling lonely and disconnected.</p>
<p><span id="more-39559"></span>Deborah Ward of the University at Buffalo and colleagues first asked 345 participants to rate themselves on various statements  related to financially contingent self-worth, such as “my self esteem is influenced by how much money I make” and “I feel bad about myself when I feel I don’t make enough money”. Next, participants reported how much they felt time pressures in their life, rating statements including “there are not enough minutes in the day” on a scale of one to seven.</p>
<p>Participants then estimated what percentage of time they spent being alone and with others (either working or socialising), and stated how often they felt lonely and isolated and how connected they felt to other people. The team also measured participants’ sense of autonomy <em>—</em> how much control and choice they felt they had in life.</p>
<p>As expected, participants whose self-worth was tied to their financial success reported feeling more time pressure <em>—</em> which, in turn, was related to greater feelings of social disconnection and loneliness. Participants’ sense of autonomy also partly accounted for this relationship: those whose self-worth was more financially contingent reported a lower sense of autonomy, which was related to worse social outcomes.</p>
<p>A second study looked at the same factors on a larger scale, with 940 participants completing the survey. Again, results suggested that financially contingent self-worth was associated with both lower autonomy and worse social outcomes; lower autonomy was also associated with spending less time with family and friends.</p>
<p>In a final study, 246 participants completed daily diary measures at home examining the same concepts as before; this time, however, participants reported how they’d felt or behaved <em>that day</em> rather than in general.</p>
<p>On days when participants reported particularly high financially contingent self-worth, both autonomy and social outcomes were far worse. Those who regularly reported high financially contingent self-worth were also more likely to report lower autonomy and worse social outcomes in general. These people also reported feeling more concerned about their finances.</p>
<p>We already knew that basing self-worth on financial achievements can have pretty negative consequences <em>—</em> financially contingent self-worth can lead to higher anxiety, increased feelings of pressure, and a higher likelihood of unfavourably comparing oneself to others.</p>
<p>The new study suggests that there are also social repercussions: if we believe money is the ultimate meaning of success, it makes sense that we’ll spend more time focusing on work than we will our relationships, that we’ll have less free time and that we’ll therefore feel less in control of our lives than we might want.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the data is correlational <em>—</em> the direction of cause and effect may not be as straightforward as this. But either way, if your self-esteem is financially contingent, working towards <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/29/people-who-try-to-be-environmentally-friendly-by-buying-less-stuff-are-happier-study-claims/">less materialistic</a> forms of validation may be a worthwhile long-term goal.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-mining-may-damage-underwater-ecosystems-decades">Deep-sea mining may damage underwater ecosystems for decades</a></h4>

<p>Microbe communities living in
the seafloor off Peru haven’t bounced back from a deep-sea mining experiment 26
years ago. The populations are still <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/18/eaaz5922">reduced by 30 percent</a> in this part of the South Pacific Ocean, researchers
report April 29 in <em>Science Advances</em>. </p>



<p>From 1989 to 1994, the <a href="https://www.discol.de/">DISturbance and reCOLonization,
or DISCOL, experiment</a> plowed grooves
into the seafloor to mimic deep-sea mining for valuable metal-bearing rocks. The
lumps of rock, known as polymetallic or manganese nodules, contain economically
important metals such as copper, nickel and cobalt. </p>



<p>To recover the nodules,
miners dredge the seafloor, scraping off much of the top layer of sediment
along with the rocks. Researchers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unknowns-linger-sea-mining">long expressed concern</a> about how this might affect deep-sea ecosystems (<em>SN:
2/19/14</em>). But there is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/new-deep-sea-sponge-could-play-starring-role-monitoring-ocean-health">little data about the effects of deep-sea mining on the
ocean environment</a> — and particularly
on the microbes at the base of the food web, which cycle the nutrient nitrogen
between seafloor and bottom waters (<em>SN: 10/10/17</em>). </p>



<p>Scientists last assessed
DISCOL’s effects in 1996. So in 2015, microbial ecologist Tobias Vonnahme, now
of The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø, and colleagues devised a new test, comparing the 26-year-old
plough tracks with five-week-old tracks they dug into the seafloor. </p>



<p>Cell counts of microbes in
the younger tracks were reduced by about 50 percent compared with undisturbed
areas; in older tracks, cell numbers were reduced by about 30 percent. Due to
slow accumulation of sediment in the deep sea, regions disturbed by mining
could take more than 50 years to fully recover, the team says. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology/">A pandemic of boredom</a></h4>

<p>It was just the two of them: on a raft, lost, floating off the coast of Africa—the lone survivors of a shipwreck. Years before, struck with stupendous boredom, Hymie Basteshaw decided to become boredom’s master. He read what others wrote about boredom, studied its physiology, and discovered its secrets in the wavering folds of human cells. Mid-sea, he now shares with Augie March his first and “obvious” findings. Boredom is “the shriek of unused capacities, the doom of serving no great end or design, of contributing to no master force. The obedience that is not willingly given because nobody knows how to request it. The harmony that is not accomplished.” Basteshaw is but a minor character—a psycho-biologist, a carpenter, a genius, a “maniac”—in Saul Bellow’s long picaresque novel, <em>The Adventures of Augie March.</em> He offers not a minor or obvious feature of boredom, but a discerning appraisal of its intimate nature. Boredom, Basteshaw tells March, although not in these exact words, is hybrid, both personal and social.</p><p>Our current situation is one of crisis, of resources, values, and priorities. It’s also a crisis for the study of boredom. It’s a call to understand boredom both as a psychological and social phenomenon. If our aim is to capture what it means to experience boredom right now—the boredom of social distancing, quarantine, and the pandemic—we can’t rely exclusively on lessons that we’ve drawn from willing participants in on-line or in-person studies. Yes, we are bored with more or less the same things that previously bored us. But we are bored because of our newfound and newly imposed social condition. In social distancing, we find ourselves in an unusual position. Both restrained and acutely aware of the meaninglessness of our everyday actions we are under the threat of a new boredom—a boredom that looks and feels just like our ordinary boredom, but which has grown out of a much different and more fertile ground.</p><p>What is boredom most fundamentally? <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-017-9515-1">Boredom</a> is an unpleasant state that signals to us the presence of an unsatisfactory situation and which, at the same time, contains a strong desire to do something else. During boredom, we feel both <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02497.x?casa_token=_BCyupis9P0AAAAA:H6yd-UBkp3cjgUwfzp3lxDYk8FMAuT0r0vSbJQmW9VoQewZqlo17-H-V5tZGMHatenq63d23ysmtQw">frustrated and listless</a>. We’re disengaged from and dissatisfied with what we do. Our situation doesn’t hold our <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691612456044?casa_token=StKmthlMIE4AAAAA%3ATtU3bwoycH54kqiCpwnOM2q2cGhirea80YUGx5oJcjvhJxw24NxB3PQsb5vUTwU91716zdieELpW">attention</a>. It doesn’t interest us and doesn’t strike us as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9">meaningful</a>. In a state of boredom, we’re moved to think of alternative situations and goals, ones that are more interesting, engaging, and meaningful to us than our current ones. We itch to leave boredom behind and are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.google.com/books/edition/Propelled/MG0lzQEACAAJ?hl=en">propelled to try to do just that</a>.</p><p>Boredom is a problem—a disruption of agency, a deficit of meaning, or a block in our ability to engage cognitively and satisfactorily with our situation at hand. And yet, it’s also a solution. Or better, it’s the promise of a solution. The unpleasantness of boredom, along with its effects on our psychological processes and behavior, offers us a possible way out. Boredom is that disagreeable reminder that we should be doing something other than what we are currently doing. It’s also a repellent force, a drive that could, under the right conditions, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2017.1346240">allow us to overcome our discontent</a>.</p><p>What I have just described sounds a lot like a psychological state that exists in a social vacuum, but that isn’t so. Boredom can arise out of a perceived dissatisfaction with our situation, a mismatch between our wishes and reality, or even a lack of sufficient engagement with the task at hand. All of these prompts of boredom can be both personal and social. Any social condition that either begets or supports them would be one that promotes boredom.</p><p>We are currently experiencing a change in social order. Compared to our recent past, the present of the pandemic is one characterized by excessive order. Out of necessity, caution, concern, or fear, we are constrained. There’re real and tangible limits to our opportunities and obstacles to free action. And so, out of this new social order, boredom grows. “Boredom arises when we must not do what we want to do, or must do what we do not want to do,” psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-00161-018">once observed</a>. In <em>Melancholy and Society</em>, German sociologist Wolf Lepenies warned us of how socially frustrated agency is a fertile ground for boredom. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2010-15712-001">Experimental studies</a> agree that conditions over which individuals have little control can give rise to boredom. And <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20042820v2">a recent study</a> examining the attitudes of people living in quarantine in Italy appears to confirm it.</p><p>There’s another element of our social condition that contributes to the rise of boredom. Boredom is related not just to the perceived control or autonomy that we have over a situation but also to how meaningful our situation strikes us. Studies report that perceived meaninglessness is both a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-011-9234-9">component</a> of and a likely <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2009.28.3.307">antecedent</a> to boredom. While social distancing, we often feel that our actions and activities are lacking in meaning. Why? In the face of the pandemic, our everyday activities seem insignificant. For those of us who are not nurses, doctors, first respondents, essential workers, or actively involved in helping others or fighting the spread of the virus, our actions seem to have little effect on the situation.</p><p>When faced with the boredom of the pandemic it helps to bring to mind the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01245/full">function</a> of boredom. It offers us a productive way to think about our boredom, for it underlines its existential import. We are fortunate not for this or that experience of boredom, but for the capacity to experience boredom. Boredom—in its non-chronic form—is a valuable tool and perhaps now, more than ever, a privilege. It’s both an affective reminder that we are stuck with ourselves and a call to become more than what we are right now.</p><p>But boredom can only do so much. Once it has made itself known to us, we are on our own. We have to decide how to act and what to do. We can turn to diversions or reflection, act rashly or prudently, give up or stand up, help others or look after ourselves. The possible outcomes of boredom are many and varied.New habits, opportunities, and careers often start with the thought “I am bored.” But so can unhealthy eating habits, binge drinking, drug use, or even <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2017/09/boredoms-push/">destruction</a>.</p><p>One hopes that in times like these boredom’s call can be put into productive and compassionate use. To borrow Voltaire’s words, one hopes that we can cultivate our garden: the ground out of which our personal and social existence can grow and flourish—not as an act of quietism but as a sign of resilience and as way to realize change.</p><p>It’s worth a try, even if it is done out of boredom.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@rhett_noonan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Rhett Noonan</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dark-bedroom?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/">A pandemic of boredom</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622979590/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622979590/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622979590/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/intermittent-fasting-can-help-people-in-high-stress-jobs/" rel="nofollow">Intermittent fasting can help people in high-stress jobs</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-ethics-of-defeating-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">The ethics of defeating COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>One of our most popular posts here at <em>Research Digest </em>looked at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/22/you-hear-a-voice-in-your-head-when-youre-reading-right/">whether we all hear an inner voice while reading</a> (spoiler: most of us do <em>—</em> but 10% or so seem not to). Now researchers have found that readers aren’t the only ones to hear voices: authors themselves do as well. </strong>Almost two-thirds of authors surveyed at the Edinburgh book festival reported hearing their characters speaking while they were writing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/majority-of-authors-hear-their-characters-speak-finds-study">reports Alison Flood</a> at <em>The Guardian.</em><span id="more-39552"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Researchers have traditionally thought of autistic people as having “social deficits” when it comes to expressing emotion <em>—</em> but this ignores the fact that communication is a two-way street, </strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/research-on-facial-expressions-challenges-the-way-we-think-about-autism-134053">write Connor Tom Keating and Jennifer Cook</a> in <em>The Conversation</em>. Instead, their research suggests that autistic and neurotypical people use different facial expressions, and it is this mismatch between the two groups that can lead to difficulties in conveying or understanding emotion. “This is really crucial as it takes the element of blame away from the autistic person and instead proposes that these difficulties are a product of autistic and neurotypical differences,” the pair writes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Autism research is also often conducted without any input from people who are actually autistic. </strong>That’s beginning to change, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/autistic-voices-should-be-heard-autistic-adults-join-research-teams-shift-focus-studies?rss=1">reports Emily Willingham at <em>Science</em></a>: teams are increasingly including autistic researchers and focusing on studies that can improve the lives of autistic people, rather than searching for a cause or “cure”.</p>

<p><strong>At <em>Discover Magazine</em>, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/do-peer-reviewers-prefer-significant-results">Neuroskeptic reports</a> on a study providing further evidence that reviewers are more likely to accept psychology publications that report positive results. </strong>Researchers gave 127 reviewers for a media psychology conference an abstract that either reported a significant or non-significant finding. Overall, the reviewers gave higher ratings to the version with the significant result, although the effect was only small.</p>

<p><strong>As the lockdown continues, many of us have been left with a strange sense of time, with days seeming to blend together. </strong>That could have a negative impact on our later memory of this period, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/lockdown-distorting-memories-daily-landmarks-brains-false-memories">writes Julia Shaw at <em>The Guardian</em></a> (we also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/28/were-not-good-at-spotting-when-someone-has-a-false-memory-of-committing-a-crime/">covered Shaw’s work on false memories</a> this week). Shaw suggests staging memorable “landmark” events at home: new experiences which require a bit of effort to create and may be particularly interesting or emotional.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Physical contact is an important part of the human experience <em>—</em> so lockdown can be particularly hard for those who live alone.</strong> And it turns out there’s a name for that craving for hugs, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/skin-hunger-coronavirus-human-touch">writes Sirin Kale at <em>Wired</em></a>: “skin hunger”.</p>

<p><strong>Some parents may be worried about children’s screen time increasing during the</strong> <strong>pandemic</strong>.

<p><strong>Superconductivity under pressure</strong>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/physical-sciences-242"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em> May 2, 1970 –</p>



<p>Cooling certain metals to temperatures near absolute zero turns them into superconductors, substances without electrical resistance, in which currents flow without power loss. In recent years it has become apparent that in some cases pressure as well as cooling has something to do with inducing superconductivity. Metals are found that are not superconducting under normal pressure but become superconducting under both pressure and cooling.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Extreme pressures can produce superconductors that work at higher temperatures than any other materials known, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-superconductor-wave-could-reveal-physics-materials">recent studies reveal</a>. Squeezed to more than a million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure, hydrogen sulfide is a superconductor at up to 203 kelvins (−70° Celsius), and a superconductor of lanthanum and hydrogen reportedly works at a record-breaking 260 kelvins (−13° C). Scientists hope to find a superconductor that doesn’t require pressure or cooling. That could revolutionize electronic devices and reduce energy losses in the power grid.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-mammals-elephants-armadillos-might-get-drunk-easily">Why mammals like elephants and armadillos might get drunk easily</a></h4>

<p>An elephant, a narwhal and a
guinea pig walk into a bar. From there, things could get ugly.</p>



<p>All three might get drunk
easily, according to a new survey of a gene involved in metabolizing alcohol. They’re
among the creatures affected by 10 independent breakdowns of the <em>ADH7</em> gene during the history of mammal
evolution. Inheriting that dysfunctional gene might make it harder for their
bodies to break down ethanol, says molecular anthropologist Mareike Janiak of
the University of Calgary in Canada. </p>



<p>She and colleagues didn’t
look at all the genes needed to metabolize ethanol, but the failure of this
important one <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0070">might allow ethanol to build up more easily in these
animals’ bloodstreams</a>, Janiak and
colleagues report April 29 in <em>Biology
Letters</em>. </p>



<p>The carnivorous cetaceans, grain-
or leaf-eating guinea pigs and most other animals that the study identified as
potentially easy drunks probably don’t binge on sugary fruit and nectar that
brews ethanol. Elephants, however, will feast on fruit, and the new study reopens
a long-running debate over whether elephants truly get tipsy gorging on marula
fruit, a relative of mangoes.</p>





<p>Descriptions of elephants
behaving oddly after binging on overripe fruit go back at least to 1875, Janiak
says. Later, a taste test offering the animals troughs of water spiked with
ethanol found that elephants willingly drank. Afterward, they swayed more when
moving and seemed more aggressive, observers reported. </p>



<p>Yet in 2006, physiologist
Steve Morris of the University of Bristol in England and colleagues <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/499983">attacked the notion</a> of elephant inebriation as “a myth.” Among their arguments was a
calculation that even if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-shakes-elephant-family-tree">African elephants</a> really were feasting on fallen, fermenting marula fruit, the animals
could not physically eat the huge amount necessary at one time to get a buzz (<em>SN: 6/13/17</em>). However, that calculation extrapolated
from human physiology. The new insight that elephants’ <em>ADH7</em> gene doesn’t work might mean they have a lower tolerance for
the tipple. </p>



<p>It wasn’t elephants, though,
but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/natures-chronic-boozers">tree shrews</a>
that inspired the new work (<em>SN: 7/28/08</em>).
They look like “cute squirrels with pointed noses,” says senior author Amanda Melin,
a biological anthropologist also at Calgary, and they have a prodigious
tolerance for alcohol. Concentrations of ethanol that would make a human sloppy
apparently don’t phase the little animals. She, Janiak and colleagues decided
to survey all of the mammal genetic information that they could find to indirectly
assess the variety of responses to alcohol. “We were on a patio drinking beer
when we first sketched out the paper,” Janiak remembers.</p>



<p>Looking at genetic
information available on 79 mammal species, researchers found that <em>ADH7</em> has lost its function in 10 separate
spots on the mammal family tree. These ethanol-susceptible twigs sprout quite
different animals: elephants, armadillos, rhinos, degus, beavers and cattle among
them. </p>



<p>In contrast, humans and nonhuman
African primates have the reverse situation, a mutation that renders their <em>ADH7 </em>some 40 times more efficient at
dismantling ethanol than a typical mammalian version. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aye-ayes-just-got-weirder-discovery-tiny-sixth-finger">Aye-ayes</a>, with
diets rich in fruit and nectar, have independently evolved the same trick (<em>SN: 10/22/19</em>). What gives tree shrews
their drinking superpower, however, remains a mystery since they don’t have the same superefficient gene.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="aye-aye" class="wp-image-3087528" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042820_sm_alcohol-enzyme_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087528">Like humans, aye-ayes carry a gene mutation that allows them to break down ethanol some 40 times more efficiently than animals without the mutation. The small primates could happen upon their cocktails naturally if nectar and fruits have fermented.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087528">javarman3/iStock/Getty Images Plus</span></figure>



<p>Finding the gene dysfunction
in the African elephant, however, raises questions about the old inebriation
arguments. A slower capacity for clearing ethanol from the body could mean that
the smallish amount that an elephant gets from eating its full of fermented fruit
might be enough to change their behavior after all, Melin says.</p>



<p>Behavioral ecologist Phyllis
Lee has been watching elephants in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park since 1982
and is now director of science for Amboseli Trust for Elephants. “In my youth,
we tried to brew a form of maize beer (we were desperate), and the elephants
loved to drink it,” she says. She does not take sides in the myth debate,
although she muses about the “huge liver” of elephants, which would have at
least some detoxifying power. </p>



<p>“I never saw one that was
tipsy,” Lee says, although that home brew “didn’t do much for us puny humans
either.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-cough-syrup-medicine-ingredient-virus-worse">Some existing drugs might fight COVID-19. One may make it worse</a></h4>

<p>Scientists are investigating a variety
of drugs, including ones for anxiety and allergies, that might prevent the
coronavirus from hijacking different cell systems to replicate itself. But one medicine
that patients with COVID-19 may be using to treat <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">a
symptom</a> of the disease could make things worse, lab experiments hint.</p>



<p>A common ingredient in cough medicines, dextromethorphan,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2286-9">stimulated the growth
of SARS-CoV-2 in monkey cells</a> in lab dishes, researchers report April 30 in
<em>Nature</em>. Dextromethorphan seems to
activate a cellular stress-coping process that is also exploited by the virus
for its replication. </p>



<p>“We’re not necessarily recommending that
everyone stop taking dextromethorphan,” said Brian Shoichet of the University
of California, San Francisco School of Pharmacy. </p>



<p>This work is only in lab experiments, he
noted during a news briefing on April 30. In people, cough suppressants have
not been shown to make infections worse. But because the lab results
demonstrate “a pro-viral effect, it would be wrong not to highlight it, because
it could be detrimental,” Shoichet said, noting that more work needs to be
done. It’s “something to look out for.” </p>







<p>Shoichet was part of an international
team that mapped interactions between the coronavirus’s proteins and proteins
found in human and monkey cells. Lung cells produce more of the proteins involved
in these viral interactions, the researchers discovered, which may help explain
why the virus causes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-some-patients-may-suffer-lasting-lung-damage">severe
disease in the lungs</a> (<em>SN: 4/27/20</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists tested a battery of drugs to
see if any could interrupt those interactions and limit the virus’s growth. Drugs
that have shown some promise in lab experiments involving monkey cells include antipsychotics
haloperidol and cloperazine; an anxiety and
depression drug called siramesine; antihistamines clemastine
and cloperastine; and an experimental drug called zotatifin, now in
clinical trials testing its efficacy against cancer. </p>

<p>None has been tried against COVID-19 in people.</p>



<p>The team also found an experimental
compound, PB28, that performed better than hydroxychloroquine at inhibiting the
virus’s growth by interfering with certain protein interactions.  Unlike hydroxychloroquine, PB28 doesn’t mess with
heart rhythm proteins, so may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-evidence-hydroxychloroquine-does-not-help-treat-covid-19">fewer
side effects</a> <em>(SN: 4/21/20)</em>. PB28 also
hasn’t been tested in people. </p>



<p>The hormone progesterone also interfered with the virus’s replication, perhaps partially explaining why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kills-more-men-than-women-why-immune-system">women are less prone to die from COVID-19</a> than men (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-less-magnetically-active-than-similar-stars">The sun is less magnetically active than similar stars, and we don’t know why</a></h4>

<p>The sun might be a magnetic
slacker. </p>



<p>A census of stars similar to
the sun shows that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aay3821">our own star is less magnetically active</a> than others of its kind, astrophysicists report in
the May 1 <em>Science</em>. The result could support the idea that the sun is in
a “midlife crisis,” transitioning into a quieter phase of life. Or,
alternatively, it could mean that the sun has capacity for much more magnetic
oomph than it’s shown in the past.</p>



<p>“Our sun could potentially
become [as] active” as those other stars in the future, says astrophysicist
Timo Reinhold of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. </p>



<p>A star’s magnetism can drive
dramatic outbursts like flares and coronal mass ejections, which can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proxima-centauri-flare-may-have-fried-earths-nearest-exoplanet">cause chaos on orbiting planets</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/18</em>). When these large ejections from
the sun hit Earth, they can knock out satellites, shut down power grids and
trigger beautiful auroras. Understanding the sun’s magnetic field is thought to
be the key to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2019-total-solar-eclipse-south-america">predicting such outbursts</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/19</em>).</p>





<p>Magnetic fields also can create
dark sunspots and bright spots called faculae on a star’s surface. These
features change over time as magnetic activity changes, altering a star’s
brightness.  </p>



<p>Astronomers have been
observing the sun’s magnetism through those surface features since Galileo
turned a telescope toward the sun in 1610. While the sun’s magnetic activity
waxes and wanes in an 11-year cycle, our star has remained fairly calm while
humans have been watching. Inferences from certain radioactive elements found
in tree rings and ice cores suggest that same overall cycle of magnetic
activity has held steady for the last 9,000 years. </p>



<p>Because other stars are so
far away, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-astrophysicist-chased-star-halo-games-real-life-young-sun">tiny changes in brightness that reveal magnetic
changes were hard to detect</a> until
2009, when the Kepler space telescope launched (<em>SN: 9/18/19</em>). The now-defunct
telescope <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">found exoplanets by picking up on slight dips in
starlight</a> as planets orbited in front
of stars (<em>SN: 10/30/18</em>), but the spacecraft’s data include a wealth of
information on other changes in stars’ brightness. </p>



<p>To see how the sun’s
brightness compared with its stellar kin from 2009 to 2013, Reinhold and his
colleagues studied stars whose age, surface gravity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-peculiar-makeup-compared-solar-twins">chemical makeup</a>
and temperature are similar to the sun’s (<em>SN: 8/3/18</em>). The team also
sought stars that rotate at nearly the same rate as the sun, roughly once every
24 days.</p>



<p>Not every star’s rotation
period was measurable, so Reinhold’s team split the stars into two groups: 369
“solarlike” stars, with rotation periods between 20 and 30 days, and 2,898
“pseudo-solar” stars, whose period could not be detected.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, although the
stars with no detectable rotation periods looked as magnetically calm as the
sun, the stars with sunlike rotations were up to five times as active.</p>



<p>Either something is
different about those stars, Reinhold says, or the sun may go through periods
of greater variability in its brightness — and thus, magnetic activity — that
scientists just haven’t seen. Perhaps “the sun did not reveal its full range of
activity over the last 9,000 years,” he says. “The sun is 4.5 billion years old;
9,000 years is nothing.”</p>



<p>Still another explanation
for the finding is related to the idea that stars might stop slowing their
rotation because of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">a midlife change in their magnetic field</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/19</em>), says astronomer Travis Metcalfe
of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. </p>



<p>Many stellar physicists think that stars continually lose momentum and slow their spins as they get old. But in 2016, Metcalfe and colleagues reported that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16168">Kepler was seeing stars that rotate too fast</a> for their advanced ages. The team suggested that stars might stop their slowdowns at middle age, and that the sun is currently going through this transition.</p>



<p>The new result “could be the
best evidence yet that the sun is in the midst of a magnetic midlife crisis,”
Metcalfe says. The hyperactive stars in Reinhold’s sample appear to be slightly
younger than the sun, and so may not have gone through their magnetic
transition yet. The sun and the other calmer stars could already be on the
other side.</p>



<p>“It’s super interesting either way it turns out,” Metcalfe says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-antarctica-are-gaining-ice-inland-losing-melting-overall">Greenland and Antarctica are gaining ice inland, but still losing it overall</a></h4>

<p>In the
tug-of-war between coastal melting and inland ice buildup, the meltdown is
winning in both Greenland and Antarctica.</p>



<p>Initial
observations from NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite in 2018 and 2019 reveal how the Greenland
and Antarctic ice sheets have changed since the original ICESat mission collected
data from 2003 to 2008. Both missions measured the height of ice near Earth’s
poles by bouncing laser light off the surface. Since each satellite’s position
in space was known, clocking how long it took reflected light to return to the
satellite revealed the ice’s height, allowing researchers to discern changes in
ice thickness between measurements. </p>



<p>These
data indicate that ice in eastern Antarctica and central Greenland thickened
slightly from 2003 to 2019. The researchers suspect this is the result of
increased snowfall, because in a warmer climate, more ocean water evaporates
and the air holds more moisture. But a minor thickening of inland ice was no
match for the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5845">massive ice losses along Greenland
and Antarctica’s coastlines</a>,
researchers report online April 30 in <em>Science</em>. Greenland and Antarctica
lost an average 200 billion and 118 billion metric tons of land ice per year,
respectively, over this 16-year period.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Thinning ice</h3>





<p>Satellite observations from 2003 to 2019 show changes in ice thickness on Greenland and Antarctica (white circle is over the South Pole where the satellite did not collect data). Colors indicate average changes in ice thickness in meters per year (blue hues mark where ice thickened; reds and purples designate ice thinning). Ice appeared to bulk up around Queen Maud Land in eastern Antarctica, as well as in central Greenland, particularly in the northeast and south. But such minor increases were far outpaced by massive ice losses around the edges of the ice sheets. In Antarctica, particularly severe losses were seen on the western Amundsen and Bellingshausen coasts. In Greenland, the southern Kangerdlugssuaq and Jakobshavn glaciers suffered the worst losses.</p>

<p>In terms
of where and how each ice sheet lost mass, “the Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets are two very different beasts,” says study coauthor Alex Gardner, a
glaciologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. </p>



<p>Ice all
around the coast of Greenland thinned drastically, due to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/expanding-ice-slabs-increasing-greenland-contribution-sea-level-rise">warmer summer temperatures</a> (<em>SN: 9/18/19</em>). But the most
severe thinning happened on Greenland’s outlet glaciers, which are like “a
whole bunch of little fingers that spread out into the ocean,” Gardner says.
Where the tips of these glacial fingers poke out from between cold fjords and
meet warmer ocean water, that water erodes the ice, causing the glaciers to
flow out faster and thin inland. Greenland’s southern Kangerdlugssuaq and Jakobshavn
glaciers have thinned most rapidly — by 4 to 6 meters of ice thickness per
year.</p>



<p>In
Antarctica, warmer seawater not only melts glaciers, but it also melts the
extensions of the ice sheet that float on the ocean, called ice shelves, which surround
the continent. Melting ice shelves do not directly contribute to sea level
rise, for the same reason a melting ice cube doesn’t overflow a glass of water.
But ice shelves resist the natural flow of Antarctica’s inland ice <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-map-best-view-yet-how-fast-antarctica-shedding-ice">from the
heart of the continent toward the coasts</a> (<em>SN: 8/5/19</em>). As ice shelves thin and
weaken, they let ice flow into the ocean faster than snowfall keeps up, raising
sea levels. Antarctic ice has especially thinned in the western Amundsen and
Bellingshausen regions.</p>



<p>ICESat-2’s detailed observations of Antarctica and Greenland’s ice loss were “eagerly anticipated,” says Andrew Shepherd, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds in England who was not involved in the study. Such a detailed record of ice changes can be used to test the predictions of past climate models, helping researchers understand how to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">make forecasting tools more accurate</a>, he says (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-superconducting-current-travels-only-along-material-edge">A newfound superconducting current travels only along a material’s edge</a></h4>

<p>Superconductors are getting edgy.</p>



<p>For the first time, scientists have spotted
a superconducting current traveling along the edge of a material, like a trail
of ants crawling along the rim of a dinner plate without venturing into its middle.
</p>



<p>Normally, such superconducting currents, in which electricity flows without any loss of energy, permeate an entire material. But in a thin sheet of molybdenum ditelluride chilled to near absolute zero, the interior and edge make up <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaw9270">two distinct superconductors</a>, physicist Nai Phuan Ong and colleagues report in the May 1 <em>Science</em>. The two superconductors are “basically ignoring each other,” says Ong, of Princeton University.</p>



<p>This distinction between exterior and
interior makes molybdenum ditelluride an example of what are called topological
materials. Their behavior is closely tied to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-awarded-using-math-shapes-explain-exotic-matter">mathematical field of topology</a>, in which shapes are considered distinct only if one
can’t be molded into another without cutting or melding (<em>SN: 10/4/16</em>). In <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-edge">topological insulators</a>, electric
currents can flow on the surface of a material but not the interior, like a
potato covered in tinfoil (<em>SN: 5/7/10</em>).</p>





<p>Likewise, topological superconductors
are superconducting in their interiors and behave differently on their
surfaces. Although some researchers suspected topological superconductors might
also host superconducting current on their edges, none had yet been found. But
the new observation is “extremely convincing,” says physical chemist Claudia
Felser of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids in Dresden,
Germany, who was not involved with the research. “It’s really, really super
exciting.” </p>



<p>Molybdenum ditelluride is a metal-like compound
called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elusive-particle-shows-semimetal">Weyl semimetal</a>
(<em>SN: 7/16/15</em>). Its unusual properties
might mean it could harbor <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/majorana-fermion-detected-quantum-layer-cake">Majorana fermions</a>, disturbances within a material that scientists hope to use to create
better quantum computers. Such topological quantum computers are expected to
resist the jitter that impairs quantum calculations (<em>SN: 7/20/17</em>).</p>



<p>In their experiment, Ong and colleagues
gradually ramped up the magnetic field on the material. They simultaneously
measured how much they could increase the electric current  before the superconducting state was lost, a
value known as the critical current. As the magnetic field increased, the
critical current oscillated, getting larger, smaller, and larger again in a
repeating pattern — a hallmark of an edge superconductor. </p>



<p>The oscillation results from the weird
physics of superconductors, in which electrons form partnerships called Cooper
pairs. The pairs act as a unified whole, all taking on the same quantum state, or
wave function, which determines the probability of a particle being found at a
particular location.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Superconducting current diagram" class="wp-image-3087505" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/043020_ec_superconductor_feat.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087505">A superconducting current (white arrows) runs around the edge of a thin sheet of molybdenum ditelluride (illustrated on right) in a magnetic field (black arrows). A similar effect in a ring of superconductor (left) was seen in a classic study known as the Little-Parks experiment.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087505">W. Wang <em>et al</em>/<em>Science </em>2020</span></figure>



<p>A property of the wave function called
the phase is analogous to twists in a party streamer hung around the edges of a
room, Ong says. If connected at the ends, the party streamer can twist once or
twice, but never 1.2 times, for example, because the ends wouldn’t align.
Similarly, the phase must make a full number of twists around the material. The
interplay between the increasing magnetic field and the twisting constraint
causes the critical current to oscillate. </p>



<p>A classic 1960s study known as the Little-Parks
experiment is closely tied to the new work. In that study, a superconductor
shaped like a cylinder exhibited related oscillations in a changing magnetic
field. But in Ong and colleagues’ version, the superconducting current runs
around the edge of a solid chunk of material rather than a physical cylinder.</p>



<p>“It’s a very clever and beautiful way of assessing whether or not there’s an edge current” that is superconducting, says physicist Smitha Vishveshwara of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not involved with the research.</p>

<p><strong>Open Science Easing the Transition from Lab to e-Lab</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of COVID19, the world is scrambling to figure out how to continue the functions of normal life while confined to a much smaller world of couches and home offices. Work, family and friend relationships, exercise, entertainment, and all the other elements of normalcy have been upended. The effort to maintain productivity (and, to be frank, sanity) has initiated a mass digital migration; a movement from life to e-life.</p>
<p>If you are a researcher you are likely dealing with your own unique micro-version of the predicament: how to continue working when you and your lab are self-isolated? In other words, how to replicate as many of the normal functions of a lab as possible in a digital environment; a movement from lab to e-lab.</p>
<p>Lab meetings have <a href="https://mcbridelab.princeton.edu/covid19-zoom-lab-meeting/">migrated to video-conferencing</a> with relatively little friction; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00786-y">conferences have gone virtual astoundingly quickly</a>; manuscripts are being drafted and figures created – perhaps a tad earlier than originally planned; grants and proposals are being written. These are, however, only a small portion of what researchers do, and leave a huge swath of scientific work untouched and in stasis.</p>
<p>Those most able to continue useful work are those who, for whatever reason, have access to as much of their work as possible from home. Pictures of researchers lugging multiple work computers home in order to continue data analysis were common in the early days of the crisis.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42994" height="512" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-1.png" width="496" /></a></p>
<p>There is a subgroup of researchers, however, who can continue work without having to cram several computer towers into the trunk of a car: those who created an up-to-date digital, online representation of their research activities right up to the moment they had to be abandoned. These lucky few, who put in the time and effort to create a comprehensive e-lab prior to the crisis, are for the most part those who already commited to open science. This is, of course, no accident.</p>
<p><strong>Open Science and e-Labs</strong></p>
<p>Open science is, at its most practical base, the effort to (1) create an accurate and well organized digital representation of research activities and (2) share that representation with as few barriers as possible so others can effectively check, replicate, rework, reuse, and remix findings. Even the concentration within open science on sharing physical materials – like cell lines, biospecimens, and model organisms – is to enable replication and follow-on research when sharing the information about those materials does not to allow others to generate them themselves due to the unique nature of the material or an inability to make materials locally.</p>
<p>Researchers who have incorporated open, online sharing of research resources throughout their work – sharing experimental designs and protocols, lab notebooks, data, software, etc – have, in effect, created a digital representation of a significant portion of their activities that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>Not to oversell things, open sharing of research resources does not mean that researchers and labs can continue functioning without a hitch in their experimental stride. Much of the actual physical work has necessarily halted. It does mean, however, that many of the inputs to and outputs of their research are available in a digital form; accessible from a couch, desk, or apartment window-sill. While the emphasis from open science advocates in the past has been on ensuring that these digital representations exist so they can be shared, an added advantage has now jumped to the fore: the ability to share your e-lab with your quarantined-self.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your e-Lab with Yourself</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-2.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42996" height="148" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-2.png" width="461" /></a></p>
<p>Labs that have, for example, stored experimental data immediately upon collection on open science platforms such as the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, <a href="https://www.synapse.org/">Synapse</a>, <a href="https://openneuro.org/">OpenNeuro</a>, and <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a> now have seamless access to the last bit collected before retreating into quarantine. Analyzing this data may be impossible if the requisite software only exists on a work computer, or you don’t have a license to use it at home; if, however, research software has been openly shared via a platform like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> then it can be accessed from a park bench (assuming a decent wifi signal).</p>
<p>If the collected data needs to be put into the context of how it was collected, perhaps to elicit input from other lab members about the best way to analyze it, there is no easier way than accessing the relevant protocols through <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">protocols.io</a> or an <a href="https://openlabnotebooks.org/">Open Lab Notebook</a>. Need to know exactly what reagents or model organisms were used in an experiment? If one cannot go check the freezer, cage, or delivery invoice, then checking the relevant <a href="https://www.rrids.org/">Research Resource Identifier</a> (RRID) listed in your shared protocol or notebook is the next best (if not better) thing.</p>
<p>The list of unanticipated advantages continues. Perhaps you need to get input from a normally-down-the-hall colleague about how to improve your protocol for the future, or eliminate an artifact from some data, or iron out a persnickety bug in analysis software. In the lab you could invite them to pull up a chair as you took them through the issue. Now that is, obviously, impossible. If the protocol, data, or software were shared, however, you could email them the link (or, better yet, <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-">persistent identifier</a>), open a videochat window, and collaborate from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your e-Lab with Your Research Community</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-3.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42997" height="379" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-3.png" width="467" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most heartening things I have seen while scrolling through my twitter-feed-turned-emotional-roller-coaster is that self-isolated researchers are engaging with openly shared research resources.</p>
<p>This is of course the case with COVID19 research, where openly shared software, data, manuscripts, and protocols relevant to the virus are being shared, collected, curated and adapted with blinding speed; but it goes farther than that. Every day I see someone in the neuroscience research community tweet something along the lines of “thank goodness for X piece of openly shared software/data that I can learn about and use from home!”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-4.png"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-42998 aligncenter" height="1081" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Tweet-4.png" width="1059" /></a></p>
<p>When people are cut off from their physical labs and don’t have an e-lab of their own, it is wonderful to see them being able to pick up the tools and resources shared by others. The lessons we are being forced to learn about the fluidity, dynamism, and capacity for collective creativity enabled by sharing research resources will serve us well in the future.</p>
<p>My sincere hope is that those working with these new found tools and resources take the open ethos to heart and openly <em>reshare</em> any modifications, derived data, and new insights with the research community. Doing so closes the loop, creating a community-based feedback mechanism that encourages further sharing in the future and, more importantly, uses the expertise of the world-wide research community to create ever better science.</p>
<p><strong>Benefiting the Public and Less Well-off Researchers with an Open e-Lab</strong></p>
<p>Some of the people involved in shaping (see: arguing about) what open science is quail at the idea that open science has anything to do with equity and equality. They say that it is merely about replicability and transparency and that is it, harumph. What I hope this situation brings to light – as you swear at your institutional VPN for once again dropping you, or find yourself unable to download important papers because of paywalls your institutional account would normally breeze through – is that you are receiving a taste of what it is like outside the gilded ivory tower.</p>
<p>Such restrictions on access and use are what interested members of the public, or those at research institutes that cannot afford staggering subscription prices, or those in labs not well funded enough to pay for the licenses to fancy analysis software, face every day. The act of openly sharing a paper, a piece of software, a dataset, an equipment design, or whatever else is not just about replicability. Doing so is an act that expands the borders of science, allowing the participation of the previously excluded. It is an act of inclusion not in some abstract post-modern sense, but in the very real sense of choosing where and why to put the fences.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Open e-Lab with the World</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the fact that open sharing is useful to the isolated-sharer and their research community, shared research resources have taken on an unprecedented importance in the COVID19 crisis. Stories abound of how <a href="https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/covid-19-how-unprecedented-data-sharing-has-led-faster-ever-outbreak-research.html">sharing genetic sequences</a> and <a href="https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html">protein structures</a> have led to the discovery of novel treatment targets, diagnostic testing protocols, and the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/record-setting-speed-vaccine-makers-take-their-first-shots-new-coronavirus">initiation of clinical trials</a> on a timescale that, in the pre-COVID19 era, would be unbelievable. Moreover, the rapid release of results via preprints has allowed the creation of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">competitions to apply machine learning</a> to generate yet more insights. Though similar mass sharing has occurred during previous outbreaks (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/plea-open-science-zika">Zika</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/data-sharing-make-outbreak-research-open-access-1.16966">Ebola</a>), the fact that COVID19’s impact has been global (and, not to put too fine a point on it, has impacted the global north) holds the hope that this time it will stick.</p>
<p>There is no reason that the same strategies cannot be applied to the ongoing crises in neurological disorders, antibiotic development, and the treatment of rare diseases, to name only a few. Indeed, the kind of massive online collaboration to solve issues around testing, creating ventilators and personal protective equipment, solving protein structures, and identifying novel treatment targets in the context of COVID19 is <em>exactly</em> what open science advocates have been dreaming of for years.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to e-Labs and Global Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Open science has laid the groundwork for the creation of e-labs and for them to be linked up to enable global collaboration. The COVID19 crisis has, on so many levels, highlighted the importance and promise sharable, digital representations of research activity hold for the future of research. More people than ever are glimpsing the potential that e-labs interlinked into a global digital research ecosystem represents.</p>
<p>This bright future does not, however, come free of complications. Just as open science reveals the potential of sharing, it also reveals difficulties of coordination and consensus. If research is going to be conducted collaboratively on a global scale we need to make sure that shared resources are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (e.g. <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples">FAIR</a>). Doing so can be made easier through technology and sharing platforms, but what it requires most are education, communities collaboratively setting norms around standards and sharing practices, and a commitment to embed open science practices throughout the research lifecycle. The necessary changes in behaviour will require social and cultural innovation on the part of research communities at least as important as any technical advance.</p>
<p>Another big coordination problem has to do with eliminating research redundancies. Individual researchers within the global community need to coordinate so as to pursue different but complementary efforts. Doing so requires researchers to move past the stage of sharing resources in the hopes that those in their community will find it to engagement with that community. In the old, closed model such coordination was handled (albeit inefficiently) through journals and conferences where community members would be apprised of the work being done by others. The same task now must be undertaken in the digital world. Those of us interested in advancing open science are busily documenting how this is being done for COVID19 research in the hope that we can, after this is over, present an iron-clad case for how research communities can be rebuilt with digitally-mediated coordination planted deep in their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Making an Open Future to Benefit Everyone</strong></p>
<p>I would ask you to deeply consider how you can begin adopting open, collaborative, community based approaches in the future of your research, once the world is rightside-up again. Doing so isn’t just about some abstract idea of openness; it has real benefits for you, your lab, your research community, and the world. COVID is, it is true, producing never before seen destruction of research efforts from which many projects may never recover. Within this destruction, however, lay clues to how research can be remade better, more collaborative, more coordinated and, of course, more open.</p>

<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>
<p>Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults. More than 15 million strokes occur every year in the world, and more than 100,000 of these affect patients in the UK. Stroke patients often have an impaired ability to control their upper limbs and need assistance with every-day tasks. Relearning motor skills after stroke is similar to learning new motor skills, for example learning to play tennis, but a problem for stroke survivors is that their impaired movements often restrict the ability to use sensory feedback for re-learning.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation robotics has shown promise to augment the rehabilitation process and to offer feedback on performance. However, the personalisation of the therapy to individual needs remains a major challenge to date.</p>
<p>The proposed project will use a computational model of the cerebellum that is being developed by the Biocomputation Research Group (biocomputation.herts.ac.uk) to optimise robotic rehabilitation for individual subjects. The cerebellum has been optimised throughout vertebrate evolution to become an adaptive controller of biological skeletomuscular structures that is unrivalled by any artificial adaptive motor control algorithm. This has led and is still leading to the development of a rapidly increasing number of computational models of cerebellar learning, and to the successful applications of these cerebellar models to controlling simulated and real robots. The PhD project will involve the development and application of personalised cerebellar models in order to optimise rehabilitation robots for individual subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Applicants</strong> should have excellent computational and numerical skills and a very good first degree in computer science, biology, maths, physics, neuroscience, or a related discipline. Successful candidates are eligible for a research studentship award from the University (GBP 15,285 per annum bursary plus payment of the student fees). Applicants from outside the UK or EU are eligible.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/slave-trade-skeletons-disease-mexico">16th century skeletons suggest the slave trade brought some diseases to Mexico</a></h4>

<p>Slavery proved contagious when Spain colonized 16th century
Mexico. Africans abducted into the transatlantic slave trade and taken to
Mexico around that time <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)30482-6">may
have introduced forms of two infectious diseases</a>, hepatitis B and yaws, to
the Americas, researchers say.</p>



<p>DNA of three men whose skeletons were previously excavated
near a Mexico City hospital indicates that all were from western or southern
Africa, say archaeogeneticist Rodrigo Barquera of the Max Planck Institute for
the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and his colleagues. The men’s
upper front teeth had been filed down, a practice known to have characterized
African slaves in the Americas, the scientists report online April 30 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Forms of strontium, carbon and nitrogen in the men’s teeth,
which indicate the region where a person grew up, also suggest childhood
origins outside Mexico.</p>



<p>One man’s tooth carried DNA from a
strain of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-fossils-betray-hepatitis-bs-ancient-roots">the
hepatitis B virus</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/13</em>)
typically found in present-day West Africans, the investigators say. While it’s
unclear when hepatitis B infections first occurred in the Americas, the
researchers contend that African slaves brought a novel genetic form of
hepatitis B to Mexico. </p>





<p>Another man’s tooth yielded
bacterial DNA from a yaws strain also observed in modern West Africans. Yaws is
a painful <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/measles-global-spread-vaccination">infection
of the bones, joints and skin</a> (<em>SN: 5/21/19</em>).
Previous research found a closely related West African yaws strain in the
skeleton of a 17th century individual with European ancestry who was buried in
Mexico City, suggesting that yaws carried by African slaves around a century
earlier continued to infect people in the region.</p>



<p>The three men lived sometime between 1436 and 1626, based on
radiocarbon dates of their teeth. They are the oldest genetically identified
first-generation Africans in the Americas. As slaves, the men likely reached
Mexico in a transatlantic bondage system Spain started in the early 1500s, the
scientists suspect.</p>



<p>These individuals died in their 20s before being placed in a mass grave, Barquera’s team estimates. The men’s bones display evidence of hard labor, including signs of carrying heavy loads, injuries such as leg fractures and damage from malnutrition or parasitic infections. </p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>In basic terms, online status indicators convey availability: whether someone is on or offline, or when they last logged into a particular app. But if you’ve ever anxiously awaited a response from a prospective partner or suspected your friend might be ignoring you, you’ll be painfully aware of just how much weight that indicator can actually hold.</p>
<p>Now a new study has found that many users are not only aware of all that online status indicators can convey, but also change their behaviour accordingly. The research is <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/04/13/how-online-status-indicators-shape-our-behavior/">due to be published</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the 2020 ACM conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>.<span id="more-39547"></span></p>
<p>Previous research has already shown that such indicators can inadvertently reveal a lot about our lives: <a href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/privacy-implications-of-presence-sharing-in-mobile-messaging-appl">one 2014 study</a> found that online status on WhatsApp was enough to identify daily routines, unusual messaging patterns, or even who users were talking to.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, Camille Cobb and her team recruited 200 participants to answer questions about their experiences with online status indicators. First, participants were presented with a list of 38 apps and asked to select those they use at least once a week. They were then asked a series of questions to gauge their familiarity with the design of status indicators and knowledge of how to control their visibility in apps.</p>
<p>Finally, participants were asked questions about their own experiences adjusting their visibility online (“is there anyone who would notice if you were offline for longer than usual?” or “have you ever changed your behaviour because you didn’t want to appear online?”) and behaviour towards others (“have you ever been surprised to notice that someone was online?” or “have you ever opened an app specifically to check if someone was online?”).</p>
<p>Use of apps with online status indicators was hugely common: 99% of participants reported regular use of at least one app with the feature, with Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger the most widely used.</p>
<p>Many participants wanted to control their online status, and had changed behaviour in order to do so: 23% had changed settings, 37% had avoided opening an app or quickly signed out to avoid a specific person, and three participants deleted an app from their phone altogether so that they didn’t appear “online”. This behaviour was usually aimed at a specific person: 43% had changed settings to avoid a particular person — often a current or former partner — versus just 25% who were trying to avoid people in general. Many stated that online status indicators had led them to feel under surveillance, aware that friends, partners or family members would be watching to see if or when they had signed in.</p>
<p>Checking for others’ online status was also prevalent: over half of participants said they had signed into or opened an app just to check somebody else’s status, and 41% said they had been “surprised” to see someone online, which in turn led to inferences about real-world behaviour and well-being and feelings around being ignored.</p>
<p>Online status indicators can be useful: as participants noted, they can be handy for working out when somebody might be available to chat or play a game, or knowing whether it might be better to message someone or call them instead. But the frequency with which participants anxiously checked others’ online status or sought to hide their own suggests that platforms should be offering better ways to meet user needs. Settings could be more transparent, for a start, or users could select not to appear online altogether — an option which many apps don’t yet offer.</p>
<p>Running into someone you really don’t want to see or speak to is an unfortunate fact of life, both on and offline: eliminating that altogether is probably unlikely to happen. But ensuring that users are able to adequately manage their online status may be something apps or messaging platforms could improve upon. Until then, it’s likely that online statuses will be a source of both community and anxiety.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology/">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Children who are victims of bullying often suffer a sense of helplessness. They don’t know what to do during bullying episodes and they don’t really believe anything will change or anyone can intervene effectively. Children subjected to bullying say it makes them feel sick, afraid, and helpless. It can also lead to feelings of anxiety, anger and depression. We know that as adults former victims can undergo similar feelings in the right circumstances.</p><p>Due to my research in the area of childhood bullying, I am contacted by many people about their own bullying incidents as children. They describe how they coped at the time. Often, they comment on how they’ve managed their lives in the wake of bullying.   The great majority have survived and gone on to live productive lives. However, during this world-wide COVID-19 crisis, adults relate that their mental state is similar to how they felt as children. I have received messages describing the reactivation of childhood memories of being captive to someone while feeling powerless.  In the face of the uncertainty generated by the coronavirus, the same emotions are rekindled: fear, anxiety, anger, and a certain amount of depression. While most are doing what they can in terms of preparedness and health precautions, helplessness is once again a prevailing emotion. Substance abuse held at bay has reemerged as a problem.</p><p>By this point, perhaps the majority of people are aware of a sense of helplessness while trying to outwait and outwit COVID-19 by using every best effort. It is a helpless feeling to see the numbers of deaths and to witness the struggles in the healthcare system. While everyone may feel some amount of anxiety related to the virus, survivors of bullying experience a heightened degree of fear, anxiety, and depression based on triggered childhood feelings. Helplessness is a familiar but unwelcome manifestation impacting their daily mood. Sheltering-in-place is difficult emotionally in general. But for victims of childhood bullying it is reminiscent of and activates the loneliness that was an everyday burden.</p><p>Trauma is an aspect of this health crisis. The loss of family and friends, and the fear of their loss, is overwhelming. Trauma results when such overwhelming stress exceeds one’s ability to cope. There are three distinct types of trauma: acute, chronic, and complex. Acute trauma describes what people are living through now, meaning the trauma is the result of a single event- the corona virus. Trauma can become chronic depending on the duration of an event; in this case how long people are required to shelter-in-place with all the problems attendant to that (loss of income, lack of childcare, family violence, etc.). Chronic bullying is traumatizing for children and it leads to changes in the brains’ ability to think clearly. At the very least, bullied children worry and their worries influence their actions. They try to hide and they learn to avoid their bullies. They often become worried, anxious adults. For those who endured bullying victimization as children, the trauma is complex. Those adults deal with childhood trauma and its effects in an ongoing way. Now they are dealing with the very personal nature of the fear of the virus as well.</p><p>Children can do very little when they are helpless. They don’t have the tools, the wisdom, the resources, or the maturity needed to ameliorate adverse childhood conditions. Adults by virtue of greater years, greater resources, and greater mental capacity are able, much of the time, to deal with difficult circumstances. But COVID-19 extracts its toll despite wisdom, years, or great resources. The virus is an equalizer in this respect. It exerts power over its victims. It is relentless in pursuing a host to control. It searches for any weakness to exploit. COVID-19 acts exactly like a bully. For those who have already been a victim in childhood, this new terror is another bully forcing people to stay inside hiding from its power. In this way, victims of childhood bullying, even with their adult resources, are revisited by an age-old sense of helplessness unique to them.</p><p>For adults intimidated and threatened throughout childhood, helplessness is not new. It has come back again in the shape of something even more powerful and intimidating.</p><p><em>Photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@foxfox?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Natalia Y</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/depression?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> </em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622804842/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622804842/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622804842/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-ethics-of-defeating-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">The ethics of defeating COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-austerity-measures-hurt-the-covid-19-response/" rel="nofollow">How austerity measures hurt the COVID-19 response</a></li></ul> </div>

A journal has retracted a controversial paper that questioned what it called the “existing dogma” about gender.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">Remdesivir is the first drug found to block the coronavirus</a></h4>

<p>An antiviral drug called remdesivir is
the first treatment to show efficacy against the coronavirus. </p>



<p>Preliminary results from a clinical trial
comparing the drug with a placebo suggest that <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19">remdesivir
speeds recovery from COVID-19 by 31 percent</a>, the U.S. National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases said April 29 in a news release.</p>



<p>The international trial randomly assigned
1,063 people hospitalized with COVID-19 to get intravenous infusions of either
remdesivir or a placebo. In the remdesivir group, the median time to recovery
was 11 days, compared with 15 days for those on the placebo. Recovery was
defined as being discharged from the hospital or being well enough to resume
normal activity. Eight percent of people in the remdesivir group died, compared
with 11 percent in the placebo group. </p>



<p>“Although a 31 percent improvement
doesn’t seem like a knockout 100 percent, it is a very important proof of
concept,” Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, said April 29 during a news
briefing at the White House. “It has proven that <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1255541788154224641">a drug can block
this virus</a>.” </p>





<p>Normally, researchers would have waited
to make the announcement until the results had been reviewed by other
scientists, but the team chose to make the announcement early, Fauci said.
“Whenever you have clear-cut evidence that a drug works, you have an ethical
obligation to immediately let the people who are in the placebo group know so
that they can have access.” </p>





<p>Remdesivir will now be the standard of
care by which other drugs are judged, Fauci said. The trial will be adapted to add
to the remdesivir treatment an antibody that may protect against inflammation,
he said. </p>



<p>Remdesivir, developed by biopharmaceutical
company Gilead Sciences, headquartered in Foster City, Calif., mimics a
building block of RNA, the coronavirus’s genetic material. When the virus
copies its RNA, remdesivir is incorporated instead of the usual RNA components,
stopping the virus’s replication. </p>



<p>In studies in lab dishes and animals,
remdesivir has been effective against a wide variety of RNA-containing viruses,
including those that cause MERS and SARS. “It’s passed every single milestone.
It works against every coronavirus we’ve tested,” says Mark Denison, a
virologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, who was not
involved in the study. </p>



<p>Remdesivir has been most effective in
animal studies when given early in infections, Denison says. The drug can stop
or slow viral replication but doesn’t block the body’s overzealous immune
system responses that cause additional damage for many severely ill COVID-19
patients. He likens remdesivir to a fire extinguisher. “If there’s a fire, and
you put it out with the fire extinguisher, you’re not going to get burned. But
if you fall in [the fire] and burn your arm, you can apply the fire
extinguisher and maybe you’ll limit the burn, but you can’t heal it.” </p>



<p>If the drug can be given early in the infection — difficult to do with a drug like remdesivir that is given intravenously and must be administered by trained medical professionals — then people might never become ill enough to need to go to the hospital. “You [could] convert this from being a lethal disease, to being a manageable, survivable disease,” Denison says.   </p>



<p>A similar compound given as an oral drug
might even be used to prevent infections, Denison says.  </p>

<p>Gilead also announced results of another remdesivir trial on April 29. That study compared a five-day course of remdesivir with 10 days of treatment. There was no control group that didn’t get the drug. It took 10 days for half of people on the shorter course of remdesivir to have clinical improvement compared with 11 days for those in the longer-treatment group. </p>



<p>“The study demonstrates the potential
for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/4/gilead-announces-results-from-phase-3-trial-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19">could
significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated</a> with our
current supply of remdesivir. This is particularly important in the setting of
a pandemic, to help hospitals and health care workers treat more patients in
urgent need of care,” the company said in a news release. </p>



<p>Of the 200 people in the five-day
treatment group, 129 went home from the hospital by day 14, while 106 of the
197 people who got the longer treatment were discharged by day 14. </p>



<p>Treating earlier was also beneficial. Sixty-two
percent of patients who got treatment within 10 days of their symptoms starting
were able to go home after two weeks in the hospital, but only 49 percent of
those who got treatment later in the infection were discharged after two weeks
in the hospital. </p>



<p>A smaller, incomplete study published
April 29 in the<em> Lancet</em> appears to
counter the results of the NIAID study. The <em>Lancet</em>
study, conducted in 10 hospitals in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic first
started, found <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31022-9/fulltext">no
statistically significant improvement in recovery time</a> in severely ill
COVID-19 patients given remdesivir, compared with those who got a placebo. </p>



<p>In that study, the median time to
recovery for patients taking remdesivir was 21 days, compared with 23 days for
those getting a placebo. There was a trend that remdesivir sped recovery for
people who had symptoms for less than 10 days, but that result didn’t meet
statistical thresholds. That trial stopped early because Wuhan’s lockdown
effectively stopped transmission so that researchers weren’t able to recruit
enough patients to fill the trial’s slots. As a result, the trial lacked the
statistical power to detect differences between the groups, Denison says.  </p>



<p>Previous results from a study of patients given remdesivir for “compassionate use” when no clinical trial was available showed that 36 of 53 people given the drug <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016">needed less supplemental oxygen</a> afterward, researchers reported April 10 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/6_fSgBi6a8U/">PLOS and Iowa State University Library announce APC-free Open Access publishing agreement</a></h4>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, April 29, at 9am Pacific</em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Iowa State University Library and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced a three-year Open Access agreement that allows researchers to publish in PLOS’ suite of journals without incurring Article Processing Charges (APCs). This partnership brings together two organizations that believe researchers should be able to access content freely and make their work available publicly, regardless of their access to grant funds.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to continue our support for Open Access publishing with PLOS under this new agreement,” said Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communications and Collections at Iowa State University. “Preserving and growing the diversity of scholarly publishers has never been more important, and this agreement reaffirms our commitment to seeing that pure Open Access publishers like PLOS thrive.”</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which will be implemented in July, Iowa State University Library will be charged an annual fixed flat rate over the three-year term, which will be based on prior years’ publication levels. Iowa State researchers will have unlimited opportunity to publish in PLOS journals over these three years and will not be charged any APCs. This agreement will further PLOS’ mission of making Open Access publishing available to all while ensuring that its journals include research from authors representing a diverse array of disciplines, career stages, and geographies.</p>
<p>“The agreement with Iowa State University Library is yet another step in our goal of empowering authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and it continues the momentum following our recent agreement with the University of California,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. “Both agreements demonstrate our effort to build a truly ‘open to read, open to publish’ environment for authors as well as our commitment to experimentation with our library partners.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-u-s-contact-tracing-end-social-distancing">To end social distancing, the U.S. must dramatically ramp up contact tracing</a></h4>

<p>Right now, many countries are
fighting the spread of COVID-19 with the bluntest tool possible: widespread
social distancing. To deny the virus the opportunity to hop between people,
most of us are staying in, regardless of whether we’ve come into contact with
the virus.</p>



<p>But social distancing, which has saved
lives and eased the burden on hospitals, comes at a high cost. Lost jobs,
closed businesses and a frozen economy have many people anxious for
restrictions to be eased and for life to get back to normal. </p>



<p>If countries hit the restart button
now, epidemiologists say that the virus will come roaring back, exploiting the
fact that so many people are still susceptible. Until a vaccine arrives, two
key measures will need to pick up the slack as social distancing is eased. </p>



<p>One is widespread, easily <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-where-things-stand-tests-testing-united-states">accessible testing</a> (<em>SN: 4/17/20</em>). And for tests that come
back positive, a second system must quickly identify people who may have been infected
by that person to prevent further spread. That’s what is known as contact
tracing.</p>







<h4>Following the links</h4>



<p>The bread and butter of infectious disease
control for over a century, contact tracing is a targeted way of breaking a
pathogen’s chain of transmission. When a positive case pops on the radar of
public health officials, a contact tracer takes action, doing detective work to
track down all the people that person has encountered, or even been near. </p>



<p>Then, the contact tracer notifies
those contacts that they may have been exposed to the virus and asks them to
quarantine for the incubation period of the virus (about two weeks for cases of
COVID-19). Starved of new hosts, the epidemic fizzles out, and contact tracers
keep tabs on the people who are potentially infected to see if they develop
symptoms.</p>



<p>Contact tracing helped contain the
SARS outbreak of 2003. More recently, it helped <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5636234/">control the 2014 Ebola
outbreak in west Africa</a>. But people with SARS or Ebola spread the
virus only when they’re clearly sick, making it easier to identify and isolate
cases. COVID-19 is a different story. Infected people who don’t yet show
symptoms, or never do, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-infection-contagious-days-before-symptoms-appear">may
account for nearly half of all transmissions</a> (<em>SN: 4/15/20</em>), a
factor that helped COVID-19 silently spread around the world at a vastly larger
scale than these previous outbreaks.</p>



<h4>Raising an army of contact tracers</h4>



<p>To be effective, contact tracing requires readily available
diagnostic testing, plus a public health workforce large enough to track down
all cases and contacts. The United States and many other countries currently
have neither. “We’re not where we need to be right now,” says Crystal Watson, a
public health preparedness expert at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>



<p>As of April 29, the United States has conducted nearly 5.8 million COVID-19 tests, reporting an average of 230,000 tests per day the week before, according to the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/">COVID Tracking Project</a>, launched by <em>The Atlantic</em>. That may sound like a lot, but about 17 percent of those cases have come back positive. For a country to be confident that it’s identifying most cases, and not just the people who are obviously sick, 10 percent of tests, or fewer, should come back positive according to the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>Experts differ on how much more
testing we need. An April 20 report from Harvard University estimates the United
States<a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/roadmaptopandemicresilience_updated_4.20.20.pdf"> may need 5 million
tests</a> a day by early June to safely reopen its economy, eventually
building to 20 million tests a day. The American Enterprise Institute released
a report March 29 estimating <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/">750,000 tests per day
will suffice</a>. That number is proportional to South Korea’s testing approach,
where a robust contact tracing system has helped control the outbreak.</p>



<p>The number of contact tracers must
also skyrocket to keep up with all those tests. In Wuhan, China, a city of 11
million where the outbreak began, 9,000 contact tracers have been deployed as lockdown
measures have eased. As of early April, <a href="https://www.astho.org/Federal-Government-Relations/Correspondence/ASTHO-Issues-Contact-Tracing-Memo-to-Congress/">the United States had 2,200
contact tracers</a>, according to an April 10 letter to Congress from the Association
of State and Territorial Health Officials, or ASTHO. </p>

<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>States have been scrambling to
boost those ranks. In an <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/28/846736937/we-asked-all-50-states-about-their-contact-tracing-capacity-heres-what-we-learne">NPR survey of state
public health departments</a>, published April 28, the public radio station
found that Washington, D.C., and the 41 states that responded have about 7,600
contact tracers now on staff. Those departments reported plans to grow that
number to more than 36,000.</p>



<p>But that’s still nowhere near
enough. An estimated <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/a-national-plan-to-enable-comprehensive-COVID-19-case-finding-and-contact-tracing-in-the-US.pdf">100,000
contact tracers</a> will need to be quickly trained and deployed to control the
spread of COVID-19 in the United States, according to an April 10 analysis by
Watson and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins and ASTHO.</p>



<p>In Massachusetts, a large-scale
effort is under way to hire 1,000 new contact tracers. So far, 15,000 people
have applied, says John Welch, the director of partnerships and operations for
the <a href="https://www.pih.org/ma-response">Massachusetts COVID-19 Community Tracing
Collaborative</a> at Partners in Health, a nonprofit involved in the state’s
response. “There are a lot of qualified people who are also out of work and
already know the communities that they’re serving,” he says. </p>



<p>New hires get a three-day crash
course. They learn how to ask those who test positive about relevant contacts
(right now that means anyone the person has been within six feet (two meters) of
for more than 15 minutes), how to log that data into a statewide database and
how to inform those contacts that they’ve been exposed, and need to
self-isolate. Contact tracers also ask about symptoms.</p>



<p>Talking someone through a 14-day
quarantine process isn’t always straightforward. Questions like “How do I
self-isolate from my partner of 40 years?” “How do I get food?” or “Who’s going
to look after my elderly mother?” can all come up. “You realize pretty quickly
that this thing that feels like a very scientific activity is really just
talking to people about this thing we’re all going through together,” Welch says. </p>



<h4>The role of technology</h4>



<p>Many experts worry that the
pandemic has grown too large, and that the virus spreads too easily, for
people-powered contact tracing alone to work. Cell phone data can help
accelerate the tracing process in places willing to use the more intrusive
approach of cell phone monitoring.</p>



<p>In Singapore, citizens can download
the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether app</a>, which
uses Bluetooth signals to register when phones with the app come into close
contact. When someone with the app tests positive, public health officials can
quickly identify contacts and notify them. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>An app for that</h3>



<p>Some countries are using cell phone apps to speed the tracing the contacts. Generally, the apps work by anonymously logging when a phone spends a certain period of time near another phone that has the app. If someone with the app later tests positive, public health officials can ping app-carrying phones that came within a certain distance to inform the users of their exposure and ask them to self-isolate for 14 days to prevent further spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Google and Apple <a href="https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/">announced
on April 10 a partnership to develop a similar system</a> for both
Apple and Android phones.</p>



<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936">Enhancing
contact tracing with digital tools could slow, or even stop, COVID-19 outbreaks</a> in many
places, according to a <em>Science</em> study posted online March 31. In
principle, if everyone used an app, individuals could be instantly notified
when someone they contacted tests positive. In such a scenario, contact tracing
would need to be only 50 to 60 percent effective to end an outbreak, the
researchers found. Effectiveness here can refer both to how many contacts
actually self-isolate and how well people do at limiting contact with others.</p>



<p>Timing is key. “The earlier a
contact is traced and self-isolates, the faster you can slow [the epidemic],”
says study coauthor Michelle Kendall, a statistician at the University of Oxford.
If it takes a couple days to notify contacts of a positive case, she says,
contact tracing becomes much less effective as people unwittingly spread the
virus. That means rapid and widely available testing is a must, though Kendall
says that an app-based system that activates when a person reports symptoms
alone can also work.</p>



<p>But technology can’t solve
everything. “An app can ping you and recommend that you self-isolate, but
unless people actually adhere to it, it won’t do anything,” Kendall says.
“You’ve got to have public trust.” </p>



<p>Widespread adoption and adherence
to these kinds of intrusive measures have so far helped South Korea avoid
massive lockdowns. And China is easing some restrictions because it can enforce
quarantines by requiring that residents install location-tracking software. Such
measures will be a tough sell in independence-minded Western cultures, says
Annelies Wilder-Smith, an infectious disease expert at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. </p>



<p>“We need a good communication
strategy that starts now,” she says, to build awareness and buy-in before
systems are in place. Without widespread participation, even the most
advanced technical tools won’t help curb the pandemic.</p>



<p>Even if the public is enthusiastic initially,
buy-in may wane as the pandemic stretches on. In areas with ongoing outbreaks,
it’s not inconceivable that someone could finish one two-week bout of
self-isolation only to be pinged days later that they’ve come into contact with
the virus again. And decisions will need to be made as to what counts as a meaningful contact. If merely walking past someone
on the sidewalk who later gets confirmed with COVID-19 sparks a message to
self-isolate, many may ignore requests. Massachusetts is trying for 15 minutes
of exposure, but will transmission events be missed? Even if a system finds a
sweet spot, people may be exposed multiple times in the coming months, and
asked to self-isolate each time.</p>



<p>That may not seem sustainable, “but right now we’re shooting blindly, and millions of people who don’t need to be quarantined are stuck at home,” Wilder-Smith says. “No solution is perfect, but of all the worst scenarios, strict contact tracing and isolation is the best scenario, and I think that’s how you have to sell it.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spinosaurus-dinosaur-fossil-tail-aquatic-swimmer">Spinosaurus fossil tail suggests dinosaurs were swimmers after all</a></h4>

<p>Sharp-toothed <em>Spinosaurus</em>
didn’t just stand in the shallows to snag fish for dinner; this dinosaur may
have been an excellent swimmer. <em>Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, </em>a new fossil
discovery reveals, had a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2190-3">paddle-shaped tail</a> that may have helped the predator slice through the water with the
grace of a crocodile. </p>



<p>The fossilized tail,
unearthed from 95-million-year-old rocks in Morocco, is the most complete <em>Spinosaurus</em>
tail ever recovered. Its unusual shape suggests that this dinosaur may have
been aquatic — contrary to prevailing wisdom that dinosaurs were solely land dwellers,
researchers report in a study published online April 29 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“It was basically a river
monster,” says Nazir Ibrahim, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of
Detroit Mercy who led the study. </p>



<p>“When I first saw the
illustrations of the tail, I literally giggled with surprise and delight — and
I’m not someone who usually giggles,” says Matthew Lamanna, a vertebrate
paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, who reviewed
the paper for <em>Nature</em>. “The tail was just so awesomely weird-looking for
a predatory dinosaur. I’d never seen anything like it.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="paleontologist sitting on rocky ground" class="wp-image-3087457" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042820_cg_spinosaurus_inline1_680-677x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087457">Paleontologist Diego Mattarelli (shown) sits in Morocco next to two unearthed fossils, pieces of a <em>Spinosaurus</em> tail. The two tail bones (the drumstick-like shapes at right) each show a central, squarish vertebrae with a projecting neural spine. The reconstructed tail revealed that the spines formed a tall paddle shape.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087457">Gabriele Bindellini</span></figure>



<p><em>Spinosaurus</em> was known to have lived near the water and to have
dined on seafood: The animal’s cone-shaped teeth would have been adept at
snagging slippery fish. “But for most people, the model they were more
comfortable with was a wading dinosaur that waited for the fish to swim by,” the
way a grizzly bear may splash into the water to catch a fish, Ibrahim says. </p>



<p>Ibrahim has previously
proposed that <em>Spinosaurus</em> was more than an occasional wader. In a 2014
paper in <em>Science</em>, he and colleagues reported that the creature <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lost-and-found-dinosaur-thrived-water">had denser bones</a> than most other theropods, the branch of predatory dinosaurs that
includes <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> and <em>Allosaurus </em>(<em>SN: 9/11/14</em>).
Denser bones could be an evolutionary adaptation to a more aquatic life,
allowing for greater buoyancy control. </p>





<p>The 2014 study was based on
a fossil discovered in Morocco’s Kem Kem beds in 2008, first partially
recovered by an amateur fossil hunter. Ibrahim’s team returned to the site and
recovered more of the skeleton. After the 2014 paper was published, he went
back again and targeted a large chunk of rock next to the original excavation
site. </p>



<p>“We struck gold,” he says.
Bone after bone emerged, revealing a tail that was nearly 80 percent complete.
That tail contained very long neural spines, bony projections on the vertebrae,
that together formed a tall fin shape, making the tail look like a paddle, he
says. </p>



<p>On the underside of the tail
are a row of v-shaped bones called chevrons, a feature that many dinosaurs
have. In most dinosaurs, chevrons “are fairly long at the base of the tail, and
then get shorter and shorter” toward the tip, Ibrahim says. But in <em>Spinosaurus</em>,
the chevrons remain long until near the tail’s end. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the tail was
surprisingly flexible. Many theropods had stiff, inflexible tails, which helped
the dinosaurs balance their weight on land. But <em>Spinosaurus’</em> tail had a
wide range of movement that allowed it to swing sideways.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="landscape image of southeastern Morrocco" class="wp-image-3087459" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042820_cg_spinosaurus_inline2_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087459">An amateur fossil hunter first recovered pieces of <em>Spinosaurus</em> in 2008, in the Kem Kem region of southeastern Morocco in the Sahara. Nazir Ibrahim and colleagues returned to the site several times, recovering more fossils.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087459">Diego Mattarelli</span></figure>



<p>Whether that movement
translated to the animal propelling itself through water is another question.
Ibrahim and colleagues tested the possible power of <em>Spinosaurus</em>’ tail shape against that of other animals, including
two terrestrial theropods and two modern, semiaquatic animals, a crocodile and
a newt. </p>



<p>Plastic versions of the
different tail shapes were swung back and forth by robotic controllers in a
water tank, while sensors measured the tails’ propulsive power and thrust. The <em>Spinosaurus</em> tail performed nearly as
well as the tails of the semiaquatic animals and far better than the other
dinosaurs’ tails, Ibrahim says.  </p>



<p>That finding suggests that <em>Spinosaurus</em> was able to actively pursue
prey in the water, he adds. “At this point I think it’s the nail in the coffin
of the idea that dinosaurs never invaded the aquatic world.”</p>



<p>It’s also possible, however,
that the extended tail vertebrae were meant for display rather than swimming, notes
Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in
College Park who was not involved in the new study. “But to be fair, those
aren’t mutually exclusive things,” he adds. And when the tail shape is considered
along with other unusual attributes, such as the dinosaur’s dense bones, “there
is a consistent pattern which is certainly suggestive of it being an aquatic
animal.” </p>



<p>If true, that would mark a
paradigm shift in our understanding of dinosaurs, previously thought to exclusively
have been land animals, Holtz says. But there are similar types of exceptions.
“We think of mammals as a terrestrial group, but we have whales and bats,” he says.
</p>



<p>And <em>Spinosaurus</em>’ ancestors had stiffer tails more like those of other theropods, which suggests that the tail shape evolved over time, Holtz says. “It would be interesting to see if there turns out to be a member of <em>Spinosaurus’</em> branch [that lived later] and was even more aquatic. It’s the sort of thing we want to keep our eyes out for.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crazy-beast-fossil-time-dinosaurs-belongs-obscure-mammal-group">A ‘crazy beast’ from the time of dinosaurs belongs to an obscure mammal group</a></h4>

<p>The
ancient mammal <em>Adalatherium hui</em> is so weird that it eluded
classification for over a decade. </p>



<p>A
roughly 70-million-year-old skeleton of the species, uncovered in Madagascar in
1999, was clearly a mammal. But it boasted several distinctly un-mammalian
features, such as a large hole on top of its snout. Also, although the animal’s
forelimbs were aligned with its spine, like a typical mammal, its back legs were
splayed out to the sides like a reptile.</p>



<p>“It is
so strange, compared to any other mammal, living or extinct,” says
paleontologist David Krause, of the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, “it
was just crazy.” Hence the name <em>Adalatherium hui</em>, from a Malagasy word
meaning “crazy” and the Greek word for “beast.”</p>



<p>Now, the
crazy beast finally has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2234-8">identified as a gondwanatherian</a> — an obscure group of mammals that
roamed the Southern Hemisphere during the age of dinosaurs, Krause and
colleagues report online April 29 in<em> Nature</em>. The key to the animal’s
identity was in comparing the skeleton to an intact skull from a different
gondwanatherian species, discovered in 2014 also in Madagascar. The arrangement of bones in
the snout of the skull
matched that of <em>Adalatherium hui</em>, establishing the animals as relatives.
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Adalatherium hui fossil" class="wp-image-3087453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042920_MT_mammal-fossil_inline.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087453">Judging by this fossilized skeleton of <em>Adalatherium hui</em>, “we think it was probably a digging animal, much like a badger,” says paleontologist David Krause of the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science. Badgers spread their hind legs and use their front legs to shoot dirt between them. The splayed hind legs of <em>Adalatherium hui</em> might be good for that. What’s more, Krause says, “badgers have these tiny little stubby tails so it doesn’t get in the way of the dirt flying backward, and <em>Adalatherium hui</em> also has a short, stubby tail.”</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087453">Marylou Stewart</span></figure>



<p>Placing <em>Adalatherium
hui</em> among the gondwanatherians gives new insight into how this enigmatic
group of animals fit into the mammal family tree. Up to 2014, the only other known
traces of gondwanatherians were a handful of teeth and jaws. Given the
historically sparse fossil record for gondwanatherians, “we knew very little
about their anatomy,” and therefore how they were related to other ancient
animals, Krause says. </p>



<p>But the
features of <em>Adalatherium hui</em>’s nearly complete skeleton reveal that it was
closely related to a group of mammals called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/lost-tribe-mammals">multituberculates</a>, which lived in the Northern
Hemisphere during the age of the dinosaurs (<em>SN: 12/14/96</em>). “It’s almost
like we have a southern counterpart to the multituberculates” in the
gondwanatherians, he says. </p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>One of the biggest political challenges of this era is getting powerful people to take the threat of climate change seriously. The most straightforward way to do that would be with bottom-up pressure: if the people who vote demand that their leaders take assertive action against climate change, then politicians will have no choice but to do so (at least if they want to get into office, or to stay there). The major challenge to this, in turn, has been the lingering influence of climate denialism: disbelief in the reality that humans are the cause of climate change, or in the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p>What can be done to combat climate denialism? Back in 2011, the researchers Jonathon P. Schuldt, Sara H. Konrath, and Norbert Schwarz published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776">an article in </a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/1/115/1846776"><em>Public Opinion Quarterly</em></a> which suggested one possible partial remedy: framing the issue a bit differently. They found that 75.0% of Americans expressed belief in “climate change,” but only 67.7% in “global warming.” It was Republicans driving this effect: among this more politically conservative subset of Americans, the difference was 60.2% versus 44.0%.</p>
<p>Those findings suggested that environmental campaigns and policy initiatives might do better if they refer to “climate change” rather than “global warming”, write Alistair Raymond Bryce Soutter and René Mõttus in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376">new paper in the </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494419307376"><em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em></a><em><u>.</u></em> But while some follow-up studies had been conducted on this issue, with fairly mixed results, no one had yet carried out a direct, pre-registered replication. So Soutter and Mõttus attempted to both replicate the original result and expand it to two other countries: the United Kingdom and Australia. (This gave them a total sample size of 5,717, about double that of the original study.)</p>
<p><span id="more-39542"></span>As in the first study, the researchers simply asked respondents about whether they believed in climate change in one of two conditions — one which referred to the climate “changing”, and one which referred to it “warming” (see full wording below). This time around, though, the researchers found no statistically significant difference between the two conditions (88.8% registered agreement that “climate change” was occurring, while 88.0% said “global warming” was.) That pattern repeated itself in the study’s three main subgroups: in neither the US, the UK, nor Australia did word choice matter. Interestingly, and contrary to the original experiment, word choice didn’t matter among political conservatives, either. One aspect of the 2011 finding — unfortunately — was replicated: in all countries, conservatives were less likely than liberals to believe in climate change.</p>
<p>Why the generally different results this time around? The researchers explain that there’s no way to know, but they speculate it could be some combination of causes: one is simply that the American sample was a bit different, politically, with more self-identified Democrats and Republicans and fewer Independents and Others than in the 2011 sample (though it’s hard to imagine that having much of an impact on what had been such a giant-sized effect on Republicans). Perhaps more importantly, the 2011 study drew on data collected in 2009, and “[s]ince then there have been major social, political, and indeed environmental changes.” The terms might simply mean different things to people today than they did back then.</p>
<p>There’s one arguably questionable aspect of the original study’s methodology — and, since it was a direct replication, the follow-up as well — that bears mentioning. Here’s the language presented to the two groups, with the differences bolded by me:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature <strong>may have been changing</strong> over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called <strong>‘climate change’</strong>. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>You may have heard about the idea that the world’s temperature may <strong>have been going up </strong>over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called <strong>‘global warming’</strong>. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?</em></p>
<p>It could be argued that this doesn’t capture exactly what researchers are interested in. What matters is whether and to what extent people agree that the planet is <em>warming</em>, and the first passage doesn’t mention that concept at all due to the fact that <em>two</em> word choices, not just one, are different. So a different rate of agreement with the two statements could just reflect the fact that they are saying two different things — the first is asking the respondent whether the planet’s climate is merely “changing” (up, down, up and then down over time, whatever), while the second specifically points out “warming”. A cleaner test would have mentioned the temperature going up in both conditions, only swapping out “global warming” versus “climate change.”</p>
<p>Setting that aside, this partially failed replication is compatible with belief held by many researchers: when issues become politicised, people cling more tightly to their opinions. It could be that word choice matters more for issues that don’t have much of a bearing on someone’s ideological or social allegiances. But once an idea becomes politicised, it feels threatening to have the ‘wrong’ view on it, which suggests subtle matters like word choice likely matter less. And climate change (or global warming, if you like) has certainly become more politicised since 2009, unfortunately.</p>
<p>All of which suggests that something as minor as word choice is rarely going to nudge people’s beliefs on as contentious an issue as this one.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaping-smoking-heart-cardiovascular-damage">Vaping may damage the heart just as smoking does</a></h4>

<p>Switching from smoking to
vaping may not help with cardiovascular health. </p>



<p>Researchers performed tests
on the vascular systems of more than 400 healthy adults aged 21 to 45. <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014570">Study participants who use cigarettes, e-cigarettes or
both had stiffer arteries</a> than those
who did not smoke or vape, the researchers report online April 29 in the <em>Journal of the American Heart Association</em>.
</p>



<p>That stiffness can damage
small blood vessels and strain the heart, both of which can contribute to the
development of cardiovascular disease, says Jessica Fetterman, a vascular
biologist at Boston University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>Fetterman and colleagues
also collected participant samples of cells lining the blood vessels, and
exposed those cells to a fluorescent dye that detects nitric oxide, a molecule
that dilates blood vessels and helps stop blood from clotting. Cells taken from
smokers and vapers produced less nitric oxide than cells from participants who
did not smoke or vape, a sign that smokers’ and vapers’ blood vessels may not
be functioning normally. </p>



<p>Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death for smokers, and some have suggested that switching to e-cigarettes might prove less harmful to health. Many adults who vape are former smokers, and that was true for the e-cigarette users in this study.  </p>



<p>The study participants who vaped had been doing so for at least three months. Previous research has shown that healthy smokers who quit can see a reduction in the stiffness of their arteries in as little as four weeks. “Our work suggests that the abnormalities in vascular stiffness persist in e-cigarette users,” Fetterman says. “There was no evidence that the use of e-cigarettes reduces cardiovascular injury” associated with smoking combustible cigarettes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hero-shrew-sturdy-spine-mammal">Here’s why a hero shrew has the sturdiest spine of any mammal</a></h4>

<p>At first glance,
hero shrews don’t appear to live up to their name. But these fuzzy, molelike
animals are the Clark Kents of the shrew world, with superpowers hidden beneath
their humble exteriors. Their backbones are like nothing else in the animal
kingdom: the vertebrae interlock, making the spine extremely strong and rigid
when compressed. </p>



<p>Now a 3-D analysis of the bone structure reveals that the <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.0457">vertebrae are exceptionally dense, with neatly reinforcing struts</a> that lend toughness too. That structure may provide insight into how these unique backbones may benefit the animals in nature, researchers report April 28 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em> <em>B</em>. </p>



<p>Two hero shrew species
(<em>Scutisorex</em>) can be found in the palm forests of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. Their strength astonished American and European explorers in the
1910s, when Congo’s local Mangbetu people reportedly demonstrated that an adult
man could step on the animal — only the heft of a deck of cards — without causing
any harm. </p>



<p>“That story may or
may not be apocryphal,” says Stephanie
Smith,
a vertebrate functional morphologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in
Chicago. That particular demonstration “certainly has not been reproduced.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="spines of an African giant shrew and a hero shrew" class="wp-image-3087442" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042820_jb_hero-shrew_inline1_680-544x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087442">The spine of a hero shrew (<em>Scutisorex somereni</em>) features interlocking vertebrae (right), unlike the more typical spine of the African giant shrew (<em>Crocidura olivieri</em>) (left).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087442">S. Smith</span></figure>



<p>The shrew’s backbone is flat on top and underneath, featuring broad side flanges with lots of fingerlike projections. To probe its strength, Smith and museum colleague Kenneth Angielczyk used a 3-D X-ray technique to scan the internal structure of vertebrae from 20 skeletal museum specimens. The skeletons were from both hero shrews and the goliath shrew (<em>Crocidura goliath),</em> which is similar in size to the hero shrew, but with a more standard backbone. The researchers hoped that studying the density and orientation of holes and struts in the spongey interior of the bones would reveal the magnitude and direction of forces the animals might have experienced during their lives. </p>



<p>Compared with
goliath shrews, hero shrews had more, and wider, vertebrae. Internally, the
hero shrews’ vertebrae also featured many reinforcing rodlike structures that
made the spongey bone very dense. These struts were mostly oriented in the
head-to-tail direction, while the goliath shrews’ struts were less aligned with
any given direction, the team reports. </p>





<p>Smith likens the hero
shrews’ backbone to a line of soda cans positioned end to end, with side projections
interlaced like the teeth of two combs. Muscles can contract the spine and lock
the segments in place. </p>



<p>“It makes the unit
more like a single block of bone than regular vertebrae, which are more like
bendy units,” Smith says. These details suggest hero shrews endure forces
that are stronger and possibly more frequent than those experienced by goliath
shrews.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how
this modified spine might have evolved, partly because the animals are
difficult to find and study in the wild. Their spines are also so unique that there
are no comparisons among other animals. Strong backbones may help hero shrews wedge
themselves into the space between dead leaves attached at the base of standing
palm trunks in search of insects or larvae, Smith suggests, though she points
out that this behavior has never been observed. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3087444" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042820_jb_hero-shrew_inline2_680_mobile.png" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087444">A cross section of the sixth lumbar vertebra of a hero shrew taken perpendicularly across the spine reveals the vertebra’s many projections on the left and right sides (shown as an array of small ovals) that can interlace with neighboring vertebrae’s projections upon compression. This turns the spine into a tough, rigid unit rather than a set of bendy segments.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087444">S. Smith</span></figure>



<p>“It’s long been
suspected that hero shrews were doing something that puts their backs under
large compressive forces,” says Katrina
Jones,
an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University. “This [study] is an important
step in understanding this adaptation, given that observing their behavior in
the wild has proved so challenging.”</p>



<p>Smith wants to search
for similarities between the hero shrew’s backbone with those of more shrew
species as well as xenarthrans, a superorder of animals that includes armadillos
and sloths. Some xenarthrans have vertebrae that interlock, though by a
different mechanism and not to the degree seen in hero shrews. It’s
possible similar pressures may have been behind the evolution of the
interlocking spines in both xenarthrans and hero shrews. </p>



<p>“Backbones are an
important part of how animals move, yet we understand surprisingly little about
them,” says Jones. “The hero shrew is a great example of how diverse and
specialized backbones can be, but it also illustrates how much we have yet to
learn about the ecology of living animals.”</p>

He  demanded that reporters be stripped of the <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>“Noble prizes”</b></span> they had  supposedly been awarded for their reporting on Trump scandals,  apparently conflating them with the Pulitzers—and then pretended that  his misspelling of <i>Nobel</i> had been intentional.  <b>...</b>  He retweeted an increasingly wild and weird range of  supporters’ Twitter accounts.</blockquote><br />Trump shows no compassion for the suffering around him, no sympathy for the families devastated by the loss of their loved ones, and only hollow praise for the health care workers, the bus drivers, the home delivery drivers, the grocery store clerks, and the sanitation workers who put their lives on the line every day.<br /><br />Eternal optimists say “we're all in this together” while sitting at home on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/" target="_blank" title="oh boo hoo, 'Zoom Fatigue'">Zoom meetings</a>, placing endless orders on Amazon, and fretting about their sourdough starter.

He also had a murky ailment that made it difficult for him to eat (“his tongue is inflamed” or later, “he has a mass at the base of his tongue”), but the true cause was never confirmed. He was prescribed oral chemotherapy pills three times a week and an <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/steroid-treatment-long-term-effects-in-cats" target="_blank">oral steroid</a> (prednisolone syrup) twice daily. I declined the chemo pills, opting for quality of life for both of us. Max's oral steroid became unworkable after four doses.<br /><br />This was not fair, especially after my wife suffered through Stage 4 cancer for a year. <br /><br />Another vet started bimonthly / monthly injections of Depo-Medrol (<a href="https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/methyl-prednisolone" target="_blank">methyl prednisolone</a>) to reduce the inflammation in his mouth, and as a partial treatment for his lymphoma. It worked wonders (for a while). He ran up and down stairs, played with his toys, and jumped over the red chair!<br /><br />He started getting worse in January. His weight was down to 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg), a 2 lb loss in two months. He was prescribed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine" target="_blank">buprenorphine</a> as needed for pain and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/mirataz-mirtazapine-transdermal-ointment-veterinarians" target="_blank" title="Ha! mirtazapine is an antidepressant for humans that causes -- you guessed it -- weight gain">transdermal mirtazapine</a> as an appetite stimulant.

And then the shelter-in-place orders were issued.<br /><br /><br /><b>Pet Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic</b><br /><br />Max's condition was getting worse. Depo-Medrol was less and less effective, and he needed injections every two weeks. The veterinary practice enacted stringent measures to protect its essential workers. In-person appointments were reserved for animals showing signs of extreme pain and suffering. Virtual Vet was used for consults and for recommending treatment plans. We had an appointment on March 27. Max was prescribed his usual meds. I picked them up curbside (calling upon arrival) and paid via contactless transaction. I watched a helpful <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS815US815&amp;oq=youtube+how+to+give+cat+injection+subcutaneous&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.8839j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> and then administered his subcutaneous injection of Depo-Medrol.<br /><br />By April 16, I had grown desperate. The poor fellow was having a severe bout of diarrhea that lasted for days. I tried scheduling a Virtual Vet appointment and called for a refill of buprenorphine. Finally I got through and picked up more meds the next day. These included oral <a href="https://m.petmd.com/pet-medication/metronidazole" target="_blank" title="chicken flavor!">metronidazole</a>, a hideously bitter and distressing medication that made his mouth foam.<br /><br />He improved slightly. I was up for hours in the middle of the night, trying to coax him to eat. Some "meaty morsels" and "flaked' varieties were palatable for their gravy. I got out the food processor and whirled them into a very soft format, which he mostly rejected. “But you were just licking the gravy off these meaty morsels!” I told him. Finally I came up with a winning concoction. But this was only a palliative interlude before the inevitable.<br /><br />Then I realized I'd established a Palliative Care Unit for my cat.<br /><br />On April 23, I could no longer care for him myself. I brought him to the ER for severe dehydration. He had blood work and an "incidental" ultrasound, neither of which he'd had since his initial diagnosis. The results were devastating. Anemia due to suspected blood loss from his GI tract. Elevated white blood cell count (no surprise). Emerging diabetes mellitus (e.g., glucose in his urine), a known side-effect of steroid treatment. He weighed only 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs).<br /><br />Most concerning was “free fluid in the abdomen and what looks like masses, possibly lymph nodes and fluid distended bowel loops.”  /  “If he does not improve in the next few days to a week, humane euthanasia should be considered given what we know.”<br /><br />I picked him up and brought him home. He hated car rides much more than actual visits to the vet or treatments of any sort. Veterinary staff all loved him. The report from his ER doc even said, “Max is a very good cat.” <br /><br />He was withdrawn for several hours. Then he got over it and sat on my lap in the red chair, purring. Here he is, as beautiful as ever.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="414" data-original-width="720" height="230" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KASN3ZD6cA8/XqeginJHbjI/AAAAAAAANGg/c5TFcbRDOIgNR_8Qa7ENF5cdp8HvSeyMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Max%2Bon%2Bred%2Bchair%2BApr%2B23%2B2020.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />The change in Max from that day to the next was astounding. He couldn't  hold his head up any more. He tried to drink some water but couldn't manage to do it. I don't think  any additional intervention would have improved his condition. I  didn't want to wait any longer and had to act quickly.<br /><br />I was fortunate  to find a caring and compassionate vet who made house calls, and wasn't  ridiculously overboard on COVID-19 restrictions.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-strummed-molecule-chemical-bonds-like-guitar-strings">Scientists ‘strummed’ a molecule’s chemical bonds like guitar strings</a></h4>

<p>Like plucking a tiny guitar string,
scientists have “strummed” chemical bonds.</p>



<p>Plucking the bonds, which connect two
carbon atoms separated by just 140 billionths of a millimeter, required a
minuscule “pick.” A single molecule of carbon monoxide attached to the
extremely thin tip of an atomic force microscope <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/8d07aY85A271206643216a00a4c5faaf9dcf91725">did the trick</a>,
researchers report in a paper accepted in <em>Physical
Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Atomic force microscopes image materials
by measuring the forces a material exerts on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-seek-materials-defy-friction-atomic-level">microscope’s slender tip</a>, which is scanned across the surface (<em>SN: 8/1/19</em>). Physicist Jay Weymouth and
colleagues used such a microscope to study molecules of perylenetetracarboxylic
dianhydride, or PTCDA. They were chosen for their flat shape, which allows them
to be laid on a surface for inspection. The researchers oscillated the atomic
force microscope’s tip back and forth over the surface, measuring how fast the
tip jiggled and how much energy was required to keep it moving. </p>



<p>When the microscope tip was dragged over
a bond, more energy was required to keep the tip jiggling. That’s because the
carbon monoxide tip flexed upward due to the forces exerted on the tip by the
bond and the attached atoms, before snapping back down on the other side of the
bond. Because forces in physics come in “equal and opposite” pairs, the force
on the microscope tip means that the tip likewise exerted a force on the atoms
and the bond. That force from the tip, the researchers say, is akin to strumming
the bond. </p>



<p>Investigating chemical bonds in this way could help atomic force microscopes better characterize molecules. “It’s a new way to look at these chemical bonds,” says Weymouth, of Universität Regensburg in Germany.</p>

<br /><p><a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora 32</a> was released today after a full six
months of development. There are a lot of improvements and new changes included
in this release. You can read the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-32-2/">announcement here</a> and the complete
release notes <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f32">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release is particularly exciting for the NeuroFedora team. It also marks
the first release of our first deliverable: the CompNeuro Lab ISO image! The
aim of developing such ready to install ISO images that are packed with the
necessary tools is to enable users to quickly set up their computers and get
down to work, instead of wasting precious time and effort on installing tools
individually by hand. While we hope that this will enable researchers by
providing them easy access to Free/Open Source research tools, we also hope
that the platform will serve as a teaching aid in Computational Neuroscience
courses.</p>

<p>All of these tools have been built with the current best practices in Software
Development in mind---this is mandated by the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/">Fedora community's software
packaging guidelines</a>. In addition to
modelling tools, the ISO image also includes multiple tools used in analysis of
data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the complete <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scipy.org/">Python science stack</a>: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, IPython, SymPy, and Pandas,</li>

</ul>
<p>This is not all, though! There's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/software/">even more Neuroscience software</a> that can be
installed from the repositories. Also, since this edition is derived from
Fedora, users have access to the <em>complete</em> set of packages that are included
in Fedora: all the <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org/">desktop environments</a>,
productivity tools, development tools, and libraries that you can choose from.</p>
<p>The CompNeuro ISO image is based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/">Fedora Workstation</a> product that uses the modern <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME
desktop environment</a>.  It provides a clean interface
integrated with a plethora of daily use productivity and development tools:</p>

<br /><p>If GNOME isn't to your liking, though, there are other options. You can install
any <a class="reference external" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org">Fedora "spin"</a> and install the
software you need there also. Whatever you choose, you'll be ready to work in
no time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>download a Fedora image,</li>
<li>install the tools you need,</li>
<li>get to work!</li>
</ul>

<p>Developing NeuroFedora is also a great learning experience, especially for
students. As a volunteer based community project, we learn skills and tools
together and share knowledge freely with each other. No skills or experience
are necessary to join the community. You can find what you want to do, and
gather the required knowledge as you go at your own pace. We strongly encourage
students to join the team, contribute their bit, and learn more about the tools
use in Neuroscience while they do it.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear from you. Please get in touch.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Our memories are not always reliable. But sometimes they’re rich, textured and vivid — even if they didn’t happen. Research has suggested false memories <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.993&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">often have the descriptive, multisensory elements of real memories</a>, a fact that obviously poses both interesting questions about memory itself and difficulties for those relying on eyewitness encounters for evidence.</p>
<p>But beyond the question of <em>how </em>people remember is another quandary: are we, as observers, able to tell whether someone’s memory is true or false? It’s a question tackled by UCL’s Julia Shaw <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00650/full">in a new study</a> published in <em>Frontiers in Psychology —</em> and she finds that not only are we susceptible to having memories planted, we’re not very good at working out when someone else’s memory is false either.</p>
<p><span id="more-39534"></span>Shaw has worked on false memory and our susceptibility to it before. In 2015, she co-authored a paper that claimed to have successfully implanted false memories of having committed a crime in 70% of participants; these crimes ranged from petty theft to the much more serious assault with a weapon. Videos of these participants recalling true and false memories formed the stimuli for the new work.</p>
<p>(It’s important to note that the findings from Shaw’s 2015 study have been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/15/psychologists-clash-over-how-easy-it-is-to-implant-false-memories-of-committing-a-crime/">subject to much debate</a>, with some psychologists arguing that the coding scheme used in the study led to wildly inflated results. However, all videos of false memories included in <em>this</em> paper were also classified as false memories in a re-analysis by critics.)</p>
<p>In the first study, 124 participants saw videos of someone recalling both a real and a false memory of events that had (supposedly) happened during their adolescence. In one condition, participants saw the person recalling an emotive false memory (e.g. being attacked by an animal, being bullied or the death of a parent) while in the other condition, the false memory related to committing a crime (e.g. an assault with a weapon). Participants were told before watching the videos that “all, some, or none of the videos” involved memories of real accounts. Afterwards they were told one memory was real and one was false, and were asked to identify which was the false one.</p>
<p>In the second study, participants were shown the same videos <em>—</em> only this time, one set of participants watched the video with sound, one listened just to the audio, and a final set watched the video without audio.</p>
<p>The results suggest that participants are not better than chance at classifying false memories <em>—</em> about 57% of false memories were identified in the first study, and only 44% in the second. Numbers were similar across conditions: criminal false memories were identified 55% of the time in study one and 44% in study two. In study two, accuracy was highest when participants were given video with audio (53% accuracy) and worst with just audio (32%) .</p>
<p>Shaw argues that the study’s results demonstrate that false memories look real to an observer: even though participants knew that one memory was false and one was true, they were still unable to accurately tell the difference.</p>
<p>This could have serious implications for judges, police officers, lawyers and others involved with gathering evidence and interviewing eyewitnesses. Shaw <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/apr/false-memories-crime-appear-real-when-retold-others">points to judges in particular</a>, who should “never assume they can tell when someone has a false memory … and should consider the entire process to see if there was any risk of contamination of a defendant or witness’ memories.”</p>
<p>The results should almost be beside the point <em>—</em> judges, lawyers and police officers should <em>already</em> try to assume they can’t always tell whether someone’s memory is accurate or not. So it will be interesting to see exactly how these findings are taken by legal and law enforcement officials. Memory, for better or worse, is a key part of evidence; being cautious before we make any firm conclusions about it may be vital to ensuring that evidence is as watertight as possible.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">What coronavirus antibody tests tell us — and what they don’t</a></h4>

<p>As some countries begin to reopen in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, experts are racing to ramp up the development and use of blood tests that pinpoint people who have been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 and are no longer infected. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-how-antibody-blood-tests-work">tests detect antibodies</a>, proteins made by the immune system to fight
infection (<em>SN: 3/27/20</em>). People who
carry antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, have been
infected previously, even if they didn’t know it. For those people, discovering that
they have these virus-fighting antibodies could raise hopes of immunity and a
return to normal life. </p>



<p>But scientists are also
working to uncover what these blood tests really tell us. At this point,
there isn’t enough evidence to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19">confirm that recovered
people are protected</a> from the disease and, if so, for how long, the World Health
Organization said in a statement on April 24. So people hoping for that assurance
may be disappointed. </p>



<p>For researchers and
public health officials, though, the tests can reveal the true extent of the
pandemic. The U.S. National Institutes of Health announced April 10 that
researchers had <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-begins-study-quantify-undetected-cases-coronavirus-infection">begun recruiting people for a nationwide study</a> that aims to test as many as 10,000 volunteers
without an official COVID-19 diagnosis, which could help clarify how many
people across the country have actually been infected. A number of similar,
more local studies are also under way.</p>





<p>The goal is to fill in
the gaps created by trouble rolling out diagnostic tests, which detect the
virus’s genetic material and can catch an active infection. Those tests have
faced roadblocks such as flawed tests and supply shortages, leaving some sick people
wondering whether their symptoms were from COVID-19 or a different respiratory
infection. </p>



<p>Such tests can’t detect the virus once the infection has cleared. But antibodies typically stick around in the body after the virus has disappeared, giving scientists a glimpse into the past. So for people who weren’t able to get a diagnostic test, the antibody test “will give us the ability to let them know yes, you did have COVID-19,” says Aneesh Mehta, an infectious disease physician at Emory University in Atlanta.</p>



<p>Knowing how many people
have already been exposed to the virus is also a step toward understanding<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end"> when the pandemic might end</a> (<em>SN:
3/24/20</em>). High numbers of immune people can protect the population as a
whole from outbreaks, creating what’s called herd immunity. Researchers
estimate that around one-third to two-thirds of a population would need to be
infected with SARS-CoV-2 to reach herd immunity.  </p>





<h4>Positive or negative</h4>



<p>For an individual, an antibody
test result isn’t black and white: exposed or not exposed, immune or not immune.
 </p>



<p>This is in part because
antibody tests are not 100 percent accurate, says Angela Rasmussen, a
virologist at Columbia University. “They don’t accurately detect every single
antibody, and they may have both false positives and false negatives.” </p>



<p>In the tests, a small sample
of a patient’s blood is taken and exposed to proteins that match parts of the
virus. If any antibodies specific to the coronavirus are present, they should
recognize and bind to the virus components. Such antibodies might attach to any of a variety of places on the virus — including spots that are similar among closely-related viruses. As a result, researchers have to carefully
choose which part of the new coronavirus to use. </p>



<p>The tests usually detect
two types of antibodies. One, called IgM, is typically produced about a week after
infection and could identify patients who may still be infected.Levels of IgM begin to wane as the
body makes another type of antibody
called IgG, which can persist for longer periods of time. </p>



<p>The best antibody tests
are both highly sensitive — detecting a wide range of IgM or IgG antibodies that
recognize different parts of a viral protein — and highly specific, meaning the
detected antibodies are for only that virus. Coronaviruses that cause colds,
for example, also circulate around the globe. Antibody tests with low
specificity and high sensitivity might detect antibodies against cold viruses
and give a false positive. But a test with high specificity and low sensitivity
could miss antibodies, resulting in a false negative. Timing is also crucial,
as patients who have not been infected long enough to develop antibodies would
test negative.    </p>



<p>Though coronavirus
antibody tests have flooded the market, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
has so far <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations">authorized just eight for emergency use</a>. Based on data the tests’ developers provided to
the FDA, the sensitivity and specificity of the tests vary widely, from 88 to
100 percent for sensitivity and 90 to 100 percent for specificity.  </p>



<p>In addition, “certain
people just don’t make as much antibody as other people do and don’t respond
the same to an infection,” Mehta says. “There will be some people that had the
infection, but we won’t be able to detect them.”</p>



<h4>Immune or not</h4>



<p>Even if the tests are
accurate, immunity is not a given. The tests being rolled out now look only for
the presence or absence of antibodies, not how effective those particular
antibodies are at knocking out the virus. And like antibody levels, that can
vary from person to person. </p>



<p>“We need to look at
people who do have antibody — and that does seem to be the majority of
patients — and see if that antibody is protective,” Rasmussen says. </p>

<p>In one cluster of
COVID-19 patients from China, most people produced <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1.full.pdf">high levels of neutralizing antibodies</a> that prevent the virus from infecting new cells,
according to a preliminary report posted April 6 at medRxiv.org before peer
review. Of 175 patients with mild symptoms, about 70 percent developed
antibodies around 10 days after symptoms began. Among those, elderly and
middle-aged people had the highest levels. </p>



<p>Younger patients tended
to have lower levels overall, including 10 people who didn’t have any
detectable antibodies. But it’s possible that those 10 people developed antibodies
that recognized a different viral protein than the one used in the test, producing
a false negative result. It could also mean that a different arm of the immune
system —
one that targets infected cells and doesn’t leave behind antibodies — may play
a heavy hand in recovery.    </p>



<p>If researchers find particularly effective antibodies, they could be
used to develop treatments, such as producing lab-made antibodies or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-can-plasma-recovered-patients-treat-sick">giving plasma from
recovered patients</a> to those that are sick (<em>SN:
4/3/20</em>).    </p>



<h4>Long-term protection</h4>



<p>It’s unclear what antibody levels provide the best defense. </p>



<p>“It’s very hard to protect the nose from being reinfected,” says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon
Health and Science University in Portland. People with lower antibody levels
could be more at risk for reinfection, he says, “but you might also be able to
still ramp up a rapid [immune] response” and prevent the virus from spreading
deeper into the lungs.  </p>



<p>But even people with protective
antibodies aren’t necessarily “bulletproof,” Slifka says. Some people
may be completely protected against infection, a state known as sterilizing
immunity, which is hard to achieve. Others may get infected again, but have
mild or no symptoms. </p>



<p>Anecdotal reports from South Korea and China of patients who tested
positive after recovering have suggested that some people could be reinfected. But
nasal and throat swabs from 12 of these “reinfected” COVID-19 patients <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3081194/south-korean-patients-who-test-positive-reactivated">had no infectious
viruses</a>
despite testing positive for the virus’s genetic material, officials from the
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a news briefing on
April 23. It’s possible the diagnostic test is detecting lingering fragments of
the coronavirus as it is cleared from the body rather than a reinfection. </p>



<p>When two rhesus macaques were infected, allowed to recover and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1">then exposed to the virus again</a>, they weren’t reinfected, according to preliminary findings posted March 14 at bioRxiv.org. That hints that at least in the short term, people may be protected. To know for sure, “we would have to follow recovered COVID-19 patients who are antibody-positive for a long period of time and see if any of them become infected again,” Rasmussen says.</p>



<p>Researchers also don’t know how long SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stick
around. Some viruses, such as measles, can <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa066092">trigger protection that lasts</a> a lifetime. Defenses
against other viruses can wane over time. Studies suggest that protection against
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2271881/">coronaviruses that
cause the cold</a> can last for about a year. Antibodies for the original SARS virus,
on the other hand, <a href="http://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/12/7264">slowly vanished</a> over a few years.
Since SARS no longer infects people, it’s unclear whether a lack of antibodies
means lack of protection. And because the new coronavirus has been infecting people
for only a few months, it’s still unknown whether it will behave similarly.</p>



<p>Despite the unknowns surrounding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2, some
countries including the United States are considering using antibody tests as a
stepping stone to provide so-called “immunity certificates” to people who test
positive that would allow them to reenter society or return to work. Some
experts, however, are skeptical. </p>



<p>“We don’t know that having antibodies necessarily means you’re
immune, so it could give people a false sense of security about how safe they
are,” Rasmussen says. </p>



<p>And, according to the WHO, that could increase the risks that the
virus will continue to spread. </p>

<p>Among
patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in China comes the first evidence
that some may suffer long-term lung damage from the disease.</p>



<p>In 70
patients who survived COVID-19 pneumonia, 66 had <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200843">some level of lung damage</a> visible in CT scans taken before
hospital discharge, researchers report March 19 in <em>Radiology</em>. The damage ranged from dense clumps of hardened tissue
blocking blood vessels within the tiny air sacs called alveoli, which absorb
oxygen, to tissue lesions around the alveoli, Yuhui Wang, a radiologist at
Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and colleagues
found.</p>



<p>The tissue lesions can be a sign of chronic lung disease. Similar
damage has been documented in survivors of SARS and MERS, respiratory diseases caused
by coronaviruses similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus behind COVID-19. Long-term
studies of SARS patients have shown that roughly a third of people who
recovered from severe bouts were left with permanent lung damage. In the case
of MERS, one study found about a third of people who recovered from a serious
infection still had signs of lung damage about seven months later.</p>



<p>But while initial lung images indicate that SARS and MARS
typically set into just one lung, COVID-19 appears to be more likely to afflict
both lungs right away. In 75 of the 90 patients
admitted to Huazhong University Hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia from January
16 to February 17, damage was seen across both lungs, Wang and colleagues
report. CT scans taken before hospital discharge revealed that 42 out of 70 patients
displayed the type of lesions around the alveoli that are more likely to
develop into scars.</p>

<p>Given how widely the pandemic has spread, chronic lung
conditions from COVID-19 could challenge many thousands of people in years to
come. As
of April 27, more than 2.9 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with
the disease. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-new-wuhan-coronavirus-stacks-up-against-sars-mers">In
comparison</a>, SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, sickened about
8,000 people during its 2003–2004 outbreak. MERS, or Middle East
respiratory syndrome, has infected more than 2,500 people (<em>SN: 1/24/20</em>). While an estimated 80 percent of COVID-19 cases are
mild, the rest display <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-coronavirus-spread-reach-u-s-communities-cdc">problems
ranging from breathing difficulties to respiratory failure</a> (<em>SN: 2/25/20</em>).</p>



<p>Some lung damage seen in the Wuhan study cases are likely to
gradually heal or disappear, Wang and colleagues suspect. However, in some
patients, lung abnormalities will harden into layers of scar tissue known as
pulmonary fibrosis. That scarring stiffens the lungs, making it hard to get
enough oxygen. People with pulmonary fibrosis typically suffer shortness of
breath, limiting their ability to be physically active. </p>







<p>Certain patients are most at risk of developing this type of
scarring. They include elderly patients who’ve had severe bouts of COVID-19 pneumonia,
patients with other illnesses such as cancer or diabetes and those with other lung
conditions caused by smoking or pollution, says Xiaolong Qi of the First
Hospital of Lanzhou University in China, where another COVID-19 lung damage
study is under way.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102583/">A hyperactive
immune response may be to blame</a> for scarring.
A sudden storm of molecules called cytokines causes inflammation that can
damage lung tissue and fill the alveoli with pus. In the worst cases, damage
from this inflammation is so severe that it eventually leaves thickened scar
tissue in honeycomb-shaped clusters — something also seen in SARS and MERS.
While it’s unclear whether any of the Wuhan patients had such severe damage,
it’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-020-05990-y">been
described</a> in other COVID-19 cases.</p>



<p>Breathing with the help of a ventilator can also cause lung
damage, and it may be difficult to tell which patients’ injuries stem from a
dysfunctional immune response to the virus versus being on ventilator, says radiologist
Karuna Das of United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain. Having studied MERS
patients, Das is now investigating the long-term health impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>“During the MERS outbreak, some patients were on ventilators
for more than 100 days,” he says. “Oxygen is being infused with positive
pressure, and when the lungs get inflated beyond their limits, it causes
trauma.” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5644332/">About
a third of MERS patients</a> who suffered lung damage had not fully recovered
more than seven months on, Das and colleagues reported in 2017 in the <em>Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging</em>.</p>



<p>Long-term outcomes for SARS survivors also suggest some
COVID-19 patients may face lasting lung problems. Researchers at a Beijing
hospital found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5">the
percentage of lung lesions</a> across 71 patients changed little between 2004
and 2018, as reported February 14 in <em>Bone
Research</em>.</p>



<p>“Based on what we have seen from SARS, MERS and H1N1 influenza, we expect that at least some COVID-19 patients will have some residual disease,” says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, a radiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He and coauthors review <a href="https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.20.22969">lessons from SARS and MERS</a> in the May <em>American Journal of Roentgenology</em>. Some survivors, he says, will have “some residual fibrosis, scars and their lung function and their lung anatomy doesn’t go back to normal.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS is part of a group of publishers supporting a rapid review initiative for COVID-19 research. We are also co-signing an Open Letter of Intent: a call for all of us in the community – publishers, editors, reviewers, and authors – to help make the peer review process as efficient as possible during this time. The Open Letter of Intent is available here </span><a href="https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , but is also reproduced in full below:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">27 April, 2020</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new urgency to openly and rapidly share and review COVID-19 research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, a group of publishers and scholarly communications organizations, are committing to work together on a cross-publisher rapid review and review transfer initiative. With the endorsement of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) we are making the following calls to reviewers, editors, authors, and publishers in the research community, in order to maximize the efficiency and speed of the triage and peer review process of COVID-19 research.</span></p>
<p><strong>To reviewers and authors:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on volunteer reviewers with suitable expertise relevant to COVID-19 from all career stages and disciplines, including those from industry, to sign up to a “rapid reviewer pool” and commit to rapid reviewing times, along with an upfront agreement  that their reviews and identity can be shared among publishers and journals if submissions get rerouted. Please sign up in this </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7MILluJtO9xV2QXznWVd66UQU4puow4wSk7iwLz7iYcykfA/viewform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on volunteer reviewers (whether or not they have signed up for rapid review) to identify and highlight important and crucial COVID-19 preprints (e.g. by using </span><a href="https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as early as possible, to optimise the limited time of expert reviewers who are subsequently invited to review the most important and promising research by a journal/platform.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on authors to support reviewers and publishers in this endeavour by ensuring the deposition of their submission as a preprint, and by working with publishers to make the peer-reviewed article and associated dataset, software, and model available for reuse as rapidly as possible.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To publishers and editors:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on all publishers to actively facilitate posting of COVID-19 preprints to preprint servers with the agreement of the authors, if authors have not already posted a preprint. This should be after confirming the submission warrants further review. (It is understood preprint servers are also doing their own checks and triage.)  Preprint servers include, but are not limited to </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arXiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSF Preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://preprints.scielo.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SciELO Preprints etc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on research scope.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on all publishers and editors to consider comments on preprints during the journal peer-review process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We call on all publishers to ensure all COVID-19 submissions include a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data availability statement, if they do not already do this for all submissions. </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers should aim to facilitate the stewardship of </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAIR data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and software code sharing underlying prioritised COVID-19 papers (and associated preprints) during the pandemic by working with </span><a href="https://fairsharing.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAIRsharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Research Data Alliance and Force11 via the joint </span><a href="https://rd-alliance.org/group/fairsharing-registry-connecting-data-policies-standards-databases.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RDA/Force11  FAIRsharing Working Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (e.g. providing recommendations to appropriate repositories and use of relevant data and metadata standards).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This call is in addition to supporting these Wellcome Trust-coordinated calls: “</span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/open-data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing research data and findings relevant to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and “</span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers make coronavirus (COVID-19) content freely available and reusable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></p>

<p>Women’s reputation as nurturing homebodies who left warfare to men in long-ago societies is under attack. Skeletal evidence from <a href="https://meeting.physanth.org/program/2020/session42/broehl-2020-women-warriors-among-central-california-hunter-gatherers.html">hunter-gatherers</a> in what’s now California and from herders in Mongolia suggests that women warriors once existed in those populations.</p>



<p>Two research teams had planned to present these findings
April 17 at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical
Anthropologists. That meeting was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The
results have been provided to <em>Science
News</em> by the scientists.</p>



<p>Sexual divisions of labor characterized ancient societies,
but were not as rigidly enforced as has often been assumed, the new studies
suggest. “The traditional view [in anthropology] of ‘man the hunter and woman
the gatherer’ is likely flawed and overly simplistic,” says forensic
anthropologist Marin Pilloud of the University of Nevada, Reno.</p>



<p>Consider hunter-gatherers who lived in central California as
early as around 5,000 years ago as well as more recent Native Americans groups
in that region, such as Coast Miwok and Yana. Some archaeological evidence as
well as historical accounts and 20th century anthropologists’ descriptions
generally portray men in those groups as hunters, fishers and fighters in tribal
feuds and conflicts with outside armies. Women are presented as focused on gathering
and preparing plant foods, weaving and child care.</p>





<p>But skeletons of 128 of those hunter-gatherer women display
damage from arrows and sharp objects such as knives comparable to skeletal
injuries of 289 presumed male warriors, Pilloud and her colleagues found. Whether
those women fought alongside men or carried out other dangerous battle duties,
such as sneaking up on enemies to cut their bow strings, can’t be determined
from their bones. Individuals in this sample came from 19 Native American
groups in central California, and had lived in any of five time periods between
around 5,000 and 200 years ago.</p>



<p>Evidence analyzed by Pilloud’s team was part of a database
of excavated skeletal remains from more than 18,000 central California
hunter-gatherers assembled by study coauthor Al Schwitalla of Millennia
Archaeological Consulting in Sacramento. A 2014 study directed by Schwitalla
determined that 10.7 percent of males in the database <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416513000603">had
suffered injuries from sharp objects and projectile points</a>, versus 4.5
percent of females. The new study finds similar patterns of those injuries on
the skeletons of men and women.</p>



<p>In wars between Native American tribes in California, women
were often killed in surprise raids and other attacks, which may partly explain
female injuries reported in the new study, says biological anthropologist
Patricia Lambert of Utah State University in Logan.</p>



<p>Some women may have fought in battles, either to defend
their children or village or as warriors, suggests Lambert, who was not part of
Pilloud’s team. But further evidence of female fighters, such as Native
American women in California buried with weapons and other battle artifacts, is
needed, she says.</p>



<p>A second skeletal analysis suggests that nomadic herders in
ancient Mongolia, bordering northern China, trained some women to be warriors during
a time of political turbulence and frequent conflicts known as the Xianbei
period, says anthropologist Christine Lee of California State University, Los Angeles.
The Xianbei period ran from 147 to 552.</p>



<p>In a study of nine individuals buried in a high-status
Mongolian tomb from the Xianbei period, conducted by Lee and Cal State
colleague Yahaira Gonzalez, two of three women and all six men displayed signs
of having ridden horses in combat. </p>



<p>That conclusion rests on three lines of evidence: bone
alterations caused by frequent horse riding and damage from falls off horses;
upper-body signatures of having regularly used bows to shoot arrows, including
alterations of spots where shoulder and chest muscles attach to bone; and arrowhead
injuries to the face and head. Because the tomb was previously looted, any
war-related objects that may have been interred with the bodies are gone.</p>



<p>In western Asia, archaeologists have uncovered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/golden-fleece-myth-was-based-real-events-geologists-contend">potential
graves of women warriors</a> that include weapons and war gear (<em>SN: 11/25/14</em>).</p>



<p>By around 900, written documents refer to Mongolian women
who fought in wars, held political power and had diplomatic credentials, Lee
says. Freedom for Mongolian women to pursue a variety of activities goes back
at least to the Xianbei period, she suspects.</p>



<p>Lee now plans to look for skeletal evidence of female
warriors in more Mongolian tombs dating to as early as around 2,200 years ago.</p>



<p>“Badass women may go back a long way in northern Asian nomadic groups,” she says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Though it may vary based on context or mood, most of us have a fairly steady belief in how intelligent we think we are. Whether that belief is in any way accurate or even helpful is a different questio<span>n</span><span> — one 2019 study found that </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/">people who were happier to admit they don’t know something actually had better general knowledge</a><span>, whilst a survey from the year before found that the </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/">majority of Americans believed they were smarter than average</a><span>. We’re also susceptible to the same foibles when it comes to those close to us, tending to </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/04/your-romantic-partner-is-probably-less-intelligent-than-you-think-suggests-new-study/">rate our romantic partners as more intelligent than they actually are</a><span>. </span></p>
<p>But how early do our ideas about our own intelligence start, and how do they relate to other facets of our personality? In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new research published in </a><em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920301677?dgcid=rss_sd_all">Personality and Individual Differences</a>,</em> Marcin Zajenkowski looks at just that.</p>
<p><span id="more-39531"></span></p>
<p>The way we perceive our intelligence seems to have an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976">important</a><u><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656618302976"> effect on both academic achievement and how we feel about ourselves</a></u>. Though studies have largely focused on adults, Zajenkowski argues that this is also likely to be the case amongst teenagers, too, where some evidence has already suggested that self-perceived ability in Maths and English is correlated with actual achievement.</p>
<p>First, Zajenkowski asked 428 teenagers aged between 15 and 17 to rate their own intelligence compared to other people on a scale from 1 (very low) to 25 (very high). Next, they completed a test of objective intelligence which measured abstract and non-verbal reasoning.</p>
<p>Participants also completed a measure of the Big Five personality traits, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory was used to assess grandiose narcissism: participants rated themselves on 34 statements such as “I have a natural talent for influencing people” and “I will be a success”. Finally, participants rated their life satisfaction, rating how much they agreed or disagreed with sentiments including “in most ways my life is close to my ideal”.</p>
<p>Zajenkowski found that teenagers with higher levels of narcissism and those who scored higher on the “intellect” personality trait tended to make higher assessments of their own intelligence. These participants also showed greater levels of life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Gender also played a part, with male students scoring significantly higher than female students on self-assessed intelligence, as well as narcissism, extraversion and life satisfaction. But, importantly, there was no gender difference in <em>objective </em>intelligence.</p>
<p>This mirrors what had already been found in adult populations (one researcher dubbed it the “male hubris, female humility” effect). It’s not clear when in development self-assessed intelligence starts to become associated with gender, though studies looking at only slightly younger children have found no gendered difference.</p>
<p>But unlike in studies on adults, there was no correlation between self-assessed intelligence and objective intelligence. Zajenkowski argues that this may be down to the way objective intelligence was measured: the test used in this study looked at abstract thinking, and  previous research has suggested that people may not see this kind of thinking as an aspect of intelligence until they’re of university age. Teenagers, therefore, may not value it or even see it as a facet of intelligence.</p>
<p>It could therefore be useful to include a wider range of IQ tests in future work. Firstly, this could provide a more comprehensive picture of intellect with which to compare self-assessed intelligence; secondly, it may be a better fit when it comes to how teenagers perceive what intelligence actually means.</p>
<p>Effort must also be made by educators and families to ensure that girls are just as confident and sure in their abilities and intelligence as boys. Not only might this increase well-being, it could disrupt negative gender stereotypes as it does so.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/caves-france-dinosaur-prints-paleontology">Deep caves are a rich source of dinosaur prints for this paleontologist</a></h4>

<p>Crawling through tight underground passages in
southern France, paleontologist Jean-David Moreau and his colleagues have to descend
500 meters below the surface to reach the only known footprints of long-necked dinosaurs
called sauropods ever found in a
natural cave.</p>



<p>The team discovered the prints, left by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossils-are-redefining-what-makes-dinosaur">behemoths
related to <em>Brachiosaurus</em></a><em>, </em>in Castelbouc Cave
in December 2015 (<em>SN: 2/21/18</em>). But
getting to the site might make even the most hardened field scientists balk. Wriggling
through such dark, damp and cramped spaces every time they visit is challenging
for elbows and knees, and even trickier when carrying delicate equipment such
as cameras, lights and laser scanners. </p>



<p>It’s both physically exhausting and “not comfortable
for someone claustrophobic,” with the researchers spending up to 12 hours
underground each time, says Moreau, of the Université
Bourgogne Franche-Comté in Dijon. It can be dangerous too, as some parts of the
cave are periodically flooded, so accessing the deep chambers must be limited
to periods of drought, he says. </p>



<p>Moreau has studied fossilized dinosaur footprints and
plants for more than a decade in southern France’s Causses Basin, one of the
richest areas for aboveground dinosaur tracks in Europe. When spelunkers
chanced upon some underground prints in 2013, Moreau and his colleagues realized
there could be lots of dinosaur prints within the region’s many deep, limestone
caves. Footprints left in soft mud or sand hundred million years ago could have
been turned to rock and forced underground over many eons. </p>





<p>And deep caves, being less exposed to wind and rain, “can
occasionally offer larger and better-preserved surfaces [imprinted by dinosaur
steps] than outdoor outcrops,” Moreau says. </p>



<p>Moreau’s team is the only one to have discovered dinosaur footprints in
natural caverns, though prints also have been found around the world in human-made
railway tunnels and mines. “The discovery of dinosaur tracks inside a natural
karstic cave is extremely rare,” he says. </p>



<p>The first subsurface dinosaur prints that the team found
were 20 kilometers away from Castelbouc at a site called Malaval Cave, reached
via an hour-long clamber through an underground river with several 10-meter
drops. “One of the main difficulties in the Malaval Cave is to walk taking care
to not touch or break any of the delicate and unique [mineral formations],” Moreau
says. </p>



<p>Those three-toed prints, each up to 30 centimeters long and <a href="https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/ijs/vol47/iss1/3/">detailed
in 2018</a> in the <em>International Journal of Speleology</em>, were left by carnivorous
dinosaurs walking upright on their hind legs through marshland about 200
million years ago. </p>

<p>In contrast, the five-toed herbivore tracks in Castelbouc Cave are each
up to 1.25 meters long and were left by three enormous herbivorous sauropods
that walked the shoreline of a sea about 168 million years ago. What’s more, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02724634.2019.1728286">these prints
are on the cave’s ceiling</a> 10 meters above the floor, the team reports in a
study published online March 25 in <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em>. </p>



<p>In fact, “the tracks we see on the roof are not ‘footprints,’ they are
‘counterprints,’” Moreau explains. “The dinosaurs walked on a surface of clay,
which is nowadays totally eroded to form the cave. Here, we only see the
overlying layer [of sediment that filled in the footprints],” leaving reverse
prints bulging out of the ceiling. It’s similar to what you’d see if you filled
a footprint in mud with plaster and then washed all of the mud away to leave
the cast.</p>



<p>The tracks are important as they hail from a time in the early to mid-Jurassic
Period from 200 million to 168 million years ago when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/long-necked-monsters-roamed-more-scotlands-lochs">sauropods
were diversifying and spreading across the world</a>, but relatively few
fossil bones have been found (<em>SN: 12/1/15</em>).
These prints confirm that sauropods then inhabited coastal or wetland environments
in what is now southern France.</p>



<p>Moreau is now leading researchers in exploring “another deep and long cave, which has yielded hundreds of dinosaur footprints,” he says. The team has yet to publish those results, which he says may prove to be the most exciting of all.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balanced-literacy-phonics-teaching-reading-evidence">It’s time to stop debating how to teach kids to read and follow the evidence</a></h4>

<p>On a chilly Tuesday back in January, my 7-year-old son’s classroom in Minneapolis was humming with reading activities. At their desks, first- and second-graders wrote on worksheets, read independently and did phonics lessons on iPads. In the hallway, students took turns playing a dice game that challenged them to spell out words with a consonant-vowel-consonant structure, like <em>wig</em> or <em>map</em>.</p>



<p>In another part of the classroom, small groups of two or three children, many missing their two front teeth, took turns sitting on a color-block carpet with teacher Patrice Pavek. In one group, Pavek asked students to read out loud from a list of words. “Con-fess,” said a dimpled 7-year-old named Hazel, who sat cross-legged in purple boots and a black fleece. Pavek reminded Hazel that a vowel sound in the middle of a word changes when you put an <em>e</em> at the end. Hazel tried again. “Con-fuse,” she said. “Beautiful!” Pavek beamed.</p>



<p>When Hazel returned to her desk, I asked her what goes through her mind when she gets to a word she doesn’t know. “Sound it out,” she said. “Or go to the next word.” Her classmates offered other tips. Reilly, age 6, said it helps to practice and look at pictures. Seven-year-old Beatrix, who loves books about unicorns and dragons, advocated looking at both pictures and letters. It feels weird when you don’t know a word, she said, because it seems like everyone else knows it. But learning to read is kind of fun, she added. “You can figure out a word you didn’t know before.”</p>



<p>Like the majority of schools in the United States, my son’s district uses an approach to reading instruction called balanced literacy. And that puts him and his classmates in the middle of a long-standing debate about how best to teach children to read.</p>





<p>The debate — often called the “reading wars” — is generally framed as a battle between two distinct views. On one side are those who advocate for an intensive emphasis on phonics: understanding the relationships between sounds and letters, with daily lessons that build on each other in a systematic order. On the other side are proponents of approaches that put a stronger emphasis on understanding meaning, with some sporadic phonics mixed in. Balanced literacy is one such example.</p>



<p>The issues are less black and white. Teachers and reading advocates argue about how much phonics to fit in, how it should be taught, and what other skills and instructional techniques matter, too. In various forms, the debate about how best to teach reading has stretched on for nearly two centuries, and along the way, it has picked up political, philosophical and emotional baggage.</p>



<p>In fact, science has a lot to say about reading and how to teach it. Plenty of evidence shows that children who receive systematic phonics instruction learn to read better and more rapidly than kids who don’t. But pitting phonics against other methods is an oversimplification of a complicated reality. Phonics is not the only kind of instruction that matters, and it is not the panacea that will solve the nation’s reading crisis.</p>



<p>Cutting through the confusion over how to teach reading is essential, experts say, because reading is crucial to success, and many people never learn to do it well.</p>



<p>According to U.S. government data, only one-third of fourth-graders have the reading skills to be considered proficient, which is defined by the National Assessment of Educational Progress as demonstrating competency over challenging subject matter. And a third of fourth-graders and more than a quarter of 12th-graders lack the reading skills to adequately complete grade-level schoolwork, says Timothy Shanahan, a reading researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>



<p>Those struggles tend to persist. As many as 44 million U.S. adults, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93275.pdf">or 23 percent of the adult population, lack literacy skills</a>, according to U.S. Department of Education data. Those affected may be able to read movie listings, or the time and place of a meeting, but they can’t synthesize information from long passages of text or decipher the warnings on medication inserts. People who can’t read well are less likely than others to vote, or read the news or secure employment. And today’s technology-based job market means students need to achieve more with reading than in the past, Shanahan says. “We are failing to do that.”</p>





<h4>Lessons in decoding</h4>



<p>The vast majority of children need to be taught how to read. Even among those with no learning disabilities, only an estimated 5 percent figure out how to read with virtually no help, says Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and author of <em>Raising Kids Who Read</em>. Yet educators have not reached consensus on how best to teach reading, and phonics is the part of the equation that people still argue about most.</p>



<p>The idea behind a systematic phonics approach is that children must learn how to translate the secret code of written language into the spoken language they know. This “decoding” begins with the development of phonological awareness, or the ability to distinguish between spoken sounds. Phonological awareness allows children, often beginning in preschool, to say that <em>big</em> and <em>pig</em> are different because of the sound at the beginning of the words.</p>



<p>Once children can hear the differences between sounds, phonics comes next, offering explicit instruction in the connections between letters, letter combinations and sounds. To be systematic, these skills need to be taught in an organized order of concepts that build on one another, preferably on a daily basis, says Louisa Moats, a licensed psychologist and literacy expert in Sun Valley, Idaho. Today, phonics proponents often advocate for the simple view of reading, which emphasizes decoding and comprehension, the ability to decipher meaning in sentences and passages.</p>



<p>Support for phonics has been around since at least the 1600s, but critics have also long expressed concerns that rote phonics lessons are boring, prevent kids from learning to love reading and distract from the ability to understand meaning in text. In the 1980s, this kind of thinking led to the rise of whole language, an approach aimed at making reading joyful and immersive instead of mindless and full of effort.</p>



<p>By the 2000s, a more all-around and phonics-inclusive approach called balanced literacy was gaining popularity as the leading theory in competition with phonics-first approaches.</p>



<p>In a 2019 survey of 674 early-elementary and special education teachers from around the United States, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/media/ed%20week%20reading%20instruction%20survey%20report-final%201.24.20.pdf">72 percent said their schools use a balanced literacy approach</a>, according to the Education Week Research Center, a nonprofit organization in Bethesda, Md. The implementation of balanced literacy, however, varies widely, especially in how much phonics is included, the survey found. That variation is probably preventing lots of kids from learning to read as well as they could, decades of research suggests.</p>



<p>In the late 1990s, with the reading wars in full swing, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development brought together a panel of about a dozen reading experts to evaluate the evidence for how best to teach reading. The National Reading Panel’s first task was to figure out which types of teaching tasks to include in the analysis, says Shanahan, a panel member. Ultimately, the group chose eight categories and conducted a meta-analysis of 38 studies involving 66 controlled experiments from 1970 through 2000. The results showed support for five components of reading instruction that helped students the most.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Five essentials </h3>



<p>A meta-analysis of 38 studies found five components of reading instruction were most helpful to students.</p>



<p><strong>Phonemic awareness</strong><br />Knowing that spoken words are made of smaller segments of sound called phonemes</p>



<p><strong>Phonics</strong><br />The knowledge that letters represent phonemes and that these sounds can combine to form words</p>



<p><strong>Fluency</strong><br />The ability to read easily, accurately, quickly and with expression and understanding</p>



<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong> <br />Learning new words</p>



<p><strong>Comprehension</strong> <br />The ability to show understanding, often through summarization</p>



<p><em>Source: National Reading Panel</em></p>
</div>



<p>Two components that rose to the top were an emphasis on phonemic awareness (a part of phonological awareness that involves the ability to identify and manipulate individual sounds in spoken words) and phonics. Studies included in the analysis showed that higher levels of phonemic awareness in kindergarten and first grade were predictors of better reading skills later on. The analysis couldn’t assess the magnitude of benefits, but children who received systematic phonics instruction scored better on word reading, spelling and comprehension, especially when phonics lessons started before first grade. Those children were also better at sounding out words, including nonsense words, Shanahan says.</p>



<p>Vocabulary development was another essential component, as was a focus on comprehension. The final important facet was a focus on achieving fluency — the ability to read a text quickly, accurately and with proper expression — by having children read out loud, among other strategies.</p>



<p>Even before the panel <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pubs/nrp/Documents/report.pdf">released its results in 2000</a>, numerous studies and books from as early as the 1960s had concluded that there was value in explicit phonics instruction. Studies since then have added yet more support for phonics.</p>



<p>In 2008, the National Early Literacy Panel, a government-convened group that included Shanahan, considered dozens of studies on phonological awareness (including phonemic awareness) plus phonics instruction in preschool and kindergarten. <a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/NELPReport09.pdf">Children who got decoding instruction scored substantially bette</a>r on tests of phonological awareness compared with those who didn’t. The benefit was equivalent to a jump from the 50th percentile to the 79th percentile on standardized tests, suggesting those students were better prepared to learn how to read.</p>



<p>Likewise, a 2007 meta-analysis of 22 studies conducted in urban elementary schools found that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013124507304128">minority children who received phonics instruction</a> scored the equivalent of several months ahead of their minority peers on several academic measures. Studies have not addressed whether phonics might help close demographic achievement gaps, but research suggests that whole language approaches are less effective in disadvantaged populations than in other groups.</p>



<p>“There are several thousand studies at least that converge on this finding,” Moats says. “Phonics instruction has always had the edge in consensus reports.” </p>



<p>It is difficult to quantify how substantial the gains are from explicit phonics instruction, partly because the bulk of published research is full of ambiguities. Randomized trials are rare. Studies tend to be small. And in schools where teachers have autonomy to respond to students at their discretion, control groups are often not well-defined, making it hard to tell what phonics-focused programs are really being compared with, or how much phonics the control groups are getting. The reality of instruction can differ from classroom to classroom, even within the same school. And students who aren’t getting intensive phonics at school may have the blanks filled in at home, where parents might sound out words and talk about letters while reading bedtime stories.</p>



<p>The data that are available suggest that kids who get systematic phonics lessons score the equivalent of about half a grade level ahead of kids in other groups on standardized tests, Shanahan says. That’s not a giant leap, but it helps. “Overwhelmingly in studies, both individually and in a meta-analysis where you’re combining results across studies, if you explicitly teach phonics for some amount of time, kids do better than if you don’t pay much attention to that or if you pay a little bit of attention to [phonics],” he says.</p>



<h4>Real experiences</h4>



<p>Some of the most compelling evidence to support a phonics-focused approach comes from historical observations: When schools start teaching systematic phonics, test scores tend to go up. As phonics took hold in U.S. schools in the 1970s, fourth–graders began to do better on standardized reading tests.</p>



<p>In the 1980s, California replaced its phonics curriculum with a whole language approach. In 1994, the state’s fourth-graders tied for last place in the nation: Less than 18 percent had mastered reading. After California re-embraced phonics in the 1990s, test scores rose. By 2019, 32 percent achieved grade-level proficiency.</p>



<p>Those swings continue today. In 2019, <a href="https://msachieves.mdek12.org/mississippi-ranks-no-1-in-nation-for-score-gains-on-national-assessment-of-educational-progress/">Mississippi reported the nation’s largest improvement in reading scores</a>; the state had started training teachers in phonics instruction six years earlier. For the first time, Mississippi’s reading scores matched the nation’s average, with 32 percent of students showing proficiency, up from 22 percent in 2009, making it the only state to post significant gains in reading in 2019.</p>



<p>England, too, started seeing dramatic results after government-funded schools were required in 2006 to teach systematic phonics to 5- to 7-year-olds. When the country implemented a test to assess phonics skills in 2012, 58 percent of 5- and 6-year-olds passed. By 2016, 81 percent of students passed. Reading comprehension at age 7 has risen, and gains seem to persist at age 11. These population trends make a strong case for teaching phonics, says Douglas Fuchs, an educational psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</p>

<p>Despite the evidence that children learn to read best when given systematic phonics along with other key components of a literacy program, many schools and teacher-training programs either ignore the science, apply it inconsistently or mix conflicting approaches that could hinder proficiency. In the 2019 Education Week Research Center survey, 86 percent of teachers who train teachers said they teach phonics. But surveyed elementary school teachers often use strategies that contradict a phonics-first approach: Seventy-five percent said they use a technique called three cuing. This method teaches children to guess words they don’t know by using context and picture clues, and has been criticized for getting in the way of learning to decode. More than half of the teachers said they thought students could understand written passages that contained unfamiliar words, even without a good grasp of phonics.</p>



<p>The disconnect starts at the top. In a 2013 review of nearly 700 teacher-training institutions, only 29 percent required teachers to take courses on four or five of the five essential facets of reading instruction identified by the National Reading Panel. Almost 60 percent required teachers to complete coursework on two or fewer of the essentials, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and policy group based in Washington, D.C.</p>

<h3>Teacher’s choice </h3>

<p>In 2019, the Education Week Research Center also surveyed 533 postsecondary educators who train teachers on how to teach reading. Only 22 percent of those educators said their philosophy was to teach explicit, systematic phonics. Almost 60 percent said they support balanced literacy. And about 15 percent thought, contrary to evidence, that most students would learn to read if given the right books and enough time.</p>



<p>“The majority of classrooms in this country continue to embrace instructional practices and programs that do not include systematic instruction in foundational skills like phonemic awareness and phonics and spelling,” Moats says. “They just don’t do it.”</p>



<p>At my son’s Minneapolis school, reading specialist Karin Emerson told me about her early days teaching kindergarten, first and second grades in the 1990s. She was trained to use a whole language approach that included the three cuing technique.</p>



<p>Emerson described a typical reading lesson: “I’m going to show you a big book, and I’m going to cover up all of the letters of the word except the <em>b</em>, and I’m going to say, ‘Look at this page. It says this is a …’ What do you think it’s going to say?” Then she would point out the butterfly in the picture and ask the students to think about whether the <em>b</em> sound could refer to anything in the picture. “What does butterfly start with? A ‘b-uh.’ Do you think it’s going to be butterfly? I think it is going to be butterfly. It is.”</p>



<p>Eight years later, Emerson switched from classroom teacher to reading specialist, helping third-graders who weren’t reading yet. Many were the same students she had taught to read in younger grades. After reviewing the reading research, she implemented systematic phonics. By the end of third grade, students in her groups advanced an average of two grade levels. She now encourages early-grade teachers to add at least 20 minutes of phonics a day into literacy lessons.</p>



<p>Looking back to her classroom-teaching days, Emerson says parents often told her they were concerned that their children weren’t reading yet. “I would say, ‘Oh, they’ll be fine because they’re well spoken, they’re bright and you’re reading to them.’ Well they weren’t fine,” Emerson says. “Some people learn how to read super easy, and that’s great. But most people need to be taught, and there’s a pretty big chunk who need to be taught in a systematic way.”</p>



<p>While learning about ongoing battles over reading instruction, I have been marveling at my son’s transformation from nonreader to reader. One recent afternoon, he came home from school and told me that he had learned how to spell the word “A-G-A-I-N.” I asked him how he would spell it if it looked like it sounded. He worked it out, one sound at a time: “U-G-E-N.” We agreed the English language is pretty strange. It’s amazing anyone learns to read it at all.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>This is your brain on reading</h3>



<p>Reading is a relatively new activity for the human brain, which hasn’t had time to evolve specialized areas devoted to the task. Instead, our brains enlist areas, such as the visual system, that originated for other reasons, says Guinevere Eden, a neuroscientist at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. An object like a tree or a lion needs to be recognizable from any angle, she says. But when we read, we need to override that kind of pattern recognition to distinguish, say, <em>b</em> from <em>d</em>, two letters that look identical to a beginning reader.</p>



<p>To translate squiggles and dots into sounds, several key brain areas, in both the visual and language systems, get involved. And how involved those areas are during reading shifts with increasing mastery, according to brain-imaging studies from the last two decades. When early or experienced readers sound out an unfamiliar word, they tap into the posterior and superior temporal lobes and inferior parietal lobe, which are involved in language and sensory processing. When the brain encounters a familiar word, on the other hand, the visual cortex takes over, suggesting that known words become like any other object that the brain recognizes instantly. As a person’s reading skills improve and the mental menu of familiar words grows, activity is more pronounced in the visual cortex during reading, Eden says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img alt="fMRI brain reading" class="wp-image-3087151" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042520_reading_inline3_mobile-674x450.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3087151">This fMRI scan shows activity (red and orange) in areas known to be involved in reading, including the left inferior frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and the inferior temporal cortex, which is part of the visual cortex. In adults with dyslexia, those areas are less active during reading.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3087151">G.F. Eden et al/Neuron 2004</span></figure></div>



<p>Eden uses brain scans to understand what goes wrong in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702896">children with reading disabilities,</a> who have trouble sounding out words. One of her goals is to <a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/09/11/what-is-dyslexia-guinevere-eden">evaluate interventions for children with dyslexia</a> to see if the interventions target the brain processes that are most impaired.</p>



<p>Despite heavy marketing by companies that sell reading products using brain scans as evidence that the companies’ methods help children learn to read, Eden says that imaging studies cannot yet answer questions about which types of reading instruction are best for children, with or without reading disabilities. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology/">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></h4>

<p>The scars of emotional abuse are invisible, deep, and diverse; and unfortunately, emotional abuse likely impacts more students than we think.</p><p>Emotionally abusive behavior broadly consists of criticism, degradation, rejection, or threat. Emotional abuse (also known as psychological maltreatment or verbal assault) can happen anywhere, both within and outside of families, and can refer to a single severe incident or a chronic, ongoing pattern. Educators, caregivers, coaches, school mental health professionals, administrators, and peers are all capable of acting emotionally abusive toward school-age youth. That is part of its insidious invisibility; despite emotional abuse being highly involved in childhood abuse cases, it is often forgotten and overlooked. This type of interpersonal trauma is typically chronic and cuts deeply, as it is associated with mental and physical health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress, sleep problems, self-harm) during the school years and beyond.</p><p>Even with this existing knowledge, emotional abuse remains misunderstood, minimized, unseen, and unreported by many, including school professionals. We outline three things teachers need to know about emotional abuse and three things they can do to meet the needs of students experiencing emotional abuse.</p><p><em><strong>What to know</strong></em></p><p><strong>The impact on the student determines the occurrence of emotional abuse more than the behavior that caused it. </strong></p><p>There is no legal or clinical universal definition of emotional abuse. For example, two students with a parent teasing them about their appearances may react differently, in part based on context and relationship with the parent. Emotional abuse would be determined by the impact on the student, rather than the teasing alone.</p><p><strong>Emotional abuse is detrimental to both a student’s way of thinking and feeling. </strong></p><p>Children create their sense of self from stories that others construct about them. Students may believe the destructive narratives that are told to them. That is, these harmful words may impact students at their core—shifting how they think about themselves and the world, and how they feel about themselves and others.</p><p><strong>There are numerous ways that emotional abuse may manifest. </strong></p><p>Emotional abuse is not simply hearing harmful words. The context around the experience of emotional abuse are varied and diverse. A student may internalize or externalize their behaviors, or something in between. If a school-aged youth is repeatedly told that she is worthless, then the student may be meek in class. If a student is threatened repeatedly, then she may act aggressively toward others.</p><p><em><strong>What to do</strong></em></p><p><strong>Take care of your emotional needs and your emotional health.</strong></p><p>Educators cannot support students if they cannot support themselves. As some students may constantly hear emotionally destructive words in their home environments, teachers certainly do not want to bring any semblance of that into their schools. Nevertheless, working with students can be tiring and frustrating. If their emotional energy is low, teachers may react rather than respond to difficult situations that unexpectedly arise. Rather than taking a breath, teachers might begin to punitively scold or admonish a student. Teachers need to take care of their emotional needs so that they do not parallel any unhealthy at-home behaviors in the classroom.</p><p><strong>Foster sharing through strong relationships. </strong></p><p>Try to examine the life contexts behind a student’s behaviors. Rather than focusing on what is wrong with students, be curious about the circumstances in students’ lives that may influence how they act in school. To have a firmer understanding, teachers need to create brave spaces in our schools and classrooms so that students may feel comfortable sharing with adults. Students often regard educators as more effective guardians in violence protection than police or security, which speaks to the importance of continuing to cultivate this trust. When students share feelings, provide positive reinforcement by expressing your gratitude or by giving a thoughtful, affirming response.</p><p><strong>Know the laws around mandated reporting, and communicate with transparency.</strong></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/manda/">Check state regulations</a> and learn to whom to report and how to report within your district or county. If and when suspicion or reports of abuse arise, reach out to your school mental health professionals. Encourage your administrators to grow emotional abuse awareness, prevention, and intervention initiatives so that others feel willing to report even in instances of suspected abuse. Openly discuss what happens after a report is made, as this transparency allows for students to feel more comfortable with the idea of reporting.</p><p>Words are powerful, and as such, can be weaponized and wounding. Words can also be healing, spoken with gentleness and justice. Teachers should listen wholly to their students and their unstated needs; let teachers use their minds and words wisely and act knowingly.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Image by Okan AKGÜL on </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/apple-gift-teacher-book-classroom-4958609/"><em>Pixabay</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/622374312/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/622374312/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/622374312/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/a-pandemic-of-boredom/" rel="nofollow">A pandemic of boredom</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/05/intermittent-fasting-can-help-people-in-high-stress-jobs/" rel="nofollow">Intermittent fasting can help people in high-stress jobs</a></li></ul> </div>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Visual stimuli are represented by a highly efficient code in the primary visual cortex,
but the development of this code is still unclear. Two distinct factors control coding
efficiency: Representational efficiency, which is determined by neuronal tuning diversity,
and metabolic efficiency, which is influenced by neuronal gain. How these determinants of
coding efficiency are shaped during development, supported by excitatory and inhibitory
plasticity, is only partially understood. We investigate a fully plastic spiking network
of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results
show that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate
input encoding. Additionally, inhibitory feedback increases the metabolic efficiency by
implementing a gain control mechanism. Interestingly, this led to the spontaneous
emergence of contrast-invariant tuning curves. Our findings highlight the role of
interneuron plasticity during the development of receptive fields and in shaping sensory
representations.</p>

<p>This episode of <em>Brain Science</em> is an interview with neuroscientist Matthew Cobb author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3avdYDa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience."</a></p> <p>Cobb approaches the history of neuroscience from a different perspective than previous writers. He writes from the perspective of a working scientist with a deep interest in the history of ideas and the interaction between science and culture. This approach makes for a fascinating discussion.</p> <p>Through out history assumptions about the brain have been influenced by both culture and contemporary science. For example, before the discovery of electricity it was impossible to image that the brain uses both chemical and electrical signals to communicate. Similarly, our current understanding is heavily influenced by the computer metaphor, which actually misses much about how real brains function.</p> <p>Another aspect of our discussion involves several ongoing debates with neuroscience such as the importance of localization versus network properties. We also touch on the tendency toward neuromythology, which is the tendency to think that understanding the brain is the only tool for understanding what it means to be human. Dr. Cobb reminds of the importance of being aware of the work in a wide varieties of fields include science and the humanities.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3avdYDa" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Amazon link"><em>The Idea of the Brain: The Past and Future of Neuroscience</em></a> by Matthew Cobb <ul> <li>Complete Bibliography at <a href="https://theideaofthebrain.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/bibliography.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">theideaofthebrain.com</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Please visit <a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additional references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> <p>Please Visit Our Sponsors:</p> <ul> <li>The Great Courses Plus at <a href="http://thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER">thegreatcoursesplus.com/GINGER</a></li> <li>TextExpander at <a href="https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=textexpander-Apr-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Textexpander link">textexpander.com/podcast</a> </li> </ul> <p>Announcements:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/"><em>Brain Science</em></a> comes out on 4th Friday each month.</li> <li>The new expanded edition of <em>Are You Sure?

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>While waiting for the philharmonic orchestra to begin in the concert hall, you observe the people around you and wonder, “What made them come to this place?” The love of music? Snobbery? Conformism — because other friends do this? Or, maybe there are other, deeper motives? Similar questions arise when we think about what drives people to participate in pop culture and consume its products. Do they simply enjoy it? Scientists’ answers to this question can be surprising. For example, one study suggests that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/01/even-those-participants-who-claimed-pop-culture-is-unimportant-suffered-psychological-ill-effects-from-feeling-out-of-the-loop/">we consume pop culture because we suffer psychological ill effects from feeling out of the loop</a>.</p>
<p>But what drives people to become cultural omnivores, those who consume both “highbrow” <em>and</em> “lowbrow” culture? Hanna Shin and Nara Youn from Hongik University in Seoul recently <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Faca0000303">investigated</a> this question in a paper in <em>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39517"></span></p>
<p>Cultural omnivorousness is a relatively new phenomenon. Until the first half of the 20th century, participation in highbrow or lowbrow culture was clearly associated with social and economic status. Opera, symphony orchestra, and painting exhibitions are places traditionally included in highbrow culture. Street performances and graffiti are considered to be products of lowbrow culture. The former are usually credited with greater intellectual sophistication and artistic values, while the latter are often considered to be more authentic and of higher intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Shin and Youn wondered whether personality factors such as narcissism, self-esteem, and feelings of authenticity could explain how likely someone is to be a cultural omnivore. To find out, they conducted two studies. In the first, they tested 178 undergraduate students, asking them to complete the Narcissistic Personality Inventory and a measure of self-esteem, as well as a scale that measured their distinction-seeking drive: that is, the desire to stand out. Participants were also asked to indicate their intentions to participate in highbrow and lowbrow cultural activities (e.g. “visiting art galleries” and “going to pop concerts”, respectively).</p>
<p>The results showed that participants who scored high in narcissism and <em>also</em> had low self-esteem tended to be cultural omnivores. These “insecure narcissists” seemed to be driven to consume both high- and lowbrow culture because of their desire to distinguish themselves from others.</p>
<p>In the second study, Shin and Youn explored more specific motivations for insecure narcissists’ cultural omnivorousness. The researchers created two biographies of a fictional artist: in the highbrow condition, the biography stated that the artist’s paintings had been displayed in major museums around the world, while in the lowbrow condition it stated the paintings were kept by family and later discovered by a collector. One hundred and forty-four undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions and completed scales of personality. After they had reviewed the applicable biography and viewed two examples of the artist’s paintings, they rated the paintings as highbrow or lowbrow, and indicated how likely they would be to visit or recommend an exhibition of the artist’s work. Finally, they completed scales of status-seeking motivations.</p>
<p>The results suggested that insecure narcissists had different reasons for consuming highbrow and lowbrow art. When they believed the paintings were highbrow, their intention to visit or recommend the exhibition seemed to be driven by a desire to consume status-seeking products . But when they believed the paintings were lowbrow, their intention to consume the art was fuelled instead by a desire to signal self-integrity.</p>
<p>The research adds much to the understanding of the motives for one’s participation in culture, going beyond the narrow focus on economic status. The results suggest at least one psychological mechanism underlying cultural omnivorousness: a combination of narcissism and psychological insecurity, which is related to a drive to signal both status and self-integrity.</p>
<p>But it also leaves many questions to be answered. How valid is the division between highbrow and lowbrow contemporary culture: is the appearance of cultural omnivores not the result of blurring the boundaries between these two types of cultures? Does a laboratory experiment reflect the complexity of motives that push us to participate in culture? Finally, are the examined motives and personality traits the most important? There is certainly still much to be done in this research area, and studies that include more psychological variables and factors could definitely enrich our understanding of this phenomenon.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/Syrian-Doctor-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Tens of thousands of Syrian war refugees are currently being trapped between Turkey and Greece or interned in deplorable and dramatic conditions on Greek islands <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/europe/greece-lesbos-moria-refugees.html">[1]</a>. This drama painfully reminds us that the conflict in Syria continues to be the biggest driver of migration. Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian migrants have crossed into Europe. Syrians are now the third-largest group of people with a foreign nationality in Germany, and among Syrian immigrants, there are comparatively many well-educated and trained health care professionals, e.g. some 3,000-4,000 medical doctors <a href="https://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/ueber-uns/aerztestatistik/aerztestatistik-2018">[2]</a>. Not all of them have fled their country as refugees; many have been granted visas, as Germany is principally welcoming Syrian doctors.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Germany needs Syrian doctors</strong></h3>
<p>The reason is simple: In Germany, a relative shortage of physicians has developed over the recent years. A change in working time regulations and a growing demand for part-time jobs, has increased the need for additional doctors. Like many other developed countries, Germany relies on international medical graduates or doctors to supplement its locally trained staff so as to maintain their health care system. Further, as the number of Syrian migrants increases, so does the number of Syrian patients being treated in hospitals and doctors’ offices, resulting in a novel need for Arabic-speaking medical staff. Therefore, Syrian doctors are able to fulfill a double function.</p>
<p>Given this background, it may seem paramount to make the licensure process for Syrian immigrant doctors as straightforward and as swift as possible, actively supporting and advising applicants through the relevant processes. But in fact, the act of obtaining a permanent license to be allowed to practice medicine in Germany is onerous, lengthy, and can bring about many negative experiences. These can include feelings of humiliation, lack of transparency, arbitrariness, and helplessness. This is what many of the 20 Syrian doctors told us in an interview study we performed from 2016-2017.</p>
<h3><strong>Syrian doctors in Germany and their stories: the basis of our study</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05209-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">this study</a> arose when a recently immigrated Syrian dentist, began working with us while waiting for his German dental license to be approved.</p>
<p>He told our team about his experiences with a “bureaucratic”, slow and confusing application procedure to secure his license. We were intrigued by his experiences and wanted to seek out other Syrian health care professionals’ experiences of the system. A qualitative study was designed and we received an overwhelming response to our call for interviewees on a Facebook page for Syrian Doctors in Germany. Within a few days, twenty Syrian health professionals were prepared to share their stories through face-to-face interviews.</p>
<h3><strong>Being lost in an opaque and arbitrary bureaucratic process: that’s what it feels like being a Syrian doctor applying for a medical license in Germany</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.</p></blockquote>
<p>We found that upon arrival in Germany, Syrian doctors are highly motivated to apply their skills and expertise in clinical patient care. However, they are confronted with a time-consuming, ever-changing and non-transparent application procedure lasting months, even years.</p>
<p>One physician explained: “<em>When I started applying for the temporary license … some rules changed and the authorities were now requiring a C1 course in medical German to obtain the temporary license! After I started the C1 language course, they required the exam for medical terms. When we completed one step, they asked for another step…nothing is stable here.</em>”</p>
<p>Interviewees describe a Kafkaesque system where they feel at the mercy of Government employees and reviewers who ask for absurd and impossible accomplishments, refuse to give information and act at random. This is shown in the quote of another interview partner: “<em>There are no clear steps. You can have two [Syrian] doctors who studied at the same university, finished their studies in the same year, – and then one of them can obtain the approbation without any exam, and the other one will need to take another exam. At the end of the day, only one person makes the decision about you. …And of course, we cannot meet this person or talk with them. We don’t even know their name.”</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11846" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Admin work" class="size-medium wp-image-11846" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/pexels-photo-52608-300x201.jpeg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair with the medical license application process.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Consequently, the interviewees reported feeling depressed, irritated or even in despair. As informational and practical support from official institutions was scarce, the Syrian doctors relied on personal networks and peers to understand the requirements and find a job.</p>
<h3><strong>Where next?</strong></h3>
<p>To obtain a balanced view of the licensure process and the interactions involved, future research should explore the perspective of the administrative staff in the German Chamber of Physicians or job centers as well. Naturally, these regulative bodies were not prepared for the large number of migrant doctors applying for a license and were surprised by the abrupt rise in the number of licensure procedures. Journalists have reported that ratifying Syrian diplomas may be difficult because in some cases, fraudulent documents have been provided <a href="https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/innenministerium-warnt-falsche-zeugnisse-und-diplome-fluechtlinge-koennen-im-libanon-antragspakete-kaufen_id_5066196.html">[3</a>,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/europe/germany-refugees-doctors.html">4]</a>. For the medical profession, in particular, credentials and certificates should be checked thoroughly and carefully. Nevertheless, Germany may learn from other countries such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, which have harmonized and simplified assessment procedures for overseas-trained doctors, and implemented specific resources guiding and supporting foreign health professionals in different stages of their application process <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2008/188/8/nationally-consistent-assessment-international-medical-graduates">[5</a>,<a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-016-0135-6">6]</a>.</p>
<p>Welcoming Syrian doctors in Germany is more important than ever – especially as the current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the dire need for skilled medical staff in hospitals. While German authorities claim to be making an effort to find as many helping hands as possible to cope with the impending shortage of health care professionals, there are no signs that the accreditation process of foreign doctors – Syrian doctors among them – may be accelerated, or handled in a more pragmatic way <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/despite-coronavirus-foreign-doctors-struggle-to-get-degrees-recognized-in-germany/a-52966674">[7]</a>.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>For many, running a marathon is seen as the ultimate amateur athletic achievement; for others, it’s just the start. Ultramarathon runners often take on courses of incredibly impressive length, running 50 or 100 kilometres at one time or over several days.</p>
<p>Clearly this is physically demanding, and only those in seriously good shape will be able to take on such challenges — ultramarathon running involves stress on muscles and bones, blisters, dehydration, sleep deprivation and mental and physical fatigue, so it’s really not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>But what about the psychological traits that make someone suitable for long-distance running? What kind of person can withstand this kind of physical stress, and how? A <a href="https://aps.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajpy.12287?af=R">new study</a> in the <em>Australian Journal of Psychology</em> takes a look.<span id="more-39510"></span></p>
<p>Gregory Roebuck from Monash University and colleagues recruited 20 ultrarunners and 20 control participants aged between 18 and 70; runners were matched with non-runners by gender and age. Participants were asked about their exercise behaviours and running experiences before completing a number of questionnaires. These included a 25-item scale designed to measure resilience (with participants rating how much they agreed with statements such as “I am able to adapt when changes occur”), and two questionnaires that looked at emotion regulation — the ways a person moderates or expresses their emotion. Finally, a 155-item questionnaire looked at a range of personality traits across domains like well-being, achievement, stress reaction, and, aggression.</p>
<p>Next, participants took part in an emotion regulation task, viewing 36 neutral images (e.g. a sofa or chair) and 36 negative images (e.g. a bloody medical scene). Before viewing each image, participants were asked to either respond naturally to it (a “look” trial) or attempt to not have a negative reaction to it (a “decrease” trial), before rating the strength of their emotional response. Heart rate and skin conductance were measured during this section of the experiment.</p>
<p>Ultrarunners scored significantly higher on the resilience questionnaire than non-runners, and were more likely to indicate they used positive reappraisal when regulating their emotions — in other words, they were better able to reframe a situation with a positive angle. This may be down to the need to maintain high levels of motivation during races, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/06/29/a-mental-technique-calledcognitive-reappraisal-makes-long-distance-running-feel-easier">attaching positive meaning to negative events in order to keep running</a>.</p>
<p>There was also a physiological difference between ultrarunners and non-runners in the emotion regulation task, with ultrarunners showing reduced skin conductance and heart rate even when viewing unpleasant images. However, they didn’t show any differences in their ability to decrease their response to negative images.</p>
<p>There was one measure on which ultrarunners scored lower, however — affiliative extraversion, which measures how socially warm people are, which the team puts down to the high levels of solitude involved in long-distance running.  There was no significant difference in any of the other measures.</p>
<p><span>The results suggest that ultrarunners are pretty similar to the rest of us — with some important differences. While it’s clear that ultrarunners are indeed more resilient than non-runners, and use different emotion regulation strategies, the direction of those relationships is not yet clear. It could be that training for ultramarathons makes people more resilient, or, on the other hand, it could be that people with higher levels of resilience are more likely to be attracted to the pastime.</span></p>
<p><span>It would be interesting to further explore how ultrarunners motivate themselves through many hours of pain and effort. Because even though most of us will never run 100 kilometres in one go (and may have no desire to, either), understanding how to tolerate pain, and cope with physical and mental fatigue, is a lesson we all could benefit from.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/chaos-485491_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Since the early 2000’s there has been growing interest in the phenomenon of household chaos and how it impacts on the well-being and development of children. Yet despite this interest, no review has been conducted that comprehensively brings the existing literature together. A <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-08587-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">systematic scoping review</a> we have published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> aims to address this gap.</p>
<h4>What we found</h4>
<p>With remarkable consistency, increased chaos in a child’s home, defined as high levels of background noise (e.g. from TV), constant rushing, and environmental commotion and confusion, negatively impacted on almost every child outcome investigated, from cognitive and academic performance, to stress physiology, and socio-emotional well-being.</p>
<h4>Chaos and parenting</h4>
<p>So how could household chaos have such far-ranging implications for the well-being of children? An important clue lies in the relationship between chaos and parenting behaviors. We found that, yet again with remarkable consistency, greater chaos was associated with increased parent-child conflict, reduced closeness in the parent-child relationship, less supportive parenting practices, and less responsive parenting. And as research has confirmed, the quality of the parent-child relationship is intricately linked to the well-being of the child.</p>
<h4>Slowing down childhood</h4>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11837 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/children-403583_640-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Improving child well-being by slowing down the lives of children is not a new concept. Outside academia a number of groups and social movements advocate for the realignment of family time with the ‘pace of childhood’ – a pace that is much slower than the pace of the hurried, modern world children find themselves in. These approaches encourage simplification of a child’s life, through the paring back of unnecessary activities, toys, and digital media, in addition to the promotion of daily rhythms and routines known to support well-being. In short, the focus shifts away from activities that disrupt the flow of family life, and instead focuses on activities that promote parent-child communication and free play (but not computer games!), and support development of warm relationships.</p>
<h4>Research gaps</h4>
<p>Yet despite a push from outside academia to simplify the lives of children, and evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies linking chaos with poor child outcomes, we still don’t know whether reducing household chaos will have a positive impact. We also don’t know how to reduce chaos, as no studies have attempted to do this. And importantly, it still remains to be seen whether we can go too far in the other direction, resulting in a home environment that is overly structured and controlled, to the point that it lacks warmth and the opportunity for supportive and caring parent-child relationships to develop.</p>
<h4>Household chaos in the time of COVID-19</h4>
<p>At the time of undertaking the review, we could not have predicted the situation we currently find <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11838" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/table-3281047_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />ourselves in. Children around the world are spending an unprecedented amount of time at home. While we don’t know whether children living in low-chaos households will fare better, intuitively, we might expect they will. These children will likely have greater opportunities to complete their home-schooling tasks in a less distracting environment. They will also likely have more time dedicated to free, non-screen based play – the kind of play that supports their emotional well-being and development. And perhaps most importantly, there is the chance that they will have greater exposure to supportive and positive parenting practices. As such, lower household chaos in the time of COVID-19 may provide an environment more conducive to the promotion of resilience and child well-being. A unique opportunity has thus presented itself to investigate not only how low levels of chaos protect children from exposure to adversity, but also whether we can effectively reduce household chaos levels to promote better outcomes across the board for our children.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/21/an-online-summer-school-for-computational-neuroscience/">An online summer school for computational neuroscience</a></h4>

<p>Megan Peters, Konrad Kording and the people behind <a href="https://neuromatch.io/">neuromatch</a> are building an online summer school for computational neuroscience (July 13 – 31st). If you’re reading this blog – chances are you should be a student in this class or a TA. It’s going to be awesome! 3 straight weeks of computational neuro education. Designed for PhD student or postdoc experimentalists in mind, what sets it apart is matching, the same technology behind neuromatch. Become part of small tight-knit group of trainees with similar interests – bond, share, learn. But wait, there’s more:</p>



<ul><li>Low TA to student ratio (6-10)</li><li>Lectures with world-class computational neuroscientists</li><li>Tutorials in Python, cloud-based in Google Colab: take your theoretical knowledge and apply to your own data</li><li>Inclusive: 100$ tuition (waivable)</li></ul>



<p>I loved summer school (CSHL computational neuroscience: vision). I made some life-long friends and have memories to last a lifetime. We want it to be better than a real-life summer school. Better by being more inclusive, matching you with more diverse people, offering multiple levels of support, and being accessible to people at different stages in their career.</p>

YOU HAVE UNTIL APRIL 27 TO SIGN UP, DO IT NOW.</p>



<h2>Teaching at scale</h2>



<p>Most real-life elite education is expensive and exclusive. In online education, it’s possible to scale to huge audiences for a fraction of the cost, and let everybody in – including people of disadvantaged backgrounds. MOOCs can have excellent learning materials – better production values, materials that resist the test of time, scannable lectures. Training educators in the latest methods can be done at scale.</p>



<p>The biggest disadvantage of MOOCs is high attrition – up to 95% of people that sign up for MOOCs drop out. New models are appearing that have the accessibility of online learning and the critical social component of real-life learning. At Stanford, Chris Piech and Mehran Sahami started Code in Place, an effort to bring CS education to people at home during covid19 times. It’s a massive effort – 8,000 students from all over the world accompanied by 800 section leaders (including me!). Several factors have kept dropout to a minimum (&lt; 20% after 2 weeks):</p>



<ul><li>A low TA-to-student ratio</li><li>matching TAs to students based on learner characteristic (age, location)</li><li>engaging materials</li><li>a very high standard for TAs (Top affiliations are Stanford, Google and MIT)</li><li>a tough preparatory assignment to make sure the students entering class were motivated</li></ul>



<p>I was very excited when Konrad announced that they were working on a summer school, fresh off my Code in Place experience, so I contacted him and have joined the team to help (in a small way) organize this thing. There are a handful of experiments in teaching computational neuroscience at scale, the most successful in my opinion being the <a href="https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/">Neuronal Dynamics online book, tutorials, and lectures</a>. Imagine that, plus TAs, your own wolf pack, live Q&amp;A – community. That’s what we’re aiming for.</p>

<p>If you belong to the latter category, you’re not alone. A <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3543">new study</a> in <em>Management Science </em>has found that many of us would rather avoid stressful or uncomfortable truths — even if they might benefit us.</p>
<p><span id="more-39504"></span>To find out who is most likely to avoid information and why, Emily Ho from Fordham University and colleagues first presented 380 participants with a series of scenarios designed to test their desire for knowledge about a situation that could have a favourable or unfavourable outcome for them. The scenarios replicated situations that participants were likely to have encountered in the past and fell into three broad categories: personal health, finances, and other people’s perceptions.</p>
<p>Participants were asked whether they would want to look at how well a missed investment opportunity was performing, for example, whether or not they’d want to know their risk for a particular medical condition, or if they’d want to know the truth about how well a speech had gone. (If you’re interested in finding out your own tendency to avoid information, you can see all the scenarios and take the test <a href="https://cmu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oYP0OROwDv1f2l">here</a>). Participants’ personality traits were also measured.</p>
<p>Information avoidance was incredibly common: on average, participants indicated that they would definitely or probably not want to receive information 32% of the time. Overall, these figures were fairly stable across domains: an average of 24% would prefer not to know if a friend hated a book given as a gift, for instance, whilst 29% would avoid finding out the impact stress had had on their long-term health. Even among those who were more likely to want to hear potentially troubling information, there was often at least one domain in which they opted to remain uninformed.</p>
<p>Participants’ likelihood of avoiding information wasn’t associated with their gender, income, age or education. However, it was related to particular personality traits: those higher in extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to new experiences tended to seek information more, while those with high neuroticism scores showed a higher likelihood of wanting to stay in the dark.</p>
<p>A second study, which saw participants rate the scenarios again, four weeks apart, suggested their responses remain stable over time.</p>
<p>A final study looked at participants’ real-world behaviour. In this case, two weeks after completing the initial survey on information avoidance, participants were given the option to be sent to a website containing potentially valuable information that they might be motivated to avoid: for instance, an occupational website that compared average salaries between men and women, or a health site informing people about their individual risk of burnout.</p>
<p>Results suggested that participants’ tendency to avoid information as measured by the survey did have an impact on real-world decisions: avoidant and seeking scores correlated with the decision to avoid or read information respectively.</p>
<p>The findings may have important uses: understanding in which situations people tend to ignore or avoid information could be vital for organisations or governments sending out public service information, for example.</p>
<p>We already knew, to some extent, that there are cases where people avoid information — interventions that seek to improve financial literacy tend to have smaller impacts than hoped, for example, partly because some people feel so anxious about money they’ll go out of their way to avoid thinking about it. Building this knowledge into the design of social interventions may be a useful way to approach such individual differences in information seeking.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Exactly how the media discusses suicide is a topic of frequent debate. <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/57/4/238">Plenty</a> of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lpcuDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=.+Media+and+suicide:+international+perspectives+on+research,+theory,+and+policy.Routledge,+2017.&amp;ots=aEVG_TEtWR&amp;sig=d6qWpbd6szrd2vPxJ14J-QU7U4Y&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=.%20Media%20and%20suicide%3A%20international%20perspectives%20on%20research%2C%20theory%2C%20and%20policy.Routledge%2C%202017.&amp;f=false">research</a> has linked media reporting  of suicide with an increase in suicidal behaviour, and both the <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">Samaritans</a> and the <a href="https://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/resource_booklet_2017/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), amongst others, have clear (and frequently promoted) guides for journalists on how to report suicide.</p>
<p>But such guidelines are often ignored in favour of insensitivity or sensationalism — especially when the person at hand is a celebrity. Take the recent coverage of the death of Caroline Flack: explicit, deeply intimate details were plastered across tabloids for weeks, with seemingly no thought for how those details would impact readers.</p>
<p>Now a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m575">new review</a>, published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, has taken a closer look at just how serious the problem is.</p>
<p><span id="more-39492"></span></p>
<p>The analysis included 20 studies which looked at the rate of suicides amongst the general population before and after the media had reported on suicide in print, online, or on TV. Of these, 14 studies looked at reports specifically on the death of a celebrity by suicide.</p>
<p>As expected, the studies found an increase in suicides during the period after the reporting of a death of a celebrity; in cases where the method was detailed, there was also an increase in the number of suicides by that same method. On average, reports of celebrity deaths by suicide were associated with an 8 to 18% increase in suicide rates in the general population, with estimates on the higher end of the scale when the celebrity in question was famous worldwide.</p>
<p>This pattern of results is also consistent with previous research which has found that media coverage of suicide can profoundly affect people’s mental health, the authors write. Suicidal thoughts often increase, as do feelings of low mood and low self-esteem.</p>
<p>As for why reports about famous people have such a large impact, one factor may be the high level of identification the general public has with celebrities. Reports may also establish suicide as a way to cope with problems, the team says.</p>
<p>Not all media coverage is associated with an increase in suicides, however: overall, reporting on suicide generally, rather than on a specific celebrity’s death, was not linked to an increase in deaths. However, past work has suggested that particular ways of reporting could increase risk: when suicide is depicted as “inevitable”, for instance, or when media outlets reinforced damaging myths.</p>
<p>Other media may also <em>help</em> those feeling suicidal, rather than impacting their mental health further. Some coverage features stories of healing or recovery, some offers support or advice, and some simply follow guidelines set by the Samaritans or WHO.</p>
<p>However, while the results do show that media reports can increase the risk of suicide among the general population, it’s also important not to draw too direct a conclusion from the findings. Suicide is a complex, nuanced thing: not only would it be irresponsible to place the blame at the door of one institution, media outlet or other specific cause, it would also be counter to the very guidelines in place to protect people. The Samaritans guidelines, for example, warn against “over-simplification of the causes or perceived triggers for a suicide”, which are “unlikely to reflect accurately the complexity of suicide”. Drawing a direct and simple line between media coverage and suicide does not adhere to that suggestion itself.</p>
<p>But, limitations aside, the analysis does have important ramifications. Guidelines do already exist, and exist for a reason: following them is hugely important when it comes to protecting mental health. Journalists may already be aware of such guidelines — but making sure they apply them to their own work is key.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has vastly increased journalists’ demand for access to scientist-sources, triggering a gold rush of sorts for articulate experts in virology, epidemiology, drug and vaccine development, and the social and psychological impacts of physical isolation, among other topics. The need for scientific expertise is especially acute among newsrooms that—as part of their all-hands-on-deck response to the pandemic—have pulled reporters onto the story who have never covered science or public health, let alone a health crisis of this magnitude. Lacking a ready bench of go-to scientists they can call, these reporters are scrambling to find trusted sources who can help them convey, accurately and clearly, health advice and insights for a nervous and news-ravenous public.</p>
<p>While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters. And while clear communication with the media is a skill that can most certainly be learned, it requires time and practice if counterproductive results are to be avoided. Given the ever-increasing demands of their day jobs, especially during this crisis, time is something that few scientists with pandemic-relevant expertise today have much of.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciline.org/for-scientists">SciLine</a>, a free service based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has been connecting journalists to scientists for 2.5 years. Through our facilitation of more than 1,100 such interviews across print, radio, and television, we’ve observed time after time the practices and behaviors that make for an effective interaction between an expert and a reporter. Recognizing that many scientists with limited media training are being called upon to share their expertise or opinions about aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we share here some tips we have found to be most useful for a successful interview, whether you have a few minutes or a few days to get ready.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>BEFORE</em> AN INTERVIEW, WRITE DOWN 3 POINTS YOU WANT TO MAKE.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider these your “vital takeaways”. If the journalist gets nothing else from the interview, what would you want them to remember and use? If you are not on camera, you can have these notes in front of you during the interview. State your points early in the conversation and repeat them as opportunities arise. Importantly, whenever possible don’t just assert these points but back them up with data and studies. You’re uniquely positioned to inject <em>evidence</em> into the news. In doing so you can do more than simply convey the facts; you can help remind the public there is a difference between research-backed evidence and mere opinion.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> DESCRIBE THE BIG-PICTURE PROBLEM.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even if not asked, you should step back from the specific questions being asked and briefly describe the overarching issue or challenge in simple terms. Explain why addressing the larger issue demands a methodical, scientific approach, and <em>then</em> get into the details. Reporters often push for quick answers—to get to the point they think they need. But if you explain even briefly why this is a question that science is in the best position to answer, you again speak up not just for the findings of science but also for the scientific process itself.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>USE ANALOGIES, VISUAL EXAMPLES, AND ANECDOTES WHEN POSSIBLE, AND AVOID JARGON.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As you plan ahead for the ideas you want to convey, think about how you can make your knowledge more accessible, relatable, and memorable to nonexperts. Avoid using acronyms, abbreviations, or jargon—including terms you might not at first realize are jargon. (You may describe a mounting threat as resulting from a “positive feedback” loop, for example, but some non-scientists think “positive feedback” means “praise” and is generally a good thing!) Remember, even a single acronym or overly technical term in a sentence increases the odds that your otherwise valuable quote will end up on the cutting room floor.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF A QUESTION, SAY SO. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not rude to say to a journalist, <em>“Actually, that’s not quite right. Let me explain …” </em>or <em>“I don’t think your premise is correct. What I see is …” </em>or <em>“That may be one factor, but the bigger issue is …”</em>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER, IT’S OK TO SAY SO. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As tempting as it can be when asked by a reporter to weigh in on a science-related question outside your area of expertise or to address a topic on which you are not fully up to speed, don’t risk your reputation (or, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health) by doing so. It’s okay to say: <em>“I’m sorry, that’s outside my area of expertise.” </em>or <em>“I don’t have the answer at my fingertips, can I get back to you on that question?” </em>or <em>“That isn’t something I focus on, but [a knowledgeable colleague you know] might be a good person to talk to.” </em></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY COULD END UP IN A STORY, AND DON’T TRY TO GO “OFF THE RECORD”. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The default status for all journalistic interviews is that the reporter may quote anything you say and is not obligated to share quotes with you ahead of time for review or approval. Anything different from that default necessitates an agreement ahead of time by both parties, the reporter and the interviewee. We recommend you do not attempt to go ‘off the record’ during an interview, as that phrase can mean different things to different reporters and may result in a statement being traceable back to you. Only share remarks that you’re comfortable having attributed to you by name. Similarly, if asked a question you don’t want to answer, avoid responding by saying, <em>“No comment,” </em>which, in itself, is a comment—and not generally taken positively. A good neutral approach is, <em>“I’m not prepared to talk about that right now.</em></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>CONFIRM YOU GOT YOUR MAIN MESSAGES ACROSS </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Close every interview by asking the reporter to summarize the most important points they gathered from the conversation. If they don’t include your key points in their review, or state something that isn’t quite right, this is your final opportunity clarify any misunderstandings and remind them of your main points. Whenever possible, also offer to be available for follow-up questions or fact checking.</p>
<p>It would be gratifying if one result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be a lasting increase in public and media interest in scientific expertise, and appreciation of the importance of science in decision making at every level—from personal health decisions to state and federal policy making. And it is inspiring to see so many scientists stepping up to the plate to share what they know in this time of need. Handling interactions with journalists skillfully today can pay off personally, professionally, and for society for many years to come.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2020/04/us-funding-for-world-health-organization-should-not-be-interrupted-during-covid-19-pandemic-say-presidents-of-the-nas-nae-and-nam"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">statement</span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"> warning that interrupting funding for World Health Organization (WHO) would be a critical failure for our global health security. PLOS stands with the assessment of our nation’s top scientists: this is not a time to turn inward, but to collaborate for immediate, robust and concentrated international action. </span></p>
<p>As the <i>PLOS Medicine</i> editors indicate in a <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2020/04/16/we-need-to-support-the-who-not-stop-its-funding-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">perspective</span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, the WHO is the only global health organization that has the tools to combat a pandemic of truly global consequences.</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">To halt funding now would risk the lives of many who rely on the WHO’s essential services and debilitate our collective progress towards understanding the virus and curbing the impact of the pandemic.</span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/dUeIsrnusZw/">The importance of being second – PLOS-wide edition</a></h4>

<div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239" rel="author" target="_blank">orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239</a></div><p> </p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our journals which are selective for novelty — PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Pathogens — have all revised their ‘scooping’ policy to waive the novelty criteria for work submitted within six months of a similar study having been published. If your almost-completed work was ‘scooped’ by a study published today, it will still be considered novel by these journals, giving you the time to rigorously complete it and submit it within the next six months.  </span></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a better demonstration of the reproducibility of a piece of research than two or more labs independently and rigorously conducting the same work in parallel? Whether they reach similar results or uncover intriguing differences, the studies complement and add value to each other, providing validation or additional insight. Yet, in the current incentives landscape in scientific research, it too often matters most to be first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of this flawed incentive system are particularly acute in the life and biomedical sciences. Because of it, labs aware of competition race to complete a study and publish it first, researchers are wary of posting results on preprint servers or presenting unpublished results at conferences to avoid tipping off competitors. And yes, in that race to be first the temptation to cut corners can be high. Because if you come second, your study will most likely be rejected from your journal of choice for not being deemed novel. You will likely endure the protracted journey of finding a journal that will consider your work, or find yourself in need of adding more results to provide ‘sufficiently novel insight’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t have to be like that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by a desire to nudge the norms of research assessment, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pioneered an expanded </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘complementary research’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. Under that policy, manuscripts that confirm or extend a recently published study are eligible for consideration at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The editors’ experience has been exemplary — the ‘scooped’ studies they considered were thorough, of high quality and their comparison with the complementary study provided even more value to the research question. Two of the first researchers who experienced the policy first-hand </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006843"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eloquently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across PLOS, we’ve been watching the reactions to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of course never considered novelty as a criterion, but until recently the existing policy at all other journals was to protect from ‘scooping’ from the time of submission only. The experience of a highly-selective journal like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it expanded this protection period to six months before submission was intriguing to all, and editors started becoming more lenient about scooping. The results from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the experience across the portfolio convinced the Editors-in-Chief of all PLOS journals of the value of this policy for scientific research in general and all PLOS journals now have adopted the same policy (</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/complementary-research"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see for example PLOS Genetics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that for all researchers intent on conducting rigorous research this helps relieve the pressure to submit before others, allowing them to do all proper controls and analyses that make their results more robust. We also hope that other journals and research assessors take note so that ultimately the norms can change across the landscape. As a widely-adopted policy, this would be a game-changer for researchers whose careers hang on the prominence of their publications and revolutionize the way we plan, execute and attribute credit for scientific research.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, we should all recognize that being first is not always the most important.</span></p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Are you an evening person — an owl? Or a morning person — a lark? No end of studies have reported variations in the functioning of people who like to wake and go to bed late, versus those who are early to bed and early to rise. And now a new study, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230169">published in <em>PLoS One</em></a>, has found links between our “chronotype” and the way we handle emotions, reflect on our thoughts and feelings, and assert ourselves. Overall, owls do worse. And this, argues Juan Manuel Antúnez at the University of Malaga, Spain, could help to explain links between being an owl and poorer psychological well-being.</p>
<p><span id="more-39466"></span>Antúnez recruited 2,283 healthy Spanish men and women, aged 18-60 years, to complete a series of online questionnaires. First, their chronotype was assessed. This revealed that about 28% were owls, about 23% were larks, and the rest were neither. (This is similar to the estimated spread in the general population, with about 20% of us falling into each of the extreme groups and the remaining 60% in the middle.)</p>
<p>The participants also completed a questionnaire that explored their use of two different strategies for emotional regulation: “cognitive reappraisal”, which involves reframing a stressful situation to lessen its emotional impact and is related to greater well-being; and emotion suppression, which is maladaptive and is related to psychological problems like depression.</p>
<p>Another scale assessed participants’ meta-cognitions — the way they think about their thoughts and feelings. This scale included measures of maladaptive thought processes about feelings (for example, thinking that worry is useful for avoiding future problems) and thoughts (such as: “I should be controlling my thoughts all of the time” and “I am constantly aware of my thinking”).</p>
<p>The final measure asked the participants to report their own level of assertiveness — their tendency to (non-aggressively) affirm a right or a point of view.</p>
<p>The responses showed that chronotype was indeed related to these measures. The closer a participant was to the lark extreme, the more likely they were to use (beneficial) cognitive reappraisal to regulate their emotions. Those who were closer to the owl extreme were more likely to use suppression, however. This strategy has been related to all kinds of problems, including depression and decreased well-being, self-esteem, and social functioning.</p>
<p>Owls also scored highest for maladaptive ways of thinking about their thoughts and feelings. And they reported the lowest levels of assertiveness, while larks reported the highest. Assertiveness is a core skill for well-being, Antúnez notes, so could protect against psychological problems.</p>
<p>These results held even after controlling for gender and age-related differences. And for all the measures, those with an intermediate chronotype — who were neither owl nor lark — scored in the middle zone.</p>
<p>Because, biologically-speaking, owls only “wake up” later in the day, after normal school and work start times, they are out of sync with most countries’ daily routines. This “social jetlag” has been linked to greater fatigue. Perhaps that fatigue drives the poorer owl results on the measures in his study, Antúnez suggests. But, as he says, studies that follow people over time will be required to explore this.</p>
<p>Still, “although future longitudinal studies are needed,” he writes, “[the] results emphasize evening-type as a risk factor for the development of psychological disturbances and morning-type as a protective factor against those.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>Do you often spend time with your friends in order to forget about personal problems? Do you think about your friends even when you’re not with them? Have you even gone as far as ignoring your family to spend time with your friends?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to these questions, you might fit the criteria for “offline friend addiction”, according to a new scale <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/7x85m/">described in a preprint</a> on <em>PsyArxiv. </em>Except, of course, that this notion is ridiculous. How can we be addicted to socialising, the fulfilment of one of our basic human needs?</p>
<p>Well, that’s pretty much the point of the new paper, written with tongue firmly in cheek. But behind it is a serious argument: although a scale for offline friend addiction is clearly absurd, there’s another, similar concept for which such scales have already been developed — social media addiction.</p>
<p><span id="more-39471"></span>Some psychologists have expressed concern that social media is damaging our mental health or that we’ve become dependent on it, and as much as a third of the population can be classified as “addicted” using measures of social media addiction. But many aspects of social media fulfil our need to connect with others. So could people actually be addicted to socialising more generally, even when that occurs offline?</p>
<p>To investigate this not-entirely-serious question, Liam Satchell from the University of Winchester and colleagues developed the Offline-Friend Addiction Questionnaire, or O-FAQ.</p>
<p>The team created the scale by mimicking the process used to develop measures of social media addiction. Many of these were adapted from scales for other problems such as alcohol craving, replacing references to alcohol with references to social media. So the team decided to adapt these social media addiction scales in the same way: for instance, instead of respondents indicating if they “spent more time on Facebook than initially intended”, they were asked if they had “spent more time with friends than I initially intended”. The team ended up with a 37-item questionnaire, which 807 participants completed.</p>
<p>In the past, researchers have attempted to prove that social media addiction scales are valid by showing that they are associated with related measures, such as scales of problematic behaviour. So again, the authors did the same thing, “validating” the O-FAQ by demonstrating that participants’ scores were associated with risk-taking behaviour and certain personality traits. Some participants also completed the questionnaire again 28 days later, allowing the team to show that participants responded consistently across time.</p>
<p>Finally, to figure out how many people were friend addicts, the team again used criteria from past work, in which a person is considered “addicted” if they score at the midpoint or above on more than half of the questions. This revealed that 69% of respondents were addicted to their friends.</p>
<p>Should we be worried about this apparent friendship addiction crisis? Obviously not, say the researchers. “’Offline friend addiction’ is not an issue of concern for public health, but rather it is capturing experiences pertinent to social support, adaptation, and well-being across the lifespan,” they write.</p>
<p>But the point is that measures of social media addiction <em>also </em>capture these experiences. We might use social media to give or receive emotional support, for instance, or to hang out with our friends after a long day. Yet these scales don’t take this context into account. “What we have demonstrated here is that researchers can quickly produce farcical results when conceptualising social media as a distinctive entity that is unrelated to any other social context,” the team writes.</p>
<p>The work also highlights how easy — and potentially problematic — it is to claim that a scale is valid and use it to diagnose people when there aren’t actually any recognised diagnostic criteria to compare it against. Neither offline friend addiction nor social media addiction are formal psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Of course, in the current crisis the paper has taken on new relevance. Right now we are unable to see our “offline friends”, and for many of us the internet is the main means of communication. So perhaps, as psychologist Amy Orben <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/26/how-psychology-researchers-are-responding-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">suggested to us</a> last month, we will begin to see the emergence of a more nuanced conversation about the benefits and risks of social media.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the team are not the first to develop a tongue-in-cheek measure to make a point about technology use. The term “Internet Addiction Disorder” was reportedly first coined in 1995 by psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg, who posted satirical diagnostic criteria for the new “disorder” to a psychology bulletin board. “To medicalize every behavior by putting it into psychiatric nomenclature is ridiculous”, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/13/just-click-no">Goldberg told the <em>New Yorker</em></a> back in 1997. More than 20 years later, the authors of the new study conclude with a similar message: “We urge future social media research to focus on testing what components of social media use are distinct to offline social information seeking, especially when attempting to pathologise everyday behaviour.”</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p>One of the most important and durable findings in moral and political psychology is that there is a tail-wags-the-dog aspect to human morality. Most of us like to think we have carefully thought-through, coherent moral systems that guide our behaviour and judgements. In reality our behaviour and judgements often stem from gut-level impulses, and only after the fact do we build elaborate moral rationales to justify what we believe and do.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-23351-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> examines this issue through a fascinating lens: free will. Or, more specifically, via people’s judgments about how much free will others had when committing various transgressions. The team, led by Jim A. C. Everett of the University of Kent and Cory J. Clark of Durham University, ran 14 studies geared at evaluating the possibility that at least some of the time the moral tail wags the dog: first people decide whether someone is blameworthy, and <em>then</em> judge how much free will they have, in a way that allows them to justify blaming those they want to blame and excusing those they want to excuse.</p>
<p><span id="more-39454"></span>The researchers examined this hypothesis, for which there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660989">already some evidence</a>, through the lens of American partisan politics. In the paper they note that previous research has shown that conservatives have a greater belief in free will than liberals, and are more moralising in general (that is, they categorise a larger number of acts as morally problematic, and rely on a greater number of principles — or moral foundations — in making these judgements). The first two of the new studies replicated these findings — this is consistent with the idea, put simply, that conservatives believe in free will more because it allows them to level more moral judgements.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to unpack in the remaining studies, but here are a few of the key findings:</p>
<p><strong>In Study 4</strong>, the researchers found that when it came to attribution of free will in instances that were viewed as “equally immoral for liberals and conservatives,” (such as spreading malicious rumours about a co-worker) there was no longer any correlation between participants’ political stance (liberal vs. conservative) and their evaluations of how much free will the transgressor had. This lends support to the idea that “differences in conservatives’ and liberals’ perception of free will may be partially due to differences in moralisation, rather than representing any generalised, abstract belief that human behaviours are freely chosen.”</p>
<p><strong>In Study 5</strong>, the researchers found that when they deliberately presented participants with hypothetical acts designed to be viewed as more immoral by liberals — such as “Robert sends a formal complaint to his child’s school after finding that his child’s kindergarten teacher is transgendered” — the normal pattern reversed itself, and it was now liberals who attributed more free will to the actors in question. (This finding was weaker, and only statistically significant when the researchers bumped up their sample beyond its initial size.)</p>
<p><strong>In Study 7</strong>, the researchers synthesised the aforementioned findings and randomly assigned online participants recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to situations in which the person committing a bad act was either described as liberal or conservative and as acting in order to achieve liberal or conservative goals. After confirming  that the MTurk respondents viewed moral harms against their own political group more harshly, the researchers also found “tentative — but weak — evidence” in favour of their overall hypothesis: liberal MTurkers viewed conservative bad actors as having more free will than bad-acting liberals, and conservative MTurkers viewed liberal bad actors  as having more free will than bad-acting conservatives. In short, when people take political actions that we morally disapprove of, we’re more inclined to believe they did it of their own volition. This bias afflicts conservatives more often, because they’re more morally disapproving, but can just as easily afflict liberals.</p>
<p>Some of the evidence is mixed, but overall the paper suggests that even judgments about free will (a complex philosophical concept that has been the subject of much debate and introspection) can’t escape the gut-impulse nature that underlies so much human moralising. Though preliminary, this is an important finding that could have ramifications for society. For one thing, if we have a tendency to view agents as more free when their bad acts offend us politically, but as less free when they don’t, that’s the sort of psychological tendency that could be echoed in law enforcement.</p>

<h4>How to spot a neuroscientist in the wild</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYbi9HRLcuUFVT_ivl83nQ.jpeg" />Neuroethologist in the wild. Image credit: Pixabay</figure><p>We here report the discovery of a new species of the genus Homo, for which we propose the binomial <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em>. Despite dating their last common ancestor with <em>Homo sapiens</em> to within a mere hundred years ago, the evolutionary pressure of being forced to reckon with the most complex organ in known existence has driven rapid divergence in <em>Neuroscientus</em>. This has given rise to an absurdly overextended obsession with the brain, while atrophying other, normal features of the genus Homo. Indeed, in our field studies we found the sense of social etiquette to be vestigial at best.</p><p>Over two decades of close observation we have identified a number of sub-species. While we believe these sub-species to be technically capable of interbreeding, they are rarely seen interacting in the wild, and so must be considered distinct. Here we present a field guide to identifying these sub-species from their characteristics</p><h4>Mimics</h4><p>There are a number of species that attempt to mimic <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em>, but are easily distinguished upon close observation. Two in particular are noteworthy:</p><p><strong>Neurobollocker</strong></p><p>Sapiens that append the prefix “neuro-” to any random noun to make it sound smart and brain-y. Particularly egregious examples include neuro-marketing, neuro-law, and neuro-criticism. Frequently confuse neuroscience with psychology.</p><p><strong>Cranks</strong></p><p>A sub-species of Sapiens easily identified by their mantra “I’ve got a theory for how the whole brain works”. Scourge of inboxes. Somehow oblivious that the collective efforts of the highly intelligent few hundred thousand members of the below <em>Homo Neuroscientus</em> sub-species have been ultimately aimed at that very same thing, across all scales at which brains work, for about a hundred years — yet have not constructed a working theory.</p><h4>Sub-species</h4><p><strong>The Electrophysiologist</strong></p><p>The recorder of single neurons, lowerer of electrodes. Notable tribes include the patch-clampers, whose cruel initiation rites require attaching a micrometer-scale piece of glass to the body of a neuron ten times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. Some among this tribe, possibly insane, attempt the same in awake, moving animals. They are easily distinguished from other <em>Neuroscientus</em> by the rhythmic beating of their heads against the lab bench when losing yet another neuron after just three trials of behaviour are complete.</p><p><strong>The Systems Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>Distinguishable from the electrophysiologist by trying to record from many neurons at the same time, and relate them to something in the outside world. Comes in many tribes, from the sensory obsessives, the memorists and decisionists, to the motor wagglers, through others that identify themselves by blobs of the brain — the corticians, cerebellites, the basal gang, the hippocampites, the amygdalarians — to yet others that identify with the type of brain — the worm-wranglers, the fly-fanciers, the sea-sluggers. To the naive observer these tribes would all seem to be working towards the same goal, but vicious internecine wars frequently erupt within and between tribes.</p><p>Insufferably smug since members of their subspecies were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2014 (“we’re a real science now”), they are nonetheless handicapped by the crudeness of their tools, which has led to the Humphries Uncertainty Principle: they can either record precisely when neurons send spikes but not know exactly where they are, or know precisely where they are but not know exactly when they send spikes (they call these “multi-electrode recording” and “calcium imaging”, respectively).</p><p><strong>The Cognitive Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>This subspecies is more intensely interested in us Sapiens than any other. We find it useful to distinguish a number of breeds, albeit with some overlap:</p><p>Neuroimager — often referred to by other subspecies as “a psychologist with a magnet”, they adore rainbow colours. A deeply superstitious people, yet highly intelligent. In their writings frequent references are made to “Bonferroni”, possibly a deity, and they will cross themselves and mutter curses to the heavens upon hearing the phrase “dead salmon”. But the complex incantations necessary to turn the magnetic alignment of oxygen-depleted haemoglobin into a measurable signal of brain activity is testament to their ingenuity.</p><p>Scalp tickler — a “psychologist with a hairnet”, readily identified by their distinctive calls. Anthropologists have transcribed some of these calls (lit. “P100”, “N2”), but have yet to discern their meaning. Some authorities subdivide a further breed, the Magnetiser, a psychologist with a quantum thingy.</p><p>The Paddlers — believe that waving a magic wand near the scalp of a Sapiens will variously cause involuntary movement, enhance their mathematical ability, or let them experience the presence of god(s).</p><p><strong>The Neuroanatomist</strong><br />Was thought to be going extinct, until the Connectomics Explosion approximately 15YA rapidly diversified the gene pool, with many new, previously unrecorded phenotypes appearing.</p><p><strong>Neural Engineer</strong><br />Consider the brain to be a feedback loop. Fiddles with amplifier settings until the squealing stops.</p><p><strong>Behavioural Neuroscientist</strong><br />Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching a rodent press a lever. Talks almost entirely in capital letters (example transcript: “the US will become the CS, but leave the UR intact”).</p><p><strong>Neuroethologist </strong><br />Attempts to infer the workings of the brain from watching an animal go about its daily routine. Barely on speaking terms with Behavioural Neuroscientists.</p><p><strong>Neuroendocrinologist</strong><br />Slightly hormonal. Obsessed with how everything sloshing around the brain that isn’t a neurotransmitter affects brain cells. Believes a “raster plot” is a graph drawn by a Bob Marley fan.</p><p><strong>Molecular neuroscientist </strong><br />Applies the tools of close cousins the molecular biologist to the brain. Loves the stuff floating inside cells, especially proteins and complex chains of chemicals signalling to each other. Unable to distinguish the brain from the liver without assistance.</p><p><strong>Neurogeneticist</strong><br />Obsessed with the expression of bits of DNA and RNA in brain cells. Unable to distinguish the brain from yeast without assistance.<br /> <br /><strong>Clinical Neuroscientist </strong><br />Haughty and proud, these interact the most with Homo sapiens, bringing their skills to treat the damaged and sick among that closely-related species. Males of this sub-species are thought to be born wearing a suit and tie.</p><p><strong>Computational Neuroscientist</strong></p><p>Often gaunt, frequently shunning daylight, these shy creatures have also a number of distinctive breeds. Recent gene sequencing work on this sub-species has revealed evidence of lateral gene transfer from known species of Physicists, Mathematicians, and Computer Scientists. The consequent melange of languages spoken among members of this sub-species often collapses interactions into mutual bafflement.</p><p>Circuit modeller — Literal-minded to a fault, these build exact scale models of bits of brain. Often try to show them to their fellow Systems Neuroscientists working on the same bit of brain, but suffer frequent barbs and social rejection (“Suited for a more specialist journal”).</p><p>The Algorithmics — Seek the Holy Grail of the step-by-step instructions by which the brain works. Once discovered that deep-lying neurons, which may or may not contain dopamine, send a signal that looked like the difference: [actual value of what happened] — [predicted value of what happened]. Have been banging on about it for the past 25 years.</p><p>Compartmentalist — Uses a thousand equations to describe a single neuron, none of whose parameters are experimentally determined. Often found weeping silently into a drink at conference bars. Worship at the Church of Rall.</p><p>The Bayesians — Have discovered a hammer, and are determined to use it on absolutely bloody anything that’s not already nailed down.</p><p><strong>Karl Friston</strong><br />Unclassifiable.</p><p><em>Want more?

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology/">The importance of character during war</a></h4>

<p>Nearly 20 years of war following the events of September 11 has resulted in advances in military psychology that stand to improve the well-being of all people, military and civilian alike. The symbiotic relationship between psychology and the military traces back to World War I. With the advent of US involvement in the war, the army and navy had to select and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers and sailors for increasingly technical jobs. Compared to nineteenth-century wars, World War I required military personnel to operate far more advanced and complicated equipment including aircraft, tanks, and communications systems. To match military personnel to jobs in which they would excel, the military turned to psychologists to develop new aptitude tests rapidly. The tests developed for the military vastly improved the reliability and validity of aptitude testing. Such testing became common in civilian institutions after the war.</p><p>Similarly, World War II stimulated psychologists to conduct further research on how to diagnose and treat combat stress and psychological injuries of war. With millions of Americans having served in the war, this knowledge provided a significant boost to clinical psychology. World War II also created a new area of psychology, human factors engineering. Engineers needed psychologists to help them understand the limits of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities in order to design ever more complex weapons and communications systems. The Vietnam War saw the emergence of the understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder, first studied among soldiers and veterans, but soon recognized to be a risk for anyone exposed to severe trauma. Our current understanding of PTSD, its causes, and how to treat it are due in no small measure to the efforts of military psychologists.</p><p>In the same manner, the war on terrorism has resulted in a renewed effort by military psychologists to better understand factors that enable military personnel to perform at their best, as well as to better understand suboptimal adjustment or pathology. This emerging research promises benefits to civilians as well. A great example is the military’s research on character and its links to individual and team performance.</p><p>Positive character traits like integrity, determination, and courage have long been identified as essential attributes of military personnel. The emergence of positive psychology in the late 1990s provided a new science-focused perspective on character among military personnel. The results of almost 20 years of research are now providing a clearer picture of the role of positive character in leading others in dangerous contexts. For example, trust — an essential element in leadership in any domain — is heavily dependent on the character traits of integrity, caring for others, and moral courage. Both research and practical leadership experience demonstrate the critical role of character in trust and leadership.</p><p>Cadets at the nation’s service academies live under an honor code that dictates they will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. Military affiliation trumps nationality when it comes to the ranking of top character strengths. In comparing US military academy cadets with Royal Norwegian Naval Academy cadets and US civilian college students, military psychologists discovered that US cadets were more similar to their Norwegian cadet counterparts than they were to US civilian college students. The strongest character attributes among the military cadets regardless of nationality were honesty, hope, bravery, persistence, and teamwork. For the US civilian college students, the highest strengths were kindness, sense of humor, honesty, and judgment.</p><p>Army researchers have discovered strong links between individual character and personal adjustment and have developed a program to enhance positive character among its soldiers. Military psychologists have found that positive character traits such as hope and optimism, persistence, self-regulation, social intelligence, and leadership contribute to the emotional and social sense of well-being, and to a sense of meaning and purpose in life. Soldiers high in these and related character strengths are less vulnerable to combat stress, perform better at their jobs, and are more likely to remain in the military compared to those low in these strengths.</p><p>Research on character provides just one of many intriguing examples of how military psychology continues to contribute to our knowledge of general psychology. After all, the challenges and stresses that military personnel face are far too easily found in other walks of life. Military research on both positive individual and organizational character have significant implications for how to optimize individual and team performance in law enforcement agencies, sports teams, schools, and in corporations. Thus, the efforts of military psychologists continue to provide insights into human behavior that stand to help us all to perform at our best and to live our lives to the fullest.</p><p>Featured photo by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@mentorofficial?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Vladislav Nikonov</a> on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/s/photos/military?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-character-during-war/">The importance of character during war</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621459582/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621459582/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621459582/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-ethics-of-defeating-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">The ethics of defeating COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/denying-climate-change-is-hurting-our-health/" rel="nofollow">Denying climate change is hurting our health</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why we like a good robot story</a></h4>

<p>Jim and Kerry Kelly live in a small town in the rural Midwest. Their sons, Ben, six, and Ryan, twelve, attend the local public school. Their school district is always short staffed. The closest town is 40 miles away and the pay for teachers is abysmal.</p><p>This year, the district’s staffing has hit a critical low: Class size will have to be huge, and there’s limited money for aides who might help with the teaching load, which will further discourage teacher applications. The school board considers accepting underqualified teachers. Parents are up in arms. Teachers and principals are stressed. The situation comes to a head at a school board meeting that drags on past midnight with shouting, frustration, threats, and anger. But, it’s too important to back off. Children’s futures are at stake.</p><p>In the next week, the superintendent finds a possible solution. The state has money available to help school boards implement technology in qualified districts. The Kellys’ town qualifies. They can receive funds to buy robots to serve in the classrooms. The robots can assume some of the teaching load, improve teaching quality, and relieve the overcrowding.</p><p>Ten years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Soulless machines educating our children? But, solutions are few, and the superintendent has found reports of success from other schools. He sells his plan well, and against all expectations, the school board agrees. The following fall, the Kelly kids, like all the kids in the district, have a robot in the classroom.</p><p>At the half-year mark, the school board reviews their decision. In six-year-old Ben’s class, the results are outstanding. Kids learn fast—pretty much as fast from the robot as from the human teacher. And, the kids like the interactions with the machines. The teacher can accomplish more and is less stressed in the process. Everyone is pleased.</p><p>But Ryan’s class, at age eleven, has a far different experience. The robot used in their class is identical to the one in Ben’s class—very human-like. By January, the kids hate it. They call it names; they hit it; they learn little from it. By midyear, it sits in a corner, scorned by students and teacher alike.</p><p>This scenario is fiction, but it reflects the real world. Many school districts are hurting for staff, and robots are entering the classroom. In Japan, Robovie speaks and teaches English with elementary school children, like Robosem does in Korea. In the United States, RUBI teaches children Finnish. Child-like robots are helping autistic children practice social interactions through imitation-teaching games.</p><p>Using robots as teachers makes some sense. Children learn much of their knowledge from others: parents, teachers, peers. Children trust that 8 × 8 = 64, that Earth is round, and that dinosaurs are extinct, not because they have uncovered these facts themselves but because reliable sources have told them so. Research shows that children are adapted to learn general knowledge from human communication. The phenomenon is known as “trust in testimony.”</p><p>But, do children trust the testimony of robots? Does it matter if the robot behaves, responds, or even looks like a human? If children learn from a robot, do they learn in the same way they learn from a human teacher? Excellent questions.</p><p>Research shows that when children as young as preschool age learn from other people, they monitor their informants’ knowledge, expertise, and confidence. They remember whether a person has given them accurate information in the past. They also monitor an informant’s access to information: Did she see the thing she is telling me about? They attend to the person’s qualifications: Is he a knowledgeable adult or a naïve child?</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about how and if children learn from robots. Because robots are machines, children could see them as infallible, like calculators or electronic dictionaries. If so, they might accept any information from a robot without considering if it is accurate. Or, children might see robots as a more fallible machine: a toaster that burns the toast, a virtual assistant that can give wrong or even outlandish answers or an alarm clock that goes off in the middle of the night. If so, they might resist a robot’s teachings.</p><p>Young children clearly can and do learn from robots, and they are appropriately choosy about the sort of robot teachers they accept. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190860974.001.0001/oso-9780190860974-chapter-8">Research </a>also shows that young children are more likely to learn from and accept robot teachers that are older children—just like in Ben Kelly’s first grade classroom—and older children are less likely, even unlikely, to do so—like in Ryan Kelly’s sixth grade classroom.</p><p>Isaac Asimov’s book, <em>I, Robot</em>, is primarily about morality and robotics: how robots interact with humans for good or evil. Most of the stories revolve around the efforts of Dr. Susan Calvin, chief roboticist for the fictional U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Incorporated (USRMM), the primary producer of advanced humanoid robots in the world. She worries about aberrant behavior of advanced robots, and she develops a new field, robopsychology, to help figure out what is going on in their electrical (“positronic”) brains.</p><p>All robots produced by USRMM are meant to be programmed with the “Three Laws of Robotics:”</p><ul><li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li><li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li><li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li></ul><p>But in Asimov’s stories, flaws are found in the robots and their prototypes. These lead to robots imploding, harming people, and in one key case, killing a man.</p><p><em>I, Robot</em> stories have spawned numerous spin-offs, continuations, and commentaries. A 2004 episode of <em>The Simpsons</em> (titled “I, D’oh Bot”) featured a robot boxer named Smashius Clay. Smashius, self-defeatingly, follows all of Asimov’s three laws and loses to every human he fights.</p><p>The Twentieth Century Fox 2004 film, <em>I, Robot</em>, starred Will Smith as detective Dell Spooner of the 2035 Chicago police department. Dell investigates a murder of the roboticist Dr. Alfred Lanning, which may have been at the hand of a USRMM robot.</p><p>Currently, robots like Robovie (or NAO or RUBI or other robots designed to interact with adults or with children) don’t have moral codes programmed in. But then, they also don’t have anything like full positronic machine intelligence. Conversely, we don’t have laws or codes about how to treat robots. For example, should a really human-like robot have rights? In November 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sophia-robot-citizen-womens-rights-detriot-become-human-hanson-robotics">granted a very human-looking robot, Sophia, citizenship</a>. This set off an uproar about rights among women in Saudi Arabia. For example, Saudi women must veil their faces when they are in public; Sophia appeared in public and on TV without a veil.</p><p>Researchers, robot designers, parents, and teachers have become increasingly concerned that interactions with robots will promote antisocial behaviors. A hitchhiking robot who traveled a bit around Europe, taking pictures and carrying on conversations with other travelers, was vandalized and destroyed after several extended weeks in the United States. And, it’s easy to imagine a world where robots displace humans from jobs and so are attacked and sabotaged by those they’ve displaced.</p><p>Research suggests that antisocial behaviors toward robots can be reduced by modifying the robots. Preschool children in a classroom comforted a robot with a hug and protected it from aggression when it started to cry after being damaged or played with too roughly. At least <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04837-001">one study</a> has shown that younger children say a robot should be treated fairly and should not be psychologically harmed after having conversed and played with the robot for fifteen minutes.</p><p>Every year, robots become a larger part of our lives. You can find robots in malls, hotels, assembly lines, hospitals and, of course, research labs. The National Robotics Initiative <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641">foresees a future</a> in which “robots are as commonplace as today’s automobiles, computers, and cell phones. Robots will be found in homes, offices, hospitals, factories, farms, and mines; and in the air, on land, under water, and in space.”</p><p>And robots are becoming more and more present in the lives of children. They are already teaching children in classrooms and helping them in hospitals. Robovie is just one of many robots that have been manufactured in the last few years designed to be used with children–created to play games, answer questions, read stories, and even watch children unsupervised.</p><p>This unbridled production of hopefully child-friendly robots certainly needs more research. But, it’s clear that in some ways and at some ages children can successfully learn from robot teachers who actively interact with them.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Andy Kelly from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/0E_vhMVqL9g"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/">Why we like a good robot story</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621138918/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/denying-climate-change-is-hurting-our-health/" rel="nofollow">Denying climate change is hurting our health</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2019/04/will-robots-really-take-our-jobs/" rel="nofollow">Will robots really take our jobs?</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JYqJBgwZHgw/">Learning how we can support researchers during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that your daily routines have probably changed due to COVID-19. Whether you’re keeping more distance between yourself and others, working from home more often, or feeling isolated by larger-scale shutdowns, it may take awhile for things to go back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time of uncertainty, we want you to know: we are here to support you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without knowing at this point what the long-term impact will be of interrupted research projects, conferences, and teaching schedules, we’re trying to find out more about you and your unique situation so that we can provide you with the information you most want. Last week, we launched a survey for researchers to let us know how their work has changed in recent weeks and we wanted to share some of the preliminary results with you as we dig in deeper.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a couple of caveats.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This survey data comes from an informal marketing poll surfaced through email and on our site beginning on March 27. The survey links are still available and we’re collecting new responses every day but the summary below is based off of responses received between March 27 and April 3 only.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also posted a simplified version on our Twitter account to take the pulse from a broader community. Those data are not included in this summary but we saw very similar trends.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Survey Structure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the initial question was the same for each researcher who entered the survey, the second-tier question was tailored to their response from Question 1. Partial responses (results where researchers answered the first question only) are included in the breakdown below.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-42953" height="436" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3-1024x436.png" width="1024" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the scale of the impact?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most researchers said their work was interrupted  in some way, either by restricted access to their labs, or a need to take personal time off. Only 7.2% of respondents reported that their lab was open and operating normally. Another 4.3% reported that their work is directly relevant to the outbreak and are actively investigating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those few whose labs were operating normally, 33.3% were “very” concerned that they would see steeper closures in the next few days.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42952" style="width: 600px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42952 size-full" height="371" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown to Question #1. Total Responses: 54, 749</figure>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In what ways are researchers able to continue their work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those whose labs or institutions have been closed, many researchers have found a way to continue their work remotely (36.2%). Of those, 58.6% reported that their research, or elements of it, could be done without a lab, although 34.8% said they had to shift to something like protocol design or new analysis that would not require a lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the researchers who’ve had to change their focus (26%) or cancel fieldwork entirely (18%), writing and training have become the major focus.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42954" style="width: 600px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42954 size-full" height="371" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown for Question 2 for those who said they needed to cancel or shift the focus of their existing work</figure>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As researchers’ needs change, so should the way we support them</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Serving authors on the front lines</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those respondents who have told us they are actively investigating research related to the coronavirus, speed matters more than anything else. At PLOS, we are fast-tracking all research related to COVID-19, the first studies of which we have already published and made available in our </span><a href="https://collections.plos.org/covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which surfaces research from across all PLOS Journals along with other relevant content. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Redefining priorities for career advancement</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of organizations have come together to support researchers during this time. For example,  the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) released a </span><a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/04/06/dora-statement-on-hiring-promotion-and-funding-decisions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week,calling on research institutions and universities to evaluate their hiring, promotion, and funding decisions within the context of the broad-scale interruptions researchers are facing in their daily work. The statement specifically asks institutions to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefine their expectations for productivity in the wake of the present pandemic.</span></li>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Knowing what to say when a friend is upset or stressed out can be a delicate balancing act. Sometimes the best route seems to be to offer advice and give practical suggestions as to how they should proceed; at other times, simply listening to what your friend has to say is by far the better option. But no matter your approach, ensuring that your friend feels validated is key, argue Xi Tian and colleagues in a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/70/1/13/5739595?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Communication</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39448"></span>The study starts with a question many of us have pondered ourselves: why do some well-intentioned attempts at comfort come off as insensitive instead?</p>
<p>To explore the question, the team asked 325 married adults to think of one person with whom they’d discussed their partner or marriage, and to imagine having a conversation with them about a recent argument they’d had with their spouse. They were then presented with one of six support messages, each of which was more or less person-centred — in other words, more or less willing to acknowledge and elaborate on the feelings of the upset person. Low person-centred messages focused on simply moving past the argument (e.g. “nobody is worth getting so worked up about… having an argument is not the worst thing that could happen to you”), whilst high person-centred messages were more engaged and acknowledged the individuals’ feelings (e.g. “you have every right to feel upset… it’s understandable you are stressed out”).</p>
<p>Participants then rated the support messages on a number of measures, including how controlling and dominant, direct and clear, or logical and well-justified the messages were. They also reported whether they felt pressured by their friend, and indicated the extent to which they experienced psychological “reactance”: that is, how angry they were after reading the message, and how critical they felt of it. Finally, they rated how optimistic they would feel after receiving the message and how much their emotions would improve.</p>
<p>As expected, low person-centred messages were not successful in helping people feel better about disputes with their partner, nor did they reduce emotional distress. These types of messages angered participants, and were also seen as domineering and lacked argument strength — in other words, they were neither convincing nor comforting.</p>
<p>In contrast, high person-centred messages were associated with higher levels of emotional improvement, which the team puts down partly to the fact participants felt little or no threat to their freedom when responding to these messages (i.e. they didn’t feel pressured or controlled by their friend). There was also less emotional reactance to high person-centred messages — participants felt less angry, less critical and less likely to argue with their friend.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the study: the messages participants received were, of course, fake, so the way they would feel about them in the context of a real conversation with a friend may differ from the artificial environment of the study. Future studies may also take into consideration the diversity of relationships and their social contexts — as the team notes, the majority of participants were in heterosexual relationships, in their first marriages and white.</p>
<p>There will, of course, be times when you believe a friend really is overreacting — that they’re making a big deal over nothing. At times like these, the results of this study may be useful to keep in mind. If you want to make them feel comforted, acknowledging, not dismissing, what they’re feeling is the way to go.</p>

At this writing, COVID-19 has affected more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html">173 countries</a>, causing <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4">972,303 infections and 50,322 deaths</a>. Highly contagious, coronavirus spreads through human-to-human contact, with the number of infections doubling every three days. Neither vaccine nor cure exists for COVID-19, although several <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins">clinical trials</a> are underway. Prevention is cure, and physical distancing is the most effective prevention endeavor.</p>
<p>Mandatory quarantines or non-mandatory stay-at-home advisories are in effect in countries around the world, affecting one third of the global population. Homebound, people are physically distant from wider social networks: school-age children are receiving homeschooling; college students are attending online classes from home; non-essential service employees are working from home.</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and 4-12% during pregnancy.</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11833 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/300px-Purple_ribbon.svg_-191x300.png" width="191" />Unfortunately, stay-at-home may not mean safer-at-home for millions of women worldwide. Home is where women experience violence in the hands of their spouses or extended family members. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027732">Domestic violence</a>, including physical, sexual, reproductive, emotional, or economic, is a health and human rights violation, leading to mental and physical health consequences, including death. Globally, <a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/">one in three women</a> experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70764/WHO_RHR_11.35_eng.pdf?sequence=1">4-12% </a>during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Domestic violence can be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns, which have been essential for suppressing the spread. Prior evidence makes it a possibility: domestic violence rates went up during <a href="https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrvv/25/5/588">emergencies</a> in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44126540?seq=1">US</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210377649?casa_token=GjwbzDKcC64AAAAA:3Zy3qOkMZDtbf5AcFxAlmRNIGgvC13FAD6d6bdw9rRFnWYlcXpU6tRFV6Pa9o3sWX_PXclVWK-HC">globally</a>. High risk (stuck in home with abuser), low protection (socially distant from family, friends, neighbors, coworkers) makes it a probability. Indeed, frontline workers <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">from a diverse set of countries</a> and cultures, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151">USA</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/domestic-violence-cases-jump-30-during-lockdown-in-france">France</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-violence/in-italy-support-groups-fear-lockdown-is-silencing-domestic-abuse-victims-idUSKBN21M0PM">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/COVID-19-Fears-of-Domestic-Violence-Rise-as-Millions-Confined-20200328-0009.html">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/rise-in-family-abuse-cases-in-australia-linked-to-covid-19">Australia</a>, <a href="https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/sharp-rise-in-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-outbreak/">Cyprus</a>, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/277940">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-fuels-domestic-violence-in-china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/lockdown-and-the-surge-in-domestic-violence/">Nepal</a>, <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/domestic-abuse-cases-rise-as-covid-19-lockdown-turns-into-captivity-for-many-women-819653.html">India</a>, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1652146/middle-east">Lebanon</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">South Africa</a>, have reported an increase in the number of calls to domestic-violence hotlines, or of police complaints. In absence of population-based estimates before and after COVID-19 lockdowns, existing reports are invaluable alternatives, indicating, at a minimum, an upswing in violence re-victimization, potentially globally.</p>
<p>To be clear, domestic violence happens in homosexual as well as heterosexual relationships. Violence can be perpetrated by both men and women against their partners of the same or opposite gender. However, men’s perpetration of violence against women is the <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/gender.pdf">most common form</a> of domestic violence worldwide, with consequences more intense, lingering <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24802">across generations</a>.</p>
<p>Preventing a potential outbreak of domestic violence during an emergency seems plausible. Conceptually, programs found to be effective in preventing conditions triggering men’s perpetration of domestic violence are likely be effective in reducing domestic violence. I discuss three such conditions and programs. Intersecting vulnerabilities (younger age, poverty, lower education levels) increase women’s vulnerability to experiencing multiple violence-triggering conditions, simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-induced economic recession heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration</p></blockquote>
<p>First, COVID-induced economic recession, and consequent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860387/">livelihood loss</a> by either or both partners, and subsequent financially stressful times leaving families with resource constraints for life essentials, or the need for rationing, heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration. Conversely, potential COVID-19 exposures through employment in essential services can be traumatic, triggering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-lockdown-domestic-violence.html">marital conflicts</a>. <a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/">Cognitive burdens</a> (preoccupation with financial woes impedes <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11831" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/wallet-300x200.jpg" width="300" />one’s ability to do the right thing; fear of disease exposure) make both partners vulnerable to violence perpetration; the higher social position of men make them more susceptible. The risk is greater for men holding traditional views on gender roles (feeling that they have failed as “the provider of the family,” and at-risk of losing power and control), growing up experiencing or watching violence (getting cues of action from “<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/WDR-2015-Full-Report.pdf">mental models</a>” of conflict resolutions), or are engaged in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00994.x">substance use</a> (blurring judgement, misplaced priorities), compared to men with comparable levels of vulnerability and susceptibility but without such attributes.</p>
<p>Second, disruptions in the operation of service-delivery institutions (e.g., schools; day care centers; restaurants; dry cleaners) and subsequent abrupt need for (primarily) women assuming significantly more roles than usual can result in women’s excessive workload, stress, anxiety, maladaptive coping including substance use, increasing their vulnerabilities to domestic violence (re)victimization.</p>
<p>Third, homebound for long, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/upshot/gender-roles-housework.html">couples</a>, even those more egalitarian, may experience increasing intensification or rebound of traditional gender roles and relations, with women, charged with caregiving among other domestic responsibilities, becoming the default target of blame for discomforts, inconveniences, or unmet needs. A prolonged, 24/7 stay at a proximity increases the use of household space and resources for meeting most daily-living essentials, increasing the frequency of interactions between intimate partners and, thereby, opportunities for marital conflicts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints</p></blockquote>
<p>As for violence prevention and mitigation, the following three policies or programs seem promising. However, a broader, multisectoral approach to address women’s deprivation in terms of education, nutrition, healthcare, family planning or economic empowerment underlying women’s vulnerability to violence should be integrated into overall emergency preparedness efforts.</p>
<p>First, a financial safety net (for example, <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=carsey">unemployment insurance in the US</a>, India’s direct unconditional cash transfers to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-mega-cash-transfer-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74975904.cms">women</a>, and poor households, etc.) will likely keep household’s overall consumption at a comparable level, enhancing women’s capacity for violence-risks management, and, thereb<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11829 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domvio-256x300.jpg" width="256" />y, enhancing the safety of women and their children. Second, addressing factors that trigger violence during stressful times is key. For example, a ban on alcohol sales, limiting hours of alcohol sales, or limiting the volume sold per person, as appropriate in each context, will curb access to alcoholic beverages, reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms including violence against women and children. Third, easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints (i.e., abuser is nearby) and relocate (i.e., women can still practice physical distancing in shelters), significantly limiting the risk of violence re-victimization. To ensure easy access, countries must ensure: (a) adequate resources for domestic-violence services and shelters as an essential service; and (b) <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/02/01/more-than-1-billion-women-lack-legal-protection-against-domestic-sexual-violence-finds-world-bank-study">legal protection against domestic violence</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in our common interest, as human beings and social and economic actors, to be serious about integrating domestic violence prevention and mitigation into COVID-19 preparedness and relief efforts. The alternative is unethical, keeping a blind eye to human right violations, and seems suboptimal: needing direct medical and mental health care services, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">global surge</a> in domestic violence could be <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/03/07/putting-a-price-on-violence-against-women-and-girls">costly</a>, potentially compromising COVID-19 responses inside and outside the health sector.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/07/hard-workers-are-more-inspiring-than-geniuses/">Hard Workers Are More Inspiring Than Geniuses</a></h4>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Albert Einstein is often used as the ultimate inspirational figure in science: an untamed genius with an abundance of innate brilliance. The proliferation of memes and inspirational quotes about his allegedly underwhelming school performance only serves to highlight exactly how naturally brilliant he really was, succeeding against the odds.</p>
<p>But, it turns out, he might not be quite as inspiring as you think: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2020.1734006">according to a study</a> published in <em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology, </em>it may in fact be hard work, not innate genius, that really inspires people to get into STEM.<span id="more-39443"></span></p>
<p>The first study focused on two specific scientists: Einstein, who is generally viewed as a genius whose success came from his talent, and Edison, whose success is seen to have come from hard work — famously, it took him over one thousand attempts to successfully create the lightbulb. Danfei Hu from Penn State and colleagues gave 176 participants a story about either Einstein or Edison, both of which included details about struggles, challenges and setbacks the scientists had supposedly faced during their career (in fact, the stories for each scientist were exactly the same).</p>
<p>Participants then filled in a survey to measure their views on talent and intelligence, rating how much they agreed with statements including “only geniuses can be good scientists”, “some people just aren’t cut out for science” and “you have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can’t do much to change it”. Participants then completed an apparently unconnected maths task, designed to investigate their approaches to problem-solving.</p>
<p>Those in the Edison condition were less likely to see exceptional talent as necessary for a scientist’s success, and slightly more likely to believe that intelligence was malleable or changeable. This group also performed better on the mathematical task, suggesting that they’d received a boost in motivation by reading about a scientist known for his work ethic.</p>
<p>To look at the impact of fame on motivation and inspiration, the team recruited 162 participants for a second study. Participants once again read one of two identical stories about a struggling scientist, half reading about Einstein and the other about Mark Johnson, a fictional scientist whom none of them had heard of.</p>
<p>Again, participants who read about Mark Johnson were less likely to believe that innate genius or talent was necessary for success than those who read about Einstein — and they performed better in the maths test, too. This suggests that a non-famous scientist may in fact make for a more effective role model than a famous, “genius” scientist.</p>
<p>A final study looked at all three scientists simultaneously: 288 participants read either about the struggles of Edison, Einstein or the non-famous scientist. Those who read about Einstein appeared less motivated than those who read about the non-famous scientist, while those who read about Edison were more motivated, suggesting that the two role models had opposite effects.</p>
<p>The team suggests that being exposed to a stereotypically “genius” scientist makes people feel brilliance is a prerequisite to succeed — that it’s essential, rather than an additional benefit. As many people don’t particularly see themselves as innately brilliant, their performance — and their interest and motivation to do well in science — is therefore diminished.</p>
<p>The successes of someone like Edison, however, might seem more in reach — his example suggests that scientific successes are related more to effort and self-control than they are to genius, making people feel more inclined to try.</p>
<p>Role models can play an important part in efforts to encourage a wider range of people to pursue STEM both educationally and professionally: female mentors, for example, have been shown to increase female students’ sense of belonging in engineering settings. Understanding what makes certain role models effective could therefore help this process considerably, allowing universities and other institutions to develop mentoring programmes that really help make STEM subjects more diverse and equal places to be.</p>

Nerd Food: Computational Finance, Part I: Introduction<div id="content"><p>Welcome to the first part of what we hope will be a long series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.quantlib.org/">QuantLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine">Open Source Risk Engine</a> (ORE), <a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system">libbitcoin</a>and other interesting finance-related FOSS (Free and Open Source) projects. However, I'm afraid this will be a bit of a dull first post, as we need to clarify our objectives before we can jump into the fray. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orgc99cdfe"><h2 id="orgc99cdfe">About</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc99cdfe"><p>Even though I've been a software engineer in the financial sector for over fifteen years, I've always felt I lacked a <i>deep understanding</i>of the foundational concepts that make up the domain. As a self-confessed reductionist, I find this state of affairs extremely uncomfortable, akin to hearing a continuous loop of David Hilbert's words: <i>wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen</i><sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.1" id="fnr.1">1</a></sup>. The situation <i>had</i> to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2">2</a></sup> to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">other complex domains</a>, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for <i>in vivo</i>communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. </p> <p>So that's that for the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. But, just <i>what</i> exactly are we researching? </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org038ff83"><h3 id="org038ff83">Scope</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org038ff83"><p>These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain "trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS" - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, <i>especially</i> when we lack competence to do so<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours "Computational Finance". Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/">Wolfram's writings</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. </p> <p>I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. </p></blockquote> <p>These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, <i>everything is interconnected with everything else</i>, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let <i>taste</i> be my guide<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are "intuitive" boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd3a5007"><h3 id="orgd3a5007">Structure</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3a5007"><p>An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. </p>  <p>Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org81de0c9"><h3 id="org81de0c9">Audience</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81de0c9"><p>The target audience for this material is the fabled <i>homo developus</i>, that non-existent "standard developer" - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the "finance" part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content <i>very</i> slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those <i>not in the know</i>, so slowness is unavoidable<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. </p> <p>With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. </p> <p>In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets "plain" software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance <i>or</i> mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04a295b"><h3 id="org04a295b">Mathematics</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a295b"><p>Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering <i>application</i>perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. </p> <p>Our core belief is that an <i>average reader</i> (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of <i>how things work</i> just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/">Experimental Mathematics</a>. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in <a href="https://codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix</a>, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3d4740f"><h3 id="org3d4740f">Cryptos</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d4740f"><p>Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i>. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as <i>cryptos</i>, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the "real" world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - <i>i.e.</i>, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs <i>vast amounts of data of the right kind</i>. Lets elaborate further on this point. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7" id="fnr.7">7</a></sup>. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a <i>simulated world</i> - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate <i>all</i> of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for "immersive" exploration. In fact, the <i>very processes for data generation</i> will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. </p> <p>Of course, generated data is not perfect - <i>i.e.</i>, <i>realistic</i> it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can <i>assume</i> the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos <i>as if they were regular currencies</i>, except where they are just <i>too different</i> - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org92cf76f"><h3 id="org92cf76f">Non Goals</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92cf76f"><p>If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you. Even when we discuss trading strategies and other similar topics, our focus is always on trying to understand how the machinery works rather than on how to make money with it. Similarly, if you are a quant or are trying to become one, you are probably better off reading the traditional books such as Hull or Wilmott rather than these posts, as our treatment of mathematics will be far too basic for your requirements. However, if you are an expert in this subject area, or if you find any mistakes please do point them out. </p></div></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-orge684ba8"><h2 id="orge684ba8">Legalese</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge684ba8"><p>As with anything to do with finance, we need to set out the standard disclaimers.

<p>As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> staff and leadership would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our community of volunteers, as well as the authors submitting their work to <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://arxiv.org/moderators/">180 moderators</a>, representing 22 countries across the globe, have continued to sift through thousands of submissions, ensure quality, and post research on arxiv.org despite significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>Since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” on January 30, 2020, more than 26,000 scholarly works have been announced on the site, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/covid19search">many related to the coronavirus</a>. March 2020 was the second busiest month in arXiv history, with 14,415 new papers posted. This is a testament to the astounding effectiveness of arXiv’s moderators. It also reflects the incredible vibrancy of the global research community and the fact that the pursuit of knowledge continues despite the pandemic. We’re proud that arXiv is used extensively to share knowledge across disciplines and across the world.</p>
<p>Members of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board">Scientific</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board">Member Advisory Boards</a> also continue to honor their commitment to arXiv, meeting with the new executive director, corresponding via email, and contributing their perspectives on operations and aspirations for 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>Here at arXiv, our staff has been working remotely for several weeks now, like so many of our colleagues. And so it is from our home offices that, again, we thank our volunteers and share our gratitude for the strong arXiv community that remains connected during this difficult time. Thank you.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Ensuring you’re well-informed before making a choice is, on the whole, a sensible thing to do. This is especially true of big decisions — just pretending you’ve read the terms and conditions of a new website might be okay, but we’re unlikely to be so lax about our health or finances.</p>
<p>But could too <em>much</em> information lead us to make worse, not better, decisions? A study published in <a href="https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z"><em>Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications</em></a> suggests that sometimes that might be the case.</p>
<p><span id="more-39433"></span>Min Zheng and colleagues were motivated by advances in machine learning that have increased the information available to feed into decision-making, particularly when it comes to models of cause and effect: these algorithms can reveal potential outcomes likely to happen from certain actions or inputs.</p>
<p>But when it comes to human decision-making, it’s unclear how useful such information is. Simply presenting causal information to people may not actually help them make decisions: as senior author <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/news/turns-out-there-such-thing-tmi-more-information-doesnt-necessarily-help-people-make-better">Samantha Kleinberg says</a>, “being accurate is not enough for information to be useful”. In particular, we don’t know how this information might interact with the knowledge and beliefs people already have.</p>
<p>An initial experiment tested how causal information influences the kinds of decisions we make in everyday life. The team presented 1,718 participants with a real world scenario and asked them to give advice on how they would approach it. Participants were told that Jane, a university fresher, wanted to avoid putting on weight but continue to have fun with her friends, and were asked what one thing she should do to achieve her goal: go for a half hour walk every weekend, maintain a healthy diet, avoid seeing her friends, or watch less TV.</p>
<p>A third of the participants were given no extra information to help them answer the question, another third were given a text-based causal explanation of the impact of diet and regular exercise on weight loss, and the final third were given a simple causal diagram. Those in the latter two categories were also asked whether the causal explanations had been helpful or affected their answer.</p>

<p>Those in the no-information condition were highly accurate: 88.8% picked the correct answer (i.e. that Jane should maintain a healthy diet). But those in the two conditions provided with causal information performed <em>worse: </em>82.7% got the correct answer with the text-based explanation, and 80.1% with the diagram.</p>
<p>The second experiment followed a similar method, except in this case the scenario was one that only some participants would have experience dealing with: the management of type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked whether it would be best for someone with diabetes to manage their condition through behaving as normal, through walking more, or by choosing a healthier dinner and going cycling. They were either given no information or a diagram showing the impact of exercise and healthy eating.</p>
<p>When no causal information was given, participants with and without type 2 diabetes chose the right answer (i.e. choosing a healthy meal and going for a bike ride) at about the same rate. Additional causal information was useful for those without personal experience of diabetes, increasing accuracy to 86.6% — but when the type 2 diabetes group were given causal information, accuracy dropped to just 50%.</p>
<p>This, along with the results from the first experiment, suggests that causal diagrams themselves are not inherently useless: rather, their ability to improve our decision-making depends on our personal experience. When a situation is new to us, we can benefit from causal information, but when we are already familiar with it, this information can actually lead us to making worse decisions.</p>
<p>The team thinks this has something to do with our existing mental models. We don’t take causal information at face value, but instead our existing beliefs and experience influence our decisions. This can sometimes mean we don’t make the right choice: with extra information we can lose confidence and start second-guessing ourselves.</p>
<p>A final experiment confirmed these findings: when participants had personal experience with a topic, causal information reduced their accuracy, but in made-up scenarios, such as a question on alien mind reading, participants were able to use causal information to make accurate choices. “In situations where people do not have background knowledge, they become more confident with the new information and make better decisions,” says Kleinberg.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that information uncovered by machine learning isn’t valuable — quite the contrary. But understanding what people already believe, and tailoring information to that, may be the best way to communicate it.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></h4>

<p>Emotions seem by their very nature to defy scientific analysis. Private and evanescent, and yet powerful and determining, feelings resist systematic observation and measurement. We are lucky to catch a glimpse in a facial expression or inflection of speech. The emotions of animals are all the more difficult. Without words to communicate what might be in their minds or on their nerves, animals–ranging from the complex to the simple–remain nearly a closed emotional book for even the cleverest experiment. A century ago Robert Yerkes, then at Harvard, registered these frustrations. Little is “of more obvious importance scientifically than affection,” he wrote in his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/details/introductiontop03yerkgoog/page/n7/mode/2up">Introduction to Psychology</a>, in 1911, but its study lags behind investigation of “cognitive consciousness.” Convenient as it might be to assume animals are machinelike anyway, our behavior in the laboratory, he observed earlier in his <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology</em> in 1906, betrays our logic. “Even those who claim that animals are automata do not treat them as such.”</p><p>Shrewd as Yerkes was about his specialty of animal behavior, he would have been puzzled by the idea that national loyalty influenced his science. His research ethos was empiricism: Infer conclusions from carefully collected facts. As he succinctly advised in 1904 in the same journal, “experiment much and speculate little.” Other Americans agreed. John B. Watson’s “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-as-the-behaviorist-views-it.html">Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It</a>” of 1913 proposed to make the field “purely objective” by jettisoning the “yoke of consciousness.” That a conscious mind exists at all, in Watson’s view, was mere supposition. It makes sense that it was the German-born émigré ornithologist, Ernst Mayr, who recognized the American devotion to practicality as a national bias. When his Dutch friend, Niko Tinbergen, planned lectures for a US tour in 1946, Mayr wrote to him that “American scientists do not care for too much speculation but like thorough analysis of observed phenomena.” Indeed, deficient experimentation and excessive theorizing became a polemical weapon in international debate. Intellectual precision was–and is–the mark of good science, but American investigators of animal sensibility once claimed it as their special national possession.</p><p>Although the danger of scientific myopia nurtured by pride is obvious, these Americans’ faith in their superior practice ironically became a path forward toward internationalism. Their zeal for conducting animal behavior experiments produced real insights into affective experience. They had something to contribute abroad. In the process, they traveled the world for fieldwork, made far-flung professional acquaintances, and opened the door to refugee scientists displaced by the twentieth century’s political turmoil. Scientific passion stoked nationalism, but also gradually undermined it.</p><figure><img height="354" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Racoon-180x105.jpg" width="607" />Researcher L.W. Cole works with a raccoon, 1905. Used with permission from Yale Library.</figure><p>Animal experiments became one area of American expertise. Nonhuman subjects, by their very lack of language and inability to deceive in self-reports, were a perfect fit for a method based on external observation. The variety of species studied included the proverbial white rat, but many others as well. Although Yerkes spent three decades after World War I focused on primates, he had earlier measured learning in newts, frogs, mice, crows, and pigs. His colleague Edward Thorndike watched chicks, cats, and dogs escape from puzzle boxes, and Yerkes’s student L. W. Cole did the same with raccoons. So much scrutiny of animals expanded the researchers’ appreciation of their personalities. Intelligence, understood as skill acquisition, was the original question. Mood and temperament were annoyances. A tired rat knew where to find the bit of bread, but stopped running for it. It is not surprising that the emotions themselves eventually caught scientific interest. Donald Griffin rattled his field in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.rupress.org/catalog/book/question-animal-awareness"><em>The Question of Animal Awareness</em></a> of 1976 when he declared, against reigning local wisdom, that animals are conscious. They have “not only images and intentions, but also feelings, desires, hopes, fears.” His revolutionary claim was the endpoint, however, of a typical American career. Three decades before, Griffin discovered how bats maneuver in the dark by echolocation, a kind of intelligence. His wonder at the animal mind deepened over the years.</p><p>To be sure, American scientists never had a monopoly on insight into animal behavior. The counterexample of Darwin is enough to deflate any sense of supremacy. Their enthusiasm for controlled animal experiments produced so many competent studies, however, that they may have had an outsized influence. One British book of 1915, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~assets.cambridge.org/97811076/26560/excerpt/9781107626560_excerpt.pdf"><em>Investigation of Mind in Animals</em></a> by E. M. Smith, borrowed nearly all of its illustrations from American publications. Although the Americans favored laboratory work for its rigor, they increasingly went into the field to witness the vast number of species in native habitats. Yerkes traveled to Senegal in 1929 in pursuit of great apes, and Griffin to Venezuela in 1952 to observe the nocturnal navigation of oilbirds. Often welcomed as respected authorities, they were also exposed to the world’s problems. Walter Cannon of Harvard celebrated “free intellectual intercourse without respect to national boundaries” in his plenary speech at the International Physiological Congress in Leningrad in 1935, published by the state press as <em>Chemical Transmission of Nerve Impulses</em>. His trip by train from Vladivostok to reach the meeting, however, was a sobering political lesson. Seeing prisoners laboring at gunpoint along the tracks in Siberia made for “a queer kind of horror that seizes you now and then,” his wife Cornelia wrote of the trip. Cannon may well not have had immediate doubts about the virtues of his own country, but he surely registered the pressures of nationalism at the borders of science.</p><figure><img height="398" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scientist-180x122.jpg" width="587" />Scientist C. R. Carpenter setting up equipment in Thailand in 1937 to record gibbon calls.

Supported by American colleagues, Mayr achieved US citizenship in 1950 after a decade of government surveillance as a suspect alien. Although the new politics of internationalism was influential, just as crucial was the internal dynamic of science to push its practitioners beyond parochialism. The same high standard that impelled these Americans to apprehend animals in all their complexity–including animal emotions–underwrote growing internationalism. Precisely because the American science of animal behavior was embedded in political life, it had the power to change minds.</p><p><em>Featured image from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/gorilla-monkey-animal-zoo-furry-3606809/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620767382/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fRacoon-180x105.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">How we can equip ourselves against climate change</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/earth-day-at-50-episode-54-the-oxford-comment/" rel="nofollow">Earth Day at 50: conservation, spirituality, and climate change [podcast]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>Psycholinguists have taken a scientific approach to the creation of new swear words, </strong><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/building-the-perfect-profanity">reports Neuroskeptic</a> at <em>Discover Magazine</em>. Researchers identified the ideal words to pair with profanities in order to come up with colourful new insults. Sticking <em>-pig</em> or <em>-mouth</em> to the end of your favoured swear word will probably have the desired effect, according to the work, while adding <em>-newspaper</em> or <em>-fireplace</em> could leave your insult falling flat.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/04/02/scraping-webpages-with-developer-tools-and-selenium/">Scraping webpages with developer tools and Selenium</a></h4>

<p>There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.</p>



<h2>Identifying targets with developer tools</h2>



<p>Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:</p>



<ul><li>Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage</li><li>See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript</li><li>Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage</li><li>Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML</li></ul>



<p>These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.</p>



<p>Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7487" data-attachment-id="7487" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scraping" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png" data-orig-size="3070,1752" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/scraping/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>Here I find that the biggest headline is a <code>span</code> with a class name of <code>balancedHeadline</code>. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.</p>



<h2>Selenium: remote control browsers</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium</a>: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></code> to grab the data and parsing it with <code><a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup</a></code>. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:</p>



<ul><li>is dynamically loaded</li><li>is hidden behind authentication layers</li><li>requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript</li></ul>



<p>In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">pip install selenium</pre>



<p>Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html">I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">downloading the gecko webdriver</a> and extracting the binary to <code>/usr/bin</code>. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

</pre>


<p>Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7477" data-attachment-id="7477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nytimes-robot" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png" data-orig-size="2176,192" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" />A remote-controlled version of Firefox</figure>



<p>We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: </p>



<ul><li>We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   <code>document.querySelectorAll("span.balancedHeadline")</code> to grab the headline</li><li>We could read the DOM to find the right span</li></ul>



<p>Let’s use the second method:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h2>Running headless and automating</h2>



<p>Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h3>Cron job</h3>



<p>All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called <code>headless-browser</code>, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;&amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;&amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
</pre>


<p>I saved this file as <code>/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh</code>. Running  <code>crontab -e</code>, I added an entry that looks like this:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate"># m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
</pre>


<p><a href="https://crontab.guru/">You can use this website</a> to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating">you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service</a> instead.</p>



<h2>Authentication</h2>



<p>A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with <code>.default</code> with:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
</pre>


<p>In my case, I found a directory called <code>lasd74g9.default</code>. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()

</pre>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Imagine going to sit in a room with a violent, imprisoned psychopath and having a chat about what you both like to eat. (It’s impossible not to think of liver, fava beans and Chianti, isn’t it….?)</p>
<p>This is exactly what one researcher did recently in Germany. But the purpose of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001">the study</a>, reported in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment</em> wasn’t to gather data on criminal psychopaths’ dining preferences, but rather on how they make — or don’t make — eye contact during a conversation.</p>
<p>This was the first study to explore psychopaths’ eye movements in a naturalistic setting. And it reveals that prisoners who scored highly on one aspect of psychopathy, in particular, were much less likely to look at the interviewer’s eyes. This finding not only helps with understanding how psychopathy develops, but also suggests that finding ways to encourage at-risk children to make more eye contact might be a useful intervention, argue Nina Gehrer at the University of Tübingen and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-39418"></span>The team studied 30 men who had been convicted of serious crimes (including murder, rape and hostage-taking) and who were incarcerated in two institutions in Germany.</p>
<p>One researcher led all the interactions, which were divided into talking and listening stages. For one minute, the participant listened while the researcher talked about one of three neutral topics (eating habits/food, job/work or typical daily routine). Then, after a brief exchange on the topic, the second stage began: the participant talked for about a minute on the same topic. This was then repeated for the other two topics.</p>
<p>Throughout both stages, the experimenter maintained eye contact (this was later verified by two independent raters). And at all times, the prisoner wore an eye-tracking headset. This allowed the team to monitor where they were looking while they were listening and talking.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the study, the team divided the face into two sections: the eyes and the philtrum (the nose and mouth region). They then examined whether time spent looking at the eyes or philtrum correlated with the participants’ scores on the PCL-R, a standard psychopathy assessment.</p>
<p>Psychopathy is generally thought to have four facets, or components: manipulating other people, affective impairments (deficits in feeling emotion and empathy and in showing remorse or guilt), having an erratic lifestyle and demonstrating antisocial behaviour. Each of these is measured within the PCL-R. And the team found that during both listening and talking, prisoners with higher affective psychopathy scores made less eye contact. “These results are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Current theories about how psychopathy develops assume that a failure to view important social cues (from the eyes, especially) is a key factor. For children who go on to be diagnosed with psychopathy, there’s evidence that emotion-related impairments emerge early, in the form of callous unemotional traits. There’s some evidence that young children who pay less attention to other people’s eyes are more likely to develop these traits, the researchers note. Now that this link has been found for adult, criminal psychopaths, this suggests that eye contact, or rather a lack of it, could be important for understanding the development of the disorder.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the study, however. The number of participants was quite small, and all were men. The researchers themselves call for a replication before any firm conclusions can be drawn. It will also be important to investigate whether it’s possible to fix this particular deficit in eye contact, and, if so, whether that reduces the risk of developing emotion-related problems.</p>
<p>“To date, evidence for lasting changes in eye gaze through social attention bias modification training is still elusive,” they note. “Thus, these promising approaches and further opportunities that target impaired eye contact need to be further investigated and enhanced.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/">is limited</a>, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.</p>
<p><strong>Our studies </strong></p>
<p>In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, <img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png" width="157" />and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.</p>
<p>Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11812" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p>Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Content analysis</strong></p>
<p>We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.</p>
<p>Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Are our results surprising?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.</p>
<blockquote><p>HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.</p>
<p>This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/">alcohol</a> and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/">energy-dense snacks</a>. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Anna Dumituru will talk about her project named "Cyberspecies Proximity" on which she is working together with Alex May.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity explores what it will mean to share our sidewalks, elevators and transport systems in close proximity with mobile intelligent robots. The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.</p>
<p>The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.</p>
<p>The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.</p>
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its launch in 2003, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quickly established itself as PLOS’ flagship journal in the life sciences–a model of Open Access and a catalyst for change in scholarly publishing as well as a leading publication for the life sciences. Today, we’re announcing the beginning of a new vision for the journal which builds upon its earlier successes and pushes boundaries even further to promote Open Science and excellence in publishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had considered holding back this announcement while so many of us are grappling with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, we view it as our duty as publishers, now and in the long term, to accelerate the path to publication and increase transparent research practices. We believe the changes to the scope and new article types on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined below, will help researchers in the life sciences rapidly share their early findings and preregister their studies, and may prove to be particularly useful in these difficult times.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To lead this new phase for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are also fortunate to welcome a talented and passionate new Editor-in-Chief, Nonia Pariente. Welcome, Nonia! </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor.png"><img alt="Nonia Pariente, PLOS Biology Editor-in-Chief" class="alignleft wp-image-42876 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/Nonia_new-Bio-editor-150x150.png" width="150" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very excited to take on this new role. PLOS Biology has a very strong reputation and an inspiring vision. I am passionate about broadening its reach to all of the Life Sciences communities and strengthening its position in the publishing landscape. All important advances in every area of biology should feel they have a home in PLOS Biology”.</span></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Pushing Boundaries in Service of Research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the journal launched, Open Access was an experimental publishing option. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved that being highly selective and Open Access were perfectly compatible, aligning all the benefits of immediate and global accessibility with impactful research. Our aim has always been to challenge the status quo in scientific communication in order to better meet researchers’ needs. With our past experience to guide us, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is setting up a framework for assessment and publication that better aligns with the process of scientific inquiry itself, including:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefined selectivity criteria which will emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its execution; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A preregistration option offering peer review of the study design, with guaranteed publication of the final research article–regardless of the results–for accepted protocols;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction of two linked article types, Discovery Reports and Update Articles, which enable researchers to report on ongoing work as their research develops and new information becomes available.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with the existing criteria around openness of research data, a preprint deposition workflow, and the option for authors to publish their peer review history, these changes are part of PLOS’ larger goals to transform scientific communication in a way that empowers researchers to choose Open Science. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Surfacing the importance of the entire research process, not just results</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve reflected on more than fifteen years of experience at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and considered the publishing landscape, we acknowledge that publishing in highly selective journals remains an imperative for many researchers. The typical criteria used to select articles, however, continue to focus on novelty and perceived importance of the research results. As such, they continue to nurture a perverse system of incentives in which it matters to be first and to have an exciting headline–much less to be right and to have results that stand robustly to the test of time. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has already started addressing this challenge by giving a premium to transparency and access to underlying data, methodology and reagents, to enhance reproducibility. By introducing its ‘scooping policy’ through which novelty is not a disqualifying criteria within six months of an initial report. By opening up its peer review process to give context to decisions, as well as publishing valuable studies with clearly stated caveats when the consensus among reviewers is unclear. And even by asking authors to remove speculative results to reduce the hype that they sometimes feel pressured to provide.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will remain a selective journal–don’t take me wrong. But in its selection process, the journal now seeks to more systematically emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its approach and execution, before considering the importance of the results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new preregistration workflow, in addition to all the benefits it offers for reducing bias in experimentation and reporting, is also meant to encourage researchers to undertake important and well-designed studies with uncertain outcomes instead of censoring their research ideas based on the odds of publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new linked article types will allow researchers to share their work more quickly, and to more effectively separate exploratory research during which they generate hypotheses (to be published as a Discovery Report) from its confirmatory phases, during which the hypothesis is further tested and new insights generated (to be linked as an Update Article). </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Welcome, Nonia Pariente!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong underlying editorial strategy. Joining our highly experienced team of staff editors, Nonia officially came on board earlier this month as Editor-in-Chief and is eager to get started on these new initiatives. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since I started editing, and definitely as I have grown throughout my career as Chief Editor of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Microbiology</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now as Editor-in-Chief of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, my goal has been to help science advance and to help scientists communicate their stories… I think what makes PLOS Biology and PLOS in general stand out is that it is an organization that was founded with the goal and drive to innovate the process of scientific publication for the benefit of scientists and scientific advance. Thinking outside the box is almost an obligation.”</span></i></p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SrNSAlYYdMg/">PLOS ONE publishes additional Coronavirus-related papers</a></h4>

<p>Today <em>PLOS ONE</em> added to its <a href="https://collections.plos.org/">collection</a> of COVID-19 papers since we started <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/">fast-tracking submissions on January 31</a><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/"><sup>st</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230405">study</a> was conducted by Constantinos Siettos from the Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy and colleagues. The authors used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with data between January 11 and February 10, 2020 and estimated key epidemiological parameters up until February 29. With these parameters, they forecasted that between 80,000 and 160,000 people would be infected by February 29 – in fact, around 84,000 are known to have become infected in this time period.</p>
<p>Dr Siettos notes, “This is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach that has provided relatively accurate three- week-ahead forecasts. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach suggesting that the actual number of the infections in the total population is of the order of twenty times more than those reported, and that the mortality rate in the total population is about ~0.15% i.e. significantly less than reported 2-3%.Our findings imply that for the case of Hubei (with a 60m population), around 2%-3% of the total population in Hubei has been actually infected by coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Science leaders have <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf">recently requested</a> that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable">already supports</a>, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push <u>all </u>PLOS content to PubMed Central. We are also forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</a>.</p>
<p>We are  compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a <a href="https://collections.plos.org/">Collection</a> as they publish. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks to also consider posting a <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint">Preprint</a>.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/search/title%3Acoronovirus%2Bwuhan%2B2019-nCoV%20title_flags%3Amatch-any%20jcode%3Amedrxiv%7C%7Cbiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard">search link</a>.</p>

This adds up to around <strong>25 grams</strong> of sugar. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a> (PHE) children consume much more sugar than recommended; this equals around eight excess sugar cubes a day or <strong>2,800 excess</strong> <strong>sugar</strong> <strong>cubes</strong> per year.</p>

The app enabled users to scan barcodes on food and drink packaging to find out how many grams of total sugars were contained in the product; depicted in sugar cubes, to help consumers visualize the amount.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8422-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">A recent study</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> aimed to determine whether the campaign was effective in altering dietary behavior, by assessing any impact of the campaign on sugar intake among children aged 5-11 years. This included looking into the parental perceptions of the campaign and exploring barriers related to reducing sugar intake.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians were asked to report their child’s dietary intake; telephone interviews were also conducted. This covered a range of topics including understanding of the general change4life message, the impact of sugar on health and family and social barriers experienced whilst trying to reduce children’s sugar intake. Findings indicate that parents often feel confused over the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sugar.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“[The children] thought because they couldn’t have sugar, they couldn’t have fruit and it was saying that sugar was bad, so we had to sort of explain that it’s not all bad; it’s just different types.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Following the campaign, many parents reported that they tried to switch out unhealthy food for a healthier version and reducing portion sizes, however, the largest barrier included time constraints due to a fast paced life style and the easy availability of sweet treats which led to increased leniency; for example, pudding at school or temptation in the local supermarkets.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You get tired and sometimes you go, “oh, just eat it then”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Overall it was found that the health marketing campaign raised awareness of sugar in food and drinks in both parents and children, impacting food consumption in families. Sugar smart campaigns are likely to have a positive influence on reducing sugar consumption.</p>
<p><em>Targeting the parents:</em></p>
<p>The study concludes that a health marketing campaign aimed at both parents and children has a positive impact in reducing sugar intake, however, reductions in sugars are not always sustained long term.</p>
<p>Parents want to reduce their child’s sugar intake, but societal barriers as well as confusion over aspects of the diet to change often hamper efforts.</p>
<p>Generally, the campaign was successful in raising awareness amongst both parents and children. The findings suggest that further education is required when it comes to different types of sugar and food labeling.</p>
<p>Future campaigns should continue to target the parents, which in turn will have a knock on effect on reducing sugar consumption in the young. In the future campaigns should focus on combatting long term sugar reduction.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a></h4>

<p>Graduate education, particularly the training of doctoral students, plays crucial role in the progress of society. Around 1,500 of the country’s 4,500 or so universities award doctoral degrees. In 2018 according to the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/data-tables/">Survey of Earned Doctorates </a>55,185 students were doctorate recipients in the United States.</p><p>To match potential graduate students and graduate programs needs the interplay among students, college professors as evaluators, and admission committees.  Many academics are involved in the admission process of graduate students.</p><p>As a college professor, it’s my seasonal duty each fall to write letters of recommendation and rate students based on several criteria in order to help them gain acceptance to graduate schools. Students should ask several professors to evaluate them. Occasionally, I have to tell a student that I would not be able to write a strong recommendation, so it would be better not to ask me. We evaluators combine quasi-objective data (say, grades) and subjective impressions to generate a rating score. Despite the subjective nature, these evaluations are far from random, and college professors don’t have better ways of helping students and graduate programs find a good match.   At the individual level, rating and ranking of application to graduate schools dramatically influences the life of students. Admissions committees have a strong interest in ensuring they only accept mature, polite, reliable, and stable people into their program, and my professional duty is to help them achieve this goal.</p><p>One company provides software as a service to many universities for admissions and applications evaluations. Its software uses six criteria to rate students:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Knowledge in chosen field</li><li>Motivation and perseverance toward goals</li><li>Ability to work independently</li><li>Ability to express thoughts in speech and writing</li><li>Ability/potential for college teaching</li><li>Ability to plan and conduct research</li></ul><p>For each criterion, the evaluator picks among five options: exceptional (upper 5%), outstanding (nxt 15%), very good (next 15%), good (next 15%), and okay (next 50%).</p><p>How do we generate the numbers and check the appropriate rubric? In principle, a micro-rationalist, bottom-up approach would work. Teachers could collect and store data from students throughout decades, and they might have a formal algorithm for calculating the percentages. I believe it is more likely that many of us apply top-down strategies. We ask ourselves:  do I want to grant a set of grades that is all exceptional? Does the applicant have a clear weak point, in which I should check the third or maybe the fourth category? What if I score, say,  four outstanding and two exceptional?  The table below shows an example:</p><figure><img height="288" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg" width="682" />Image credit: Peter Érdi</figure><p>I thought this student should be supported, because she seemed to be very motivated, independent and clever. However, I have never checked anybody to be “exceptional” in all categories. First, nobody is exceptional in everything, second, it would be suspicious if my scores were unfair and consciously biased, and so it might be counterproductive. In the case shown in the figure the candidate had little experience in her chosen field, so I checked the second column. Probably the third or even the fourth column would have been more appropriate. I did not feel I was cheating, but I knew I was a little biased.</p><p>Good or bad, decision makers calculate the sum of the scores, analyze their distribution, read the recommendations, and adopt some strategies to bring  decisions. (In some version of the ranking game, weights are assigned to the different features, to expressing the relative importance of the different features. University ranking systems  famously assign relative percentage weights to each ranking factors .) While rating with numbers contains subjective elements, we don’t have better ways to approximate objectivity.</p><p>The notion of objective reality refers to anything that exists as it is independently of any conscious awareness or perceiver. Subjective reality is related to anything that depends upon some conscious awareness or some perceiver. Objectivity is associated with concepts like reality, truth, and reliability. Objectively ranking the tallest buildings in the world is relatively easy, since it is based on verifiable facts, and we have a result that everybody will accept.</p><p>If we accept that it is an impossible task to objectively ranking graduate students, what we could and should do? On the one hand, we could improve our ranking methodologies, on the other hand we (all stakeholders of the game from students to professors) should feel that our actions are as fair as possible.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Joshua Golde from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/qIu77BsFdds"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620581304/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fEOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">How we can equip ourselves against climate change</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/earth-day-at-50-episode-54-the-oxford-comment/" rel="nofollow">Earth Day at 50: conservation, spirituality, and climate change [podcast]</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arXiv now offers a <a href="https://arxiv.org/covid19search">quick search link to all coronavirus and COVID-19 research</a> hosted on <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>. The search results are sorted by date, with the most recent papers at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Also new on the arXiv homepage is an external link to<a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181"> medRxiv and bioRxiv</a> preprints about the coronavirus and COVID-19.</p>

<p>“In times like this, we need global collaboration in research and shared knowledge among different disciplines,” says Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “arXiv allows researchers from different backgrounds and geographical locations to quickly share their findings and push forward for the discoveries we need. It is an ideal platform for researchers to communicate with each other when speed is of extreme importance.”</p>
<p>As a free, fast, and open access scholarly research distribution service, arXiv accelerates the pace at which science can advance. And online communication is particularly relevant now, with researchers around the world isolated due to travel restrictions and conference cancellations.</p>
<p>“In the context of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it is crucial to get information to people quickly, and arXiv provides a shared infrastructure and community to get scientific research to those that can make a difference,” says Greg Morrisett, Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of<a href="http://tech.cornell.edu"> Cornell Tech</a>. “Already, there are preprints on topics ranging from genomic structure of the virus to epidemiological studies to projected economic impacts, and from every corner of the globe.”</p>
<p>The new quick search link will expedite efficient research discovery, says Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director. “Within arXiv, research on the coronavirus, associated clinical syndromes, and epidemiology is spread across multiple disciplines and tagged with a number of different keywords. In the interest of expediency, we are providing a direct curated link to e-prints with the most commonly used tags.”</p>
<p>Like other preprint servers, arXiv does not facilitate in-depth peer-review and does not specifically endorse the contents of the documents it hosts. Results on <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a> should be considered preliminary and not used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. Likewise, such findings should not be reported in the news media as established information.</p>

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.<br /><br />The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852">Bourouiba, 2020</a>).

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

<p>As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.</p><p><strong>First and foremost – plan</strong><br />More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, are another source of trusted information.</p><p><strong>Disconnect to reconnect</strong><br />After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.</p><p>Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.</p><p><strong>Maintain your foundation</strong><br />Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.</p><p><strong>Reconnect with natural joys</strong><br />Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.</p><p><strong>Practice gratitude and altruism</strong><br />Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.</p><p>The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.</p><p><strong>Know when to seek help</strong><br />Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources">a list of trusted resources</a> and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm"><em>Photo</em></a><em> </em><em>by prostooleh via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/covid-19-and-employment-law-in-the-uk/" rel="nofollow">COVID-19 and employment law in the UK</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/what-the-civil-war-can-teach-us-about-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">What the Civil War can teach us about COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/lessons-learnt-from-coronavirus-and-global-environmental-challenges/" rel="nofollow">Lessons learnt from Coronavirus and global environmental challenges</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.</p>

Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf">Wikipedia</a>.</figure>



<p>Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:</p>



<ul><li>evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods</li><li>locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets</li></ul>



<p>Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.</p>



<h3>The theory behind reverse correlation</h3>



<p>Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up <a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf">writing my PhD thesis on systems identification</a>, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.</p>



<p>There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097">Franz &amp; Schölkopf (2006)</a>. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="N" /> real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" />:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" /></p>



<p>Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system <img alt="f(\bold x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x)" /> as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" /></p>



<p>Note that the kernels <img alt="h_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_i" /> have increasing order: <img alt="h_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_0" /> is a scalar, <img alt="h_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_1" /> a vector, <img alt="h_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_2" /> a matrix, <img alt="h_3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_3" /> a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion</p></blockquote>



<p>The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function <img alt="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" /> has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb">Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png" />Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.</figure>



<p>This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.</p></blockquote>



<p>To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series">Wiener expansion</a>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" /></p>



<p>And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:</p>

<p>This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, <img alt="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" />. Thus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0+%3D+k_0+%5Cnewline+G_1+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%5Cnewline+G_2+%3D+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+-+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D%5Cnewline&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0 = k_0 \newline G_1 = (x - x_0)^T k_1 \newline G_2 = (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) - \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj}\newline" /></p>



<p>Since each functional are orthogonal over the data distribution, we can easily calculate them using an iterative procedure:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.</p></blockquote>



<p>What does <em>estimate</em> mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" /></p>



<p>For the first-order kernel:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" /></p>



<p>Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, <img alt="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" />. The second order kernel is a little more tricky. We first define <img alt="r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T" />. Then:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_2+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_2%7D+%5Csum+%5Cleft%28r+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+%2B+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D+%5Cright%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D%28%28D%5ET+D%29%5E%7B-1%7D+D%5ET+r%29+%5Cnewline&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline" /></p>



<p>The columns of the matrix <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is composed of all the cross-products <img alt="x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+x_j+-+%5Cdelta_%7Bij%7D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2" /> for <img alt="i \ge j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cge+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="i \ge j" />. The operator <img alt="\text{unstack}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\text{unstack}" /> takes this linear representation of the coefficients and transforms them into a matrix. Here again, we find that for normally distributed inputs, the non-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix <img alt="D^TD" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%5ETD&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D^TD" /> have an expected value of zero. The inverse of the diagonal is a bit more tricky to calculate, but a little bit of grinding shows that we pick up a scalar factor <img alt="\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%5Csigma%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}" />. In fact, we can show that the estimate of the kernels can be written as:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_i%28j_1%2C+j_2%2C+%5Cldots+j_i%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bi%21%5Csigma%5E%7B2i%7DN%7D+%5By+-+%5Csum_%7Bm%3D0%7D%5E%7Bi-1%7D+G_m%28%5Cmathbf+x%29%5D+x_%7Bj_1%7D+x_%7Bj_2%7D+%5Cldots+x_%7Bj_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}" /></p>



<p>Where <img alt="G_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_j" /> are the orthogonalized Wiener functionals (equation 2, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3382067">Korenberg et al. 1988</a>).

Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion</a>.</p>



<p>Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:</p>



<ol><li>Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.</li><li>The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.</li><li>The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.</li></ol>



<p>The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:</p>



<ol><li>Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood</li><li>Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise</li><li>Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood</li><li>Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent</li></ol>



<p>Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.</p>



<h3>Evolution strategies (ES)</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies">Evolution strategies</a> (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a <em>smoothed</em> gradient via the ES method.</p>



<p>The setup is quite clever. We have a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative <img alt="\nabla f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla f(z)" /> directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, <img alt="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" /> in a local neighborhood <img alt="\pi(\theta, z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi(\theta, z)" />. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.</p>



<p>To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" /></p>



<p>The last equality, which is also called the <a href="http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/">log-derivative trick</a>, is derived from:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" /></p>



<p>A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" /></p>



<p>Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking ES to reverse correlation</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png" /><a href="https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/">From the OpenAI blog</a>.</figure>



<p>The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).</p>



<p>ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.</p>



<p>ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)</a>. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.</li><li><a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html">NES (Natural evolution strategies)</a>. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.</li></ul>



<p>Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.</p>



<p>Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction">variance reduction literature</a> to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb">This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus</a>.</p>



<h3>Locally interpretable models</h3>



<p>There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html">locally interpretable models</a>. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model.

<p>Several choices are possible for <img alt="\Omega(g)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(g)" />. For example, we may privilege functions that focus on few input dimensions; we can impose that <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="g" /> is sparse in parameter space using an L1 penalty as <img alt="\Omega(g)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28g%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\Omega(g)" />. The model class <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G" /> can be anything that is “easy to interpret” for humans. This could mean:</p>



<ul><li>a GAM</li><li>a decision tree</li><li>a linear model</li></ul>



<p>If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking LIME to reverse correlation</h4>



<p>An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.</p>



<p>Many articles have documented that <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short">receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles</a>, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.</p>



<p>Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:</p>



<ul><li>the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)</li><li>the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)</li><li>the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)</li></ul>



<p>Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Local linearization of receptive fields" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/movshon-1978.png" />From <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012489">Movshon et al. 1978</a>.</figure>



<p>There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589">A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features</a> that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).</p>



<p>Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short">explain sensory neurons</a> and to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">compress neural networks</a>.</p>



<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/IS098TI3W-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In recent years, the Cesarean section (CS) <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2689-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">rate has been increasing</a> with the main reason being a woman’s prior CS history. Trial of labor after Cesarean (TOLAC), with the aim of achieving vaginal birth rather than repeat CS, is considered a safe and reasonable option. However, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227">rate of TOLAC is decreasing</a>, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">risk of uterine rupture</a> is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.</p>
<p>We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> showed promising results.</p>
<h3><strong>Our criteria</strong></h3>
<p>Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1. Criteria for TOLAC in this study<br />
</strong></p>
<table style="height: 447px;" width="573">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="566">1) only one previous Cesarean delivery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="566">2) former Cesarean delivery was a low transverse Cesarean</td>

<tr>
<td width="566">3) no obstetric contraindications for vaginal delivery</td>

<td width="566">6) in general, no medical induction of labor</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.</p>
<h3><strong>High success rate</strong></h3>
<p>Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).</p>
<blockquote><p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors associated with failed TOLAC</strong></h3>
<p>This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.</p>
<p>Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267">risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes</a> in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.</p>

The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.</p>
<p>Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.</p>
<p>The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.</p>
<p>A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11795 aligncenter" height="343" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg" width="620" />
<p>Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.</p>
<p>An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.</p>
<p>School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.</p>

<p>Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.</p>

Unlike many other tools for searching though the scientific literature, CoCites uses citations rather than keywords. It has been designed to be more efficient than the traditional keyword-based methods and works on the assumption that the user knows at least one highly relevant article within their chosen research area, pulling out all articles that have previously been cited together.</p>

<p>People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11777" height="255" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg" width="300" />of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.</p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that parents from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds interact verbally with their children less than parents from more advantaged background, resulting in what has been coined “the 30 million-word gap”. Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620217952/0/oupblogpsychology/">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></h4>

<p>The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">COVID-19 pandemic</a> was announced on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, marking a turning point for the public health systems serving the health of constituent populations across the globe. This declaration moment is important for narrative on COVID-19 because it is the point at which it is accepted that the virus is not only travelling to different countries, but is now circulating in those countries. Governments are now required to take action to moderate the impact of the infection, reducing harm for the polity until the virus – through the mutation of its biological properties, human immunity, vaccines or some combination of these – takes its place, we hope, among the many other microbes with which human life has found co-existence.</p><p>The WHO declaration is also an important moment for the COVID-19 story because it reveals how data about notifications of diagnosed infection and deaths are used to make decisions and therefore reveals how, in the circumstances of a pandemic, it is keenly apparent that numerical and narrative futures constitute each other.</p><p>Pandemics are narrated into meaningful existence and COVID-19 is no exception. In Australia, for instance, news stories on the novel coronavirus have escalated since January 2020 to become headlined on many broadcast and digital news platforms. This pattern of media interest conforms to what has been seen in previous outbreaks. Swine flu in 2009 was a significant media event that did not go unremarked in the interviews and focus groups I and colleagues conducted with members of the general population variously impacted by the pandemic threat. Ebola, too, was a prominent news story in 2014 as was Zika in the run up to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  in 2016.</p><p>COVID-19 resembles these other outbreaks and pandemics, but the news stories about it seem to have a distinctively numerical quality. The number of known infections in a particular place over a period of time gives an index of the transmissibility of an infection. Mortality rates – a measure of the proportion of people that die with an infection – are also woven into pandemic stories, in general. But COVID-19’s numbers seem to <em>be</em> its story. News feeds continually update the counts of diagnoses and deaths, and have numerically tracked the contagion from a supposed source in China to other countries, notably South Korea, Iran and Italy, and then to most other parts of the world. This pandemic by numbers approach charts the particular transmissibility and severity of this virus, but also lends itself to our increasingly complex small-screen media diet, where numbers and graphs alongside images and videos more easily convey the COVID-19 story than do long form narrative texts.</p><p>COVID-19 also comes into a context where public health systems have increasingly turned to mathematical models to make decisions about how to manage various infections, notably HIV and influenza. Models are used to decide how to apply resources and strategies to best effect. For example, modelling has shown how HIV can be prevented by HIV treatments, because they reduce the likelihood of the transmission of the virus. For influenza, models are used to calculate what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to protect the whole population from an emerging infection. These models can be adjusted to fit what is known about the biosocial properties of a particular infection, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and cost. In the case of COVID-19, for example, models may be indicating that containment will reduce the speed and scope of transmission and therefore reduce mortality, the burden on the health system, and ultimately the cost for governments. COVID-19 may be a fully-fledged algorithmic pandemic in the sense that its storyline is transparently about its numbers and because it is managed in terms of the models that combine numerical indices of transmission, mortality, burden, and cost.</p><p>Mathematical models and narratives also have a point of contact in relation to futures and pasts: they both offer means of trying to shape what might happen through action in the present guided by understandings of what has happened. Decision-makers want to know how to act now to reduce the future impact of a pandemic and models support these decisions by analysing pre-existing data about transmission, mortality, the benefits and costs of treatments, vaccines and containment, for example. Modelling, then, looks to what the future might be by assessing a pandemic’s past numbers. This is strictly true even during the course of a particular pandemic. Narratives on pandemic futures also recall the past, for example, through reference to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, swine flu in 2009, and other outbreaks, and on that basis orient the narrator and their interlocutors to possible futures. Public policy statements about containment requirements and news media vision of empty supermarket shelves both reflect action in the present that is predicated on pasts and aims to shape futures.</p><p>For all its life threatening, anxiety-making potential, though, the numerical narrative on COVID-19 is surprisingly impersonal. Stories of the many lives affected by the pandemic and the full tenor of its corporeal horrors are crowded out by governmental advice and updating of the numbers. One reason for this separation of pandemic knowing and lived experience is their incommensurability. Pandemics are constituted in the sheer scale and spread of their numbers, so much so that no one person can experience a pandemic without recourse to some signification of this calculated, collective plight. Infections, in contrast, are visceral and personal, including for those who devote themselves to providing care. Moreover, narrative arguably meets its limits in the experience of an infection because, like traumatic experience, living through a debilitating one is not an easy story to tell. Some accounts of how people experienced the 1918-1919 pandemic remark on the lack of affect, giving the impression that emotion was bracketed aside as irresponsible, impossible or even a luxury.</p><p>Numerical narrative, then, may not only be one of the ways we can know a pandemic is happening; it may provide the means of living with emerging threat. As they say, time – and numbers – will tell how things turn out for COVID-19.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: “people walking on train station” by Liliya Lisa.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology/">How olive oil promotes brain health</a></h4>

<p>Diets and superfoods are all the rage. From acai berries to the Zone diet, many a dietary trend has come along promising a range of benefits, such as weight loss, heart health, and improved cognition. But the science behind these claims is often sketchy at best. One dietary regime that has stood the test of time – and importantly, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet">scientific scrutiny</a> – is the Mediterranean diet. Earlier this year, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/how-us-news-ranks-best-diets">the best diet of 2020</a> for the third year in a row. The diets were scored by a panel of nationally recognized experts in diet and nutrition. In second place was another consistent high performer in the rankings, the DASH diet (DASH stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) which focuses on lowering blood pressure.</p><p>If you are on a DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet you are probably eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, as well as whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts.  You are also probably consuming olive oil as a substitute for unhealthy vegetable or coconut oils.  Olive Oil, particularly the extra virgin preparation, contains lots of antioxidants (just look at that rich color; it screams anti-oxidants) and also has significant anti-Inflammatory properties. Everyone knows that these are the two most important properties of healthy foods.</p><p>Your body clearly benefits from eating olive oil. Does your brain care?</p><p>Answering this question is not easy. First of all, olive oil is a complex blend of various chemicals. It would be nice to know which of these is most advantageous and whether they influence brain health directly or indirectly. A recent study attempted to find answers using an animal model that mimics conditions of multiple sclerosis in the human brain. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by brain inﬂammation leading to numerous degenerative changes.</p><p>The brain inflammation present in multiple sclerosis patients is thought to be driven by changes in the gut microbiome. Scientists now understand that the gut microbiome plays a signiﬁcant role in both the progression and severity of the disease. This is the likely scenario: an imbalance in the gut bacteria leads to inflammation, chemical debris released from the bacteria migrate out of the gut into the blood and then into the brain. The most harmful of these bacterial debris is called lipopolysaccharide and it can induce a powerful inflammatory response inside the brain. People with multiple sclerosis have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in their brains, spinal cords, and blood.</p><p>Olive oil modifies how your gut microbiome communicates with your brain. Olive oil’s beneficial effects on the human brain and body are likely related to the presence of the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol and oleic acid. Hydroxytyrosol protects cells that are under oxidative stress. Oleic acid has beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels.</p><p>One recent <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1469281">study</a> of olive oil demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Administering olive oil animals significantly reduced the number of harmful chemicals that can cause tissue injury and aging, particularly within the brain. Olive oil administration also increased levels of the enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage in the brain and also reduces the negative actions the lipopolysaccharide released by bacteria in the gut. Olive oil also reduced the level of inflammation in the brain.</p><p>So, yes, your brain benefits a lot from adding olive oil to your diet and these benefits originate in response to the changes that olive oil makes to your gut microbiome. Olive oil should become a big part of the diet for anyone with an aging brain.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Photo by Steve Buissinne from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/olive-oil-salad-dressing-cooking-968657/">Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/">How olive oil promotes brain health</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620131832/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/how-childhood-trauma-resurfaces-during-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">How childhood trauma resurfaces during COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-tips-for-teachers-who-see-emotional-abuse/" rel="nofollow">Six tips for teachers who see emotional abuse</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-ethics-of-defeating-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">The ethics of defeating COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/YKdkxcn_eTg/">PLOS ONE publishes its first Coronavirus-related paper</a></h4>

<p>Open Access and Open Science are critical, especially in times of crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak shows how important it is for medical professionals, scientific experts, and every member of the public to have immediate access to the latest science. Equal access to the latest research can assuage public fears or spur government action. Today, we’re happy to report that <em>PLOS ONE</em> published its first COVID-19 paper since we started <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/">fast-tracking submissions on January 31</a><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/"><sup>st</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Science leaders have <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf">recently requested</a> that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable">already supports</a>, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push <u>all </u>PLOS content to PubMed Central.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230548">The study</a> was conducted by Mingli Yuan and colleagues from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The researchers studied 27 patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan. In this patient group, the authors associated clinical features identified from computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs with eventual outcomes. They scored patients based on features they observed such as ground glass opacity, abnormality on both sides, and widespread distribution of pathology in the lungs, to produce an overall severity score for each patient.</p>
<p>Dr Yuan adds: “This study allows us to compare radiologic findings with the mortality of patients infected with COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Since February 1<sup>st</sup>, PLOS’ family of journals have received approximately 175 coronavirus-related submissions. This paper had a turnaround time of less than 21 days from submission to acceptance. A fast, open and transparent process of publishing reliable, peer reviewed science <em>and </em>its underlying data is an important contribution towards tackling this outbreak, and we are happy to make contributions to this effort. We are forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</a>.</p>
<p>We are compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a <a href="https://collections.plos.org/covid-19">Collection</a> as they publish. Meanwhile, you can keep tabs on our <a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs">Disease Forecasting and Surveillance Channel</a> for curated research related to coronavirus. We encourage all researchers investigating pressing issues like disease outbreaks and climate change, to also consider posting a <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint">Preprint</a>.  You can find the most recent preprints relating to the coronavirus outbreak – posted across bioRxiv and medRxiv on this <a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181">search link</a>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/kLhMdRBiCSg/">A message to our community regarding COVID-19</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Joerg Heber, Editorial Director, PLOS and Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS ONE</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the global research community, along with everyone else, adopts measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we wanted to update you on how we are dealing with the situation at PLOS.</span></p>
<h3><b>PLOS Operations</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a paper in process at any PLOS journal, it is being processed as normal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are conscious of the challenges that many of you face during this crisis. We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes. </span></p>
<h3><b>Reassurance for Our Research Communities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Authors</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time. Please keep in touch with us if you need any extensions or if you experience any challenges around manuscript preparation; we will work with you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fast-tracking all relevant research related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and are processing all other submissions as normal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are forwarding all submissions and papers related to the outbreak to the World Health Organization for their </span><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">database </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of publications on coronavirus.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage all researchers to also consider posting a </span><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remember that – across all our journals – we protect primary research studies from being considered “scooped” by closely related, parallel studies recently published in other journals. So, there is no need to rush your research, or revisions, for the sake of being selected for novelty!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reviewers</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have agreed to do a review, or would like to do a review, for a PLOS journal but need extra time, please just let us know. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can, please review </span><a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprints related to coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly via the preprint’s commenting options or on the </span><a href="https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid PreReview server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — this can speed up the review process down the line, as constructive comments may be vetted and used in a review process at a journal (read about PLOS’ </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or authors can respond rapidly to comments made</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the now-limited resources for experimental research due to closed laboratories, we encourage you to carefully consider the need for additional experiments or analyses in revision requests, especially if the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. (Note: while we recommend this for all journals during this crisis, this is always standard practice at PLOS ONE and simply a reminder in this case.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Editors</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your continued support of open research and of PLOS. We appreciate that you will have multiple calls on your time, and that at the moment it is hard to predict when these time pressures will occur. We are here to support you, please let us know if you need more time or assistance on any paper you are working on; we will work with you and the authors. </span></li>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology/">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a></h4>

<p>How companies and teams make decisions can be very challenging. Poor or ill-structured decision-making processes can make the organization less successful and create destructive conflicts in decision-making teams. But there are a few strategies companies can try that help organizations make big decisions in a better way.</p><p>People operate in complex and dynamic environments, making decisions with limited information under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast to routine decisions, strategic decisions are often made at top-management level and they have an impact on the whole organization in terms of its future direction and the scope of its activities. Such important decisions have a significant impact of the organization’s resource allocation that require trade-offs between alternatives and the setting of organizational priorities. In addition the strategic decision making process  rarely results in one clear best solution to the problem, but an organization makes a  decision it will be difficult to reverse. This is because the implementation of a decision involves a significant resource commitment and change in organizational activities.</p><p>Although we have ways to assess risk through probability theory, dealing with strategic decision problems is much more difficult where the information we gather to support a decision and the actual decision outcomes are uncertain and ambiguous.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/psychology/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-262">In complex decision situations, groups are better at solving problems than acting alone</a>. This may be because group members bring a variety of information, critical judgment, solution strategies, and a wide range of perspectives to the decision problem. However, groups can be subject to destructive conflict and cognitive biases that may hinder the quality of decision outcomes and group members’ decision acceptance.</p><p>The main group decision-making biases are <em>risky shift</em>, as groups tend to make risker decisions than individuals alone, and <em>groupthink</em>, as group members strive for consensus and harmony in their decision-making. In addition, group conflict may arise when people with competing opinions and solution alternatives clash.  Group decision-making, therefore, presents a managerial conundrum. On the one hand, multiple perspectives of group members can add insight into the problem situation. On the other hand, group diversity can produce fragmentation, conflict, or groupthink.</p><p>Group member interaction in decision-making situations may produce two types of conflict: cognitive and affective conflict. Task-focused<em> cognitive conflict</em> arises when group members focus on a task or an issue and debate to come up with a creative solution.  Cognitive conflict improves decision-making quality as the goal of the decision-makers is to find the best possible solution rather than win the argument. However, there is a danger that this beneficial cognitive conflict spills into a dysfunctional, affective conflict. Instead of working constructively to achieve the best possible solution, the debate becomes personal, adversarial, and a lose-win paradigm where one view prevails while others are discarded.</p><p>Affective conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes. These disputes can result from group members’ personal judgments that they are not fully able to explain to group members. The more these personal judgments influence decisions, the more there is potential for decision-making group members to speculate and find reasons to distrust the motivation and hidden agendas of other group members. Hence, too much affective conflict may hinder overall group performance as the decision will not be accepted by some decision-making group members regardless of the quality of the decision outcome.</p><p>Management consultants have developed several decision-making techniques to encourage critical interaction between decision-making group members. <em>Devil’s advocacy</em> is a decision-making technique where one or more people in the group works to point out all the flaws and risks with an option under consideration. <em>Dialectical inquiry</em> is a decision-making technique where divide into two camps: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Both sides highlight the advantages of their assigned decision and outline the disadvantages of the opposing idea.</p><p>Both dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy lead to higher quality assumptions and decision outcomes than a consensus approach in decision-making. However, consensus-seeking groups express more satisfaction and desire to continue to work with their groups and indicate a greater level of decision acceptance than those who were asked to apply dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy in their groups’ decision-making process. Hence, management scholars’ attention has turned to developing techniques that maintain moderate levels of cognitive conflict to ensure high quality decision outcomes, but simultaneously preserve group cohesion to prevent emergence of affective conflict.</p><p>Causal mapping is a visual decision-making technique that is designed to help groups improve their strategic decision-making processes and promote cognitive conflict, while at the same time preventing the emergence of affective conflict<strong>. </strong>Visual tools are particularly useful in strategy work as decisions are often made collectively in group working situations.</p><p>In a causal map, ideas are causally linked to one another through the use of arrows and nodes. The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another. In effect, the maps are word-and-arrow diagrams where the arrows mean “might cause,” “might lead to,” or “might result in.” Causal mapping facilitates a visual articulation of a large number of ideas, actions, and their consequences.</p><p>An example of a fully developed causal map is depicted in below. The map incorporates the collective understanding of a decision-problem by a decision-making group.</p><div><figure><img height="310" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gggggg-180x90.jpg" width="620" />Image Credits: Mikko Arevuo, ‘Epistemic objects in collective decision-making: a practice perspective on the use of causal maps as situated material artifacts’, PhD Thesis, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield CERES (2015). [accessed 16.07.2019]</figure></div><p>Causal maps that have been created in groups bring together the thinking of many people, including conflicting views, subtly different slants on the same issues, and different perspectives held by individual people. Such causal maps provide simplified representations of the beliefs of the greater group.</p><p>Group causal mapping could be perceived as a form of brainstorming, but there is a distinction between group maps and a free-flowing brainstorming of ideas. Group mapping that is used for decision-making is focused on raising issues and concerns. These are usually activities or events that can either support or challenge the decision-making aspiration of the group. In contrast to eliciting “off-the-wall” ideas in group brainstorming sessions as the means of unleashing creativity, group mapping focuses on bringing together the group members’ current wisdom and experience, as well as issues surrounding the problem. Therefore, group mapping is a process of engaging in a dialogue to uncover the causality between the problem and a number of potential solution outcomes, represented as a visual object. The mapping process provides the means for the decision-making group to structure and merge differing perspectives that should lead eventually into a shared understanding of the issue in a holistic manner.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Strategy-Mapping-Nonprofit-Organizations-ebook/dp/B00JZUPLPU/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1583250943&amp;refinements=p_27%3AJohn+M.+Bryson&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=John+M.+Bryson">There is increasing evidence that</a> the causal mapping process prevents decision-making groups from talking over each other and going around in circles. It helps group members to speak and be heard. The mapping process produces a lot of ideas and can ultimately clarify the most suitable course of action. Furthermore, the shared and collective enactment of a group causal map can increase individual ownership, acceptance, and the feeling of fairness of the decision outcomes. This is because the map shows evidence that people have listened to everyone in the group.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: AbsolutVision, ‘Photo of bulb artwork’ via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/82TpEld0_e4">Unsplash </a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620039770/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fgggggg-180x90.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/adult-aging-alone-american-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Integrated care is characterized by a proactive and person-centered approach to care, which is seamlessly coordinated across multiple professional disciplines and care interfaces. Integrated care aims to improve outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, and quality of care. The organisation of integrated primary and community care is considered an essential step towards supporting older people to age in place.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintaining people’s safety at home</strong></h3>
<p>To support older people living at home, it is essential to maintain their safety. Older people encounter limitations in multiple domains of life, which could pose risks to their ability to live safely and independently at home. Such risks may relate to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/47/6/830/626240">different factors</a>, including people’s functioning and behavior, their physical and social environments, and the health and social care they receive. This wide range of risks could lead to a multitude of problems that challenge people’s safety at home, ultimately resulting in emergency department visits, (re)hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. Given its proactive, interdisciplinary and comprehensive character, integrated care is expected to provide opportunities to address <a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/18/6/424.long">the prevention of such risks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1482-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our recently published scoping review</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a> shows that integrated care programs for older people living at home address a broad range of safety risks. After examining included programs according to the predefined conceptual framework shown in Figure 1, findings show that all programs addressed risks related to people’s functioning and behavior, and several programs addressed risks associated with people’s health and social care management. Fewer programs addressed risks related to people’s social and physical environments. However, as the number of people receiving care and support at home keeps rising, risks related to people’s socio-economic conditions, their home environments, and increasing caregiver responsibilities, for example, are becoming more prominent. Therefore, addressing such risks is important, especially since <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0521-5">older people themselves also express their concerns</a> regarding these issues.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11783" style="width: 299px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11783 size-full" height="289" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/pic.jpg" width="289" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1. Domains of risks that could challenge people’s ability to live safely at home.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Timely identification of risks, combined with relevant clinical, behavioral and environmental interventions and support, as well as care coordination or case management, would enhance care providers’ ability to support older people’s safety at home. Prioritizing such a proactive and multidimensional approach requires combining the expertise of professionals from different disciplines of health and social care. However, our scoping review suggests that these linkages between health and social care are not yet common practice in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Investing in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101930260X">collaborative skills</a> and inter-professional dynamics, as well as addressing financial and organisational incentives for collaboration, are deemed necessary to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484371/">strengthen these linkages</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Balancing safety, autonomy, quality of care and quality of life</strong></h3>
<p>This review showed that integrated care programs can potentially incorporate many ways of addressing and preventing risks. However, it remains challenging to priorities these activities in a way that is meaningful for older people. Adopting a person-centered way of working, in which professional expertise is tailored to people’s individual needs and preferences, is considered one of the core components of integrated care. In this light, it is important to acknowledge that safety is not the only aspect to consider, especially in the care provided in the context of people’s homes. People’s homes are not only care settings, but the setting of their daily lives, and older people may have preferences or make choices that value quality of life over safety. This means that safety risks cannot be addressed independently of older people’s perspectives. Instead, professionals are tasked to consider their professional perceptions in combination with older people’s preferences, and find a balance between aspects such as safety, prevention, autonomy and quality of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, in practice, this raises the question of responsibility and accountability for the safety of older people living at home. Naturally, professionals have no control over how older people live their lives and the choices they make. As such, professionals cannot be held accountable for the adverse consequences of those choices. What then, exactly, is the responsibility of health and social care professionals? And what is the responsibility of older people themselves, their families, or society? How is accountability for adverse events shared across these different stakeholders? These questions necessitate a widespread debate on our perceptions and expectations of quality of care, prevention, and ethics, as well as individual, professional and societal responsibility and accountability.</p>
<h3><strong>Expanding the health care paradigm</strong></h3>
<p>Concluding, integrated care provides both a platform and tools that could be harnessed further to support older people living at home in a manner that balances safety with other values important to older people. However, it is important to note that efforts to integrate health and social care alone are not enough. Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being – a paradigm that recognizes the role that health, social, and environmental factors play in older people’s ability to live safely at home, and in which many different actors in the wider community play their part and perform their responsibilities.</p>

Rampant panic buying, superstore shelves emptied of toilet paper, selfish people hoarding hand sanitizer. Worries about elderly relatives, jobs, money, health care costs. <br /><br />If you already have a serious anxiety disorder, how can you possibly cope in the current climate of fear and uncertainty? What if one of the core recommendations to help prevent disease transmission is the very pathology you've worked so hard to overcome?<br /><br /><br /><b>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</b><br /><br />Contamination fears cause many individuals with OCD to compulsively wash their hands. Meanwhile, the directive to frequently wash your hands with soap &amp; water for 20 seconds could be quite triggering for some. The International OCD Foundation has provided helpful resources:<br /><br /><a href="https://iocdf.org/covid19/" target="_blank">Resources for the OCD and related disorders community during the COVID-19 outbreak</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In times like these, what the experts are recommending temporarily becomes our new normal.  This may mean that you need to make some changes to your treatment, including which exposures you do, when you do them, how frequently, etc. What might normally be considered a “baseline” for people with OCD to aspire to should shift to match the recommended guidelines for as long as those guidelines are in place. A good suggestion would be to talk about the guidelines with your treatment team at your next session and go over how, if at all, your plan might change for the near future.<br /><br />It is important for all of us in the OCD and related disorders community to remember that this is temporary, and understand that it may feel uncomfortable. You are not going backwards in your recovery journey because the baseline changes. These troubled times will end, and you will keep doing your best in the meantime.</blockquote>They also provide recommendations for what you should and should NOT do.<br /><br /><u>Examples of <b>What to do</b></u>:<br /><ul><li>set a time limit of 5 minutes <span style="font-weight: 400;">per day for reading news and updates from <b>trusted sources</b></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">take breaks and allow yourself to do things you enjoy</span></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consult your treatment team </span></span></li></ul><u>Examples of <b>What NOT to do</b></u>: <br /><ul><li>avoid the temptation to learn “everything” about COVID-19</li><li>do not excessively wash your hands </li><li>don’t let “social distancing” rob you of your support networks <span class="st">–</span> seek online connections</li></ul><br /><b>Generalized Anxiety Disorder </b><br /><br />Tips from Health Canada:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.anxietycanada.com/articles/what-to-do-if-you-are-anxious-or-worried-about-coronavirus-covid-19/" target="_blank">What to do if you’re anxious or worried about coronavirus (COVID-19)</a><br /><ul><li>Be self-compassionate</li><li>Limit the news &amp; unplug from social media</li><li>Stop talking about coronavirus</li><li>Protect yourself</li></ul>...and more<br /><br /><br /><b>Health Anxiety</b><br /><blockquote>The constant new barrage of developments regarding the current outbreak of COVID-19 can cause particular challenges for people living with anxiety, stress and/or anxiety-based depression especially those that have health anxiety and/or OCD.</blockquote>Suggestions from Anxiety UK:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/blog/health-and-other-forms-of-anxiety-and-coronavirus/" target="_blank">Health and other forms of anxiety and coronavirus</a><br /><ul><li>Firstly, try to limit your exposure to news sources which are covering the coronavirus issue as this only serves to feed fear.</li></ul>[<i>an ongoing theme</i>]<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/blog/covid-19-and-anxiety-part2/" target="_blank">COVID-19 and anxiety – part 2</a><br /><ul><li>For those that have anxiety disorders such as claustrophobia, agoraphobia and panic disorder, some of the potential management strategies that are being discussed in relation to COVID-19 might give rise to specific challenges and thoughts of ‘feeling trapped’.</li></ul><ul><li>Fearing being ‘out of control’ and ‘being unable to tolerate uncertainty’ are actually common characteristics of many anxiety disorders and therefore it stands to reason why so many individuals with pre-existing anxiety may now be seemingly experiencing an exacerbation of their anxiety as a result of COVID-19.</li></ul>[see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjhp.12058" target="_blank"><i>Intolerance of uncertainty, appraisals, coping, and anxiety: The case of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic</i></a>]<br /><br /><br /><b>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</b><br /><br />Suggestions from the National Center for PTSD:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/covid/COVID_managing_stress.asp" target="_blank">Managing Stress Associated with the COVID-19 Virus Outbreak</a><br /><ul><li>Increase Sense of Safety </li><li>Stay Connected</li><li>Cultivate Ways to be More Calm</li><li>Improve Your Sense of Control and Ability to Endure</li></ul><u>Those who have been faced with life-threatening situations recommended the following strategies</u>:<br /><ul><li>Quickly recognize, acknowledge, and accept the reality of the situation.</li><li>Make a plan for dealing with feelings of being overwhelmed or overly distressed. </li><li>Combat unhelpful emotions by using distraction or staying busy—both mentally and physically.</li><li>Avoid impulsive behavior.</li><li>Increase positive coping behaviors that have worked in the past.</li><li>Shift negative self-statements to statements that allow you to function with less distress. </li></ul>...and more<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/covid/COVID_healthcare_workers.asp" target="_blank">Managing Healthcare Workers' Stress Associated with the COVID-19 Virus Outbreak</a><br /><blockquote>A strong service-orientation, a lack of time, difficulties in acknowledging or recognizing their own needs, stigma, and fear of being removed from their duties during a crisis may prevent staff from requesting support if they are experiencing stress reactions.

In the meantime, the potential is there for contagion to other patients on the unit, the hospital staff, and visitors to the unit.</blockquote><br /><b>Readers</b> <span class="st">–</span> if you have any suggestions for helpful resources or personal coping strategies, feel free to comment here or <a href="https://twitter.com/neurocritic" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>.<br /><br /><div class="feedflare">
