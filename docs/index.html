                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9387">Scientific Salami Slicing: 33 Papers from 1 Study</a></h4>

"Salami slicing" refers to the practice of breaking scientific studies down into small chunks and publishing each part as a seperate paper.



Given that scientists are judged in large part by the number of peer-reviewed papers they produce, it's easy to understand the temptation to engage in salami publication. It's officialy discouraged, but it's still very common to see researchers writing perhaps 3 or 4 papers based on a single project that could, realistically, have been one big paper.

It’s always interesting to know how many researchers in any given field engage in so-called questionable research practices that don’t rise to the level of out-and-out fraud: honorary authorship, citing articles they don’t read, choosing reference lists that would please editors or reviewers, for instance. And when the researchers work in a field with potential … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/03/02/ethical-shades-of-gray-90-of-researchers-in-new-health-field-admit-to-questionable-practices/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">“Ethical shades of gray:” 90% of researchers in new health field admit to questionable practices</span></a>

<p>You may have seen the recent viral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54">TV interview</a> in which the Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson claimed that an important part of the reason there are fewer women than men in leadership positions is to do with personality differences between the sexes. Specifically, he said that women on average score lower than men on traits, such as assertiveness, that are known to be associated with reaching senior roles, and higher on others that work against promotion, especially agreeableness and emotional sensitivity.</p>
<p>While these observations are largely <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161011-do-men-and-women-really-have-different-personalities">backed by</a> <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0021-9010.87.4.765">evidence</a>, what’s far less clear – because the question simply hasn’t been studied much before – is whether women who reach senior management tend to share the traits of men in these positions, or if instead female bosses have a contrasting personality profile, indicative of an alternative, “feminine” route to the top.</p>
<p>These are pertinent questions for any one who would like more gender diversity in leadership roles because the findings could point to clues for how to ease the promotion path for women. For a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879118300228">paper</a> in <em>Journal of Vocational Behaviour,</em> a team led by Bart Wille at the University of Antwerp has investigated.</p>
<p><span id="more-33385"></span></p>
<p>The researchers accessed comprehensive personality tests taken by nearly 600 top-level executives (including 143 female bosses) and over 52,000 non-executives (including 17,643 women) from diverse industries in Belgium and other European countries.</p>
<p>Men and women in non-leadership roles differed in their personality traits in ways consistent with the existing literature – for instance, women scored higher than men on characteristics associated with being more agreeable, such as being cooperative and people-oriented, while scoring lower on emotional stability and aspects of extraversion. In contrast, the personalities of male and female bosses were far more similar, with many sex-linked differences absent altogether or greatly attenuated (although the women still scored higher on aspects of agreeableness).</p>
<p>“…[M]en and women in executive positions demonstrate a similar pattern of classically masculine personality traits,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>This picture was reinforced by the within-sex personality comparisons between bosses and non-bosses. Whereas the personality of female managers contrasted sharply with the traits of non-managerial women, male bosses were not so different in their traits from non-managerial men. “Women tend to be lower on traits that lead individuals to pursue and be selected for leadership roles,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>All this would appear to support the Peterson view: because there are more men with the traits associated with striving for and obtaining leadership than there are women, it could be argued this helps explain the paucity of women in management roles. In turn, helping women develop more stereotypically masculine traits of the kind displayed by the male and female managers in this study, could be one way to enable more women to become bosses. Again, this matches the Peterson perspective – in his Channel 4 interview, he talked about how he has coached women to be more assertive to help them gain promotion.</p>
<p>However, one problem with this solution is that existing evidence suggests that women often face a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/04/female-bosses-judged-more-harshly-than-male-counterparts-for-being-insensitive-disrespectful/">backlash</a> when they display stereotypically masculine traits. Wille and his team mention this issue and they say that “organisations must strive to counter these biases”. Another criticism is that this approach is arguably all about changing women to excel in existing male-dominated hierarchies, rather than changing workplace cultures to make them fairer.</p>
<p>Perhaps, if there were a cultural change, then people with different personality profiles, including more stereotypically feminine traits, might more often reach leadership roles, which would then favour more women. Peterson acknowledged the potential benefits of such a shift in his Channel 4 interview: “It could be the case that if companies modified their behaviour and became more feminine then they would be more successful”, he said, although he added that “there is no evidence for it”.</p>
<p>However you choose to interpret the new findings, they help answer a question that many have long speculated about. They suggest that even after several decades with an increasing female presence in the workplace, it remains the case that the same stereotypically masculine traits predict the attainment of senior roles among men and women.</p>
<p>Many issues remain unanswered and the study had various limitations. For instance, we don’t know if the women with a profile of higher extraversion and lower emotional instability were more likely to become bosses because they harboured more leadership ambitions, or because they had what it takes to overcome the barriers to the top. Also, the study relied on participants rating their own personalities, and it was conducted within a particular culture so the findings may not generalise.</p>
<p>“This study found that male and female C-level executives represent similar populations with a common profile of characteristic agentic, strategic personality traits,” the researchers concluded. “Ongoing research and practice should acknowledge that gender similarity, not difference, characterises leader personality and potential.”</p>

<p>No matter where they live, people interpret certain kinds of vocalisations, even from animals, as conveying a particular emotion – as “angry”, for instance, or “soothing”. It’s tempting to think that there might be similar cross-cultural universals in the ways that we use music – that a song used to calm an infant in Melanesia, say, should bear striking similarities to a song created for the same purpose by a culture in the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>Well, it’s tempting if you’re a cognitive scientist – though not if you’re an ethnomusicologist (who studies music from different cultures), according to a survey of the opinions of academics reported in a <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(17)31675-5">new paper</a>, published in <i>Current Biology</i>. “Historically, the idea that there might be universals in music from many cultures has been met with considerable scepticism, especially among music scholars,” note the authors of the study, led by Samuel Mehr at Harvard University, which then goes on to explore whether they do exist.</p>
<p><span id="more-33375"></span></p>
<p>The team recruited 750 online participants from 60 countries. They listened to a random sample of 36 excerpts of songs taken from the <i>Natural History of Song</i> discography, which includes vocal music from 86 predominantly small-scale societies – such as love songs from the Fulani society of pastoralists from Western Africa, lullabies from Igluik Inuit hunger-gatherers from the Arctic Circle, and dance songs by a society of horticulturalists from Melanesia. “The broad range of cultures and languages…combined with the many countries of origin of the participants makes it likely that participants were both unfamiliar with the music they heard and unable to understand the lyrics,” the researchers note.</p>
<p>These particular songs were chosen because each represented one of four specific social functions: “for dancing”, “to soothe a baby”, “to heal illness” and “to express love for another person”. The participants’ task was to indicate, on six-point scales, the degree to which they believed each song was used for each of those four reasons.</p>
<p>The listeners were fairly accurate at judging which songs were intended “for dancing” or “to soothe a baby”. They were less competent at recognising healing songs: while they were generally of the opinion that these songs were not “for dancing”, they found it hard to judge whether they were for healing or for soothing a baby. The participants were least accurate at spotting “love songs”.</p>
<p>In a second experiment, the researchers explored which features of the various songs the listeners might have been using to make their judgements. Using 500 participants from India and 500 from the US, they found that dance songs were rated as having higher melodic complexity, a faster tempo and a steadier beat, for example, relative to the three other song types. Lullabies, meanwhile, were rated as having lower melodic complexity, lower rhythmic complexity, a slower tempo and a less steady beat than the other three types. It seems likely then that these are culturally universal characteristics shared by music that serves these functions.</p>
<p>However, we can’t be entirely sure this is the case. As the researchers note, all the participants in these experiments had access to the internet, so while in theory there was no reason to think that a listener from India would have been familiar with lullabies from the Arctic, they might have been. More likely, they may already have heard various songs with different uses from different cultures, and this experience, rather than cultural universals in the use of music, might have influenced the participants’ conclusions. “A stronger test of universality would require testing the inferences of people living in isolated societies with minimal access to the music of other cultures,” the researchers note.</p>
<p>Still, overall, “these findings are consistent with the existence of universal form-function links in human song,” the researchers argue.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/AdobeStock_139538849-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Most studies on blood pressure (BP) have focused on high BP, whereas studies on low BP are rare. Unlike hypertension, constitutional low BP is not considered to be related to serious illness or death, and it is widely accepted that ‘the lower the BP, the better’.</p>
<p>However, it was not difficult to find people who complain, ‘I’m dizzy because my blood pressure is low’ or ‘I feel down because of my low blood pressure’. This raised our suspicions about the common perception that low blood pressure is not really a problem, and thus marked the beginning of our research.</p>
<p>Using data from the 2010-2013 Korea National Health and Nutrition survey, we compared 10,708 people with either normal or low blood pressure. Suicidal ideation was identified by asking one of two questions: “Have you ever felt inclined to commit suicide over the last year?” (2010-2012) and “Have you ever considered suicide seriously over the last year?” (2013).</p>
<p>The results showed that among people with normal blood pressure, the proportion of those with suicidal ideation was 10.8%. This proportion increased for people with lower blood pressures: those with systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;100 mmHg the proportion was 12.5%; those with SBP &lt;95 mmHg, 13.7%; and those with SBP &lt;90 mmHg, 16.6%. In other words the lower the blood pressure, the higher the percentage of people with suicidal thought. Observing the distribution of low blood pressure among those with suicidal thought and those without, we came to the following assumption: Low blood pressure may explain a higher risk of suicidal thought.</p>
<blockquote><p>Observing the distribution of low blood pressure among those with suicidal thought and those without, we came to the following assumption: Low blood pressure may explain a higher risk of suicidal thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>We then analyzed the risk of suicidal ideation present in people with low blood pressure after controlling for potential confounding variables such as gender, age, BMI and underlying diseases. As a result, people with a systolic blood pressure lower than 100 mmHg were shown to have more than 25% higher odds of suicide ideation than those with normal blood pressure.</p>
<p>We also found that increasing the strictness of the criteria for low BP led to a more pronounced tendency towards suicidal ideation. That is, the odds of suicidal ideation for the low blood pressure group with a cut-off value of SBP&lt; 95 mmHg and SBP &lt;90 mmHg was 43% and 74% higher, respectively, than that of the normal pressure group.</p>
<p>In addition to looking at low blood pressure, we also investigated the risk of suicidal thought at high blood pressure. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the risk of suicidal ideation among the higher blood pressure groups (pre-hypertensive and hypertensive) and that of the normotensive group. Therefore, low blood pressure may pose its own different health issues in comparison to high blood pressure. Our study hereby challenges the perception that, in terms of mental health, lower blood pressure is always better.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this study is a cross-sectional study and cannot verify the causal relationship between low blood pressure and suicidal ideation. The study’s use of self-reported survey data may have introduced information and recall bias. As only levels of systolic blood pressure were used to define low blood pressure, future studies are needed to explore the relationship between suicidal ideation and diastolic blood pressure. Further research is also needed into the possible biological mechanisms that may explain the association between blood pressure and suicidal ideation.</p>
<p>This study is the first to investigate the association between low BP and suicidal ideation, which is an indicator of a negative psychiatric state, and thus underscores the need to re-evaluate the health implications of low BP. This may also call for careful monitoring of the mental health conditions of those with low BP.</p>

<blockquote><p>The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition</p>
<p>-The States Parties to the WHO Constitution</p></blockquote>
<p>With the interest in human rights issues having grown exponentially in recent years, <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC International Health and Human Rights</em></a> provides a niche home for work which is carried out to communicate, across various disciplines and geographical boundaries, human rights issues related to health. The journal also welcomes <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/debate">debate</a> pieces, important for stimulating discussion and further research.</p>
<p>In highlighting <em>BMC International Health and Human Rights</em> as a forum for activists, practitioners and academics from human rights, public health and related fields, we are delighted to announce the revised scope of the journal:</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC International Health and Human Rights</em> is an open access, peer-reviewed journal that considers articles on the influences of human rights violations on health in developing and transitional countries, as well as all issues relating to the impact of health policies, programs and practices on human rights.</strong></p>
<p>The journal is separated into the following sections, each with its own focus on core subject areas under the umbrella of health and human rights:</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/health-and-human-rights-of-marginalized-populations">Health and human rights of marginalized populations</a></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9972" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9972" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/aid-300x218.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Disadvantaged and marginalised populations tend to be excluded from what may be considered by them to be the luxury of enjoying good health. This section of the journal considers studies regarding the health and human rights of members of marginalized populations, including sexual and gender minorities, children, migrants, ethnic minorities, refugees, displaced people, commercial sex workers, injection drug users, and other marginalized populations.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/healthcare-availability-practices-and-development">Healthcare availability, practices and development</a></p>
<p>Healthcare needs to be both available and accessible to all. Together with the need for a sufficient quantity of health care facilities, goods, services and programs, barriers of accessibility to these services should be identified and addressed. This section considers studies addressing all aspects of access to and availability of healthcare, healthcare knowledge, practices, and beliefs, as well as studies of healthcare development and training in rural and/or developing areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/prison-violence-and-conflict">Prison, violence, and conflict</a></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9970" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9970" height="198" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/prison-300x198.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Harmful traditional practices, torture, trafficking, violence against women, and violence against children are just a few of the various forms of violence which have been recognized as human rights issues. Freedom from violence and conflict is a fundamental human right. This section considers studies regarding the health and human rights of prison inmates and victims of violence, war, and civil conflict.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/healthcare-policy-and-law">Healthcare policy and law</a></p>
<p>A rights-based approach to health requires that health policy must prioritize the needs of those furthest behind first towards greater equity. Standards in both law and policy are required to address barriers to healthcare. This section considers studies regarding the impact of international and national policies on healthcare for individuals and communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/sections/hiv-aids">HIV/AIDS</a></p>
<p>As one of the world’s most fatal communicable diseases, HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects the world’s poorest populations, and in many cases, its effects are intensified by other factors such as gender, age, sexual orientation or gender identity and migration status. This section of the journal considers studies regarding all aspects of healthcare provision for and the social aspects of HIV/AIDS in developing countries, including awareness, stigma, prevention and treatment.</p>

<p>The tone was set on my first day at university. After a tough year of sitting exams to get the grades required to be admitted to a competitive undergraduate science programme, I was sitting in my first lecture. The professor stood in front of around 300 excited undergraduate students and began their first lecture with the statement “A year from now around half of you will be gone”. Indeed, what followed were three gruelling years of constant pressure with exams every 6 weeks and term breaks filled with additional lab work, seminar presentations, or essays. By the end, only around a third obtained their degree.</p>
<p>Rather than protesting this brutal pressure that robbed us of our intellectual and social breathing space, we students were largely complicit. On the contrary, a culture developed that aggravated and justified the pressure. After all, this level of sacrifice is to be expected if you want to make it at a top university. Plus, the recession had hit hard and obtaining jobs was seen as a struggle for life at an institution that offered little perspective on employment prospects outside of academia. It seemed like there was no chance to find employment without top grades and extracurricular activities to make you stand out.</p>
<p>I observed a similar culture as an MSc and later PhD student at a different institution in a different country. Senior academics told us that the commitment necessary to obtain their position had taken a substantial toll on their private lives. Again, there were myths floating around that made the pressure balloon to even more crushing proportions. Apparently, getting a position as a university lecturer is impossible with a Nature or Science publication, students working less than 45 hours per week might as well give up, and if you really took it seriously you should consider emulating Professor X who gets through his enormous workload with caffeine pills and nicotine gum. I adapted to this culture by working extremely long hours, working on weekends, taking on additional projects, and neglecting my social life.</p>
<p>After bearing the pressure stoically for a few years, I had my first breakdown during the second year of my PhD. I had fallen into a vicious cycle of caffeine-fuelled work during the week and heavy drinking on weekends – the abundance of cafes and pubs around university might indicate that this is a common pattern. One Monday morning, I did not find the strength to get up. The isolation and constant pressure of my PhD had sucked the joy out of my life. By sacrificing almost everything for my work, I had eroded all the support that might have provided some resilience.  Fortunately, I could get professional help and managed to start building a healthier relationship with academic work, which is still very much work in progress.</p>
<p>I think a learned a few lessons about triggers that make academic work problematic for people with a predisposition for depression and/or anxiety like myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>unclear or unrealistic expectations: We often don’t know what leads to success and if it is attainable</li>
<li>isolated work: In my experience, scientists often work by themselves and identify a lot with their work</li>
<li>high standards, abundant criticism: from anonymous peer review to seminar questions, scientists have to deal with a lot of negative feedback</li>
<li>comparisons: the golden boy from lab X just received a fellowship right after his PhD, the people I follow on social media publish papers in high impact journals all the time, X is not only a great postdoc but also an accomplished concert pianist, …</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I had a good solution for dealing with these triggers, but, unfortunately, I don’t. However, I think that there are things to all of us can do to change this culture of pressure and make life more enjoyable for all. First, we should acknowledge that longer working hours and higher workloads are not the route to success. In contrast, leisure time is essential for building creativity and resilience. Second, share your difficulties as well as your successes. Even the most accomplished scientists are not some sort of Übermensch and will have experienced some setbacks. It is important for junior scientists to hear these stories and learn how they can be overcome. Third, we should all monitor how we communicate with other people. You may disagree with another scientist’s work, but you should acknowledge that this scientist’s time, sweat, and blood went into this work. So, in reviews or Q&amp;A sessions at least try to find something nice to say.</p>

<p>The talk will be based mainly on Voelter et al's paper on "Handling
Variability in Model Transformations and Generators". Marco will provide
an introduction to the topic and explain how it relates to his
research. At the end of the talk he will provide a brief introduction

<p>Main paper by Voelter et al: Handling Variability in Model Transformations and Generators</p>
<p>Software product line engineering aims to reduce development
time, effort, cost, and complexity by taking advantage of the
commonality within a portfolio of similar products. The effectiveness
of a software product line approach directly depends on how well
feature variability within the portfolio is implemented and managed
throughout the development lifecycle, from early analysis through
maintenance and evolution. Using DSLs and AO to implement product
lines can yield significant advantages, since the variability can be
implemented on a higher level of abstraction, in less detailed models.
This paper illustrates how variability can be implemented in
model-to-model transformations and code generators using
aspect-oriented techniques. These techniques are important ingredients
for the aspectoriented model-driven product line engineering approach
presented in [13].</p>
<p>Secondary paper by Rose et al: A Feature Model for Model-to-Text Transformation Languages</p>
<p>Model-to-text (M2T) transformation is an important model management
operation, as it is used to implement code and documentation
generation; model serialisation (enabling model interchange); and
model visualisation and exploration. Despite the creation of the MOF
Model-To-Text Transformation Language (MOFM2T) in 2008, many very
different M2T languages exist today. Because there is little
interoperability between M2T languages and rewriting an existing M2T
transformation in a new language is costly, developers face a
difficult choice when selecting a M2T language. In this paper, we use
domain analysis to identify a preliminary feature model for M2T
languages. We demonstrate the appropriateness of the feature model by
describing two different M2T languages, and discuss potential
applications for a tool-supported and model-driven approach to
describing the features of M2T languages.</p>

A biology journal is investigating concerns about a 2014 paper by a marine biologist who was found guilty of misconduct last year. In December, Uppsala University concluded that Oona Lönnstedt had “fabricated the results” of a controversial 2016 Science paper (now retracted), which examined the harms of human pollution on fish. (Lönnstedt’s supervisor Peter Eklöv … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/28/journal-investigating-earlier-work-by-author-of-discredited-fish-microplastics-paper/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Journal investigating earlier work by author of discredited fish-microplastics paper </span></a>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">"The Arms of Nildo and Rony:" a NeuroMat story</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">A professional motorcyclist and a surgeon meet up at the waiting room of a physiotherapy clinic. They share a common story: rehabilitation after a traumatic brachial plexus injury. Their fate is somehow similar to the one of a famous soccer player who, after a serious lesion, must attend therapy sections to learn again how to play, after a period of recovery. These stories are the guiding narratives of a newly released educational material for patients, caregivers and health professionals, the illustrated magazine "The Arms of Nildo and Rony."

<p>Although criminal investigation has been transformed through technological developments in DNA, phone tracking, and online data, the way a detective works through a crime has remained much the same. The first suspect is often the true perpetrator, but not always, and snowballing biases continue to lead to miscarriages of justice. Proficient detectives need the ability to generate and evaluate different explanations and keep an open mind. New <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-017-9231-3">research</a> in the <i>Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology</i> investigates whether it’s possible to use established tests of reasoning ability to identify who has the skills necessary for thinking this way.</p>
<p><span id="more-33367"></span></p>
<p>University of Gothenburg psychologists Ivar Fahsing and Karl Ask asked 166 recruits (60 women, aged around 23) from the Norwegian Police University College to complete two tests of reasoning ability. One involved deductive reasoning – the ability to apply rules to reach a correct conclusion, in this case, combining shapes to form a new target shape. The other involved inductive reasoning –  viewing different images, and using these to figure out the rule that is governing them all. These tests already feature in Norwegian police recruitment but it’s not clear whether they are useful for predicting detective skills, which are more dependent on abductive reasoning, which is much harder to test.</p>
<p>Whereas deduction seeks linear, definitive conclusions, and induction tries to identify a category based on the available clues (“all birds, none fly”  therefore the category must be “flightless birds”), abduction amplifies the known information to generate imaginative possibilities (“an open wine bottle and smashed glasses could suggest a thwarted seduction… or a failed reconciliation with his wife?”). It requires a leap of logic, a creative act, hard to measure but known to differentiate stronger investigators, whether criminal or scientific. The ability to make many such leaps helps avoid premature foreclosure on the possibilities of a case.</p>
<p>Fahsing and Ask were hopeful that measures of deductive and inductive reasoning would help identify better detectives because investigation isn’t rooted solely in abduction, and because different forms of reasoning ability are known to correlate (so a candidate skilful at deduction and induction ought to be skilled at abduction and therefore detective thinking too).</p>
<p>To assess detection nous, the researchers asked their participants to review two case vignettes, each describing a woman missing under ambiguous circumstances, and some versions also mentioned the arrest of a suspect. The participants’ task was to outline all the possible explanations that could account for the facts. Both vignettes had been reviewed by an expert panel of detectives, who generated a “gold standard” of 9 viable hypotheses for the first and 11 for the second.</p>
<p>The participants tended to neglect the non-criminal hypotheses, such as the possibility the missing woman had suffered an accident. More importantly, scores on the reasoning ability tests didn’t predict their detective performance. Nor did they predict immunity to a commonly observed detecting error: becoming more narrow-minded (generating fewer hypotheses) after reading that a suspect had been arrested.</p>
<p>The current data suggest that commonly used cognitive assessments are unlikely to help identify candidates with the best aptitude for becoming a detective. It seems police forces will need to think more inventively about the actual skills that contribute to good detection if they are to succeed in separating the Maigrets from the Clouseaus.</p>

<h4>What does it mean to be author number seven on a twenty-five–author article?</h4>
<p>Establishing transparency for each author’s role in a research study is one of the recommendations in a <strong><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/02/26/1715374115" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report published today</a></strong> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (<strong><a href="http://www.pnas.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PNAS</a></strong>) by a group led by Marcia McNutt, President of the National Academy of Sciences. The recommendations issued by this group, which included one of us, were adapted based on community feedback and peer review from an original draft presented as a <strong><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/20/140228" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preprint</a></strong>. PLOS supports the recommendations for increased transparency and has already put some of them in practice.</p>
<p>A more systematic description of author contributions is a prerequisite to providing due credit for roles that are instrumental to the research enterprise, especially those roles that are too often ignored or devalued. For example, collecting, curating and sharing a dataset or developing a new methodological approach that can be reused by others are key contributions that may not always land a ‘first author position’ but have applications beyond a single article and deserve recognition.</p>
<p>Transparency also brings more accountability to a system where questionable and even detrimental practices (such as guest, ghost or conscripted authorship) have been documented. While transparency requirements cannot entirely eliminate abuse, transparent description of individual author contributions can deter inaccurate representations and can expose institutionalized authorship practices that should be questioned.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, a concern often heard about emphasizing contributions is that they risk diluting individual author responsibility for the overall integrity of a study. The recommendations address this concern by stipulating authorship standards that require each author to be “personally accountable for [their] own contributions and to ensure that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work, even ones in which the author was not personally involved, are appropriately investigated, resolved, and the resolution documented in the literature.” Thus, having one’s contributions precisely described does not absolve any author of responsibility for the accuracy and rigor of the entire study.</p>
<p>The paper also recommends mechanisms by which publishers can bring a minimum level of standardization to the description of author contributions. In particular, the group advocates for the implementation of <strong><a href="https://orcid.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORCID</a></strong> identifiers and the <strong><a href="http://dictionary.casrai.org/Contributor_Roles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CRediT</a></strong> taxonomy as emerging standards in the industry. While many journals already require specification of author contributions, a more fully integrated system of persistent identifiers (like ORCID iDs for authors and DOIs for articles) connected via a standardized vocabulary of relationships (like the CRediT taxonomy for contributions) will make the information both human- and machine-readable and allow it to be surfaced more easily.</p>
<p>PLOS journals have adopted both <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/01/author-credit-plos-orcid-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORCID</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CRediT</a></strong> since 2016; the roles and ORCID iDs provided by authors are now visible with one click on the author name in the by-line. ORCID information is passed on to CrossRef, which updates ORCID records with authors’ permissions.</p>
<p>In our experience, the CRediT taxonomy has worked well, but the definition of some individual terms could be improved. In particular, those related to data may benefit from some refinement to distinguish generation of data from its subsequent curation. As others examine the possibility of using the taxonomy, we encourage a collaborative approach with CASRAI’s CRediT Committee, the taxonomy steward, to match the needs of different communities.</p>
<p>Not all roles in the CRediT taxonomy immediately qualify a participant for authorship; that qualification is determined by journal policy. To determine who should be an author, PLOS currently follows the <strong><a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recommendation</a></strong> established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (<strong><a href="http://www.icmje.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ICMJE</a></strong>) for medical journals which posits that authorship should be associated with a substantive intellectual contribution as well as participation in drafting or revising the manuscript. While <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/authorship" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Medicine</em></a></strong> checks that all four ICMJE criteria are met by all authors, the experience at other PLOS journals indicates that in fields outside medicine, not all authors state they have participated in the drafting or revising of the manuscript. The proposed adaptation of authorship criteria in the<strong> <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/02/26/1715374115" rel="noopener" target="_blank">current PNAS report</a></strong>, which includes writing as a <em>qualification</em> for authorship but does not <em>require</em> it, aims not to exclude important contributors from authorship. Conversely, the inclusion of writing without other intellectual contribution to a study as a role worthy of authorship may not find acceptance in all disciplines. The intent is not to impose a monolithic approach to authorship, but to accommodate a broad range of community standards transparently. When contributors do not meet authorship criteria, CRediT can also serve to document their precise contributions as acknowledged colleagues, supported by other means of credit like citations of protocols and datasets.</p>
<p>On a <strong><a href="http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/Transparency_Author_Contributions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new website</a></strong>, the report’s authors commit to reflect upon and improve current authorship guidelines and practices at the journals they represent, and they encourage other journals to do the same. Such introspection and subsequent discussion are timely, as research studies are increasingly large-scale and multi-disciplinary affairs. As more work goes into providing due credit for scholarly contributions like methods development, data collection and data sharing, transparency in authorship roles should advance in tandem.</p>

<p>Intelligence tests are meant to tell you something about a person’s inherent abilities. But what if the results are distorted by the motivation to perform well? That would undermine the tests’ validity and have important implications for their use in education and recruitment.</p>
<p>A simple way to find out whether motivation affects intelligence test performance is to offer people a financial incentive for doing well and see if this helps them get a higher score. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12288/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">paper</a> in the <i>British Journal of Psychology</i> has done this, finding that while a financial incentive boosted people’s self-declared effort levels, it failed to lift their performance. This result is good news for the validity of intelligence testing. Or as the paper’s author, Gilles Gignac at the University of Western Australia, put it: “The position of a causal effect of test-taking motivation on intelligence test performance in adults does not, yet, appear to be clearly tenable”.</p>
<p><span id="more-33349"></span></p>
<p>The background to this research is a controversial <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/04/19/1018601108">meta-analysis</a> published in 2011 by Angela Duckworth (of Grit fame) and her colleagues which suggested that motivation distorts IQ test performance, thereby challenging the validity of IQ tests as a pure measure of ability. However, only 2 of the 46 samples included in that meta-analysis featured adults, and the findings from those adult samples were inconclusive.</p>
<p>To plug this gap, Gignac recruited 99 undergrads and asked them to complete various intelligence tests, including of basic “processing speed”, working memory, fluid intelligence (measured using Raven’s progressive matrices) and crystallised intelligence (based on a vocab test).</p>
<p>Gignac split the tests in half so that the participants completed two very similar testing sessions in succession: one without any financial incentive and one with the chance to win $75 if they were among the top 10 per cent of performers (some participants did the session with this incentive first, others did it second). After each session, the participants completed a survey about how much effort they had put in and how important they thought the tests were.</p>
<p>The financial incentive didn’t affect the participants’ perception of the importance of the tests. However it affected their effort levels, at least according to their self-reports. Those participants who had the financial incentive session in their first session subsequently reported less effort in their second session. In contrast, those who had the financial incentive in the second session managed to sustain their effort levels. “It may be claimed with some confidence that financial incentives can, on average, increase the amount of effort testees apply to complete cognitive tasks,” Gignac said.</p>
<p>Crucially, however, this effect on effort did not translate into any difference in performance. Participants’ actual performance on all the various tests was the same across both sessions, suggesting that the financial incentive failed to boost their results.</p>
<p>Many prior studies, in children and adults, have found that people’s self-reported effort correlates with their IQ. That is, people who are more intelligent – at least according to their higher test results – tend to say that they tried harder. Of course this doesn’t mean that greater effort is causing the superior performance. And the new results are among the first in adults to suggest strongly that it does not.</p>
<p>Although this study makes a useful contribution, it doesn’t settle the matter. Remember the financial incentive did not affect participants’ belief in the importance of the tests. Perhaps a bigger or different kind of incentive may affect test performance, especially if it manages to harness people’s intrinsic motivation by making them think it is very important to do well (for instance, imagine feeling highly motivated after being told that your test performance would be used to rate the ability of your country or your university). Another thing is that the participants in the new study all scored fairly high in terms of their effort levels, even without financial incentive. It remains possible that financial incentives may affect intelligence test performance but only among people who have very low motivation to start with.</p>
<p>For now, though, it is safe to say there is little evidence that differences in motivation undermine the validity of intelligence tests taken by adults. However, Gignac concluded, “as absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, we encourage more research to help understand precisely why test-taking motivation and intelligence test scores are correlated positively in both children and adults.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/frgJf61zACA/">Rare Disease Day Spotlight on PLOS Authors: Open Data Repositories in Practice</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/02/Rare-Diesase-Open-Data_blog-image2-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Science increasingly involves collaborative research groups, program partnerships and shared learnings to encourage transparency, reproducibility and a responsible transition to a more open way of doing science. Open Science policies and best practices are currently under discussion, definition and development across the wide spectrum of activities that make up the research cycle, from open notebooks, <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/open-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open data</a></strong> and transparent peer review to the interoperability of meta-data and digital identifiers. In particular for open research practices, adoption of emergent and recent policies (i.e. PLOS Data Policy) could be strengthened if accompanied by <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2017/05/08/making-progress-toward-open-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">examples of successful implementation</a></strong>. Examples can serve as a powerful motivator for improved understanding and behavioral change for those confronted with the uncertainties of a more open landscape for the practice and communication of science.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a question of making clear to the broad stakeholder community, at all stages and across multiple disciplines, the practical benefit of these polices moving us all toward a more Open Science. It’s not just a theoretical pursuit of Open Science for the sake of being open. The current energy behind Open Science in the European Union, as well as in the United States, stems also from a frustration over wasted resources, time and talent. Practicing Open Science well does enhance reproducibility through improved clarity of methods and reagents, and accelerated reuse of data and code by others.</p>
<h4>A Celebration of Open Data</h4>
<p>A major benefit of open data is that data can be reused, not only for validation work but also for <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006945" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pushing science forward</a></strong>. Teams of scientists with diverse expertise collaborated to explore<strong> <a href="http://collections.plos.org/up-for-a-challenge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preexisting data sets</a></strong> to advance breast cancer research, in the US National Cancer Institute’s Up For A Challenge (<strong><a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3157598/wiki/232604" rel="noopener" target="_blank">U4C</a></strong>) Contest. Finalists in the US National Institutes of Health, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Wellcome Trust <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/open-data-projects-win-wellcome-trust-nih-and-hhmi-open-science-prize/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Science Prize competition</a></strong> (which included projects by PLOS authors and their related publications) “demonstrated the huge potential for data to be reused to develop new applications and uncover new knowledge,” wrote Robert Kiley, Head of Open Research, and David Carr, Programme Manager, Wellcome Trust, in Figshare’s <strong><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/_/5481187" rel="noopener" target="_blank">State of Open Data Report 2017</a></strong>. The report provided insight into how researchers approach publishing their data. In response to surveys asking where they published their data, researchers most commonly did so as an appendix to an article (slightly over 30%) or in a data repository (slightly under 30%), with 20% having published data in a data journal (<strong><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/The_State_of_Open_Data_2017_Report_-_Infographic/5519155" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see the summary infographic</a></strong>).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://opendataday.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Data Day</a></strong> (March 3, 2018) is an opportunity to showcase the benefits of open data and open data systems, and, according to the grassroots collective’s website, “to encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society around the world.” This year, the focus is on four key areas where open data can help solve universal problems: opening research data, tracking public money flows, informing open mapping projects and providing open data for equal development. In Copenhagen, Open Data Day will include announcement of the <strong><a href="https://dk.okfn.org/2018/02/13/join-us-for-open-data-day-2018-in-copenhagen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Danish Open Data Award</a></strong> and in London activities are planned related to Open Science and <strong><a href="http://goldsmiths.tech/data" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reproducible research</a></strong>. Participants in The Philippines will benefit from a <strong><a href="http://ilead.ph/2018/02/20/open-data-day-rtd-on-open-research-in-the-philippines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roundtable discussion on open research</a></strong> as it applies locally and globally. There are no shortage of <strong><a href="http://opendataday.org/#resources" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ideas and data </a><a href="http://opendataday.org/#resources">sources</a></strong> for Open Data Day.</p>
<h4>Publisher Actions</h4>
<p>PLOS took a leadership position in open data in 2014 with our strengthened Data Policy, and <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2015/07/02/plos-recommended-data-repositories/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since 2015</a></strong> our journals maintain a list of <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recommended repositories</a> </strong>to help authors share their data. When we assess repositories for inclusion in our list we are guided by criteria that meet the <strong><a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAIR principles</a></strong> on open data. We consider this our responsibility as a publisher. The FAIR guiding principles state that beyond making data open as an important component in the data ecosystem, data also need to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. For inclusion on PLOS’ list of recommended repositories, several criteria were developed, some of which are listed below. For a more complete description of repository criteria, visit the <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EveryONE blog</a></strong> on Open Data Day!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Datasets should be available at no cost. </strong>All PLOS articles are available to readers free of charge and we believe cost should not be a barrier to access either the scientific literature or accompanying datasets. Repositories are not considered for our recommended list if they charge readers access or subscription fees.</li>
<li><strong>Repository with stated licensing policies should offer </strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>CC 0</strong></a><strong> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CC BY</a> licenses (or equivalents</strong>), for maximum reproducibility and reuse.</li>
<li>To ensure that datasets will be permanently accessible at the specified location, repositories must <strong>issue a stable identifier at publication, such as a digital object identifier (DOI) or an equally robust accession number</strong>.</li>
<li>FAIRsharing.org works with a community of journals, funders and databases in support of standards, polices and educational material to enable funders, librarians, journals, researchers and developers to thrive in the open data world. <strong>The repository chosen by PLOS authors should have an entry created in the </strong><a href="https://fairsharing.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>FAIRsharing database</strong></a><strong>, to allow it to be linked to the </strong><a href="https://fairsharing.org/recommendation/PLOS" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>PLOS entry</strong></a><strong>. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to considering the PLOS Data Policy and providing a Data Availability Statement for their individual data and datasets, selecting the appropriate data repository is an important part of a researcher’s overall experimental and data plan. To assist authors in choosing the best repository, in addition to the current list of <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recommended repositories</a></strong>, the complete list of <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/03/01/criteria-for-recommended-data-repositories/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repository criteria</a></strong> will soon be available on PLOS journal websites.</p>
<h4>Researcher Participation</h4>
<p>What is the practical importance of open data? As one specific example we can look to a coincidence of timing: February 28 is <strong><a href="https://www.rarediseaseday.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rare Disease Day</a></strong>. Rare diseases constitute a group of more than 6,000 different diseases and affect more than 300 million people worldwide. To put this number in perspective, 1 in 20 people live with a rare disease in their life, according to <strong><a href="https://www.eurordis.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EURORDIS</a></strong>, an alliance of over 700 patient organizations from nearly 70 countries in Europe. In light of Rare Disease Day’s close temporal alignment with <strong><a href="http://opendataday.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Data Day</a></strong>, we highlight a selection of articles on rare diseases published at PLOS that utilize a variety of repository options to best make their associated data available. These are examples of authors doing the right thing to advance rare disease research, collective knowledge, and future therapeutic interventions.</p>

Few, if any, dedicated repositories exist exclusively for bibliometric work, so data underlying work like this can be deposited to a discipline-independent repository—in this case <strong><a href="https://figshare.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Figshare</a></strong>. While subject-specific repositories are preferred, in cases where they are not available authors may use a cross-disciplinary repository.</li>

This work contributes to the development of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gene therapy</a></strong> that could be used in the treatment of several rare diseases affecting the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The theme for Rare Disease Day this year is a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/02/optimism-on-rare-disease-day-with-research-possibilities-are-limitless/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">carry-over from last year</a></strong>—research. If scientists working in these disease areas make their data open and available for reuse and re-examination, they can extend the impact of their efforts and may open a window to unrealized diagnoses, therapies and perhaps even cures.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of Open Science, practical and even incremental change has the power and potential to bolster momentum and encourage a spirit of collaboration that ultimately brings about large-scale cultural shift. We have seen evidence of this most recently with the preprint movement in biomedical and life sciences. Making open data the norm, <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2017/06/05/new-icmje-requirements-and-the-plos-data-policy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">whenever possible</a></strong>, and following FAIR sharing principles are additional practices that, like preprints, have the capacity to transform the work and culture of science.</p>

A chemistry journal has retracted a nanoparticle paper following heavy outcry from readers, who alleged the paper contained signs of obvious manipulation. After the paper appeared in 2017, one critic lamented it contained “obviously fabricated” images, and asked the journal to retract it. Another suggested the presence of one image merited “an instant lifetime ban.” … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/02/26/chemistry-journal-retracts-highly-criticized-paper/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Chemistry journal retracts highly criticized paper</span></a>

<p>Recent studies of mindfulness schools programmes for teenagers have produced mixed results, with some failing to find benefits, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/26/perhaps-teens-are-too-cynical-to-benefit-from-mindfulness-say-authors-of-latest-negative-school-trial/">even when extra features were added</a> to try to make them more effective. But given the demonstrated benefits of mindfulness training on stress and wellbeing in adults – and the urgent need to find ways to reduce stress and prevent depression in teenagers – it’s not surprising that researchers are pursuing work in the area.</p>
<p>Advocates of mindfulness for kids may, then, take some comfort from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12646/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">a new study</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em> that found an 8-week training programme improved emotion processing in 16-18-year-olds. In theory, this might reduce their vulnerability to depression, write the researchers, from Bangor University, UK.</p>
<p><span id="more-33326"></span></p>
<p>The study was not large: it involved just 40 sixth-form pupils (aged 16 to 18) from north Wales. Twenty-one pupils from two schools acted as controls, while 19 from two other schools formed the training group. Regular teachers from these schools delivered the “Foundations” version of the .b mindfulness curriculum, originally developed by the <a href="https://mindfulnessinschools.org">Mindfulness in Schools Project</a> for busy adults, and which consists of eight 50-minute sessions (the researchers said they chose this programme to “reflect the maturity of the age group targeted for this intervention”).</p>
<p>At the start and end of the study period, all the pupils completed a number of questionnaires, including the Perceived Stress Scale, a self-assessment of empathy, and a version of the WHO Well-Being Index. The researchers also used electroencephalography (EEG) to provide a brainwave measure of the teenagers’ sensitivity to happy, sad and neutral male and female faces.</p>
<p>After the training, the mindfulness group did not score higher for empathy or lower for stress than the controls. But they did report feeling greater well-being. And the EEG data showed that, unlike the controls, they sustained their sensitivity to the faces that had happy or sad expressions, rather than becoming habituated to them.</p>
<p>“Tentatively, we can interpret the findings as suggesting that mindfulness practice, which encourages curiosity and exposure to emotion without judgement or reactivity, can help maintain attention on socially relevant stimuli,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>According to the so-called Emotion Content Insensitivity model, depression is characterised by a lack of response to both positive and negative emotional stimuli. So, in theory, maintaining a sensitivity to happy and sad faces may reduce these pupils’ vulnerability to depression, the researchers argue.</p>
<p>It has to be said that there are a quite a lot of “maybes” in the conclusions of this study. And while there were some potentially encouraging trends in the data (in relation to empathy, for example), only a few of the positive results were statistically significant. Also, the final assessments came soon after the training finished, so there’s no way of knowing how long the slight improvements shown by the mindfulness group would have lasted.</p>
<p>Still, “we hope that future work will build on these initial findings and explore the long-term effects of mindfulness training on adolescents,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Of course, every teacher and parent would like to see effective interventions to reduce stress and the risk of depression in teenagers. But whether mindfulness is the answer is yet to be demonstrated.</p>

A new Lancet paper about antidepressants caused quite a stir this week. Headlines proclaimed that "It's official - antidepressants work", "Study proves anti-depressants are effective", and "Antidepressants work. Period."



Wew.

The truth is that while the Lancet paper is a nice piece of work, it tells us very little that we didn't already know, and it has a number of limitations. The media reaction to the paper is frankly bananas, as we'll see below.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/528121437/0/oupblogpsychology/">In memoriam: Jimmie C. Holland, MD</a></h4>

<p>Jimmie C. Holland, MD, internationally recognized as the founder of the field of Psycho-oncology, died suddenly on 24 December 2017 at the age of 89. Dr. Holland, who was affectionately known by her first name, “Jimmie,” had a profound global influence on the fields of Psycho-oncology, Psychosomatic Medicine, and Oncology.</p>
<p>Dr. Holland was the Attending Psychiatrist and Wayne E. Chapman Chair at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and Professor of Psychiatry, Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York. In 1977, she was appointed Chief of the Psychiatry Service in the Department of Neurology at MSK. The Psychiatry Service at MSK was the first such clinical, research, and training service established in any cancer center in the world. In 1996, Dr. Holland was named the inaugural Chairwoman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at MSK Cancer Center, also the first such department created in any cancer center in the world. Over 25 years ago, Dr. Holland founded and co-edited the international <em>Psycho-Oncology </em>journal.</p>

</div>
<p>Dr. Holland edited the first major textbooks of Psycho-oncology, and in 1989 edited the <em>Handbook of Psychooncology: Psychological care of the patient with cancer</em>. This landmark textbook was notable for several reasons; it established a “new” field, a subspecialty of both Psychosomatics and oncology. I remember being a young faculty member in Dr. Holland’s service and the very real sense that we were creating something that had not existed before. I remember her asking me to write multiple chapters, including several in which I had very little expertise. I expressed my concern, “I’m not an expert on the psychiatric complications of head and neck cancer!” She calmly reassured me, “Well, Bill, no one is. So when you finish researching and writing the chapter I suppose then you’ll be the world’s expert!”</p>
<p>Psycho-oncology was born and named with the publication of this textbook and with Dr. Holland’s founding of the International Psycho-oncology Society (IPOS) in 1984, then the American Psychosocial Oncology Society in 1986. Subsequently, Dr. Holland edited, with a group of co-editors, what became known as the “Bible” of Psycho-oncology; <em>Psycho-oncology</em> was published in 1998, and represented the most comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and international encyclopedia of a field entering its adolescence. 2010 saw the publication of the second edition followed by the third edition in 2015. Every card-carrying “psycho-oncologist” (in 57 countries with national psycho-oncology societies) had to have the latest edition in their library to demonstrate their link to Jimmie Holland. Dr. Holland also co-wrote two well received books for the public: <em>The Human Side of Cancer</em> and <em>Lighter as We Go: Virtues, Character Strengths, and Aging</em>, the latter reflecting her interests in Geriatric Oncology as she approached her 90th birthday.</p>
<p>Dr. Holland was born in the small farming community of Nevada, Texas in 1928. She credits the local family physician in that community for her interest in medicine and caring for those who were suffering. She was one of only three women in her class at Baylor College of Medicine. In 1956, Dr. Holland married the renowned oncology pioneer James Holland, MD, who was then Chief of Medical Oncology at Roswell Park in Buffalo, NY. She would chide James, complaining that cancer patients were asked every conceivable question about their physical functioning but never, “How do you feel emotionally?” Dr. Holland pioneered the inclusion of psychological and emotional well-being patient-reported outcomes in quality of life measures and as a component of clinical outcomes in clinical trials.</p>

</div>
<p>Dr. Holland has received too many awards to list, however some notable ones include: The Medal of Honor for Clinical Research from the American Cancer Society, The Marie Curie Award from the Government of France, and the Margaret L. Kripke Legend Award for contributions to the advancement of women in cancer medicine and cancer science from the MD Anderson Cancer Center. She served as President of the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine (APM) in 1996 and was the recipient of the APM’s Hackett Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. She was also the inaugural recipient of the Arthur Sutherland Award for Lifetime Achievement from IPOS.</p>
<p>Over a 40-year career at MSK Cancer Center, Dr. Holland created and nurtured the field of Psycho-oncology, established its clinical practice, advanced its clinical research agenda, and through her pioneering efforts, launched the careers of the leaders of a national and worldwide field who mourn her passing and continue to work in what has become a shared mission to emphasize the <em>care</em> in cancer care.</p>
<p>After stepping down as Chairman of the MSK Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences in 2003, she kept working full time, seeing patients, conducting research, training and supervising fellows, and traveling the world lecturing and teaching. She also helped bring Psycho-oncology to Africa through her work with the African Organization for Cancer Research &amp; Training in Cancer (AORTIC).</p>
<p>Born in a humble farming community with a one room school house, Dr. Holland created a life that led her to New York and the capitals of the world, honored by so many organizations and societies. She was teaching and seeing patients up until two days before her death. I think we’ll all remember her for various reasons. I certainly have many memories from a 34 year career working beside her. But on that list was her generosity and loving attitude towards her family, her patients, her colleagues, trainees, and everyone who crossed her path. Those who worked alongside her in medicine have made her mission our mission. We will continue this mission’s work, always remembering and honoring Dr. Jimmie Holland. Her death is a profound loss for all of Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine, Psycho-oncology, and Oncology. We’ve lost a pioneer, a remarkable woman, a once-in-a-generation influencer.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/publications/statistics/physical-inactivity-report-2017">statistics</a> published by the British Heart Foundation, we spend 76 days per year, on average, sitting. The World Health Organisation describes physical inactivity as a “<a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_inactivity/en/">global public health problem</a>” that contributes to millions of deaths each year.</p>
<p>You might not be surprised to hear about the harmful health consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, but perhaps less obvious is that physical inactivity is also associated with unwelcome changes in personality over time. Previous research has documented these effects over periods of four and ten years. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656618300175">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em> has extended this, finding that greater physical inactivity at baseline is associated with deterioration in personality two decades later, even after accounting for any differences in initial personality.</p>
<p>As the researchers, led by Yannick Stephan at Université de Montpellier, point out, there is an upside: the findings suggest that even a moderate increase in your activity levels today could have positive implications for your personality decades from now.</p>
<p><span id="more-33331"></span></p>
<p>The researchers combined data from three long-running survey studies. Two involved over 6000 participants in Wisconsin, first recruited between 1992 and 1994, aged 53 on average, when they completed a personality questionnaire and answered questions about their physical activity levels. These same participants then repeated the personality questionnaire in 2011. The other study was US-wide and involved over 2500 participants who first took part between 1995 to 1996, aged 46, on average, when they answered questions about their personality and physical activity. The same participants then provided follow-up personality data in 2013-2014. All the studies also recorded extensive information about the participants’ health and any illnesses or psychological problems.</p>
<p>The main take-away is that greater physical inactivity at baseline was associated with sharper declines in conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and openness, as measured two decades later, even after factoring out baseline personality and any differences in health. The pattern also wasn’t moderated by race, age, education or sex.</p>
<p>For a sense of perspective about the size of these links: the associations between physical inactivity and personality change were mostly either as great as, or even greater than, the associations between demographic factors and personality change, and between disease burden and personality change (in a multiple regression on data combined from the three studies, and controlling for other factors like health, the β value for the inactivity and personality correlations was between -.03 and -.06).</p>
<p>These patterns generally held across different intensities of physical activity (the researchers were able to look separately at light physical activity, such as gardening; moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking; and vigorous activity, such as running or lifting weights). However, for extraversion and agreeableness, there was a suggestion that a lack of moderate physical activity might be especially relevant in terms of later declines in these traits.</p>
<p>Although we may not usually think of physical activity as contributing to our personalities, in fact <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180221-the-hidden-side-to-your-personality">there is a close association between personality and our basic physiology</a>, including our responsiveness to stress. Another part of the reason that lower physical activity may have such long-term links with personality may be due to knock-on consequences of inactivity for our physical capabilities, which will impact the kind of lives we are able to lead. Being less active may also contribute to us becoming less self-disciplined, less curious and adventurous. We will have fewer opportunities for socialising and also miss the mood-enhancing effects of exercise, a detriment that may accumulate over time and potentially contribute to our lower agreeability.</p>
<p>Somewhat unexpected, but consistent with previous research, was the relative lack of an association between inactivity and later higher trait neuroticism (or emotional instability). However there was one exception: lower vigorous physical activity at baseline was associated with higher neuroticism two decades later.</p>
<p>This paper includes a large number of participants and covers an impressive time span. However, it’s far from perfect. It mostly pertains to changes between mid-life and older age. There is also no data on what happened earlier in the participants’ lives – perhaps the participants’ personalities in their youth influenced both their later activity levels and the later trajectories of their trait changes. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/18/hate-sport-maybe-its-because-you-have-the-genes-that-make-exercise-feel-awful/">Genetic differences</a> between the participants could be another major confound, potentially influencing personality trajectories and activity levels. It’s worth noting too that we don’t know how the participants’ activity levels changed over the course of the studies.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the findings reinforce the increasingly well-established idea that personality and health are closely interwoven, and that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/07/longest-ever-personality-study-finds-no-correlation-between-measures-taken-at-age-14-and-age-77/">personality is relatively malleable across the life-span</a>.</p>
<p>We already know that being more active is good for our health, this new paper brings home that it’s probably good for our personalities too. Something to ponder when you next decide whether to walk or drive to the shops. “It is likely that the benefits of even a small increase in physical activity may accumulate over time, resulting in significant [positive] personality change,” the researchers said.</p>

<p>Maternity care policy in England has opened the doors for women to choose their birth setting. With this change in policy, women now have the options to give birth in a hospital obstetrics unit, a freestanding midwifery unit, with a midwife affiliated with an obstetric unit, or plan a home birth. Despite the options provided, in recent years it has been observed that only 13% of women take advantage of non-obstetric unit settings. Previous studies have suggested that women chose one birth option over another due to the perceived level of safety in hospitals, a lack of information related to non-obstetric birth units, or sociodemographic factors.</p>
<p>In this systematic review, 20 research articles were assessed using the best fit framework, delving into what influences women’s decisions based on their perspective. This study found women were influenced by the level of information they received regarding each birth setting, the opinions of healthcare providers, family and friends, the characteristics of the services provided, perceived level of associated risk, and experiences with previous births.</p>
<p>This study found that each birth setting had its positive attributes and factors that concerned women. Women often relied on hospitals due to access to facilities in the event something went wrong as well as access to pain relief. Conversely, women often felt that hospitals were not as personal as other birthing options. Women who decided to deliver at home or use a midwifery affiliated unit felt that it was a more relaxed setting and that they had a greater sense of control and a relationship with the person caring for them.  Alternatively, women in this setting felt they had to do extra research to gain the appropriate information outside of what was provided to them and worried about what would happen in the event they needed to transfer to a hospital.</p>
<p>This study concluded that women with a low-risk pregnancy found giving birth in a hospital more straightforward than non-hospitals births. Overall, these opinions were shaped by each woman’s personal experience and pre-existing opinion, despite the access to multiple forms of care.</p>

<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9940 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/surgery-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Safe surgery and anesthesia are critical to comprehensive emergency obstetric care.  International standards of safe practice have been formulated to address the needs of low- and middle-income countries to improve the quality and safety of surgical procedures using anesthesia.  However, small studies across East Africa have shown that these standards are not being met by hospitals offering obstetric anesthesia.</p>
<p>Epiu <em>et al.</em> conducted a large, cross-sectional survey of 64 hospitals in Uganda, both public and private, to assess adherence to guidelines for safe anesthesia. They found that only 5% met all the requirements set out by the international guidelines while 8% had no trained providers for anesthesia at all. Many hospitals lacked some of the equipment necessary for monitoring of anesthesia and the authors noted that much of the equipment present was obsolete.</p>
<p>These results highlight the need to strengthen obstetric and general anesthesia services in Uganda by increasing training and access to equipment. These improvements would play an important role in meeting United Nations goals for reducing the maternal mortality ratio by providing safe cesarean section services when needed.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9941 alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/meditation-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Past research suggests th<span style="line-height: 1.5;">at fear of childbirth is highest among first-time mothers. This fear not only predicts the use of pain medication, but it is linked to perinatal and postpartum depression, puts women at a higher risk for poor postpartum adjustment, and can act as a predictor of poor outcomes for labor and birth. In order to provide first time mothers with a resource to combat fear of childbirth, Duncan </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">et al.</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> conducted a randomized controlled trial implementing a mindfulness-based childbirth workshop. In the trial, the intervention group utilized the workshop while the control group underwent standard preparations for childbirth.</span></p>
<p>The workshop, titled “Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth,” was an 18-hour program, utilized in the 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester for both the mothers and their partners. The MIL workshop taught the participants yoga, walking meditation, partner touch, mindful breathing, and instruction grounded in mindfulness as strategies to cope with labor-related stress. The mindfulness strategies used in the study are based on a nine-week Mindfulness-based Childbirth and Parenting program which in turn is based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. The overall goal of the workshop was to teach women the traditional topics needed for childbirth preparation, how to become more aware of their bodies, separate the cognitive and emotional aspects of pain and replace it with the goal to decrease fear, and show participants ways to cope and support each other throughout the process.</p>
<p>The results of this trial found that there was a reduced rate of opioid analgesia in the MIL group as compared to controls, but no reduction in the overall rate of epidural or perceived pain retrospectively. The results also suggested that participants in the MIL group had marginally fewer perinatal and postpartum depression symptoms as compared to the controls. Most notably, participants in the MIL group were significantly more likely to feel confident in their behaviors throughout labor. In conclusion, a mindfulness based approach to childbirth preparation is promising avenue for continued research in reducing fear of childbirth.</p>

<p>Birth trauma, an extreme negative experience during childbirth that can result from a number of factors, can lead to ongoing poor mental health, affecting the woman herself, her relationship to her family, and her ability to bond with her child. A number of studies have identified a perceived lack of control of decision-making as a major factor in the experience of birth trauma.  Additionally, a lack of emotional support of women during birth has also been identified as a risk factor for birth trauma.</p>
<p>In this qualitative study by Reed, Sharman, and Inglis, from our collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/SVWomen">The Role of Structural and Interpersonal Violence in the Lives of Women</a>,’ nearly 750 women out of over 900 who completed an online survey answered an open-ended question about birth trauma. While one third of them described birth trauma related to medical concerns or adverse events, the other two thirds described trauma relating to care provider actions and how they were treated during labor and birth. Accounts of trauma included care providers disregarding or not seeking women’s preferences regarding interventions, women not being believed regarding onset of labor or timing of pushing, outright lies and threats to coerce women into consenting to interventions, and physical violations such as internal examinations on women who had explicitly not consented.</p>
<p>These experiences were common across cultural contexts and birth settings.  This highlights the global nature of the problem and the need for maternity services to comply with recommendations from the World Health Organization and others regarding women-centered maternity services and potentially unnecessary medical interventions. In addition, it contributes to ongoing debate about the accuracy and efficacy of standards and assessments used during labor and birth.</p>

<p>From the beginning of recorded time, humanity has been fascinated by the figure of the wise person, wending their path through the tribulations of life, and informing those willing to learn. What sets them apart? Maybe that’s the wrong question. In a new <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-02884-003">review</a> in <i>European Psychologist</i>, Igor Grossman of the University of Waterloo argues that understanding wisdom involves taking the wise off their pedestal, and seeing wisdom as a set of processes that we can all tap into, with the right attitude, and in the right context.</p>
<p><span id="more-33322"></span></p>
<p>Wisdom might seem to be a difficult concept for psychologists to study, but Grossman says there is some agreement now that it comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/23/something-we-could-use-a-little-more-of-studies-link-intellectual-humility-with-openness-to-other-viewpoints/">Intellectual humility</a></li>
<li>Appreciating broader perspectives</li>
<li>Knowing that social relations can change</li>
<li>A willingness to compromise or integrate different opinions together</li>
</ul>
<p>Seen this way, wisdom is distinct from things like creativity and intelligence, while being associated with related phenomena like emotion regulation, cooperative intentions, and political even-handedness (e.g. not condemning an opponent’s change of view as flip-flopping).</p>
<p>Psychologists who research wisdom tend to use questionnaires administered at one point in time to measure it, treating it as a static property. But Grossman argues that this doesn’t fit with the variability with which wisdom manifests. Experiments in the lab that asked participants to work through hypothetical situations, have found that people’s wisdom on one topic (say, the “Meaning of Life”) only gave a limited indication of their wisdom in another, like adjudicating a family issue. And <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/31/wisdom-is-more-of-a-state-than-a-trait/">diary studies</a> where participants reflect on the most difficult issue they faced each day show that wise thinking can fluctuate wildly.</p>
<p>In Grossman’s view, this suggests that although wisdom has some stability, the context is king. And changing the context of thinking can encourage more wise outcomes. For instance, researchers observe wiser thinking when participants are asked to consider a problem as if it occurred a year ago, rather than now, or if it’s occurring to a third party, rather than themselves. These <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/03/01/how-thinking-for-others-can-boost-your-creativity/">distancing techniques</a> help us take a less egocentric approach, trapped in the urgent “here, now, me” which pushes us to look for certainty and closure, often prematurely.</p>
<p>In addition, explaining an issue you care deeply about is done in a more wise, balanced manner when you imagine that the recipient is a 12-year old, casting you as a teacher. It seems that again, seeing yourself as a teacher of someone in need of insight (rather than facing a peer in need of convincing) leads us to be less egocentric and more focused on the other, allowing us to disinvest in static certainties.</p>
<p>If different contexts can encourage wisdom, does this mean that wisdom can be taught? There’s good reason to be skeptical: in <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1973-31215-001">a classic study</a>, John Darley and Daniel Batson found that seminary students who had been preparing a talk about the Good Samaritan were no more likely to stop and help someone in need, suggesting that learning about a wise approach to living doesn’t mean that we will internalise it. And we know that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/22/expert-philosophers-are-just-as-irrational-as-the-rest-of-us/">moral philosophers are no more moral</a> than the rest of us, suggesting that even deep training doesn’t add up to real world practical wisdom.</p>
<p>But Grossman is optimistic, citing the fact that even undergraduate study – including in psychology – can lead to better reasoning about statistics, methodology, and practical aspects of logic. While these don’t map directly onto wisdom, they share something in their recognition of uncertainty and error in the ways we know the world.</p>
<p>Proponents of teaching wisdom suggest that this teaching could be framed around exemplars – wise figures from the past. Grossman is in favour of this, but suggests that the road to wisdom comes not from treating these figures as peerless exemplars, but as successes within a social context, and by comparing and contrasting where their wisdom apparently reached its limits and why. This is captured by the Solomon Paradox, named after the great Jewish king who also boasted of his riches and ill-prepared his son to succeed him. Grossman argues that exploring these foibles and failings – and whether, in their historical context, they were as great a failing as we now assume – leads to intellectual humility and a sense of a bigger, more complicated picture.</p>
<p>Putting the social context into wisdom isn’t an entirely new idea. Taoism teaches us to go beyond an individual point of view, and the Socratic method involves gaining wisdom through discussion, rather than solitary rumination. So consider this new paper a reminder of what these traditions have said: that wisdom is a way, a path along which our thinking becomes proportionate, balanced and expansive, and that it’s a journey enriched by company.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/microbiome-influence-brain-health-part-2/">How does the microbiome influence our health? (Part 2)</a></h4>

<p><em><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-5296 size-full" height="450" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bacteria-108898_1280-e1519278029540.jpg" width="675" /></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>This is the second post in a series exploring the neurobiology of the gut-brain connection published in partnership with neuroscientist <a href="http://amyreichelt.com/">Dr Amy Reichelt</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Our intestines are home to an ecosystem of trillions of microbes including bacteria, viruses, phages, fungi, protists, and nematodes. Dominant are bacteria from the families <em>Firmicutes</em> and<em> Bacteriodetes.</em> As I talked about in <a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/neuroscience-gut-brain-connection-part-1/">my last blog</a>, the collective community of these microbes in the intestines is the gut ‘microbiome’.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll consider the gut microbiome from the perspective of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cristina_Torres-Fuentes/publication/319296336_The_microbiota-gut-brain_axis_in_obesity/links/59a6ffc0aca272895c169c9a/The-microbiota-gut-brain-axis-in-obesity.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">obesity research</a>. Changes in the gut microbiome are associated with several disease states including obesity. Obesity-associated microbes affect insulin resistance, inflammation, fat deposition, metabolism, and appetite. And the gut microbiome is becoming a target for new anti-obesity therapies.</p>
<h2>How does the microbiome influence our health?</h2>
<p>The gut microbiome responds to its surrounding environment including to the foods we eat. Healthy versus unhealthy diets have a profound effect on the microbiome including which species dominate.</p>
<p>For example, eating an unhealthy diet full of sugar and saturated fat alters the balance between ‘good’ <em>Bactereoides</em> and ‘bad’ <em>Firmicutes</em> bacterial species. <em>Firmicutes</em> are needed to digest fats, and eating a high-fat diet encourages their population to increase, leading in turn to weight gain. <em>Bactereoides</em> digest soluble fibre, so people who consume fibre-rich diets have more <em>Bactereoides</em> than <em>Firmicutes</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20508158">Research</a> in germ-free mice, which lack gut microbes, found altering the balance between <em>Bactereoides</em> and <em>Firmicutes</em> dictated how obese or lean mice became. And a propensity for obesity or leanness could be transmitted from mouse to mouse via gut microbes alone.</p>
<p>The brain regulates appetite, feeding behaviours, and energy balance, and although the gut microbiome <em>contributes</em> to obesity and metabolic syndromes such as diabetes, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship are uncertain. To date, the link between the microbiome and obesity <a href="http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/4/e01018-16">in humans is “weak”.</a></p>
<h2>How might gut bugs speak to the brain?</h2>
<p>The gut provides an environment for bacteria to ferment digested food into all kinds of chemicals and molecules that inform the brain of our current nutritional state. As mentioned in the previous blog, the microbiome signals to the brain via pathways such as vagus nerve, immune and hormone systems, and also via the production of bioactive microbial metabolites released into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites produced in the gut by microbial fermentation of undigested dietary fibre and complex carbohydrates. SFCAs can cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate brain activity to regulate appetite and food intake. In the brain, SCFAs are neuroprotective.</p>
<p>One such SCFA is butyric acid or butyrate.  Butyrate is an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27346602" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-inflammatory agent in the brain and the gut</a> and reduces levels of harmful toxins that can damage neurons. Butyrate also fortifies the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/07/23/3808471.htm">blood–brain barrier</a> by tightening connections between cells, which prevents harmful toxins entering the brain causing neuron-damaging inflammation. A leaky blood-brain barrier is often seen in obesity and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Butyrate also boosts the production of molecules that are important for neuroplasticity including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Boosted levels of BDNF leads to enhanced <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5277010/#B130">memory performance</a> in lab rats. Scientists have found that eating a junk food diets reduces SCFA levels so it is important to eat a healthy diet to maintain optimal brain function.</p>
<h2>How can we change our gut microbiome?</h2>
<p>I think of the microbiome like the different soils that plants grow in — certain plants grow well in nutrient-rich compost, but they won’t survive in dry, sandy soil. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16504">Western diets</a>, especially those with low levels of fibre, have possibly reduced the diversity of microbiota over generations. By contrast, traditional diets high in fibre and low in sugar and fat increase microbiome diversity.</p>
<p>So what can we do to ensure our microbiome supports our health?</p>
<p>Researchers suggest the diversity and function of microbiome are established by your genetic background and external factors, including way you were delivered at birth and how you exercise. It’s suggested the key determinant affecting the composition and activity of the gut microbiome is your diet —  explaining about 57% of variations in total gut microbiota.</p>
<p>We can influence the populations of gut microbes by making our gut environment hospitable to them by eating <em>probiotic</em> and <em>prebiotic </em>foods<em>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Probiotics</strong></em> are foods or dietary supplements containing specific gut-beneficial microbes (such as <em>Lactobacillus</em> or <em>Bifidobacterium</em>) to stimulate the growth of these microorganisms in the gut. Probiotic-rich foods include live yoghurt, kombucha, kimchi, and fermented vegetables such as sauerkraut.</p>
<p><strong><em>Prebiotics</em></strong> are foods stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria. I think of them as the nutrient-rich fertiliser that helps plants grow. Prebiotic-rich foods include bananas, onions, wheat, flaxseeds, legumes and leafy green vegetables, e.g. spinach, kale, and broccoli. Fermented foods contain microbes that aid gut health and are also prebiotic. The live microbes have already worked on digesting these foods, unlocking extra nutrients.</p>
<h2>Harnessing the gut microbiome to boost the brain</h2>
<p>A healthy gut microbiota is crucial for proper metabolic function and homoeostasis. It’s a win-win for us and our microbes — in exchange for living and proliferating in the gut, they keep us healthy.</p>
<p>Changing our gut microbiome using probiotics and prebiotics has exciting potential to improve brain function. In my next blog, I’ll talk about a whole new field called ‘psychobiotics’ that could provide a novel therapy for people suffering from mood disorders.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9961" style="width: 284px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9961" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/e3-274x300.jpg" width="274" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© Kellergassen Niederösterreich 2016 / Wikimedia Commons / , via Wikimedia Commons</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Heigl <em>et al</em>. studied the spatial patterns of road-killed reptiles and amphibians on tertiary roads using a citizen science approach. Open-access remote sensing data was obtained through the use of a citizen science app.</p>
<p>The authors monitored the reptile and amphibian road-kills along 97.5km of tertiary roads, stretching across interurban, municipal and agricultural roads as well as cycling paths. The data was collected in eastern Austria across two seasons.</p>
<p>72 reptile and 180 amphibian road-kills comprising eight species were recorded, mainly along agricultural roads. It was found that the highest concentrations of road-kills were located next to vineyards, suburban areas and arable land. Green toads, common toads and grass snakes were the most often found road-killed species.</p>
<p>It was found that a citizen science approach was more cost-efficient than monitoring by professional researchers in instances where more than 400km of road are studied. This information may help authorities aiming to reduce road-kills and other researchers to implement large-scale monitoring of road-kill hotspots in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<a href="https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0135-y"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9962" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/e4-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></a>
<p>Mareike Hirschfeld and Mark-Oliver Rödel investigated which traits make a species more tolerant to disturbances, thereby enabling their success and survival in altered tropical forests as well as pristine ones.</p>
<p>Through analyzing published data in 243 frog species, they identified which traits enabled these amphibians to cope most effectively to modifications of their natural environment.</p>
<p>Those that coped with modifications to their natural habitat best were; indirect developing species with a wide elevational distribution and large range size, which were independent of streams and inhabited leaf litter.</p>
<p>This study helps to predict future frog communities in altered tropical forests by identifying the traits which are likely to persist in these new environments. These traits found in frogs are also linked with traits found in species with a low extinction risk.</p>

<p>The researchers found that increasing crayfish density decreased vegetation and animal prey density whilst also increasing the rate of growth of individual crayfish.</p>
<p>When the vegetation was replaced with an increased amount of artificial vegetation, the crayfish growth rate decreased and the survival of animal prey increased.</p>
<p>The experiments determine that the aquatic vegetation strengthens the bottom-up control of crayfish, but this effect is relaxed when the density of crayfish is increased.</p>
<p>This study contributes towards ecosystem restoration knowledge, as the introduction of submerged plants which are tolerant to crayfish destruction may assist in the rebuilding of other aquatic plants and therefore invertebrate populations at small scales.</p>

<strong>Can psychology help us get a better night’s sleep?</strong> Our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com">Ginny Smith</a> hears how worry about sleep is sometimes more of a problem than lack of sleep itself. She gives us some evidence-backed sleep tips and finds out about “sleep engineering” – deliberately manipulating the sleep process to aid memory and enhance its health benefits.</p>
<p>Our guests are <a href="http://lichstein.people.ua.edu">Professor Kenneth Lichstein</a> at the University of Alabama and <a href="http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/lewisp8.php">Professor Penny Lewis</a> at the University of Cardiff.</p>

<p>After a traumatic event, some people develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – generally within about a month – while others don’t. Identifying those most at risk could allow for targeted interventions, aimed at stopping the disorder developing. So how do you spot these people?</p>
<p>One way of exploring this question involves viewing PTSD as a dynamic process in which symptoms interact over time to cause the disorder, and some symptoms likely play a bigger causal role than others. So if you can identify the most problematic symptoms, and the people displaying them, at an early stage, then you can work out not only who to target but which symptoms to focus on.</p>
<p>In a new paper due for publication in <i>Psychological Medicine</i> and released as a <a href="https://osf.io/hv5ts/">pre-print</a> at the Open Science Framework, a team of researchers from Israel and Amsterdam conducted just such an analysis on data collected from Israeli civilians during the 50-day Israeli-Gaza war of 2014. “It is important to note that collecting [this kind of] data regarding traumatic stress symptoms during a conflict situation is unparalleled in the literature,” the researchers write.</p>
<p><span id="more-33293"></span></p>
<p>Talya Greene at the University of Haifa led the study of 96 people who were living in communities that were exposed to rocket fire. The participants were recruited via adverts and entered the study between eight and 24 days into the conflict. Twice a day, for 30 days, they received a personalised email link to an online version of a 20-item diagnostic checklist for PTSD.</p>
<p>This checklist asks people to self-report on four categories of symptoms: intrusions (such as nightmares and flashbacks); avoidance (of thoughts about and reminders of the  traumatic event); negative alterations in mood and thoughts (such as amnesia, blame of self and others, and reduced emotion); and alterations in arousal and reactivity (which measures, among other things, irritability and anger, sleep problems, hyper-vigilance, difficulties in concentrating, and the startle response – an involuntary reaction to a flash of light, a loud noise, or a sudden, potentially threatening movement).</p>
<p>Every morning, and every evening, the participants recorded any symptoms that they had experienced since completing the previous checklist.</p>
<p>The researchers found that showing the startle response was clearly the most important predictor of future PTSD symptoms. Reduced emotion, blame, negative emotions and an avoidance of thoughts relating to the conflict were also, in order of decreasing importance, predictive of future symptoms. Participants who showed any of these five symptoms earlier in the study (but the startle response, especially) were more likely to show even more PTSD-related symptoms later on – and those who had more of these predictive symptoms early on developed even more of the other symptoms of PTSD over time.</p>
<p>The researchers believe this means these are the specific symptoms that could indicate PTSD vulnerability and that targeting them early on could have a preventative benefit.</p>
<p>There were some limitations to the study. One is that it began during the conflict period, and in fact for many participants the conflict was still unfolding by the time they completed their final checklist. PTSD usually develops in the month after a trauma, but in some cases, it takes much longer to appear. These findings may not apply, then, after a trauma. Also, as the researchers themselves point out, they didn’t take some potentially relevant variables – such as gender, trauma history and severity of exposure to the conflict – into account in their analysis. And it would have been interesting to know which – if any – of the participants would have met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (a process that requires more than completion of a symptom checklist.)</p>
<p>Still, as the researchers conclude: “More studies in this vein can elucidate the complex processes by which PTSD symptoms crystallise into disorder and indicate possible causal mechanisms that drive the development of PTSD. This in turn could have clinical implications for identifying the relevant importance of symptoms as targets for interventions.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/steak-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The global food system, from fertilizer manufacture to food storage and packaging, is responsible for up to a staggering one-third of all human-caused GHG emissions. Although there is a need to make food systems more efficient and sustainable, this in itself is not adequate to bring GHG emissions down to acceptable levels; changes also need to be made to our diets.</p>
<p>But what changes are required? Elisabeth Temme and colleagues at The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) set out to answer this question by looking at food consumption in the Netherlands, where the intake of fruits and vegetables is very low and where the intake of saturated fatty acids and sodium is very high.</p>
<p>Consumption data was obtained from the most recent food consumption survey in the Netherlands, the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey (DNFCS) 2007-2010. All consumptions were labelled as one of seven food consumption occasions, distinguishing between the three main meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and all moments in between meals (before breakfast, in between breakfast and lunch, in between lunch and dinner, after dinner). Socio-demographic and lifestyle data such as physical activity and educational level was also obtained.</p>
<p>In order to estimate GHG emissions associated with different foods, life cycle assessments were performed; these look at the entire life cycle of a product from primary production, processing, use of packaging and transport to storage as well as the preparation of the food. The GHG emissions associated with the preparation of foods in the consumer phase was based on the average cooking time for each product . Food waste was also included by using food group specific percentages for avoidable and unavoidable food losses throughout the food chain, including the consumer phase.</p>
<p>The researchers found that, in the Dutch diet, the GHG emission varies per consumption occasion. In the highest tertile of dietary GHG emission, dinner was associated with the highest GHG emissions, and consumptions in between meals were associated with the second-to-highest emissions. Meat consumption contributed most to the GHG emission of dinner, while beverages contributed most to the GHG emission of consumptions in between meals. Dairy (including cheese) was an important contributor to total daily dietary GHG emission throughout the day.</p>

<p>The authors also developed various scenarios to lower GHG emissions of people in the highest tertile of dietary GHG emission: 1) reduce red and processed meat consumed during dinner by 50% and 75%, 2) replace 50% and 100% of alcoholic and soft drinks (including fruit and vegetable juice and mineral water) by tap water, 3) replace cheese consumed in between meals by plant-based alternatives and 4) two combinations of these scenarios. Effects on GHG emission as well as nutrient content of the diet were assessed.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9828" style="width: 220px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9828 size-full" height="240" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/water.jpg" width="210" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Flickr: Government of Prince Edward Island</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The most effective single dietary change was to reduce the consumption of meat, with a 75% reduction in red and/or processed meat during dinner resulting in a 24% reduction in GHG emissions for men and a 22% reduction for women. Furthermore, replacing the consumption of all alcoholic drinks and soft drinks (including mineral water and fruit and vegetable juices) with tap water was also successful in reducing dietary GHG emissions.</p>
<p>The dietary changes are also beneficial for health as they are more in line with dietary guidelines and reduce saturated fatty acids and sugar intake. For those who may not meet energy or iron requirements with these changes in diet, low GHG emission and nutritious replacement foods might be needed.</p>
<p>Although the scenarios in this study were focused on people in the highest tertile of GHG emissions, it is expected that the dietary changes proposed here will also lead to reductions in GHG emissions for people in the lowest or intermediate tertiles. However, further research is required to determine whether this is indeed the case.</p>
