                <p>In a new study from <em>PLOS ONE</em>, researchers explore relationships between domestic cats&rsquo; hormone levels, gut microbiomes, and social behaviors &ndash; shedding light on how these solitary animals can cohabitate together in high densities.

<p><strong>Background and Study Design</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="402" height="301" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/cats-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20566" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/cats-1.png 402w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/cats-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px"><figcaption> <em>Cats that live in the same space form friendly relationships, but they might not be a tight group</em>.

<p>Most feline species display solitary and territorial behavior, but domestic cats often live in high densities, raising the question of what strategies cats use to establish cohabitating groups. Social behaviors of cats can be influenced by hormones and the mix of different microbe species living in their guts&mdash;known as the gut microbiome. Studying these factors could help illuminate the group dynamics of cohabitating cats.</p>



<p>With this in mind, Koyasu and colleagues conducted a two-week-long study of three different groups of five cats living together in a shelter. They used video cameras to observe the cats&rsquo; behavior, measured hormone levels in their urine, and collected feces to evaluate the mix of microbial species in the cats&rsquo; microbiomes.</p>



<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="230" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/unnamed-1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20559" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/unnamed-1-1.png 400w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/unnamed-1-1-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption> A graphic summary of the results from the study. Low testosterone and cortisol concentrations in cats enabled them to share the space and live together, but the higher the oxytocin, the less affiliative behavior with others and the more lonely they are. The function of oxytocin was different from that of affinity for a tight. <em>Photo Credit:</em> <a href="https://plos.io/3BbYzHQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koyasu et al</a>., CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Statistical analysis of the data revealed that cats with high levels of the hormones cortisol and testosterone had less contact with other cats, and those with high testosterone were more likely to try to escape. Meanwhile, cats with low cortisol and testosterone were more tolerant in their interactions with other cats. The researchers also found greater similarity of gut microbiomes between cats who had more frequent contact with each other, and they found links between the gut microbiome, social behavior, and cortisol levels.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, contrary to the researchers&rsquo; expectations from research on animals that typically live in groups, cats with high levels of the hormone oxytocin did not display bonding behaviors described as &ldquo;socially affiliative.&rdquo; This suggests that oxytocin might function differently for typically solitary animals living in groups than for animals that typically live in groups.</p>



<p><strong>Future Research&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The researchers outline possible directions for future research to further deepen understanding of cohabitating cat dynamics, such as a follow-up study that observes cats for several months, rather than just two weeks, and investigations to tease out causal relationships between hormones and social behaviors.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;Low testosterone and cortisol concentrations in cats enabled them to share the space and live together, but the higher the oxytocin, the less affiliative behavior with others and the more lonely they are. The function of oxytocin was different from that of affinity for a group-mate. Cats may not consider other individuals living in the same space as tight relationship group-mates.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crustaceans-pollinate-seaweed-fertilization-algae">Like bees of the sea, crustaceans ‘pollinate’ seaweed</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to reproduction, one type of red algae gets by with a little help from its friends: small sea crustaceans that transport sex cells between male and female algae, like pollen-laden bees buzzing between flowers. </p>



<p>The discovery is the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo6661?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D82048896509660740613981364128583574319%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1658928677&amp;_ga=2.119814027.2055624078.1658894020-1390130024.1658181674">first known example of animal-driven “pollination” in algae</a>, researchers report in the July 29 <em>Science</em>. Both the red algae and crustaceans belong to far more ancient groups than land plants do, raising the possibility that a form of pollination first evolved in the ocean, hundreds of millions earlier than originally thought.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Pollination typically describes the transfer of male sex cells — pollen — to a female flower, usually on land. Then in 2016, researchers discovered that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12980">various marine invertebrates “pollinate” seagrass flowers</a> by feeding on and moving between the gelatinous pollen masses of seagrasses, which are descended from land plants. But nothing similar had yet been documented in algae.</p>



<p>Like other red algae, <em>Gracilaria gracilis</em> doesn’t have free-swimming male sex cells. Called spermatia, its sex cells were typically thought to be dispersed to female algae by the flow of water, much like how wind can spread pollen to fertilize certain land plants.</p>



<p>In the new study, Myriam Valero, a population geneticist at the Sorbonne University in Paris, and her colleagues were studying the genetics and mating of <em>G. gracilis</em>. After collecting <a>samples of the seaweed </a>and storing them in laboratory tanks, the team kept noticing hundreds of small, oblong crustaceans in the tanks. This discovery and the similarity of the algae’s spermatia to pollen led the team to wonder if the crustaceans help “pollinate” the algae.</p>

</div><figcaption>Crustaceans called Idotea balthica move from a male red alga to a female one. A new study finds that the isopods spread the algae’s sex cells, aiding reproduction.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the lab, the researchers placed male and female algae 15 centimeters apart in tanks with no water movement. Some tanks also included the centimeters-long <em>Idotea balthica</em>, a type of isopod crustacean, while others didn’t. When a successful fertilization occurs on the body of a female red algae, it creates a bubblelike structure called a cystocarp. By counting cystocarps, the team quantified how many spermatia were reaching and fertilizing the female algae. When isopods were present, fertilization success was about 20 times as high as in their absence.</p>



<p>The team also set up tanks with just female algae and isopods exposed to male algae earlier. Some of the female algae then bore cystocarps, offering more evidence that the crustaceans — relatives of land-living pill bugs — shuttle sex cells between algal stalks. The team further confirmed the isopods’ role when looking at the crustaceans under a high-powered microscope — like bumblebees dusted with pollen, the creatures had spermatia stuck all over their bodies.</p>



<p>The discovery hints that algae may have been among the very first organisms to reproduce using animals to spread sex cells.</p>

<p>There was already evidence that animal-driven fertilization and pollination-like services evolved before land-based flower pollination. Scorpion flies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pollination-pre-flower-power-era">may have pollinated conifers</a> tens of millions of years before flowering plants evolved roughly 130 million years ago (<em>SN: 11/5/09</em>). Mosses, which are very similar to the first land plants that evolved about 300 million years before flowering plants, can be fertilized by tiny arthropods. Red algae are possibly more than 800 million years old, and complex animal life dates back more than half a billion years. That means animal-driven fertilization could have arisen even earlier than scientists realized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Such a system could extend to the Precambrian when red algae were present,” says Conrad Labandeira, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. The pollinators wouldn’t have been isopods, he says, but very early arthropod groups.</p>



<p>Water movement may still help <em>G. gracilis</em> to spread its spermatia. But much of the algae’s fertilization occurs in rocky pools at low tide, when the water is calm, Valero says. “We think that the influence of the <em>Idotea</em> might be very important in those conditions.”</p>



<p>In return for their services, the isopods may gain shelter from the bushy algae and access to food stuck to their surface.</p>



<p>The team now wants to know if other red algae also use animal “pollinators” and if more than one animal partner is involved in algae reproduction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-patch-skin-watch-heart-beat-personalized-medicine">This stick-on ultrasound patch could let you watch your own heart beat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Picture a smartwatch that doesn’t just show your heart rate, but a real-time image of your heart as it beats in your chest. Researchers may have taken the first step down that road by creating a wearable ultrasound patch — think of a Band-Aid with sonar —&nbsp;that provides a flexible way to see deep inside the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultrasound, which maps tissues and fluids by recording how sound waves bounce off them, can help doctors examine organs for damage, diagnose cancer or even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/these-disease-fighting-bacteria-produce-echoes-detectable-ultrasound">track bacteria</a><em> </em>(<em>SN: 1/3/18</em>). But most ultrasound machines aren’t portable, and the wearable ones either struggle to spot details or can be used for only short periods.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2542">new patch</a> can work for up to 48 hours straight — even while the user is doing something active, like exercising. And the miniature device sees just as well as a more unwieldy hospital machine, researchers report in the July 29 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is just the beginning,” says Xuanhe Zhao, a mechanical engineer at MIT. His team plans to make the patch wireless and able to interface with a user’s phone, which could then show the ultrasound signals as 3-D images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The medical possibilities range wide. Stick a patch over a person’s heart, and the frequent images it takes could help predict heart attacks and blood clots potentially months before disaster hits, explains Aparna Singh, a biomedical engineer at Columbia University. Placed on a COVID-19 patient, the patch — which is only about the size of a quarter — could be an easy way to catch lung problems as they develop.</p>



<p>“This also has a huge potential to be available for developing countries,” where limited access to hospitals can make monitoring patients difficult, Singh says. The patch costs about $100 to make. One of the researchers’ next steps will be to try to make the device cheaper.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-aurora-rare-amateur-astronomer-images">Amateur astronomers’ images of a rare double aurora may unlock its secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>What happens when two different kinds of auroras get together? One spills the other’s secrets.</p>



<p>Amateur astronomers have captured a strange combination of red and green auroras on camera, and physicists — who had never seen such a thing before — have now used these images to learn what may trigger the more mysterious part of the lightshow.</p>



<p>Photographer Alan Dyer was in his backyard in Strathmore, Canada, when he saw the lights dancing overhead and started filming. “I knew I had something interesting,” says Dyer, who also writes about astronomy. What he didn’t know was that he had just made the most complete recording of this rare phenomenon.</p>





<p>At a glance, Dyer’s video looks like a celestial watermelon. The rind, a rippling green aurora, is well understood: It appears when the solar wind energizes protons trapped within Earth’s magnetic field, which then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/breach-shield-magnetic-links-between-sun-and-earth-last-hours">rain down</a> and knock electrons and atoms around <em>(SN: 12/10/03)</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The swath of fruity magenta is more mysterious: Though scientists have known about these “stable auroral red arcs” for decades, there’s no widely accepted proof of how they form.&nbsp;One popular theory is that part of Earth’s magnetic field can heat up the atmosphere and, like proton rain, jostle particles. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But until now, researchers had never seen both of these red and green auroras side by side, says Toshi Nishimura, a space physicist at Boston University.&nbsp;“This strange combination,” he says, “was something beyond our expectations.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>Alan Dyer’s footage of this rare double aurora, a time lapse captured over 33 minutes on October 12, 2021, is helping physicists tease out clues to what causes the red glow.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Along with satellite observations, Dyer’s images and similar ones captured by other amateur astronomers in Canada and Finland show that the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JA030570">two phenomena are related</a>, Nishimura’s team reports in the July <em>JGR Space Physics</em>. Thin rays in the red aurora are the smoking gun as to how. Those lines trace the paths of electrons as they fall along the Earth’s magnetic field. So just as proton rain triggers the green aurora, electron rain appears to trigger the red one, with the solar wind powering both at the same time. Since the electrons carry less energy than the protons, they make for a more reddish color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But electron rain might not be the only way to produce these red glows, cautions Brian Harding, a space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. Either way, he says, the results are exciting because they show what’s going on is more complicated than researchers thought.</p>



<p>Those complications are important to understand. The auroras Dyer saw, though beautiful, are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-atmosphere">danger zones for radio communication and GPS systems</a> <em>(SN: 8/13/17)</em>. As Nishimura puts it: If you were driving under a subauroral red arc, your GPS might tell you to veer into a field.</p>



<p>Until scientists better understand these red glows, they won’t be able to forecast space weather like they do normal weather, Harding explains. “You want to make sure that you can predict stuff like this,” he says.</p>



<p>The new results would not have been possible without the citizen scientists who took the photos, Nishimura says. “This is a new way of doing research…. When they take more and more cool images, they find more and more things that we don’t know about.”</p>



<p>According to Dyer, more photos are exactly what’s coming. “We can make a unique contribution to science,” he says. &nbsp;After all, “you never know what’s going to appear.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/murder-hornets-new-name-northern-giant-hornet">‘Murder hornets’ have a new common name: Northern giant hornet</a></h4>

              
                <p>What’s been called a “murder hornet” or “Asian giant hornet” now has a somewhat official, maybe kinder, name. Meet the northern giant hornet.</p>



<p>That’s what the Entomological Society of America, or ESA, announced July 25 as the <a href="https://entsoc.org/news/press-releases/northern-giant-hornet-common-name-vespa-mandarinia">preferred plain-English common name</a> for the big, orange-and-black <em>Vespa mandarinia.</em> The choice has at least as much to do with people as it does with hornets.</p>



<p>It’s a celebrity as insects go. By 2019, the species had hitchhiked across the Pacific and was already nesting in Canada probably also on the U.S. side of the border. News stories exclaimed over hornet queens as long as a human thumb and the hornets’ late summer raiding parties that mass-slaughter whole hives of adult honeybees to steal the chubby larvae as wasp food. <em>V. mandarinia</em> became the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada">doomsday spirit insect</a> for the start of COVID-19 times (<em>SN: 5/29/20</em>). As of late July, there have been <a href="https://agr.wa.gov/departments/insects-pests-and-weeds/insects/hornets/data">no confirmed sightings</a> this year of the hornet in Washington, the state at the center of the buzz in the United States, but trapping efforts are under way.</p>





<p>In that innocent earlier time, the ESA’s list of preferred common names didn’t have an entry for the species. “Murder hornet” was way too tabloid; the hornets don’t hunt people. Frontline scientists dealing with invaders in the Pacific Northwest took up the name “Asian giant hornet.”</p>



<p>Yet both “Asian” and “giant” troubled Chris Looney of the Washington State Department of Agriculture in Olympia. “Asian” is “at best neutral and uninformative,” he wrote when proposing an alternative name to ESA. All 22 species of <em>Vespa</em> hornets have some part of their range in Asia. So mentioning the continent does pretty much nothing to clarify which species is under discussion.</p>



<p>At worst, though, connecting Asia and a nervous-making insect feeds racist fears, Looney argued. He warned about a recent “rise in hate crimes and other odious behavior directed at people of Asian descent in countries across the globe.” He has heard multiple grumblings about the hornet as “another” unwelcome “thing from China,” he said. (The current invaders came from elsewhere in Asia.)</p>



<p>With such concerns in mind, ESA has launched the Better Common Names Project to fight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racism-common-animal-names">racism embedded in names</a> (<em>SN: 8/25/21</em>). In 2021, this effort led to retirement of a cringy old name for what’s now <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spongy-moth-new-name-replaces-ethnic-slur">the spongy moth</a> (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>). Looney urged that a hornet common name avoid linking “Asian”with “a large insect that inspires fear and is under eradication.”</p>



<p>The trouble with just calling it “giant” is that other hornets also grow whoppingly big. One, <em>Vespa soror</em>, a mostly subtropical species, turned up as a large, one-hornet surprise in Vancouver in 2019. Those hornets grow about the same size as <em>V. mandarinia </em>and also will mass-slaughter honeybees.</p>



<p>The new name declaration finesses both size and geography. Based on rough distribution in their native Asian range, <em>V. mandarinia</em> is now the “northern giant hornet” and <em>V. soror</em> the “southern giant hornet.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Name game</h4>



<p>Comparing the native ranges of two huge hornet species shows why the Entomological Society of America picked “northern giant hornet” as the common name for <em>Vespa mandarinia</em>, which had invaded British Columbia and Washington state by 2019. Yellow dots mark reports of that species across a more northerly range of Asia (darker yellow denotes more abundant reports) than the span of red-orange stars for the also newly named “southern giant hornet” (<em>V. soror</em>).</p>

<p>This decision is official in the sense of selection by a relevant institution, but ESA can only enforce name use in its own publications. Other groups may decide to follow ESA rules, but there’s no central authority in the free-for-all fizz of common names. A field guide writer can choose among folk traditions and languages or even just make up names.</p>



<p>“I ignore common names anyway,” says James Carpenter, a hornet specialist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “It is an amusing conceit to think that they can be regulated.”</p>



<p>What matters to scientists are the Latin names, and ESA’s rethink does nothing about the northern giant’s formal scientific name, <em>V</em>. <em>mandarinia</em>. It dates from 1852 and “indeed, it is a reference to Asia,” says evolutionary biologist and entomologist Jessica Ware, also at the American Museum of Natural History. She is president of ESA and a strong advocate for better common names. The scientific names, however, follow intricate rules overseen by an international governing body. Making changes “will be challenging to do, should people decide to do it,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-entanglement-communication-security-bell-test">Quantum entanglement makes quantum communication even more secure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stealthy communication just got more secure, thanks to quantum entanglement.</p>



<p>Quantum physics provides a way to share secret information that’s mathematically proven to be safe from the prying eyes of spies. But until now, demonstrations of the technique, called quantum key distribution, rested on an assumption: The devices used to create and measure quantum particles have to be known to be flawless. Hidden defects could allow a stealthy snoop to penetrate the security unnoticed.</p>



<p>Now, three teams of researchers have demonstrated the ability to perform secure quantum communication without prior confirmation that the devices are foolproof. Called device-independent quantum key distribution, the method is based on quantum entanglement, a mysterious relationship between particles that links their properties even when separated over long distances.</p>





<p>In everyday communication, such as the transmission of credit card numbers over the internet, a secret code, or key, is used to garble the information, so that it can be read only by someone else with the key. But there’s a quandary: How can a distant sender and receiver share that key with one another while ensuring that no one else has intercepted it along the way?</p>



<p>Quantum physics provides a way to share keys by transmitting a series of quantum particles, such as particles of light called photons, and performing measurements on them. By comparing notes, the users can be sure that no one else has intercepted the key. Those <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-quantum-communication-top-science-stories-2017-yir">secret keys</a>, once established, can then be used to encrypt the sensitive intel (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). By comparison, standard internet security rests on a relatively shaky foundation of math problems that are difficult for today’s computers to solve, which could be vulnerable to new technology, namely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">quantum computers</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>But quantum communication typically has a catch. “There cannot be any glitch that is unforeseen,” says quantum physicist Valerio Scarani of the National University of Singapore. For example, he says, imagine that your device is supposed to emit one photon but unknown to you, it emits two photons. Any such flaws would mean that the mathematical proof of security no longer holds up. A hacker could sniff out your secret key, even though the transmission seems secure.</p>



<p>Device-independent quantum key distribution can rule out such flaws. The method builds off of a quantum technique known as a Bell test, which involves measurements of entangled particles. Such tests can prove that quantum mechanics really does have “spooky” properties, namely nonlocality, the idea that measurements of one particle can be correlated with those of a distant particle. In 2015, researchers performed the first “loophole-free” Bell tests, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-quantum-spookiness-real">certified beyond a doubt</a> that quantum physics’ counterintuitive nature is real (<em>SN: 12/15/15</em>).</p>



<p>“The Bell test basically acts as a guarantee,” says Jean-Daniel Bancal of CEA Saclay in France. A faulty device would fail the test, so “we can infer that the device is working properly.”</p>



<p>In their study, Bancal and colleagues used entangled, electrically charged strontium atoms separated by about two meters. Measurements of those ions certified that their devices were behaving properly, and the researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04941-5">generated a secret key</a>, the team reports in the July 28 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Typically, quantum communication is meant for long-distance dispatches. (To share a secret with someone two meters away, it would be easier to simply walk across the room.) So Scarani and colleagues studied entangled rubidium atoms 400 meters apart. The setup <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04891-y">had what it took</a> to produce a secret key, the researchers report in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. But the team didn’t follow the process all the way through: The extra distance meant that producing a key would have taken months.</p>



<p>In the third study, published in the July 29 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, researchers <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/3e07dY90A0b1176b582e78c5f757c7eafdfc527e5">wrangled entangled photons</a> rather than atoms or ions. Physicist Wen-Zhao Liu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei and colleagues also demonstrated the capability to generate keys, at distances up to 220 meters. This is particularly challenging to do with photons, Liu says, because photons are often lost in the process of transmission and detection.</p>



<p>Loophole-free Bell tests are already no easy feat, and these techniques are even more challenging, says physicist Krister Shalm of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo. “The requirements for this experiment are so absurdly high that it’s just an impressive achievement to be able to demonstrate some of these capabilities,” says Shalm, who wrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01987-3">a perspective in the same issue</a> of <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>That means that the technique won’t see practical use anytime soon, says physicist Nicolas Gisin of the University of Geneva, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>Still, device-independent quantum key distribution is “a totally fascinating idea,” Gisin says. Bell tests were designed to answer a philosophical question about the nature of reality — whether quantum physics really is as weird as it seems. “To see that this now becomes a tool that enables something else,” he says, “this is the beauty.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lactose-tolerance-milk-famine-disease-ancient-europe">Famine and disease may have driven ancient Europeans’ lactose tolerance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient Europeans may have evolved an ability to digest milk thanks to periodic famines and disease outbreaks.</p>



<p>Europeans avidly tapped into milk drinking <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05010-7">starting around 9,000 years ago</a>, when dairying groups first reached the continent’s southeastern corner, researchers report July 27 in <em>Nature</em>. Yet it took several thousand years before large numbers of Europeans evolved a gene for digesting lactose, the sugar in milk, the investigators say.</p>



<p>These discoveries — based on animal fat residue samples from hundreds of archaeological sites and a trove of DNA data — undermine an influential idea that milk use dramatically increased as the product’s nutritional and health benefits drove the evolution of lactose tolerance, say biogeochemist Richard Evershed of the University of Bristol in England and colleagues.</p>





<p>Milk drinkers who can’t digest lactose experience diarrhea, gas, bloating and intestinal cramps. Those uncomfortable reactions were too mild to move the evolutionary needle toward lactose tolerance on their own, Evershed’s group says. But during periodic famines and infectious disease outbreaks, lactose-induced diarrhea became fatal for severely malnourished individuals in farming communities, the scientists suggest. Those recurring threats hotwired the evolution of lactose tolerance, they contend.</p>



<p>Evershed’s report “comprehensively rules out” widespread milk consumption as the evolutionary force behind lactose tolerance, says bioarchaeologist Oliver Craig of the University of York in England. Further research needs to clarify the scale and extent of famines or infectious disease episodes that may have influenced how ancient Europeans digested milk, adds Craig, who did not participate in the new study. Investigators must also keep in mind that &nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pots-bear-oldest-signs-cheese-making">cheese and other low-lactose dairy products</a> date to as early as around 7,400 years ago in Europe (<em>SN:</em> <em>12/12/12</em>). If these foods were widely available, it’s unclear why lactose intolerant Europeans would not have survived times of famine or disease, Craig says.</p>



<p>Evershed’s team mapped estimated frequencies of milk use across Europe from around 9,000 to 500 years ago by analyzing previously published data from animal fat residues extracted from more than 13,000 pottery fragments at about 550 archaeological sites.</p>



<p>At the beginning of that time span, migrating farmers introduced dairying to southeastern Europe’s Balkan Peninsula, where residents embraced regular milk drinking, the investigators say. Milk use then fluctuated over time in different parts of the continent. After about 7,500 years ago, relatively heavy milk use characterized western France, northern Europe and the British Isles. Dairying occurred less often in central Europe.</p>



<p>Evershed’s team also tracked the emergence and spread of the main gene responsible for lactose tolerance using published ancient DNA data from nearly 1,800 Europeans and Asians. The earliest European evidence of a gene variant in adults responsible for boosting the activity of lactase, an enzyme that confers tolerance by chemically breaking down lactose, dates to about 6,650 years ago, the researchers say. But this trait, known as lactase persistence, did not become common in Europe until around 3,000 years ago, they find.</p>



<p>Before that time, increasing levels of lactase persistence tended to align with population busts linked to famines in particular regions, the researchers report. Between 8,000 and 4,000 years ago, excavated farming sites across Europe display signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-farming-populations-went-boom-then-bust">periodic population declines</a> that were influenced by severe food shortages, the researchers say (<em>SN: 10/1/13</em>).</p>



<p>Estimates of settlement density, a measure of how closely together people lived, also tended to decline at times of increasing lactase persistence. The spread of animal-borne infections such as salmonella lowered settlement densities as residents unable to digest lactose suffered an excess of deaths, the scientists suspect. In those periods of malnourishment and illness, lactase persistence boosted access to badly needed nutrients in milk, Evershed’s group speculates.</p>



<p>But archaeologist Ron Pinhasi of the University of Vienna is not convinced the famine and disease theory holds up. Diarrhea causes death more often in malnourished children, he says, so he questions whether it would have led to enough adult fatalities to trigger the evolution of milk tolerance. No current proposal explains how lactase persistence spread, he says.</p>



<p>In other parts of the world, and for equally mysterious reasons, regular milk consumption doesn’t necessarily stimulate the spread of lactose tolerance. For instance, lactose tolerance rarely occurs among<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035340"> milk-drinking Central Asian herders</a> but biological signs of lactose tolerance often appear in East African Hadza hunter-gatherers, who don’t drink milk.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heat-humans-stress-extreme-climate-change-physiology">Humans may not be able to handle as much heat as scientists thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than 2,000 people dead from extreme heat and wildfires raging in Portugal and Spain. High temperature records shattered from England to Japan. Overnights that fail to cool.</p>



<p>Brutal heat waves are quickly becoming the hallmark of the summer of 2022.</p>



<p>And even as climate change continues to crank up the temperature, scientists are working fast to understand the limits of humans’ resilience to heat extremes. Recent research suggests that heat stress tolerance in people may be lower than previously thought. If true, millions more people could be at risk of succumbing to dangerous temperatures sooner than expected.</p>





<p>“Bodies are capable of acclimating over a period of time” to temperature changes, says Vivek Shandas, an environmental planning and climate adaptation researcher at Portland State University in Oregon. Over geologic time, there have been many climate shifts that humans have weathered, Shandas says. “[But] we’re in a time when these shifts are happening much more quickly.”</p>



<p>Just halfway through 2022, heat waves have already ravaged many countries. The heat arrived early in southern Asia: In March, Wardha, India, saw a high of 45° Celsius (113° Fahrenheit); in Nawabshah, Pakistan, recorded temperatures rose to 49.5° C (121.1° F).</p>



<p>Extreme heat alerts blared across Europe beginning in June and continuing through July, the rising temperatures exacerbating drought and sparking wildfires. The United Kingdom shattered its hottest-ever record July 19 when temperatures reached 40.3° C in the English village of Coningsby. The heat fueled fires in France, forcing thousands to evacuate from their homes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the litany goes on: June brought Japan its worst heat wave since record-keeping began in 1875, leading to the country’s highest-ever recorded temperature of 40.2° C.&nbsp; China’s coastal megacities, from Shanghai to Chengdu, were hammered by heat waves in July as temperatures in the region also rose above 40° C. And in the United States, a series of heat waves gripped the Midwest, the South and the West in June and July. Temperatures soared to 42° C in North Platte, Neb., and to 45.6° C in Phoenix.</p>



<p>The current <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts">global rate of warming on Earth is unprecedented</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/19</em>). And scientists have long predicted that human-caused <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01058-x">climate change will increase the occurrence of heat waves</a>. Globally, humans’ <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2024792118">exposure to extreme heat tripled</a> from 1983 to 2016, particularly in South Asia.</p>



<p>The heat already is taking an increasing toll on human health. It can cause heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which is often fatal. Dehydration can lead to kidney and heart disease. Extreme heat <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">can even change how we behave</a>, increasing aggression and decreasing our ability to focus (<em>SN: 8/18/21</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Hot zones</h3>



<p>On July 13, multiple heat waves seared much of Europe, Asia and North Africa, smashing temperature records. China&#8217;s Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory recorded its highest-ever temperature of 40.9° C in almost 150 years of record-keeping. Tunis, Tunisia, reached a 40-year record of 48° C. And the scorching heat fueled fires in Portugal, Spain and France.</p>

<h4>Staying cool</h4>



<p>The human body has various ways to shed excess heat and keep the core of the body at an optimal temperature of about 37° C (98.6° F). The heart pumps faster, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">speeding up blood flow</a> that carries heat to the skin (<em>SN: 4/3/18</em>). Air passing over the skin can wick away some of that heat. Evaporative cooling — sweating — also helps.</p>



<p>But there’s a limit to how much heat humans can endure. In 2010, scientists <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0913352107">estimated that theoretical heat stress limit to be at a “wet bulb” temperature of 35° C</a>. Wet bulb temperatures depend on a combination of humidity and “dry bulb” air temperature measured by a thermometer. Those variables mean a place could hit a wet bulb temperature of 35° C in different ways — for instance, if the air is that temperature and there’s 100 percent humidity, or if the air temperature is 46° C and there’s 50 percent humidity. The difference is due to evaporative cooling.</p>



<p>When water evaporates from the skin or another surface, it steals away energy in the form of heat, briefly cooling that surface. That means that in drier regions, the wet bulb temperature — where that ephemeral cooling effect happens readily — will be lower than the actual air temperature. In humid regions, however, wet and dry bulb temperatures are similar, because the air is so moist it’s difficult for sweat to evaporate quickly.</p>



<p>So when thinking about heat stress on the body, scientists use wet bulb temperatures because they are a measure of how much cooling through evaporation is possible in a given climate, says Daniel Vecellio, a climate scientist at Penn State.</p>



<p>“Both hot/dry and warm/humid environments can be equally dangerous,” Vecellio says — and this is where the body’s different cooling strategies come into play. In hot, dry areas, where the outside temperature may be much hotter than skin temperature, human bodies rely entirely on sweating to cool down, he says. In warm, humid areas, where the air temperature may actually be cooler than skin temperatures (but the humidity makes it <em>seem</em> warmer than it is), the body can’t sweat as efficiently. Instead, the cooler air passing over the skin can draw away the heat.</p>



<h4>How hot is too hot?</h4>



<p>Given the complexity of the body’s cooling system, and the diversity of human bodies, there isn’t really a one-size-fits-all threshold temperature for heat stress for everybody. “No one’s body runs at 100 percent efficiency,” Vecellio says. Different body sizes, the ability to sweat, age and acclimation to a regional climate all have a role.</p>



<p>Still, for the last decade, that theoretical wet bulb 35° C number has been considered to be the point beyond which humans can no longer regulate their bodies’ temperatures. But recent laboratory-based research by Vecellio and his colleagues suggests that a general, real-world threshold for human heat stress is much lower, even for young and healthy adults.</p>



<p>The researchers tracked heat stress in two dozen subjects ranging in age from 18 to 34, under a variety of controlled climates. In the series of experiments, the team varied humidity and temperature conditions within an environmental chamber, sometimes holding temperature constant while varying the humidity, and sometimes vice versa.</p>



<p>The subjects exerted themselves within the chamber just enough to simulate minimal outdoor activity, walking on a treadmill or pedaling slowly on a bike with no resistance. During these experiments, which lasted for 1.5 to two hours, the researchers measured the subjects’ skin temperatures using wireless probes and assessed their core temperatures using a small telemetry pill that the subjects swallowed.</p>



<p>In warm and humid conditions, the subjects in the study were unable to tolerate heat stress at wet bulb temperatures closer to 30° or 31° C, the team estimates. In hot and dry conditions, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00738.2021">that wet bulb temperature was even lower</a>, ranging from 25° to 28° C, the researchers reported in the February <em>Journal of Applied Physiology</em>. For context, in a very dry environment at about 10 percent humidity, a wet bulb temperature of 25° C would correspond to an air temperature of about 50° C (122° F).</p>



<p>These results suggest that there is much more work to be done to understand what humans can endure under real-world heat and humidity conditions, but that the threshold may be much lower than thought, Vecellio says. The 2010 study’s theoretical finding of 35° C may still be “the upper limit,” he adds. “We’re showing the floor.”</p>



<p>And that’s for young, healthy adults doing minimal activity. Thresholds for heat stress are expected to be lower for outdoor workers required to exert themselves, or for the elderly or children. Assessing laboratory limits for more at-risk people is the subject of ongoing work for Vecellio and his colleagues.</p>

<p>If the human body’s tolerance for heat stress is generally lower than scientists have realized, that could mean millions more people will be at risk from the deadliest heat sooner than scientists have realized. As of 2020, there were <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw1838">few reports of wet bulb temperatures around the world reaching 35° C</a>, but climate simulations project that limit could be regularly exceeded in parts of South Asia and the Middle East by the middle of the century.</p>



<p>Some of the deadliest heat waves in the last two decades were at lower wet bulb temperatures: Neither the 2003 European heat wave, which caused an estimated 30,000 deaths, nor the 2010 Russian heat wave, which killed over 55,000 people, exceeded wet bulb temperatures of 28° C.</p>



<h4>Protecting people</h4>



<p>How best to inform the public about heat risk is “the part that I find to be tricky,” says Shandas, who wasn’t involved in Vecellio’s research. Shandas developed the scientific protocol for the <a href="https://nihhis.cpo.noaa.gov/Urban-Heat-Islands/Mapping-Campaigns">National Integrated Heat Health Information System’s Urban Heat Island</a> mapping campaign in the United States.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s very useful to have this physiological data from a controlled, precise study, Shandas says, because it allows us to better understand the science behind humans’ heat stress tolerance. But physiological and environmental variability still make it difficult to know how best to apply these findings to public health messaging, such as extreme heat warnings, he says. “There are so many microconsiderations that show up when we’re talking about a body’s ability to manage [its] internal temperature.”</p>



<p>One of those considerations is the ability of the body to quickly acclimate to a temperature extreme. Regions that aren’t used to extreme heat may experience greater mortality, even at lower temperatures, simply because people there aren’t used to the heat. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know">2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest</a> wasn’t just extremely hot — it was extremely hot for that part of the world at that time of year, which makes it more difficult for the body to adapt, Shandas says (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Heat that arrives unusually early and right on the heels of a cool period can also be more deadly, says Larry Kalkstein, a climatologist at the University of Miami and the chief heat science advisor for the Washington, D.C.–based nonprofit Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. “Often early season heat waves in May and June are more dangerous than those in August and September.”</p>

<h3>Rising heat</h3>



<p>In the 1960s, the average time between the earliest and latest heat waves that might occur in a year was just about 22 days. By the 2010s, the average heat wave season had lengthened to almost 70 days.</p>

<p>One way to improve communities&#8217; resilience to the heat may be to treat heat waves like other natural disasters — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricanes-names-heat-waves-climate-health">including give them names</a> and severity rankings (<em>SN: 8/14/20</em>). As developed by an international coalition known as the <a href="https://www.onebillionresilient.org/post/extreme-heat-resilience-alliance-reducing-extreme-heat-risk-for-vulnerable-people">Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance</a>, those rankings form the basis for a new type of heat wave warning that explicitly considers the factors that impact heat stress, such as wet bulb temperature and acclimation, rather than just temperature extremes.</p>



<p>The rankings also consider factors such as cloud cover, wind and how hot the temperatures are overnight. “If it’s relatively cool overnight, there’s not as much negative health outcome,” says Kalkstein, who created the system. But overnight temperatures aren’t getting as low as they used to in many places. In the United States, for example, the average minimum temperatures at nighttime are now about 0.8° C warmer than they were during the first half of the 20th century, according to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-economic-cost-united-states">the country’s Fourth National Climate Assessment</a>, released in 2018 (<em>SN: 11/28/18</em>).</p>



<p>By naming heat waves like hurricanes, officials hope to increase citizens&#8217; awareness of the dangers of extreme heat. Heat wave rankings could also help cities&nbsp;tailor their interventions to the severity of the event.&nbsp;Six cities are currently testing the system&#8217;s effectiveness: four in the United States and in Athens, Greece, and Seville, Spain.&nbsp;On July 24, with temperatures heading toward 42° C, Seville became the first city in the world to officially name a heat wave, sounding the alarm for Heat Wave Zoe. </p>



<p>As 2022 continues to smash temperature records around the globe, such warnings may come not a moment too soon.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moths-pollinate-clover-flowers-night-bees">Moths pollinate clover flowers at night, after bees have gone home</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bees aren’t the only insects pollinating red clover. Moths do about a third of the flower visits after dark, new research suggests.</p>



<p>The findings, detailed in the July <em>Biology Letters</em>, come as a surprise, since almost all the credit for pollination of red clover has gone to bees. The discovery highlights what researchers may be missing <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0187">during the night shift of plant pollination</a>, including a previously unknown benefit the moth pollination bestows on the clover — a boost in seed production.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This work may help deepen scientists’ understanding of the pollination services provided by nocturnal moths, says Daichi Funamoto, a pollination biologist at the University of Tokyo who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>For about a century, the general understanding of clover pollination has been that bees — and bees alone — are the key insect players. Clover is a “valuable agricultural plant and has received a lot of study,” says Jamie Alison, a pollinator ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. “Yet none of those studies have said anything about the possibility of moth pollination.”</p>



<p>Alison and his colleagues discovered moths’ pollination role while studying how plants and their insect pollinators respond to climate change by potentially moving uphill. To track pollinator visitation to grassland plants, the team set up 15 time-lapse cameras in the Swiss Alps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From June to August 2021, the cameras monitored 36 flowers of red clover (<em>Trifolium pratense</em>), an important crop used as forage for livestock. Such cameras are very useful for monitoring sites that are difficult to reach daily, Alison says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine of the cameras took images in a slice of the afternoon and again at night, while six of them continuously captured photos every five minutes. The technology provides substantial practical benefits.</p>



<p>“You can’t feasibly have someone stand there for 24 hours and record consistently what is visiting a flower,” Alison says. “Fortunately, you can do that with cameras.”</p>



<p>The method also allowed Alison and his colleagues to investigate nighttime visitors. In all, the team collected more than 164,000 photos of red clover flowers, with 44 of these images capturing visits by insect pollinators. Most of these nectar-seekers — some 61 percent — were bumblebees (<em>Bombus</em>). But a substantial proportion — 34 percent — were moths, mostly large yellow underwings (<em>Noctua pronuba</em>), visiting in the early morning hours. Butterflies and either a wasp or another bee species rounded out the other 5 percent of visits.</p>



<p>Moths are well-known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hawk-moth-flowers-pollination-conflict">habitual pollinators</a> of many other plants, but their role in clover pollination seems to have been overlooked, Alison says (<em>SN: 6/27/17</em>). He and his colleagues also investigated how many seeds the clover blossoms produced, finding that nighttime visits from moths added to seed yield.</p>



<p>It’s clear “the role of nocturnal moths as pollinators of crops has largely been neglected,” Funamoto says. “I think future studies will reveal many plant species that are thought to be dependent on pollination by diurnal insects are indeed pollinated by nocturnal moths, to some extent.”</p>



<p>Alison and his team are now looking to replicate their observations at different latitudes in Europe to confirm that <em>N. pronuba </em>moths pollinate red clover in other places. The researchers also would like to equip cameras with artificial intelligence–driven programs that are trained to identify and swiftly categorize the type of pollinator making a visit.</p>



<p>“The future isn’t just cameras,” Alison says, “but cameras should be a big part of it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jet-fuel-sunlight-air-water-vapor-solar-kerosene">How to make jet fuel from sunlight, air and water vapor</a></h4>

              
                <p>Jet fuel can now be siphoned from the air.</p>



<p>Or at least that’s the case in Móstoles, Spain, where researchers demonstrated that an outdoor system could <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00286-0">produce kerosene</a>, used as jet fuel, with three simple ingredients: sunlight, carbon dioxide and water vapor. Solar kerosene could replace petroleum-derived jet fuel in aviation and help stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers report in the July 20 <em>Joule</em>.</p>



<p>Burning solar-derived kerosene releases carbon dioxide, but only as much as is used to make it, says Aldo Steinfeld, an engineer at ETH Zurich. “That makes the fuel carbon neutral, especially if we use carbon dioxide captured directly from the air.”</p>





<p>Kerosene is the fuel of choice for aviation, a sector responsible for around 5 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Finding sustainable alternatives has proven difficult, especially for long-distance aviation, because kerosene is packed with so much energy, says chemical physicist Ellen Stechel of Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>In 2015, Steinfeld and his colleagues <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b00351">synthesized solar kerosene in the laboratory</a>, but no one had produced the fuel entirely in a single system in the field. So Steinfeld and his team positioned 169 sun-tracking mirrors to reflect and focus radiation equivalent to about 2,500 suns into a solar reactor atop a 15-meter-tall tower. The reactor has a window to let the light in, ports that supply carbon dioxide and water vapor as well as a material used to catalyze chemical reactions called porous ceria.</p>

<p>When heated with solar radiation, the ceria reacts with carbon dioxide and water vapor in the reactor to produce syngas — a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide. The syngas is then piped to the tower’s base where a machine converts it into kerosene and other hydrocarbons.</p>



<p>Over nine days of operation, the researchers found that the tower converted about 4 percent of the used solar energy into roughly 5,191 liters of syngas, which was used to synthesize both kerosene and diesel. This proof-of-principle setup produced about a liter of kerosene a day, Steinfeld says.</p>



<p>“It’s a major milestone,” Stechel says, though the efficiency needs to be improved for the technology to be useful to industry. For context, a Boeing 747 passenger jet burns around 19,000 liters of fuel during takeoff and the ascent to cruising altitude. Recovering heat unused by the system and improving the ceria’s heat absorption could boost the tower’s efficiency to more than 20 percent, making it economically practical, the researchers say.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/grill-burger-math-time-calculations">Here’s the quickest way to grill burgers, according to math</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you have a hankering for a hamburger, math may have some timesaving cooking tips for you.</p>



<p>Increasing the number of times a burger is flipped from one side to the other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278922001567">reduces its cook time by up to nearly a third</a>, theoretical calculations suggest. But cooks at home probably won&#8217;t see much benefit out of more than three to four flips, mathematician Jean-Luc Thiffeault reports June 17 in <em>Physica D</em>.</p>



<p>Thiffeault used math to model how heat moves through an “infinite” slab of meat, which cooks continuously on only the bottom side and cools on the top until the meat is flipped. Flipping heated the meat evenly, speeding up cooking, the analysis showed. And more flips led to a faster cook. For example, flipping this theoretical 1-centimeter-thick patty just once gave it a cook time of 80 seconds, while flipping it 10 times at intervals ranging from six to 11 seconds resulted in a cook time of 69 seconds. Continuing to flip the burger led to a maximum decrease of 29 percent in cooking time.<br><br>But the timesaving benefit seemed to diminish as the number of flips increased beyond a certain threshold, says Thiffeault, of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “After three or four flips, the gain in time is negligible.”</p>





<p>Thiffeault’s findings align with what chef and food writer J. Kenji López-Alt has observed in the kitchen. In a 2019 article for the food and drink website Serious Eats, Kenji López-Alt compared how long it took for a burger’s internal temperature to reach about 52° Celsius, or 125° Fahrenheit, based on cooking method. <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-burger-lab-how-many-times-should-you-flip-a-burger-while-cooking">Flipping a burger every 15 seconds</a> — as opposed to flipping the patty just once — shortened cooking time by nearly a third.</p>



<p>But there isn’t a one-size-fits-all way to cook a burger, Kenji López-Alt notes. “The idea of the perfect anything is just nonsense, right?” he says. “It’s all based on what you want.”</p>



<p>Thiffeault’s friends probably wouldn’t want his theoretical hamburger, the mathematician jokes. The infinite slab of meat is considered cooked when it reaches 70° Celsius, or 158°<strong> </strong>Fahrenheit. “That&#8217;s no burger that they would want to eat because it&#8217;s quite a well-done burger,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-home-coronavirus-isolation-filter-transmission">Here’s what to do when someone at home has COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>I’m one of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#national-lab">40 percent or fewer</a> of Americans who have managed to avoid getting COVID-19. I have been avoiding it like a potentially life-threatening virus — I’d say the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html"> plague</a>, but all I really do to avoid that illness is not interact with rodents when I visit the West and Southwest. To protect against COVID-19, I wear KN95 masks when I’m indoors in public or in crowded outdoor situations. I’m up-to-date on vaccines with my <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">second booster</a> shot as of May, which may provide a tiny bit of protection against infection, but is mostly for keeping me from getting really sick if I were to get infected (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet, I recently invited COVID-19 into my home. It came in the form of a relative who tested positive while vacationing here. She isolated herself in her hotel room until it was time to check out, but needed a place to stay until she was safe to fly home, according to this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html">quarantine and isolation calculator</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</p>





<p>She was still testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on at-home antigen tests when she came to us, so we assumed she was contagious to me and my husband. I made that assumption based on research and conversations with experts. A recent study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> found that people infected with the omicron variant BA.1 produced infectious virus for about <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202092">six to eight days</a> on average, with some people shedding infectious virus for 10 days or longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We didn’t know which of the omicron variants now circulating my relative had, but we did know that we didn’t want to catch it. Omicron carries a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791601">higher chance of being passed on to household members</a> than earlier variants of concern did, a recent <em>JAMA Network Open</em> study found. For instance, omicron had a secondary household attack rate of 42.7 percent, referring to the percentage of household members who got COVID-19 from an infected person in the house. That beats other highly infectious variants by a mile: Alpha’s rate was 36.4 percent and delta’s 29.7 percent. And the currently circulating subvariant of omicron, BA.5, may even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-covid-again-reinfection-omicron">reinfect people who recently had COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 6/27/22</em>).</p>



<p>So how do you evade a virus that has been catching up with even those who have so far managed to avoid infection for years? A lot of people are probably asking that question right now, given that the CDC’s&nbsp;<a href="http://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community transmission map</a>&nbsp;is red across the country (more than 93 percent of counties are reporting high community transmission), and my own personal gauge — Anna Gibbs’ reporting on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">experts’ advice on what to do after a positive COVID test</a> — is consistently among <em>Science News</em>’ most-read stories (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>

<p>“There’s a bunch of different options, and you could do one or many of them, depending on your situation and how concerned you are about getting it,” says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist who studies disease transmission at&nbsp;Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>



<p>The first option is to isolate the infected person from the rest of the household. For most people that probably involves putting someone in a room alone and closing the door. We did an admittedly extreme version of secluding our COVID-19 patient by putting up plastic sheeting to wall off our guest bedroom and guest bathroom as an isolation suite. Making things as airtight as possible may help limit the virus’ spread in the house, Marr says. You don’t need to erect a plastic wall like we did, though. Rolling up a towel and sticking it under the door may reduce the amount of air flowing in and out of an infected person’s room. That is a tactic Marr says she uses when staying in hotel rooms.</p>

<p>In our house, my relative went into the isolation suite and emerged only to retrieve meals I left for her on a tray just outside the zipper and to go for brief (masked) walks around the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But not everyone has such a high tolerance for solitude or has a housing situation that allows for a sick ward. And it’s not really feasible to isolate children or household members that need care. Our isolation suite wouldn’t have worked for Marr’s 14-year-old son, she says. “He’s very social. It would have been torture to make him stay in his room.”</p>



<p>Not to worry. Marr says there are plenty of ways to keep the virus away from uninfected family members. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mask-guidelines-community-risk">Good quality face coverings</a>, such as N95, KN95 or KF94 masks, can help keep the virus in check (<em>SN: 3/25/22</em>). “The most important person to have wear a mask is the infected person because it acts as source control to keep the virus from getting out in the air,” Marr says. Uninfected family members can wear masks as an extra layer of protection, too. My relative graciously wore her mask when outside of the isolation suite, and my husband and I masked and gloved up when we dropped off meals and retrieved dishes.</p>



<p>But Marr’s son wasn’t keen on wearing a mask, so her family took other measures. “We had a portable air cleaner and moved that around with him wherever he was. We did eat dinner together. We opened a window and had him sitting closest to the window with a fan pointing out, so that everything from him was getting sucked out.” Their plan worked. Nobody else in Marr’s household got COVID-19.</p>



<p>“Increased ventilation, of course, is going to be very helpful,” she says. That might involve opening windows when the weather allows and running the bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Pointing a fan out the open window in an infected person’s room will also help limit the amount of virus reaching the rest of the household. Open windows aren’t always welcome, especially when it’s too cold or hot outside or during allergy season or when other conditions degrade air quality. For instance, “this assumes your outdoor air is not full of wildfire smoke,” Marr says.</p>



<p>Filtering the air can also reduce the amount of virus floating around the house. We put a portable air cleaner in the isolation suite. And we <a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/">built a Corsi-Rosenthal box</a> to filter any stray virus that wandered into our air space. The box is a do-it-yourself alternative to pricey HEPA filters. We built ours from four large air filters, a box fan and the cardboard box the fan came in (for the bottom of the box and a shroud for the top). Such boxes aren’t HEPA filters, but they have a higher clean air delivery rate than many commercial machines because they move so much air, Marr says. Still, the box wasn’t cheap to build. It cost about $130, with each filter costing just under $25.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“All of these things you can do will reduce your risk by some amount, and the more you layer on top of each other, the more you reduce your risk,” Marr says. Also important is to keep vulnerable people away from the infected person. Vulnerable people include the elderly, immunocompromised people or others with medical conditions that put them at high risk of severe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that once the infection is over, the virus is probably gone. “The air doesn’t typically stick around in a house, even when everything is closed up … for more than a few hours. It leaks in and out,” Marr says. As for cleaning surfaces and laundry, there’s no need to buy special products. “Regular soap will easily kill the virus,” she says.</p>



<p>Our relative’s positive line on at-home antigen tests grew fainter and fainter and finally disappeared during her stay. Now, more than a week after her departure, my husband and I are still feeling fine and getting negative results on our at-home tests. It wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t fun (especially for my sequestered relative) to ward off the pestilence within our walls, but it’s possible. If the coronavirus invades your home, I hope you’ll be able to escape it, too.</p>



<p>Stay safe in there!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-woman-fossil-china-ancient-dna-early-americans">Ancient DNA links an East Asian Homo sapiens woman to early Americans</a></h4>

              
                <p>A previously undetected <em>Homo sapiens</em> population inhabited what’s now southwestern China around 14,000 years ago and contributed to the ancestry of ancient Americans.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00928-9">This far-ranging Asian group’s evolutionary identity has been revealed</a> thanks to ancient DNA extracted from a skullcap previously excavated at Mengzi Ren, or MZR, a site in southwestern China’s Red Deer Cave, researchers report July 14 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The finding offers a rare opportunity to narrow down where the ancestors of ancient Americans came from in East Asia’s vast expanse.</p>





<p>Geneticist Bing Su of China’s Kunming Institute of Zoology and colleagues recovered nearly all the fossil individual’s mitochondrial DNA, typically inherited from the mother, and roughly 3.3 percent of the nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents.</p>



<p>Hominid fossils unearthed at Red Deer Cave in 1989 look like those of people today in some ways but in others resemble Asian Neandertals and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>Homo erectus</em> </a>(<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thigh-bone-adds-mystery-over-14000-year-old-homo-species">That unusual skeletal mix inspired a debate</a> about whether the Chinese fossils represent <em>H. sapiens</em> or had different origins (<em>SN: 12/17/15</em>).</p>



<p>The new genetic analyses and comparisons with present-day and ancient people peg the MZR individual’s DNA as that of a female <em>H. sapiens</em> from southern East Asia. Much like East Asians today, the ancient female’s ancestry included small contributions from Denisovans and Neandertals.</p>



<p>Su’s group found that the MZR woman carried genetic ties to ancient people in the Americas who date to as early as about 12,000 years ago. Some ancient southern East Asians traveled up China’s eastern coast, possibly by way of Japan, and crossed a land bridge to North America, the scientists suspect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/who-losing-effort-contain-monkeypox-virus">The world is ‘losing the window’ to contain monkeypox, experts warn</a></h4>

              
                <p>It may soon be too late to end the global monkeypox epidemic.</p>



<p>“We are <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/event/2022-monkeypox-outbreak-situational-awareness">losing the window to be able to contain this outbreak</a>,” Boghuma Titanji, an infectious diseases doctor and virologist at Emory University in Atlanta said July 21 during a seminar sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.</p>



<p>On July 23, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of monkeypox is <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-statement-on-the-press-conference-following-IHR-emergency-committee-regarding-the-multi--country-outbreak-of-monkeypox--23-july-2022">a public health emergency of international concern</a>, the organization’s highest state of alert. The WHO committee evaluating the matter was split on whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency, but Ghebreyesus decided that enough conditions were met to warrant the designation.</p>





<p>Monkeypox has infected <a href="https://map.monkeypox.global.health/country">more than 15,700</a> people since the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">beginning of May</a>, according to Global.health (<em>SN: 5/26/22</em>).  More than<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html"> 2,800 cases</a> have been reported  in the United States as of July 22, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.</p>



<p>“Although I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners,” Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups.”</p>



<p>Monkeypox has caused outbreaks for decades in some parts of Africa, Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said at the Harvard seminar. But the virus “has been neglected by the global health community.” Monkeypox “has been giving us warning signals” for years in Congo, Nigeria and other parts of West Africa, but has only gotten attention once it recently started causing cases outside of the continent, Rimoin said.</p>



<p>There has been no concerted global effort to contain the virus, which is related to smallpox, Titanji said. Each country has been left to set its own policies.</p>



<p>That has led to disparities. Well-resourced countries have had at least some access to testing, vaccines and medications, which may help limit the spread of the virus or the severity of the disease. Resource-poor nations often lack that access, leaving them with limited ability to track or control the virus. Continued spread of monkeypox in resource-poor countries could leave places that do manage to contain an initial outbreak vulnerable to reintroductions, Jay K. Varma, director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response in New York City, said in the seminar. The WHO emergency declaration may lead to a more concerted international effort that could make more resources available to contain the spread of the virus.</p>



<p>Even for the wealthiest countries, containing the outbreak is a challenge. Questions abound about how the virus is transmitted, and whether vaccines and treatments — when people can get them — can halt its spread. Even diagnosing the disease can be tricky, with testing often hard to come by and missed diagnoses potentially leading to more cases.</p>



<p>The vast majority of monkeypox cases in the global outbreak have been among men who have sex with men. Of 528 people infected with monkeypox in 16 countries, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323">98 percent identified as gay or bisexual men</a>, researchers report July 21 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>In some countries with outbreaks, “gay men are criminalized,” Kai Kupferschmidt, a correspondent for <em>Science</em> magazine, said during the seminar. In those countries, “people cannot access good information to help them keep from getting infected and cannot access health care if they do get infected. In these countries, it becomes really difficult to even see the problem,” he said.</p>



<p>Ghebreyesus urged all countries to “work closely with communities of men who have sex with men, to design and deliver effective information and services, and to adopt measures that protect the health, human rights and dignity of affected communities. Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus,” he said in a statement.</p>



<p>Doctors might also miss cases of monkeypox because of the unusual presentation of the illness in this outbreak, compared with earlier outbreaks. For instance, in the <em>NEJM </em>study, only a quarter of patients had monkeypox lesions on their faces and only 10 percent had the sores on their palms or soles of their feet. Those body parts have been among some of the most affected in other outbreaks.</p>



<p>Instead, 73 percent of people in the study had lesions in the anal and genital regions and 55 percent on the trunk, arms or legs. Some people also had lesions in their mouths and throats. Most of the people in the study had fewer than 10 lesions, with 54 people having only a single lesion on their genitals, making confusion with herpes or syphilis possible, even easy.</p>



<p>Seventy people in the study were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 21 were hospitalized because of pain, mostly severe rectal pain. Others had eye lesions, kidney damage, inflammation of the heart or throat swelling that prevented them from taking in liquids. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those complications fit with what health officials across the United States have been seeing. “While mortality appears very low, which is great, morbidity has been much higher than any of us expected,” Mary Foote, the medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said July 14 in a <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/multimedia/videos/idsa-media-briefing-monkeypox-diagnosis--treatment/">news briefing</a> sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>



<p>“A lot of people with this infection are really suffering, and some may be at risk of permanent damage and scarring. We see many people with symptoms so severe that they are unable to go to the bathroom, urinate or eat without excruciating pain,” Foote said.</p>



<p>A small number of women and children have also gotten monkeypox in the outbreak. Two children in the United States have been diagnosed with monkeypox, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said July 22 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6d2gBpizv0Q">an interview</a> with the <em>Washington Post</em>. Both children were social contacts of men that have sex with men, she said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.29.2200552">child in the Netherlands who had no contact</a> with anyone known to be infected with the virus also got monkeypox, researchers report July 21 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. His case raises the possibility that monkeypox may be spreading undetected more broadly in communities than realized.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s surprising that we are occasionally going to see cases in individuals who are not gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men. The social networks we have as humans mean we have contact with a lot of different people,&#8221; Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology said July 22 during a White House news briefing.</p>



<p>Exactly how the child in the Netherlands became infected is a matter of speculation. Monkeypox typically spreads among people through close contact with infected people or with clothing, bedding or towels used by people with the disease. Examination of viral DNA showed that the boy isn’t connected to any of the known cases in the Netherlands. He traveled to Turkey in June and may have gotten infected there or while traveling.</p>



<p>The boy has very low levels of IgA antibodies, which patrol mucous membranes and help prevent infections there. Low levels of the antibodies could make him vulnerable to respiratory infections. People can get infected with monkeypox through droplets given off by infected people during close face-to-face interactions, such as close conversation, kissing or during medical exams. But patterns of infection clearly indicate that monkeypox isn’t airborne the way COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses are, Kupferschmidt said.</p>



<p>Details of how monkeypox spreads are still unknown. For instance, researchers don’t know whether the virus can be transmitted through semen as a sexually transmitted disease. Researchers have found evidence of <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.28.2200503">viral DNA in semen</a>, saliva, urine and feces, but that may just be inactive remnants of the virus. So far, no researchers have reported finding infectious virus in genital body fluids that might be exchanged during sex. Also unknown is whether getting infected through mucous membranes during sexual contact would shield against catching the virus later, Rimoin said.</p>



<p>Scientists are questioning whether the monkeypox virus has changed or whether it has simply found a niche social-sexual network among gay and bisexual men that may enable the virus to spread more efficiently, Titanji said. It may be that there are different transmission patterns in historically affected countries and newly affected countries that require different strategies to stop the spread, she said.</p>



<p>Researchers also need to do good studies to figure out how well vaccines and therapeutics work and under what circumstances, Rimoin said. WHO’s emergency declaration includes recommendations for increasing testing and surveillance and for seeding up research on vaccines, treatments and other virus containment measures.</p>



<p>One thing is clear, Rimoin said. “We’re giving this virus room to run like it never has before.” People have passed the buck, leaving others to work out the problem of monkeypox, she said. But now, “it’s everybody’s problem to solve.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenonnt-axions-dark-matter-experiment">A new dark matter experiment quashed earlier hints of new particles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Potential hints of weird new particles in a dark matter detector have evaporated with new data.</p>



<p>Following up on a beguiling result from its predecessor experiment, the XENONnT experiment found <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/922783/contributions/4892806/">no sign of extra blips</a> that could point to new particles or another phenomenon, scientists report July 22 in Vienna at the International Conference on Identification of Dark Matter.</p>



<p>The XENONnT experiment (pronounced “xenon n ton”), at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, uses 5.9 metric tons of liquid xenon to search for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed?mode=magazine&amp;context=192525">dark matter</a>, an elusive substance that so far has been seen only via its gravitational effects in the cosmos (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>). The detector is designed to look for dark matter particles crashing into xenon atoms’ nuclei, causing them to recoil. But the detector can also spot recoiling electrons.</p>





<p>In 2020, a smaller version of the experiment, called XENON1T, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/unexpected-result-dark-matter-experiment-new-particles">reported greater-than-expected numbers</a> of those ricocheting electrons (<em>SN: 6/17/20</em>). “This caused a lot of stir when we published it,” says physicist Rafael Lang of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.</p>



<p>That surplus, some scientists suggested, could have been explained by some unexpected new physics, such as hypothetical lightweight particles that may originate from the sun called solar axions. But the excess wasn’t large enough to be convincing, so more data were needed.</p>



<p>In the new analysis, which uses about 97 days of data, XENONnT spotted as many electron recoils as expected due to known particle interactions, the researchers also reported <a href="https://www.science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/XENONnT_SR0_lowER-48.pdf">in a paper</a> posted on the experiment’s website. Scientists don’t know what caused the extra detections in the previous experiment, but it’s possible it was merely a statistical fluke, Lang says. Or it may have been due to small amounts of tritium — hydrogen atoms with two neutrons in their nuclei — in the detector. </p>



<p>With the red herring out of the way, XENONnT researchers are now combing through their data for nuclear recoils, in hopes of detecting the real deal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/heaviest-neutron-star-mass-sun-record-black-holes">The heaviest neutron star on record is 2.35 times the mass of the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>A fast-spinning neutron star south of the constellation Leo is the most massive of its kind seen so far, according to new observations.</p>



<p>The record-setting collapsed star, named PSR J0952-0607, weighs <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05124">about 2.35 times as much as the sun,</a> researchers report July 11 on arXiv.org. “That’s the heaviest well-measured neutron star that has been found to date,” says study coauthor Roger Romani, an astrophysicist at Stanford University.</p>



<p>The previous record holder was a neutron star in the northern constellation Camelopardalis named PSR J0740+6620, which tipped the scales at <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac03b8">about 2.08 times as massive as the sun</a>. If a neutron star grows too massive, it collapses under its own weight and becomes a black hole. These measurements of hefty neutron stars are of interest because no one knows the exact mass boundary between neutron stars and black holes.</p>





<p>That dividing line drives the quest to find the most massive neutron stars and determine just how massive they can be, Romani says. “It’s defining the boundary between the visible things in the universe and the stuff that is forever hidden from us inside of a black hole,” he says. “A neutron star that’s on the hairy edge of becoming a black hole — just about heavy enough to collapse — has at its center the very densest material that we can access in the entire visible universe.”</p>



<p>PSR J0952-0607 is in the constellation Sextans, just south of Leo. It resides 20,000 light-years from Earth, far above the galaxy’s plane in the Milky Way’s halo. The neutron star emits a pulse of radio waves toward us each time it spins, so astronomers also classify the object as a pulsar. First reported in 2017, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa8400">this pulsar spins every 1.41 milliseconds</a>, faster than all but one other pulsar.</p>



<p>That’s why Romani and his colleagues chose to study it — the fast spin led them to suspect that the pulsar might be unusually heavy. That’s because another star orbits the pulsar, and just as water spilling over a water wheel spins it up, gas falling from that companion onto the pulsar could have sped up its rotation while also boosting its mass.</p>



<p>Observing the companion, Romani and his colleagues found that it whips around the pulsar quickly — at about 380 kilometers per second. Using the companion’s speed and its orbital period of about six and a half hours, the team calculated the pulsar’s mass to be more than twice the mass of the sun. That’s a lot heavier than the typical neutron star, which is only about 1.4 times as massive as the sun.</p>



<p>“It’s a terrific study,” says Emmanuel Fonseca, a radio astronomer at West Virginia University in Morgantown who measured the mass of the previous record holder but was not involved in the new work. “It helps nuclear physicists actually constrain the nature of matter within these extreme environments.”</p>

                <p>This month's episode of <em>Brain Science</em> is a free encore playing of my interview with <a title="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evan Thompson</a> about his book <a href= "https://amzn.to/3i4FfTm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind</em></a>. We discuss how the enactive approach to embodied cognition offers potential clues to the mystery of how the brain can generate Consciousness. A free episode transcript is also available.</p> <p>This is the 2nd of two free encore episodes that are being shared to give listeners a taste of the diverse content available to Premium subscribers. <a href= "https://brainsciencepodcast.com/premium" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Premium subscribers</a> have access to over 100 additional episodes of <em>Brain Science</em> along with episode transcripts.</p> <p>The embodied cognition movement is an approach within cognitive neuroscience that includes philosophers, neuroscientists, psychologists and computer scientists. The key idea is that cognition, which includes thinking and decision-making, is inseparable from embodiment. This is not just because it requires sensory inputs to the brain, but also because moving in the world is a key component. Thus embodied cognition does not see this as a passive input/output process, but as something that requires constant interaction with the world via the body.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3i4FfTm" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind</a></em> by Evan Thompson</li> <li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3N7Vwmr" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience</a></em> by Francisco J.
