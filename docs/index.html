<p>Sauropods, a group of long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs, were the largest animals to have ever walked the earth. In this study, Melstrom and colleagues demonstrate that sauropods evolved a unique feeding strategy that helped them dominate their environments for over 100 million years.</p>
<p>Dental complexity, a measure of the number of features on a 3D tooth surface, is closely linked to an animal’s diet. For example, meat-eaters typically have simple sharp teeth for ripping flesh, while plant-eaters have complex teeth with many cusps and ridges to grind down fibrous vegetation. Using computerised tomography (CT) and microCT scanning, Melstrom and colleagues analysed 3D models of Late Jurassic dinosaur teeth from around the globe. The group compared the dental complexity of carnivorous theropods, herbivorous ornithischians and herbivorous sauropods.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As expected, meat-eating theropods had simple sharp teeth while plant-eating ornithischians had more complex teeth. However, in stark contrast to herbivores living today, sauropods had mostly simple teeth. Furthermore, sauropods replaced their simple teeth faster than more complex teeth. Some sauropods like </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apatosaurus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diplodocus </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">exhibited remarkably simple &#8216;peg-like&#8217; teeth with incredibly fast replacement rates, which possibly allowed them to eat different foods from other sauropods like </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brachiosaurus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which had more complex teeth. Given that simple teeth weigh less, reducing the skull&#8217;s weight, the simple teeth of sauropods could have reduced the strain on their long necks.</span></p>

<p>Open science practices, including the deposition of data in public repositories, bring significant benefits to individual researchers, research communities and society. Making data publicly available increases the transparency, reproducibility and speed of dissemination of research. Consequently, transformative open science policies are increasingly becoming standard worldwide. In this commentary, BMC Research Notes senior Editorial Board Member Diego Forero and colleagues discuss the value of data sharing in open repositories as well as the challenges and strategies for the success of open science. The commentary highlights that in times of COVID-19, adherence to international standards for depositing open data in public repositories is now more important than ever.</p>

<p>How long is the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic stable and infectious for on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)? In this <em>in vitro</em> study, Córdoba-Lanús and colleagues evaluated SARS-CoV-2 stability and viability on PPE gowns and FFP2 (KN 95) face masks infected by the virus.</p>
<p>Genomic analyses by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic material remains on PPE for up to 30 days post contamination. In addition, via a cell-based assay using Vero-E6 host cells that measures the cytopathic effect of the virus, the researchers demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 contaminated PPE materials remain infectious for up to 7 days. These findings could help improve PPE use and management to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection from these items after the wearer has removed them, even after several days.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Transposable elements (TEs), also known as &#8220;jumping genes&#8221;, make up almost half of our genetic material. TEs are highly repetitive DNA sequences capable of mobilising themselves and increasing their copy number in the host genome. Historically, many scientists dismissed these TEs as useless &#8220;junk&#8221; DNA. However, these mobile elements are now known to have a multitude of biological functions. TEs can have neutral, beneficial, and harmful effects and contribute to human genetic variation and disease.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In this study, Talal bin Amin and colleagues develop a novel statistical approach to catalogue the recently mobile TE subfamilies (RMSs) that make humans different from each other &#8211; the types of TEs that drive human polymorphism, somatic variants and disease. Interestingly, the RMS catalogue is enriched for contributions to germline genetic disorders and somatic insertions in diverse cancers. These RMSs are primarily found within open chromatin regions associated with active DNA regulatory elements &#8211; therefore, the group speculates that they could be involved in regulating gene expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9 deletion, Talal bin Amin and colleagues show that an RMS-derived polymorphic TE insertion increased the expression of </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">RPL17</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a gene associated with lower survival in liver cancer. The RMSs and RMS-derived polymorphic TE insertions identified in this study are a valuable resource for human disease genetics and population history studies.</span></p>

<p>People who recently drifted off into a light sleep later <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj5866">had problem-solving power</a>, scientists report December 8 in <em>Science Advances. </em>The results help demystify the fleeting early moments of sleep and may even point out ways to boost creativity.</p>



<p>Prolific inventor and catnapper Thomas Edison was rumored to chase those twilight moments. He was said to fall asleep in a chair holding two steel ball bearings over metal pans. As he drifted off, the balls would fall. The ensuing clatter would wake him, and he could rescue his inventive ideas before they were lost to the depths of sleep.</p>



<p>Delphine Oudiette, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute, and colleagues took inspiration from Edison’s method of cultivating creativity. She and her colleagues brought 103 healthy people to their lab to solve a tricky number problem. The volunteers were asked to convert a string of numbers into a shorter sequence, following two simple rules. What the volunteers weren’t told was that there was an easy trick: The second number in the sequence would always be the correct final number, too. Once discovered, this cheat code dramatically cut the solving time.</p>





<p>After doing 60 of these trials on a computer, the volunteers earned a 20-minute break in a quiet, dark room. Reclined and holding an equivalent of Edison’s “alarm clock” (a light drinking bottle in one dangling hand), participants were asked to close their eyes and rest or sleep if they desired. All the while, electrodes monitored their brain waves.</p>



<p>About half of the participants stayed awake. Twenty-four fell asleep and stayed in the shallow, fleeting stage of sleep called N1. Fourteen people progressed to a deeper stage of sleep called N2.</p>



<p>After their rest, participants returned to their number problem. The researchers saw a stark difference between the groups: People who had fallen into a shallow, early sleep were 2.7 times as likely to spot the hidden trick as people who didn’t fall asleep, and 5.8 times as likely to spot it as people who had reached the deeper N2 stage.</p>



<p>Such drastic differences in these types of experiments are rare, Oudiette says. “We were quite astonished by the extent of the results.” The researchers also identified a “creative cocktail of brain waves,” as Oudiette puts it, that seemed to accompany this twilight stage — a mixture of alpha brain waves that usually mark relaxation mingled with the delta waves of deeper sleep.</p>



<p>The study doesn’t show that the time spent in N1 actually triggered the later realization, cautions John Kounios, a cognitive neuroscientist at Drexel University in Philadelphia who cowrote the 2015 book <em>The Eureka Factor: Aha Moments, Creative Insight, and the Brain</em>. “It could have been possible that grappling with the problem and initiating an incubation process caused both N1 and the subsequent insight,” he says, making N1 a “by-product of the processes that caused insight rather than the cause.”<br><br>More work is needed to untangle the connection between N1 and creativity, Oudiette says. But the results raise a tantalizing possibility, one that harkens to Edison’s self-optimizations: People might be able to learn to reach that twilight stage of sleep, or to produce the cocktail of brain waves associated with creativity on demand.</p>



<p>It seems Edison was onto something about the creative powers of nodding off. But don’t put too much stock in his habits. He is also said to have considered sleep “a criminal waste of time.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-virus-phage-shigellosis-arms-race">A bacteria-virus arms race could lead to a new way to treat shigellosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>When some bacteria manage to escape being killed by a virus, the microbes end up hamstringing themselves. And that could be useful in the fight to treat infections.</p>



<p>The bacterium<em> Shigella flexneri </em>— one cause of the infectious disease shigellosis — can spread within cells that line the gut by propelling itself through the cells’ barriers. That causes tissue damage that can lead to symptoms like bloody diarrhea. But when <em>S. flexneri</em> in lab dishes evolved to elude a type of bacteria-killing virus, the bacteria couldn’t <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.01514-21">spread cell to cell anymore,</a> making it less virulent, researchers report November 17 in <em>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</em>.</p>



<p>The research is a hopeful sign for what’s known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-slay-bacteria-draw-new-interest">phage therapy</a> (<em>SN: 11/20/02</em>). With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-drug-resistant-microbes-kill-about-35000-people-united-states-per-year">antibiotic-resistant microbes on the rise</a>, some researchers see viruses that infect and kill only bacteria, known as bacteriophages or just phages, as a potential option to treat antibiotic-resistant infections (<em>SN: 11/13/19</em>). With phage therapy, infected people are given doses of a particular phage, which kill off the problematic bacteria. The problem, though, is that over time those bacteria can evolve to be resistant against the phage, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re kind of expecting phage therapy to fail, in a sense,” says Paul Turner, an evolutionary biologist and virologist at Yale University. “Bacteria are very good at evolving resistance to phages.”</p>





<p>But that doesn’t mean the bacteria emerge unscathed. Some phages attack and enter bacteria by latching onto bacterial proteins crucial for a microbe’s function. If phage therapy treatments relied on such a virus, that could push the bacteria to evolve in such a way that not only helps them escape the virus but also impairs their abilities and makes them less deadly. People infected with these altered bacteria might have less severe symptoms or may not show symptoms at all.</p>



<p>Previous studies with the bacteria <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, for instance, have found that phage and bacteria can engage in evolutionary battles that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2018/1/60/4923328">drive the bacteria to be more sensitive to antibiotics</a>. The new study hints that researchers could leverage the arms race between <em>S. flexneri </em>and the newly identified phage, which was dubbed A1-1 after being found in Mexican wastewater, to treat shigellosis.</p>



<p><em>S. flexneri </em>in contaminated water is a huge problem in parts of the world where clean water isn’t always available, such as sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, says Kaitlyn Kortright, a microbiologist also at Yale University. Every year, approximately 1.3 million people die from shigellosis, which is caused by four <em>Shigella</em> species. More than half of those deaths are in children younger than 5 years old. What’s more, antibiotics to treat shigellosis can be expensive and hard to access in those places. And <em>S. flexneri </em>is becoming resistant to many antibiotics. Phage therapy could be a cheaper, more accessible option to treat the infection.</p>



<p>The blow to <em>S. flexneri</em>’s cellular spread comes because to enter cells, A1-1 targets a protein called OmpA, which is crucial for the bacteria to rupture host cell membranes. The researchers found two types of mutations that made <em>S. flexneri </em>resistant to A1-1. Some bacteria had mutations in the gene that produces OmpA, damaging the protein’s ability to help the microbes spread from cell to cell. Others had changes to a structural component of bacterial cells called lipopolysaccharide.</p>



<p>The mutations in lipopolysaccharide were surprising, Kortright says, because the relationship between that structural component and OmpA isn’t fully worked out. One possibility is that those mutations distort OmpA’s structure in a way that the phage no longer recognizes it and can’t enter bacterial cells.</p>



<p>One lingering question is whether <em>S. flexneri </em>evolves in the same way outside a lab dish, says Saima Aslam, an infectious diseases physician at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the work. Still, the findings show that it’s “not always a bad thing” when bacteria become phage-resistant, she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cicada-science-brood-x-2021">Cicada science heats up when Brood X emerges. 2021 was no exception</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In one of history’s weird coincidences, the second summer of a global pandemic brought Johns Hopkins biologist Ethan Allen Andrews out on a Baltimore lawn to watch the massive Brood X cicada mating frenzy. The year was 1919 and a great influenza was still spreading around the world.</p>



<p>In 2021, the second summer of a different pandemic with many heartbreaking parallels, Brood X cicadas again sent people in the eastern United States onto their lawns in wonder, or into hiding from the mini projectiles and their high-decibel din.</p>



<p>Every 17 years, big-eyed Brood X <em>Magicicada</em> bugs as fat as fingers and defenseless as gummy bears fumble out of the ground by the millions. They orient toward various trees as if mystically called, then seethe over lawns in masses to converge and climb. “Astonishing,” Andrews called the view near a large tree. And that was before the mobs took their adult flying form and, after 17 asexual years, the males finally chorused for females.</p>



<p>“Ear drums nearly shattered by boiler-foundry din,” the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> exclaimed on May 30, 1919. Yet Andrews sounded thrilled. For three years, he had dug test holes to check on the young cicadas maturing underground. When they finally crawled into daylight, he sampled and calculated. “The entire number emerging from an acre of such suburban land runs up toward one hundred thousand,” he estimated.</p>





<p>Six Brood X cicada–lifetimes later (102 years), the most recent crop of the big, goofy bugs clambered above ground on schedule in patches scattered across 15 states. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, researchers took to the field, or the lawn.</p>



<h4>All together now</h4>



<p><em>Magicicada</em> species live hypercoordinated, “periodical” lives. To be considered periodical, a whole geographic population, called a brood, must live through a multiyear life cycle, synchronizing big events. North America’s periodical cicadas, depending on location, emerge either every 13 or 17 years, mating only in the last month or so of life. Imagine, for a second, whole cities of humans who hit some of the big milestones of life — being born, having babies and then dying — within weeks of each other.</p>



<p>A periodic life cycle is rare, but not unique, says biologist Chris Simon of the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Out of the million or so named insect species, she knows of more than 50 with periodic lives — hardly an overwhelming number. Thirty-eight species of moths and butterflies live like this. So do at least four kinds of beetles and even a fly.</p>



<p>Among the estimated 3,000 cicada species, just a few kinds live so tightly in lockstep. For the various North American cicadas, only <em>Magicicada</em> species synchronize. Brood X may get a lot of publicity, but there are 14 other broods, all but one mixing more than one species.</p>



<p>Brood X mingles three species, which Simon’s well-tuned ear can identify by the males’ mating calls: the angry chipmunk call of <em>M. septendecula</em>, <em>M. cassini</em> with its ticking that winds up to a raspy scream and <em>M. septendecim</em>, known for its whistling spaceship drone. Females just click.</p>



<p>“We used to think only North America had periodical cicadas,” Simon says. And that the cycles were all odd-numbered. “We” however means Western scientists. A small expanse of India has its “World Cup” cicada (<em>Chremistica ribhoi</em>), which appears on the same four-year cycle as the soccer competition. Among Fiji’s cicadas, the gold-and-black nanai (<em>Raiateana knowlesi</em>) bursts out on the main island every eight years. It has replaced Queen Elizabeth on the South Pacific country’s $100 bill.</p>

<h4>When life gives you cicadas</h4>



<p>This year, as Simon went south for intensive Brood X mapping in North Carolina and Georgia, she bought Brewed X coffee in Washington, D.C. She’s been immersed in the fascinating world of cicadas for decades, and collects instances of cicadas touching human culture. She can quote from a 1987 newspaper story reporting two men “brandishing” a cicada in a suspected robbery at the Grand Slam restaurant in Cincinnati, and she has a 2011 photo of the window of the beloved Sparky’s ice cream parlor in Columbia, Mo. The shop had sold out of cicada ice cream, so the staff taped up a note: “Check back in 2024.”</p>



<p>Looking back over her travels and worldwide research, this year Simon and long-time colleagues <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ento-072121-061108">updated a synthesis of ideas</a> about how <em>Magicicada</em> species evolved in three main lineages that diverged from a common ancestor some 3.9 million years ago. The periodical lifestyle evolved along with them, the researchers wrote online October 8 in the <em>Annual Review of Entomology.</em></p>



<p>One factor on the path to periodicity is what Simon calls “predator fool­hardiness.” <em>Magicicada</em> adults are big and weirdly easy to catch. They only halfheartedly try to escape predators. Even though birds, squirrels and plenty of other animals gorge on the easy meals, a sufficiently huge burst of cicadas can feed all the menaces and still leave enough survivors to reproduce. Reaching such mind-boggling abundance is easier when youngsters from a whole swath of countryside burst out of the ground together every 17 years.</p>



<p>This coordination can fit with a nutrient­-skimpy diet and slow growth. Developing <em>Magicicada</em> youngsters tap tree roots for food, but ignore the higher-calorie fluid that carries sugars downward from the leaves. Instead, young cicadas drive their mouthparts into the up-sucking xylem, which carries roughly 99.9 percent water, with just a smidge of nutrients, from roots.</p>



<p>Feeding this way is hard work. To sip even such weak broth means a hard fight against the plant’s strong upward draw of fluids. To get the job done, cicadas, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/froghoppers-suction-insects-biophysics">like other xylem specialists</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 14</em>), grow specialized power pumps in their heads.</p>

<h4>Spreading wings</h4>



<p>Cicadas’ foolhardiness coupled with their extraordinary numbers brought a research bonanza for Mary Salcedo, a biomechanist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. She studies how newly adult insects quickly pump up their massive wings from the early squished-together tissue pads. Speed matters, as flightless means defenseless.</p>



<p>Cicadas can pump up their wings in only about 45 minutes. After studying the wings of lab locusts and grasshoppers, she enthusiastically turned to <em>Magicicada</em>: “Thousands of insects I don’t have to rear or care for!”</p>



<p>Before the first of Brood X pushed out of the ground this year, Salcedo booked an Airbnb rental outside Washington, D.C., for 10 (fully vaccinated) people from the Virginia Tech lab of biomechanist Jake Socha. The pandemic shut Socha’s lab in 2020, so the trip helped Ph.D. student Joshua Pulliam, for one, in his dramatic swerve to study cicada motion. He’s finding a way to fit insect climbing into his Ph.D. project on snakes that glide so well <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-flying-snakes-stay-aloft">they just about fly</a> (<em>SN: 8/1/20, p. 16</em>).</p>

<p>Salcedo has long wondered how insects manage to get huge wings flight-ready so fast. “Most people — I found, even some entomologists — think of an insect wing as like your hair,” she says. “But it’s … more like your arm.”</p>



<p>Instead of just inert stuff, insect wings have networks with nerves, airways and insect “blood,” or hemolymph. That complex system takes a lot of circulatory power, including extra hearts, says Salcedo, who is working with colleagues on a cicada wings paper. Cicadas have one central heart, plus more for the wings.</p>



<p>Unlike locusts and grasshoppers, which have a two-step wing reveal, the periodical cicada pulls its wings open all at once, like “pulling a sword out of a sheath,” Salcedo says. She Zoom-shares images of Brood X cicadas she caught and photographed during the recent excursion as they stretched out their wings for the first time. The starting shapes look like small, white sails with yellow squiggles. As those squiggles expand, the wings flare wider and longer, gradually coming to life.</p>

<h4>Mind control</h4>



<p>Forest pathologist Matt Kasson and his students also went cicada hunting in 2021, but not just any Brood X bumbler would do. Based at West Virginia University in Morgantown, the group searched in the Shenandoah Valley and nearby mountains for cicadas infected with a fungus that renders cicadas sterile but juices up their sex drive, maximizing fungal spread by mating contact.</p>



<p>“You have a cicada walking around with, basically, a chalky gumdrop [of fungus] on the backside of its abdomen,” Kasson says. These <em>Massospora</em> fungi drive males to mimic the flirtatious clicks of females, attracting other males. The duped males eventually catch on and clatter away, but they carry infectious fungi away with them.</p>



<p>Students Angie Macias and Matt Berger came up with the idea to study these fungi more than five years ago. There was no way to grow <em>Massospora</em> in labs, but the fungi attack both periodical and nonperiodical cicada species. One of the group’s first projects used nonperiodical cicadas from the American West to explore what chemistry could let a fungus energize insect sexual behavior.</p>



<p>“I get a call one snowy night in February at 2 in the morning,” Kasson remembers. It was from grad student Greg Boyce. He had a day job at a biotech company that let him use — after hours but for free — very expensive instruments to identify substances produced as an organism metabolizes. So in the dark of night, Boyce asked his adviser, “You know what psilocybin is?’’</p>

<p>Boyce had found that the legendary ingredient in a kind of magic mushroom, of all things, turned up naturally in a <em>Massospora</em> that attacks wing-banger cicadas (<em>Platypedia putnami</em>) from New Mexico.</p>



<p>By daylight “we were just like, holy crap!” Kasson says. This was especially surprising because the trippy mushrooms are far, far away from <em>Massospora</em> fungi in evolutionary history. The cicada attackers are in a whole different phylum, “way lower” on the fungal tree of life. Kasson thinks the same compound must have evolved twice, maybe a couple hundred million years apart.</p>



<p>“We got a bunch of colleagues looped in on that, and everybody was going nuts.” The big question was, did the periodical cicadas’ version of <em>Massospora</em> also have psilocybin?</p>



<p>The answer is, no. What turns out to drive periodical cicadas to hypersexed flirtation is a different stimulant: an amphetamine called cathinone. That same ingredient puts the kick in the khat plant, popularly chewed in the Middle East and not at all related to a fungus.</p>



<p>Eventually it dawned on Kasson that his cicada collecting had inadvertently filled his university lab with controlled substances for which he had no permits. “I wrote the most awkward letter of my life to the DEA,” he says.</p>



<p>In the end, the lab got squared away with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Insect mating–enhancement drugs have now become yet another tidbit of science that cicada watchers can muse over the next time their lawns start crawling.</p>

                <p><em>By guest blogger&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>



<p>Over the past ten years, developmental psychologists have been astounded by the young age at which children appear to be aware of the moral qualities of others’ actions. At just four months, babies already react with surprise <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389704/">when others engage in unequal distribution of treats and resources</a>. They also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461303/">snub these unfair individuals</a> in social interactions by the age of 24 months and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6025">expect others to do the same</a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6025"></a>. Other forms of moral judgement may emerge even sooner: as early as 3 months of age, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2966030/">infants show distinct preferences for those who help</a>, as opposed to hinder, others.</p>



<p>In thinking about these nascent moral judgements, researchers have become interested in figuring out their underlying mental “structure”. Do children’s moral rules operate like a loose “‘anthology”, where judgements passed on the basis of one principle have little effect on judgements on the basis of another? Or is there a deeper underpinning mental framework that gives rise to a multitude of connected moral expectations? &nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/39/e2109045118">recent study in <em>PNAS</em></a> by a duo of American researchers breaks new ground on this fascinating question. It reveals that toddlers are guided by a core mental representation of what it means to be a moral person (albeit with some potentially concerning caveats). Within this moral framework, a single faux pas risks entirely sweeping an individual from a child’s good books. &nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-44884"></span>



<p>In their set of experiments, the researchers examined how 25-month-old toddlers reacted to a series of morally loaded social interactions staged during a puppet show. The toddlers were first introduced to two dog puppets before observing one of them subject the other to a harmful action that ranged from crumpling up their drawing to knocking down a toy tower they had made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next came the crucial question. Would the toddlers be surprised if the perpetrator engaged in an entirely different sort of moral transgression in another setting? To test this, the researchers staged a scenario in which the dog discovered two toys and decided how to divide this lucky find between two excited puppets. Children were randomly selected to see one of two possible endings to this story: a fair outcome, where each recipient got a toy, or an unfair one where the dog inexplicably snubbed one of the puppets and gave both toys to just one.</p>



<p>The researchers found that toddlers who viewed the fair outcome spent significantly more time gazing at the interaction. This observation — which developmental psychologists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4215956/">widely accept to indicate surprise</a> — suggested that the children didn’t quite expect someone who acted as a bully to make fair decisions in a different context. The finding indicates that children judge others from a holistic perspective of what being moral really means. In their view, a single action that is at odds with one aspect of a “good” representation implies that the individual should be expected to violate other moral principles.</p>



<p>But there’s a catch — it turns out that seeing an individual mistreating someone else does not <em>always</em> cause children to expect them to behave immorally in the future. The researchers saw this when they repeated their experiment, except this time the toddlers first witnessed a dog puppet mistreating a rabbit (as opposed to a fellow dog) before watching the dog share out a pair of toys. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In this scenario, toddlers gazed longer when the dog went on to make an unequal sharing decision, suggesting that they still expected the puppet to be fair. Only when the researchers ensured that the dog engaged in <em>three </em>sequential acts of bullying towards the rabbit did the children’s gaze patterns suggest that they no longer expected it to act fairly in the next social interaction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While this outcome is not entirely surprising (other studies have documented children <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/31/8199">expecting others to give their in-group members special treatment</a>), the present study is the first to discover something profound about the way children make their moral judgements, flawed as they might be. That is, the moral principles that children use do not operate in arbitrary isolation. They stem from a core mental representation of what makes someone a moral person.&nbsp;Whether this representation is “hardwired” or amenable to changes through development, experience, and age is an exciting question for future research to address.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier ice shelf could collapse within five years</a></h4>

              
                <p>The demise of a West Antarctic glacier poses the world’s biggest threat to raise sea levels before 2100 — and an ice shelf that’s holding it back from the sea could collapse within three to five years, scientists reported December 13 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in New Orleans.</p>



<p>Thwaites Glacier is “one of the largest, highest glaciers in Antarctica — it’s huge,” Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the Boulder, Colo.–based Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, told reporters. Spanning 120 kilometers across, the glacier is roughly the size of Florida, and were the whole thing to fall into the ocean, it would raise sea levels by 65 centimeters, or more than two feet. Right now, its melting is responsible for about 4 percent of global sea level rise.</p>



<p>But a large portion of the glacier is about to lose its tenuous grip on the seafloor, and that will dramatically speed up its seaward slide, the researchers said. Since about 2004, the eastern third of Thwaites has been braced by a floating ice shelf, an extension of the glacier that juts out into the sea. Right now, the underbelly of that ice shelf is lodged against an underwater mountain located about 50 kilometers offshore. That pinning point is essentially helping to hold the whole mass of ice in place.</p>



<p>But data collected by researchers beneath and around the shelf in the last two years suggests that brace won’t hold much longer. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">Warm ocean waters</a> are inexorably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-warm-water-sea-level-climate">eating away at the ice</a> from below (<em>SN: 4/9/21; SN: 9/9/20</em>). As the glacier’s ice shelf loses mass, it’s retreating inland, and will eventually retreat completely behind the underwater mountain pinning it in place. Meanwhile, fractures and crevasses, widened by these waters, are swiftly snaking through the ice like cracks in a car’s windshield, shattering and weakening it.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This deadly punch-jab-uppercut combination of melting from below, ice shattering and losing its grip on the pinning point <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/978762">is pushing the ice shelf to imminent collapse</a>, within as little as three to five years, said Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. And “the collapse of this ice shelf will result in a direct increase in sea level rise, pretty rapidly,” Pettit added. “It’s a little bit unsettling.”</p>



<p>Satellite data show that over the last 30 years, the flow of Thwaites Glacier across land and toward the sea has nearly doubled in pace. The collapse of this “Doomsday Glacier” alone would alter sea levels significantly, but its fall would also destabilize other West Antarctic glaciers, dragging more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels even more.</p>



<p>That makes Thwaites “the most important place to study for near-term sea level rise,” Scambos said. So in 2018, researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom embarked on a joint five-year project to intensively study the glacier and try to anticipate its imminent future by planting instruments atop, within, below it as well as offshore of it.</p>



<p>This pull-out-all-the-stops approach to studying Thwaites is leading to other rapid discoveries, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/951416">including the first observations of ocean and melting conditions right at a glacier’s grounding zone</a>, where the land-based glacier begins to jut out into a floating ice shelf. Scientists have also spotted how the rise and fall of ocean tides can speed up melting, by pumping warm waters farther beneath the ice and creating new melt channels and crevasses in the underside of the ice.</p>

<p>As Thwaites and other glaciers retreat inland, some scientists have pondered whether they might form very tall cliffs of ice along the edge of the ocean — and the potential tumble of such massive blocks of ice into the sea could lead to devastatingly rapid sea level rise, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-sheets-collapse-sea-level-rise-climate-change">a hypothesis known as marine ice cliff instability</a> (<em>SN: 2/6/19</em>). How likely researchers say such a collapse is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-practically-irreversible-antarctic-melting">depends on our understanding of the physics and dynamics of ice behavior</a>, something about which scientists have historically known very little (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>).</p>



<p>The Thwaites collaboration is also tackling this problem. In simulations of the further retreat of Thwaites, glaciologist Anna Crawford of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and her colleagues found that if the shape of the land beneath the glacier dips deep enough in some places, that could lead to some very tall ice cliffs — but, they found, the ice itself might also deform and thin enough to make tall ice cliff formation difficult.</p>



<p>The collaboration is only at its halfway point now, but these data already promise to help scientists better estimate the near-term future of Thwaites, including how quickly and dramatically it might fall, Scambos said. “We’re watching a world that’s doing things we haven’t really seen before, because we’re pushing on the climate extremely rapidly with carbon dioxide emissions,” he added. “It’s daunting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pulsar-dead-stars-general-relativity-einstein">The only known pulsar duo sheds new light on general relativity and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>The only known duo of pulsars has just revealed a one-of-a-kind heap of cosmic insights.</p>



<p>For over 16 years, scientists have been observing the pair of pulsars, neutron stars that appear to pulsate. The measurements confirm Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, to new levels of precision, and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/a7077K4fR4216c02853742f061ca5a31085788a3e">hint at subtle effects</a> of the theory, physicists report in a paper published December 13 in <em>Physical Review </em>X.</p>



<p>Pulsars, spinning dead stars made of densely packed neutrons, appear to blink on and off due to their lighthouse-like beams of radiation that sweep past Earth at regular intervals. Variations in the timing of those pulses can expose pulsars’ movements and effects of general relativity. While physicists have found plenty of individual pulsars, there’s only one known pair orbiting one another. The 2003 discovery of the double-pulsar system, dubbed J0737-3039, opened up a new world of possible ways to test general relativity.</p>



<p>One of the pulsars whirls around roughly 44 times per second while the other spins about once every 2.8 seconds. The slower pulsar went dark in 2008, due to a quirk of general relativity that rotated its beams out of view. But researchers kept monitoring the remaining visible pulsar, combining that new data with older observations to improve the precision of their measurements.</p>





<p>Now, astrophysicist Michael Kramer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and colleagues have dropped an exhaustive paper that “just lays it all out,” says physicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville. “To me, it’s just magnificent.”</p>



<p>Here are five insights from the new study:</p>



<h4>1. Einstein was right, in so many ways.</h4>



<p>The pulsar duo allows for five independent tests of general relativity in one, checking whether various properties of the orbit match predictions of Einstein’s theory. For example, the researchers measure the rate at which the orbit’s ellipse rotates, or precesses, to see if it agrees with expectations. All of the parameters fell in line with Einstein.</p>



<p>What’s more, says astrophysicist Scott Ransom of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va., “each of the individual tests of general relativity have gotten so precise that … &nbsp;higher-order effects of general relativity have to be included to match the data.” That means that the measurements are so exacting that they hint at subtle peculiarities of gravity. “All of those things are really amazing,” says Ransom, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<h4>2. Gravitational waves are sapping energy.</h4>



<p>The observations reveal that the pulsars’ orbit is shrinking. By measuring how long the pulsars take to complete each orbit, the researchers determined that the pair get about seven millimeters closer every day.</p>



<p>That’s because, as they orbit, the pulsars <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pulsar-pair-ripples-spacetime">stir up gravitational waves</a>, ripples in spacetime that vibrate outward, carrying away energy (<em>SN: 12/18/15</em>). This telltale shrinkage was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/indirect-evidence-gravity-waves">seen for the first time</a> in the 1970s in a system with one pulsar and one neutron star, providing early evidence for gravitational waves (<em>SN: 12/16/78</em>). But the new result is 25 times as precise as the earlier measurement.</p>



<h4>3. The pulsar is losing mass and that matters.</h4>



<p>There’s a subtler effect that tweaks that orbit, too. Pulsars gradually slow down over time, losing rotational energy. And because energy and mass are two sides of the same coin, that means the faster pulsar is losing about 8 million metric tons per second.</p>



<p>“When I realized that for the first time, it really blew me away,” says Kramer. Although it sounds like a lot, that mass loss equates to only a tiny adjustment of the orbit. Previously, scientists could neglect this effect in calculations because the tweak was so small. But the measurement of the orbit is now precise enough that it makes sense to include.</p>



<h4>4. We can tell which way the pulsar spins and that hints at its origins.</h4>



<p>By studying the timing of the pulses as the light from one pulsar passes by its companion, scientists can tell in what direction the faster pulsar is spinning. The results indicate that the pulsar rotates in the same direction as it orbits, and that provides clues to how the pulsar duo formed.</p>



<p>The two pulsars began as neighboring stars that exploded, one after the other. Often when a star explodes, the remnant it leaves behind gets kicked away, splitting apart such pairs. The fact that the faster pulsar spins in the same direction it orbits means the explosion that formed it didn’t give it much of a jolt, helping to explain how the union stayed intact.</p>



<h4>5. We have a clue to the pulsar’s radius.</h4>



<p>Gravitational effects are known to cause the orbit’s ellipse to precess, or rotate, by about 17 degrees per year. But there’s a subtle tweak that becomes relevant in the new study. The pulsar drags the fabric of spacetime behind it as it spins, like a twirling dancer’s twisting skirt, altering that precession.</p>



<p>This dragging effect implies that the faster pulsar’s radius must be less than 22 kilometers, an estimate that, if made more precise with future work, could help unveil the physics of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-stars-pulsar-density-diameter-matter">extremely dense neutron star matter</a> that makes up pulsars (<em>SN: 4/20/21</em>).</p>



<p>“The authors have clearly been very meticulous in their study of this amazing system,” says astrophysicist Victoria Kaspi of McGill University in Montreal. “It is wonderful to see that the double pulsar … indeed is living up to its unique promise.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-neutron-star-black-hole">The cosmic ‘Cow’ may have produced a new neutron star or black hole</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cosmic flare-up called the Cow seems to have left behind a black hole or neutron star.</p>



<p>When the flash was spotted in June 2018, astronomers debated its origins. Now, astrophysicist DJ Pasham of MIT and colleagues have seen the first direct evidence of what the Cow left behind. “We may be seeing the birth of a black hole or neutron star,” Pasham says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The burst’s official, random designation is AT2018cow, but astronomers affectionately dubbed it the Cow. The light originated about 200 million light-years away and was 10 times as bright as an ordinary supernova, the explosion that marks the death of a massive star.</p>



<p>Astronomers thought the flare-up could have been from an unusual star being eaten by a black hole or from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cow-may-be-strange-supernova">weird sort of supernova</a> that left behind a black hole or neutron star (<em>SN: 6/21/19</em>).</p>





<p>So Pasham and colleagues checked the Cow for flickering X-rays, which are typically produced close to a compact object, possibly in a disk of hot material around a black hole or on the surface of a neutron star.</p>



<p>Flickers in these X-rays can reveal the size of their source. The Cow’s X-rays flicker roughly every 4 milliseconds, meaning the object that produces them must be no more than 1,000 kilometers wide. Only a neutron star or a black hole <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01524-8">fits the bill</a>, Pasham and colleagues report December 13 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Because the Cow’s flash was from the explosion that produced either of these objects, a preexisting black hole was probably not responsible for the burst. Pasham admits he was hoping for a black hole eating an exotic star. “I was a little bit disappointed,” he says. “But I’m more blown away that this could be direct evidence of the birth of a black hole. This is an even cooler result.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">2021 research reinforced that mating across groups drove human evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Evidence that cross-continental Stone Age networking events powered human evolution ramped up in 2021.</p>



<p>A long-standing argument that <em>Homo sapiens</em> originated in East Africa before moving elsewhere and replacing Eurasian <em>Homo</em> species such as Neandertals has come under increasing fire over the last decade. Research this year supported an alternative scenario in which <em>H. sapiens</em> evolved across vast geographic expanses, first within Africa and later outside it.</p>



<p>The process would have worked as follows: Many <em>Homo</em> groups lived during a period known as the Middle Pleistocene, about 789,000 to 130,000 years ago, and were too closely related to have been distinct species. These groups would have occasionally mated with each other while traveling through Africa, Asia and Europe. A variety of skeletal variations on a human theme emerged among far-flung communities. Human anatomy and DNA today include remnants of that complex networking legacy, proponents of this scenario say.</p>



<p>It’s not clear precisely how often or when during this period groups may have mixed and mingled. But in this framework, no clear genetic or physical dividing line separated Middle Pleistocene folks usually classed as <em>H. sapiens</em> from Neandertals, Denisovans and other ancient <em>Homo</em> populations.</p>





<p>“Middle Pleistocene <em>Homo</em> groups were humans,” says paleoanthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Today’s humans are a remix of those ancient ancestors.”</p>



<p>New fossil evidence in line with that idea came from Israel. Braincase pieces and a lower jaw containing a molar tooth unearthed at a site called Nesher Ramla date to between about 140,000 and 120,000 years ago. These finds’ features suggest that a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/israel-fossil-new-hominid-nesher-ramla-homo-human-evolution">previously unknown Eurasian <em>Homo</em> population lived at the site</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/24/21</em>), a team led by paleoanthropologist Israel Hershkovitz of Tel&nbsp;Aviv University reported. The fossils were found with stone tools that look like those fashioned around the same time by Middle Easterners typically classified as <em>H. sapiens</em>, suggesting that the two groups culturally mingled and possibly mated.</p>



<p>Interactions like these may have facilitated enough mating among mobile <em>Homo</em> populations to prevent Nesher Ramla inhabitants and other Eurasian groups from evolving into separate species, Hershkovitz proposed.</p>



<p>But another report provided a reminder that opinions still vary about whether Middle Pleistocene <em>Homo</em> evolution featured related populations that all belonged to the same species or distinct species. Researchers studying the unusual mix of features of a roughly 146,000-year-old Chinese skull dubbed it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals">a new species, <em>Homo longi</em></a> (<em>SN Online: 6/25/21</em>). After reviewing that claim, however, another investigator grouped the skull, nicknamed Dragon Man, with several other Middle Pleistocene <em>Homo</em> fossils from northern China.</p>



<p>If so, Dragon Man — like Nesher Ramla <em>Homo</em> — may hail from one of many closely related <em>Homo</em> lines that occasionally mated with each other as some groups moved through Asia, Africa and Europe. From this perspective, Middle Pleistocene <em>Hom</em>o groups evolved unique traits during periods of isolation and shared features as a result of crossing paths and mating.</p>

<p>Back-and-forth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arabia-stone-age-tools-humans-migration-green-lakes-desert">migrations by <em>Homo</em> groups between Africa and Asia</a> started at least 400,000 years ago, discoveries in Saudi Arabia suggest (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 7</em>). Monsoon rains periodically turned what’s now desert into a green passageway covered by lakes, wetlands and rivers, reported archaeologist Huw Groucutt of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and colleagues. Each of five ancient lake beds identified at a Saudi site once hosted hunter-gatherers who left behind stone tools.</p>



<p>Occupations occurred intermittently between about 400,000 and 55,000 years ago. By about 200,000 years ago, stone tools at one of the lake beds resembled those made around the same time by <em>H. sapiens</em> in northeastern Africa. Some of those Africans may have stopped for a bit in a green Arabia before trekking into southwestern Asia, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>Either <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals made stone tools unearthed in the youngest lake bed. Neandertals inhabited parts of the Middle East by around 70,000&nbsp;years ago and could have reached a well-watered Arabia by 55,000 years ago. If that’s what happened, Neandertals may have mated with <em>H. sapiens</em> already there, Groucutt speculates.</p>



<p>Although Arabian hookups have yet to be detected in ancient DNA, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">European Neandertals and <em>H. sapiens</em> mated surprisingly often</a> around 45,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 7</em>), other scientists reported. DNA extracted from <em>H. sapiens</em> fossils of that age found in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic indicates that these ancient individuals possessed between about 2 percent and 4 percent Neandertal ancestry, a large amount considering <em>H. sapiens</em> migrants had only recently arrived in Europe.</p>



<p>So even after the Middle Pleistocene, networking among ancient <em>Homo</em> groups may have helped make us who we are today.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/12/13/we-mistake-information-weve-googled-for-our-own-knowledge/">We Mistake Information We’ve Googled For Our Own Knowledge</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>In many ways, the internet has democratised knowledge, allowing people to access more information than they could possibly dream of reading. No matter where your interests lie, there is almost certainly something new to learn online.</p>



<p>But is this immediately accessible trove of information making us confused about what knowledge is ours and what is the internet’s? According to a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2105061118">new paper</a>, it might be. Authored by Adrian F. Ward of University of Texas at Austin and published in <em>PNAS</em>, the series of eight studies finds that those searching online are sometimes unable to distinguish what knowledge belongs to them and what belongs to the internet — and that it could even cause unwarranted overconfidence in our future attempts to remember things.</p>



<span id="more-44820"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants answered ten general knowledge questions, either by themselves or with the help of Google. They then completed measures of self-esteem in relation to memory, agreeing or disagreeing with statements on ability to remember (“I have a better memory than most people”), process (“I am smart”), and access (“When I don’t know the answer to a question, I know where to find it”) information.</p>



<p>Participants who used Google unsurprisingly answered significantly more questions correctly than those who relied on their memory — and they were, again unsurprisingly, more confident in their ability to access external knowledge. But, importantly, they were also significantly more confident in their own memory, suggesting that using Google or other search engines can make people feel more capable.</p>



<p>In another study, participants who completed the test with the help of Google predicted that they would perform better on a second test, during which they would have no access to any external knowledge at all, than those who hadn’t used Google. However, these participants didn’t perform any better in reality, suggesting that access to the internet can generate unwarranted confidence in knowledge and memory.</p>



<p>In a further experiment, a new condition was introduced in which participants were asked to write down their own answers before searching online. Compared to participants who used Google as normal, these participants were significantly less confident in their own memory and less likely to assume they would know the answers in future, suggesting this extra step had prevented mistakes usually made when we search online.</p>



<p>Next, an experiment looked at how knowledge attribution changes based on the difficulty of questions, with participants randomly assigned to answer easy, medium or hard questions with or without Google. Once again, those who answered moderately difficult questions were significantly more confident in their knowledge after using Google than after answering questions on their own, and also believed they were smarter and had a better memory, and that they would do well in the future without the help of a search engine. However, using Google had no effect for people answering easy questions, and only affected predictions about future performance for people answering hard questions. The team suggests we know with more certainty whether or not we know the answers to easy or hard questions, while those of medium difficulty are harder to gauge.</p>



<p>In a final study, participants again answered general knowledge questions using both their memory and Google or Wikipedia; those in the Wikipedia condition were sent a direct link to the relevant information. After a short break, participants were shown the same questions again plus extra, new questions, and were again asked whether or not they had answered it from their own internal knowledge, the internet, or whether it was new. Participants who used Google were far more likely to misattribute external knowledge to internal knowledge, as they had in previous studies, than those who had used Wikipedia. This suggests that people experience the accessing of information differently via search than they do from a more formal repository of information.</p>



<p>Overall, the studies don’t suggest particularly good things about our grasp on our own knowledge and memory. On a basic level, this may not be too much of an issue — most of the time we can still access the internet when we need to look something up. But these distortions may cause us to learn less effectively when we do come across new knowledge that we need to keep hold of, assuming we already know it rather than seeing it as novel information worth hanging onto.</p>



<p>The team proposes this merging of human and online knowledge might not be such a bad thing, anyway: “perhaps this union will give rise to an ‘Intermind’ — a cognitive entity that is more and greater than the sum of its parts”. This Intermind is probably a few years away yet — but it might at least ease some of the guilt the next time you use your phone to sneak a look at a pub quiz answer.</p>

<p>And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as no one is getting hurt!</p>
<p>When I heard about outreachy, an internship that welcomes total beginners that was a very good motivation and the stipends?? Free mentoring from professionals? This was definitely my chance to broaden my scope.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-flying-mars-perseverance-nasa">Ingenuity is still flying on Mars. Here’s what the helicopter is up to</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Ingenuity Mars helicopter was never supposed to last this long. NASA engineers built and tested the first self-powered aircraft to fly on another planet to answer a simple question: Could the helicopter fly at all? The goal was to take five flights in 30 Martian days or break the aircraft trying.</p>



<p>But more than 120 Martian days past that experiment window, Ingenuity is still flying and doing things no one ever expected. The helicopter, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">took its first flight on April 19</a>, is breaking its own records for distance and speed (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>). It’s helping the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover explore Jezero crater</a>, near an ancient river delta that may hold signs of past Martian life (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). And Ingenuity is coping with changing seasons and navigating over rough terrain, two things that the flier wasn’t designed to do.</p>



<p>“It’s gotten into a good groove,” says Ingenuity’s original chief engineer Bob Balaram NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif. “It’s in its element and having fun.”</p>



<p>Here’s what Ingenuity has been up to on Mars.</p>





<h4>Testing the limits</h4>



<p>Ingenuity is flying farther, faster and higher than it did in its first few flights. The helicopter has lifted itself a maximum of 12 meters above the Martian surface, zipped along at up to five meters per second (about half as fast as record-setting sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner) and covered 625 meters (about a third the length of the Kentucky Derby) in a single flight. These extremes give engineers valuable information about the limits of flying on Mars.</p>



<p>“We are still trying to learn lessons,” says JPL robotics engineer Teddy Tzanetos, a team leader for the Ingenuity mission. “Flight after flight, we’re learning the boundaries of performance.”</p>

</div><figcaption>The Ingenuity craft is now flying over untested, rough Martian terrain. During the helicopter’s 13th flight, on September 4, Ingenuity (indicated with the white circle in the video above) took pictures of a rocky outcrop from multiple angles. NASA’s Perseverance rover filmed the flight.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Early on, Ingenuity tested its limits in a way that the flight team really didn’t plan for. During its sixth flight on May 22, the helicopter’s navigation system suffered a glitch that made it roll and sway alarmingly.</p>



<p>The helicopter’s navigation software keeps track of the craft’s position by taking an image, reading the time stamp on that image and predicting what the camera should see next based on landmarks from previous photos that Ingenuity took. If the next image doesn’t match that prediction, the software corrects the helicopter’s position and velocity to match up better.</p>



<p>Less than a minute into the May 22 flight, a single image got lost on its way from Ingenuity’s cameras to its onboard computer. That meant that the time stamps on all subsequent images were a little off. In trying to correct what it perceived as errors, Ingenuity “went on a wild joyride,” Balaram says.</p>



<p>Luckily, the helicopter touched down safely within five meters of its intended landing spot. The anomaly was a blessing in disguise, Balaram says. It put the helicopter through extremes of movement — “how aggressively you can move the joystick, if you will” — that the engineers would not have asked it to do on purpose, and did perfectly fine, he says.</p>



<p>“It’s a serendipitous thing that we got that flight experience under our belt,” Balaram says. “We have much more confidence in the vehicle.”</p>



<h4>Doing science</h4>



<p>Originally, the helicopter team wanted to push the vehicle until it broke. But now the researchers are flying more cautiously and less often. That’s because the helicopter is currently <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">supporting the Perseverance rover</a> in doing science (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>“We’re no longer in the Month of Ingenuity,” Tzanetos says. “We’re a small part of a much larger team.”</p>



<p>The helicopter has already proven its worth by telling the rover where not to go. Ingenuity’s ninth flight, on July 5, took the helicopter over a dune field called South Séítah that would have been difficult for the rover to drive through safely. Then, Ingenuity photographed some rock outcrops and raised ridges in South Séítah that had looked interesting in images taken from an orbiting spacecraft. Scientists thought those ridges could record some of the deepest water environments in the lake that filled the crater long ago.</p>

<p>In 3-D images from the helicopter, it turned out that those ridges did not show the layers that would have indicated that the rocks formed in deep water. The rover team decided to move on, saving Perseverance a long, arduous and potentially dangerous drive.</p>



<p>“They didn’t have to send the rover all the way to this particular target, and then realize, hey, this may not be the highest priority thing,” Balaram says.</p>



<p>Scouting for the rover has also taken Ingenuity over terrain that the helicopter wasn’t designed to understand. Ingenuity’s navigation software was programmed to assume that the ground beneath it is always flat because that was the type of terrain selected for that experimental first month of flight demonstrations.</p>



<p>“It was a perfectly reasonable simplification for a technology demonstration,” Balaram says. “But it was baked in. And now you’re stuck with a system with a flat ground assumption.”</p>



<p>When the helicopter is flying over a sloped surface, some features seem to move faster in its view than they would if the ground were flat, giving the helicopter a false sense of its motion. “The onboard navigation has no way of explaining it, except for thinking maybe I’m turning or spinning a bit,” Balaram says. The helicopter ends up veering to the side.</p>



<p>The team has come up with some work-arounds, such as choosing large enough landing zones that a precision landing isn’t necessary and slowing down when flying over rough terrain.</p>



<h4>Coping with seasons</h4>



<p>The air on Mars is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">notoriously thin</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>). But since mid-September, the atmosphere in Jezero crater has been getting even thinner. As that part of Mars shifts from spring to summer, the air density has gone from about 1.5 percent of Earth’s at sea level, to about 1 percent.</p>



<p>That doesn’t sound like a big difference, but it’s enough that Ingenuity has had to spin its rotor blades faster to stay aloft. In October, the helicopter increased its rotor speed to 2,700 revolutions per minute, compared with a previous maximum of 2,537 rpm.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="3106612" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/120821_lg_ingenuity_inline2" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/120821_lg_ingenuity_inline2.jpg" data-orig-size="680,510" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="120821_lg_ingenuity_inline2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity has to spin its rotors faster to cope with thinner air during the Martian summer compared with spring.

<p>At that faster spin speed, the helicopter can fly for only 130 seconds at a time instead of the 170 seconds it managed before, without running the risk of the motors overheating.</p>



<p>That would be fine if the helicopter was just going to hang around the rover in one area, Tzanetos says. But the Mars duo’s next task is a race to the long-dry river delta at the mouth of Jezero crater. The Perseverance team hopes to cover hundreds of meters each Martian day. The farthest Ingenuity has covered in a day is 625 meters, and that was with the lower spin speed.</p>



<p>“It’ll be challenging to keep up,” Tzanetos says.</p>



<p>There’s no technical reason why Ingenuity can’t make it, though, Balaram says. “It’s certainly possible that one day it just won’t wake up. Or a landing will be a failure and we’ll never hear from it again because it tipped over,” he admits. “Those are rolls of the dice, there’s nothing inevitable about those. Barring that, it should keep working for many months.”</p>



<h4>Inspiring future fliers</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, engineers are already dreaming of the next Martian aircraft.</p>



<p>“Ingenuity is very exciting, we’re breaking a lot of ground,” Tzanetos says. “The whole point of it is to be that foundation. The important thing is what comes next.”</p>



<p>Current blueprints include a scaled-up version of Ingenuity that could carry more equipment and work alone or with a rover, and a large hexacopter, with six rotors arranged around a central ring. A craft like that could cover more ground more quickly than a rover, traveling distances that could take Perseverance multiple years in just a few months.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i361/release/1">white paper</a> submitted to the 2023–2032 planetary science and astrobiology decadal survey — a once-a-decade review of the fields’ goals and priorities — suggests several possible missions for a Mars Science Helicopter. In one, the craft could take samples of clay minerals at a site like Mawrth Vallis, a channel thought to be carved by a long-ago flood.</p>

<p>Mawrth was a finalist for the last two Mars rover landing sites and is a contender for the European Space Agency’s Rosalind Franklin rover, set to launch in 2022. Clays can preserve organic material on Earth, so a mission to Mawrth could search for signs of life.</p>



<p>A helicopter could also explore craters with water ice deposits with slopes too steep for rover wheels. And by taking measurements at several different altitudes, the helicopter could help figure out how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-molecules-upper-atmosphere-chemical-reactions">atmosphere exchanges gases with the ground</a>, which could help solve the mystery of when and how Mars lost its liquid water (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>). Or a helicopter could map the magnetic field of large swaths of the Martian surface, revealing when and how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-nasa-insight-lander-learned-about-mars-magnetism-quakes">Red Planet lost its molten core </a>(<em>SN: 2/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>And whenever astronauts get around to visiting Mars, “it might be useful to have fleets of drones zipping around the skies, carrying loads or scouting ahead,” Tzanetos says. “That’s the exciting future I’m looking forward to.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">For 50 years, CT scans have saved lives, revealed beauty and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>One grainy, gray-scale image of a brain changed science and medicine forever.</p>



<p>Half a century ago, the first CT image of a patient lifted the veil of invisibility that cloaks the interior of the human body, providing scientists a window on our innards unlike any before. </p>



<p>Today, doctors in the United States alone order more than 80 million scans per year. X-ray computed tomography, or CT, is frequently the quickest way of getting a handle on what’s causing a mysterious woe. CT scans can ferret out heart disease, tumors, blood clots, fractures, internal bleeding and more. The technique can give surgeons a heads-up about what they will encounter inside a patient, and guide treatment for cancer and other diseases.</p>



<p>“It answers so many questions quickly. That’s why it’s used,” says medical physicist Cynthia McCollough of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p>





<p>A CT scan involves thousands of X-ray measurements taken from multiple angles. Here’s how it works: A source of X-rays rotates around the body, sending a beam of radiation through bone, blood and tissue, while rotating detectors measure the beam that makes it through.</p>



<p>Different materials in the body absorb X-rays differently. The calcium in bone vigorously sops up X-rays, for example, while soft tissues absorb less. So when the data collected by the detectors are stitched together by a computer, it can form a cross-sectional view of what’s inside based on where X-rays are absorbed more or less. Moving the table holding the patient so that the X-ray beam and detectors slide along the body enables 3-D reconstructions of organs and other parts.</p>





<p>Over the years, scientists have continually improved the technology, making it faster and higher resolution, and cutting the amount of radiation that patients receive. These improved CT scans have painted ever more detailed landscapes of the human body. It’s hard not to marvel at the beauty of the inner world that the scans bring to the surface.</p>



<p>Here’s a look back at some of the major advances in CT scans over the last 50 years.</p>



<h4>The CT scan is born</h4>



<p>In 1971, radiologist James Ambrose at Atkinson Morley Hospital in London performed the first CT scan of a patient in collaboration with engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, the technology’s inventor. Hounsfield worked for the British electronics company EMI, best known for its role as the record company for the Beatles.</p>

<p>The scan, an image just 80 pixels across and 80 pixels wide, didn’t provide a lot of detail. But it showcased the technology’s potential, revealing a tumor in a woman’s brain. A surgeon who later operated on the tumor is said to have marveled that “it looks exactly like the picture.”</p>



<p>Previously, if doctors wanted to look for a brain tumor, they injected air into the spinal column. Then they rotated the patient to allow the air to bubble up into the area around the brain to increase the contrast in standard X-ray images. The procedure “hurt like heck,” McCollough says. “Patients routinely vomited; it was like torture.” With CT scanning, that agony soon became a thing of the past.</p>



<h4>Any way you slice it</h4>



<p>At first, CT scanners were designed to image only the brain. But researchers quickly adapted the technology to take cross-sectional images, or slices, at various points along the body. Then, in the early 1990s, scanners were created in which the X-ray source scanned in a continuous spiral around the body, instead of taking individual cross-sections. That advance allowed a whole organ, such as the lungs, to be imaged in one go.</p>

<p>But the image resolution along the length of the body was still low. CT scanners with multiple rows of X-ray detectors solved this problem by imaging several slices of the body at once along the spiral path.</p>



<p>CT scanner manufacturers kept pushing up the number of detectors, making scanners that could capture more slices at once. When detectors hit 64 slices in the early 2000s, McCollough says, “the real ‘Wow’ happened.” Scans could be fast, high resolution and cover a significant length of the body, all at once. Today, scanners are even more sophisticated, using up to 320 slices.</p>



<p>Finally, the fragile complexity hidden inside the human body — from the intricate webs of blood vessels to the gracefully branching air passages of the lungs to the delicate yet sturdy structure of bone — was there for all to see.</p>



<h4>Doubling up</h4>



<p>When McCollough’s father-in-law landed in the emergency room with a painful wrist, he languished for hours while doctors tried to figure out what was wrong. Eventually, McCollough remembers, she asked, “Can’t we send him over to CT?”</p>



<p>Thanks to a technique called dual-energy CT, doctors were able to pinpoint the problem. Dual-energy CT, introduced in 2006, uses two beams of X-rays at different energies, instead of just one beam. Taking images this way allows the scanners to work out exactly what materials are within. Different materials absorb X-rays in different amounts, but in order to zero in on a specific type of material, you want to know how that absorption changes as the X-rays’ energy changes.</p>



<p>For example, dual-energy CT can distinguish between different types of crystals that can form in the joints, causing arthritis. Urate crystals indicate gout, and crystals containing calcium point to pseudogout. For McCollough’s father-in-law, the scan quickly uncovered the cause of his pain: pseudogout. In this way, CT scans can reveal the human body at its most basic level, the materials that make it up.</p>

<h4>Count on it</h4>



<p>The X-ray detectors in CT scanners are the “secret sauce” of the technology, McCollough says, because the detectors are how the machines measure the X-rays in the first place. Most CT scanners measure that radiation indirectly, first converting the X-rays into visible light and then converting that light into an electric signal. A new era of CT technology is cutting out the middleman. In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration OK’d the first “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-major-imaging-device-advancement-computed-tomography-nearly-decade">photon-counting</a>” CT scanner.</p>



<p>X-rays are a type of high-energy light, and like all light, they are made up of particles called photons. Photon-counting CT scanners measure individual X-ray photons. The technology also allows for crisper, more detailed images and provides a measure of the energies of the photons, which, like dual-energy CT, identifies different materials inside the body.</p>

<h4>Beyond the (human) body</h4>



<p>CT scans may have been invented for medicine, but that didn’t stop other researchers from recognizing the technology’s usefulness. Scientists in fields including archaeology, biology and physics have harnessed the technology to better understand everything from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">mummified remains</a> (<em>SN: 8/</em><em>20/20</em>) to how cracks form in concrete to the anatomy of animals such as the earless monitor lizard (<em>Lanthanotus borneensis</em>).</p>

<p>This image of <em>L. borneensis </em>comes from the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. Researchers there are making 20,000 CT datasets of preserved specimens that represent every vertebrate genus housed in U.S. natural history collections to reveal the animals’ internal anatomy. Anyone in the world <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/overt/">will be able to access these scans</a> online.</p>



<h4>The next 50 years</h4>



<p>Despite all of these advances, some researchers caution that physicians’ <a href="https://acpinternist.org/archives/2011/02/CT.htm">love affair with CT has gone too far</a>, at least in the United States, where the scans are used more often than in many other countries. Unneeded CT scans can have drawbacks: They may uncover unrelated findings that look concerning but are probably benign, which could lead to expensive and anxiety-inducing additional testing. But foregoing CT scans can also have negative impacts, by slowing diagnoses for ailments that resolve best if treated quickly.</p>

<p>There’s no denying that, when warranted, CT scans are a crucial, lifesaving part of the medical toolkit. Recently, the scans have been in the spotlight for revealing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-some-patients-may-suffer-lasting-lung-damage">damage done to the lungs by COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 4/27/20</em>). The technology seems poised to remain a mainstay of medicine and science in future decades, continuing to scan its way into our hearts, lungs, brains and everywhere else.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tropical-forest-recovery-ecosystem">Cleared tropical forests can regain ground surprisingly fast</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tropical forests are disappearing at an alarming clip across the globe. As lush land is cleared for agriculture, climate-warming carbon gets released and biodiversity declines.&nbsp;But when farmland is left alone, nature can make a surprisingly quick comeback.</p>



<p>After just 20 years, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3629">forests can recover</a> by nearly 80 percent in certain key areas, including biodiversity and soil health, researchers report in the Dec. 10 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">existing forests intact</a> is crucial for curbing climate change and stemming species loss (<em>SN: 7/13/21</em>), says ecologist Lourens Poorter of Wageningen University in the Netherlands. But this research shows “there&#8217;s tremendous [climate] mitigation potential” in letting forests regenerate.</p>



<p>Land cleared of tropical forests often is abandoned after a few years of low-intensity agricultural use, Poorter says, allowing nature to creep back in. To see how such areas recover, he and colleagues studied 77 sites across the Americas and West Africa that are regrowing forests that vary in age. Using 51 old-growth sites, those that show no signs of human use in at least 100 years, as a baseline, the researchers investigated 12 forest attributes related to soil health, ecosystem functioning, forest structure and plant biodiversity, analyzing how quickly those things recovered.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>On the mend</h3>



<p>Tropical forests can re-establish themselves on abandoned agricultural lands faster than expected, recovering by nearly 80 percent on average in just 20 years, new research suggests. But different forest attributes, related to soil (red), diversity (orange) and structure (blue), recover at different rates. Soil carbon and nitrogen levels rapidly recovered, reaching levels close to those found in old-growth forests in about 20 years. Plant species richness, or the number of species, in regrowing forests takes longer to come close to old-growth levels — about 40 years — while species composition, or the relative abundances of those species, takes more than a century. Likewise, total aboveground biomass will take 120 years to approach old-growth levels, the scientists estimate. </p>

<p>Soil bounced back fastest, its carbon and nitrogen levels nearly reaching those of old-growth forests within a decade after abandonment. After 38 years, regrowing forests had nearly as many plant species on average as similar old-growth forests, though it will take 120 years for the relative abundances of the species to rebound to 90 percent of old-growth levels, the researchers estimate. Total aboveground biomass will also take 120 years to near untouched forest levels, the data suggest.</p>



<p>Overall, “recovery was way faster than we expected it to be,” Poorter says. Seeds and stumps that remained after clearing probably accelerated the process. Recovery time could be slower on land that has experienced more intense agricultural use, he says, but protecting regrowing forests can be a “cheap, natural solution,” to help address the climate and biodiversity crises.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>It’s natural to start a new year with plans to make this one better than the last. But if you are thinking about how to boost your wellbeing, it’s worth knowing that some &#8220;good&#8221; ways of living have dark sides, too…</p>



<span id="more-44857"></span>



<p><strong>Happiness</strong></p>



<p>People who are happy — who enjoy &#8220;hedonistic wellbeing&#8221; — experience plenty of positive emotions and are generally pretty satisfied with life. If this sounds like something worth aiming for, then a word of caution: there’s plenty of evidence that striving to be happier can backfire. The authors of an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691611406927">influential review article</a> published in <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em> back in 2011 concluded that while some of the strategies recommended for boosting happiness — such as taking time in the day to reflect on what you are grateful for — are far from bad in themselves, if you <em>expect</em> that they will make you feel noticeably happier, but find that they don’t, you can be left worse off than when you started. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-018-1436-7">More recently</a>, Aekyoung Kim and Sam Maglio from Rutgers concluded that people who pursue happiness can end up feeling that the time in the day to do what’s needed to achieve this is vanishing — which makes them more unhappy.</p>



<p>Two of the <a href="http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/files/2012/09/Fritz-Lyubomirsky-in-press-1.pdf">lessons from research in this area</a>: don’t start out with high expectations of how much happier you might become, and don’t feel that you should be devoting a lot of time to becoming happier. You might also want to look beyond happiness…</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Meaning&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Happiness is one dimension of wellbeing. But there’s also &#8220;eudaimonia&#8221; — the feeling that your life has meaning, and that you are reaching your potential.</p>



<p>No end of studies have highlighted the importance of meaning. In 2019, for example, Andrew Steptoe and Daisy Fancourt at UCL <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1207">published a study</a> in <em>PNAS </em>finding that people who felt more strongly that the things they did in their life were worthwhile — in other words, that their lives had meaning — were better off in all kinds of ways: socially, physically and emotionally. However, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917305044?casa_token=sMxTODbBLMYAAAAA:r6T4qjptPBJevsTlYWNoUr6KKBdjH-ifl77E43JNYXGEMeNY2764qX9wh5IztLsc_qcjh9YmPg">recent study</a> by David Lane and Eugene Mathes in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> revealed that there can be downsides to meaning, too. The team’s study of university students found that those who perceived education and relationships as being meaningful reported more positive emotion — but <em>also</em> a greater fear of failure. &#8220;These findings suggest that meaning in life may be associated with not only happiness, but also stress because of the worry over losing the meaningful experience,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t pursue meaningful experiences, of course. But it does suggest that it’s sensible to prepare for the possibility that doing so may cause you some anxiety, as well. Still, that might not be a bad thing…</p>



<p><strong>What is a good life, anyway?</strong></p>



<p>Research into what makes some people feel that theirs is a &#8220;good life&#8221; tends to focus on happiness and meaning. But last year, US-based psychologists Shigehiro Oshi and Erin Westgate argued that we’ve been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/14/weve-neglected-the-role-of-psychological-richness-when-considering-what-makes-a-good-life-study-argues/">missing a crucial third dimension: &#8220;psychological richness&#8221;</a>. A psychologically rich life is characterised by plenty of interesting and perspective-changing experiences. These need not be uniformly positive experiences. At their worst, they may even be traumatic at the time. When the researchers asked participants from nine different countries which type of life they would go for if they could only choose one, most chose &#8220;happy&#8221;, and &#8220;meaningful&#8221; came second, but there was a &#8220;substantial minority&#8221; of participants — ranging from 7% in Singapore to 17% in Germany — who said they would opt for a psychologically rich life <em>above</em> a happy or a meaningful one. For this group, at least, this most defines a &#8220;good life&#8221; for them. And anyone wanting to pursue this type of life should be prepared for difficulties, as well as great times, along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Mental calm<br></strong>Maybe you’re starting to wonder whether it would be better to set aside the grand pursuit of a good life, and aim for something else instead. Like feeling calmer, perhaps?</p>



<p>Mindfulness is often promoted as a way to achieve this. Indeed, there are plenty of studies finding that mindfulness can help even with mental health problems. However, as we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/12/the-psychology-of-mindfulness-digested/">first reported back in 2015</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/19/episode-15-is-mindfulness-a-panacea-or-overhyped-and-potentially-problematic/">later explored in episode 15 of our PsychCrunch podcast in 2019</a>, there are also reasons to be cautious. Mindfulness is not risk-free. For example, it <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/17/mindfulness-training-does-not-foster-empathy-and-can-even-make-narcissists-worse/">doesn’t necessarily foster empathy and can even make narcissists worse</a>, and while there is some work finding that it can improve decision-making, say, there’s also research concluding that it <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/20/mindfulness-meditation-increases-peoples-susceptibility-to-false-memories/">increases people’s susceptibility to false memories</a>.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was inevitable that something once so incredibly popular should experience a backlash. But if you haven’t tried mindfulness training before and are considering it for 2022, it’s worth knowing about the potential downsides, too.</p>



<p><strong>If all fails…</strong></p>



<p>If you do set yourself some goals for 2022, and find that you don’t quite achieve your hoped-for levels of happiness, meaning, psychological richness, calmness — or even &#8220;just&#8221; eating more healthily and exercising more — there is a way to mitigate the anxiety that might result. Earlier this year, we looked at the latest research on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/">how best to cope with failure</a>. The key recommendations included:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>Be kind to yourself&nbsp;</li><li>Resist socially prescribed perfectionism</li><li>Don’t worry too much if you were over-confident — and wrong</li><li>Try not to take evidence of failure too personally</li></ol>



<p>In fact, if you are looking for some evidence-based ways of going about boosting your wellbeing in 2022, maybe <em>this</em> is the place to start. Because all of us, at some point, set ourselves goals that we don’t quite meet. One option is to stop setting goals. Another is to learn how to cope when not all work out — so you can reap the benefits of those that do.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-toxic-ozone-urban-air-pollution-cities">Wildfire smoke may ramp up toxic ozone production in cities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Wildfire smoke and urban air pollution bring out the worst in each other.</p>



<p>As wildfires rage, they transform their burned fuel into a complex chemical cocktail of smoke. Many of these airborne compounds, including ozone, cause air quality to plummet as wind carries the smoldering haze over cities. But exactly how — and to what extent — wildfire emissions contribute to ozone levels downwind of the fires has been a matter of debate for years, says Joel Thornton, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>A new study has now revealed the elusive chemistry behind ozone production in wildfire plumes. The findings suggest that mixing wildfire smoke with nitrogen oxides — toxic gases found in car exhaust — could <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl3648">pump up ozone levels in urban areas</a>, researchers report December 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Atmospheric ozone is a major component of smog that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-air-pollution-ozone-shutdown">can trigger respiratory problems</a> in humans and wildlife (<em>SN: 1/4/21</em>). Many ingredients for making ozone — such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides — can be found in wildfire smoke, says Lu Xu, an atmospheric chemist currently at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Chemical Sciences Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. But a list of ingredients isn’t enough to replicate a wildfire’s ozone recipe. So Xu and colleagues took to the sky to observe the chemistry in action.</p>





<p>Through a joint project with NASA and NOAA, the researchers worked with the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality flight campaign to transform a jetliner into a flying laboratory. In July and August 2019, the flight team collected air samples from smoldering landscapes across the western United States. As the plane passed headlong through the plumes, instruments onboard recorded the kinds and amounts of each molecule detected in the haze. By weaving in and out of the smoke as it drifted downwind from the flames, the team also analyzed how the plume’s chemical composition changed over time.</p>



<p>Using these measurements along with the wind patterns and fuel from each wildfire sampled, the researchers created a straightforward equation to calculate ozone production from wildfire emissions. “We took a complex question and gave it a simple answer,” says Xu, who did the work while at Caltech.</p>



<p>As expected, the researchers found that wildfire emissions contain a dizzying array of organic compounds and nitrogen oxide species among other molecules that contribute to ozone formation. Yet their analysis showed that the concentration of nitrogen oxides decreases in the hours after the plume is swept downwind. Without this key ingredient, ozone production slows substantially. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Air pollution from cities and other urban areas is chock full of noxious gases. So when wildfire smoke wafts over cityscapes, a boost of nitrous oxides could jump-start ozone production again, Xu says.</p>



<p>In a typical fire season, mixes like these could increase ozone levels by as much as 3 parts per billion in the western United States, the researchers estimate. This concentration is far below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-04/documents/20151001healthfs.pdf">health safety standard</a> of 70 parts per billion, but the incremental increase could still pose a health risk to people who are regularly exposed to smoke, Xu says.</p>



<p>With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires, this new ozone production mechanism has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">important implications</a> for urban air quality, says Qi Zhang, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). She says the work provides an “important missing link” between wildfire emissions and ozone chemistry.</p>



<p>The findings may also pose a challenge for environmental policy makers, says Thornton, who was not involved in the research. Though state and local authorities set strict regulations to limit atmospheric ozone, wildfire smoke may undermine those strategies, he says. This could make it more difficult for cities, especially in the western United States, to meet EPA ozone standards despite air quality regulations.</p>

<p>Malaria is still a public health issue in the Brazilian Amazon and its transmission occurs in deforestation frontiers, the human-nature interface. Deforestation is the result of impoverished locals who undertake slash-and-burn activities on their own lands as a way of living. Clearings in patches of tropical rain forests create conditions for the larval habitats of the dominant malaria vector (<em>Anopheles darlingi</em>). When the anopheline larvae emerge into flying adults, adult females fly on seeking human hosts in the nearby houses. When these anopheline females bite a person carrying malaria parasites, they get infected and send propagating malaria parasites to the whole community.</p>

<p>Undertaking mosquito collections is an enormous task in the Amazonian settings. Every field plan must be reassessed as conditions turn out to change quickly during the days of field collection. Numerous methods for catching mosquitoes are used. One of them is the barrier screen (above) on which anophelines land and can be captured by us using small electric-powered aspirators. Field collections may last all night long (12 hours), which means everyone in the team has to stay awake during the night and sleep during the day.</p>
<p>Back in the lab with samples of anophelines, specimens are identified at the level of species and then tested for the presence of malaria parasites. Each malaria microcosm site has its landscape analyzed by remote sensing and satellite imagery from the initiation of colonization in the 1970s until now.</p>
<p>Altogether, 80 malaria microcosm sites all over the Amazon region were studied during our research project and the results have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85890-3">published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>.</p>
<p>The main results obtained were: (A) malaria risk is greater when accumulated deforestation reaches 50%, (B) two temporal malaria peaks occur: one at 10 years and a second at 35 years after settlement initiation.</p>

<p>Our results ultimately show that the loss of forest cover supports the transmission of human malarial parasites over time in the Amazon. These results can be translated to policies aimed at public health intervention designs for enhanced health of locals and in favor of conservation of tropical rain forests and education of locals for keeping the forest up, complying directly with <strong>SDG3 – Good health and well-being</strong> and <strong>SDG15 – Life on land</strong>. Translational science in our field of research depends heavily on policies that are implemented by the government. With the proof of concept and scientific evidence that could be obtained from this research project, it is more likely that these policies can come to life and help in sustaining <strong>good health and well-being</strong> and <strong>life on land</strong>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vulture-bees-gut-bacteria-eat-rotting-flesh-sick">Gut bacteria let vulture bees eat rotting flesh without getting sick</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mention foraging bees and most people will picture insects flitting from flower to flower in search of nectar. But in the jungles of Central and South America, “vulture bees” have developed a taste for decaying flesh.</p>



<p>They are “the weirdos of the bee world,” says insect biologist Jessica Maccaro of the University of California, Riverside. Most bees are vegetarian.</p>



<p>Scientists have puzzled over why the stingless buzzers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flesh-eaters-bees-strip-carrion-also-take-wasp-young">seem to prefer rotting carcasses</a> to nectar (<em>SN: 2/11/04</em>). Now, Maccaro and colleagues think they have cracked the riddle by looking into the bees’ guts.</p>



<p>Vulture bees (<em>Trigona</em> spp.)<em> </em>have a lot more <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02317-21">acid-producing gut bacteria</a> than their vegetarian counterparts do, Maccaro and colleagues report November 23 in <em>mBio</em>. And those bacteria are the same types that protect carrion feeders such as vultures and hyenas from getting sick on rotting meat.</p>





<p>To probe the bees’ insides, Maccaro’s colleagues trekked into a Costa Rican jungle. Since vulture bees feed on almost any dead animal, including lizards and snakes, the researchers cut up store-bought chicken and suspended the raw flesh from tree branches. To deter ants, the team smeared petroleum jelly on the string that the meat dangled from.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The funny thing is we’re all vegetarians,” says entomologist Quinn McFrederick, also of UC Riverside. “It was kind of gross for us to cut up the chicken.” That gross factor quickly intensified in the warm, humid jungle: The meat rotted, turning slimy and stinky.</p>



<p>Bees took the bait within a day. As the scavengers stopped by to dine, the researchers trapped about 30 bees. The team also captured another 30 or so of two other types of local bees — one that feeds on only flowers and one type that dines on both flowers and rotting meat. All bees were stored in alcohol-filled vials to preserve the insects’ DNA for analysis, as well as the DNA of any gut microbes.</p>



<p>Strictly meat-eating bees had between 30 percent and 35 percent more acid-producing gut bacteria than strictly vegetarian bees and the ones that sometimes eat meat, the team found. Some types of these microbes showed up only in the solely carnivorous bees.</p>



<p>Similar acid-producing bacteria in the guts of vultures and hyenas keep toxin-producing microbes in rotting meat from making the animals sick. The microbes probably do the same for the meat-eating bees, the team says.</p>



<p>The health benefit extends beyond individual bees, says David Roubik, an evolutionary ecologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama, who was not involved in the work. Vulture bees regurgitate some of the meat they consume, storing it in their nests where it serves as food for young bees. Some of the acid-loving gut bacteria end up in this food reserve, Roubik says. “Otherwise, destructive bacteria would ruin the food and release enough toxins to kill the colony.”</p>



<p>In the end, Maccaro says, it’s hard to know which evolved first — the gut bacteria or the bees’ ability to eat meat. But the bees probably first turned to meat because there was so much competition for nectar for food, she suspects.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh has planned an introductory presentation on the research developments in Natural Language processing NLP.
The main neural architecture he will discuss is the Transformers network, introduced in the paper &quot;Attention Is All You Need&quot;, which forms the backbone of many states of the art NLP models.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex
recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and
a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and
decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple
network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention
mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.
Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be
superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring
significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the
WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the
existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT
2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new
single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for
3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer
generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English
constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Why do people share fake news? All kinds of studies have looked into <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/12/the-more-we-see-fake-news-the-more-likely-we-are-to-share-it/">what encourages it</a>, and which <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/20/people-who-crave-structure-are-more-likely-to-declare-that-errors-in-media-reports-are-fake-news/">personal attributes</a> play a role. As the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-96824-001">new paper </a>in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em> point out, multiple studies have found that political conservatives are relatively more likely to disseminate false news than those on the political left. However, their new work finds that this is an over-simplification — that the link is “largely driven” by conservatives who<em> are also low in conscientiousness</em>. This is an important finding for a few reasons. On the upside, it’s a far less politically polarising message. On the downside, this group does not seem to be receptive to the main identified way of stopping fake news from spreading.</p>



<span id="more-44808"></span>



<p>Asher Lawson and Hemant Kakkar at Duke University ran eight online studies on a total of 4,642 US-based participants. In the first, the participants were given 12 reputable and 12 fake news COVID-19 stories from websites. Participants who identified as conservative were, as expected, more likely to say that they would share fake stories. However, further analysis revealed that this was true for conservatives who were low in conscientiousness, but not for those who were high in conscientiousness (highly conscientious people are those who are more diligent and better at controlling impulses). A second study found the same pattern of results for political stories unrelated to Covid-19.</p>



<p>Earlier research has found that giving guidance on the likely veracity of a news article helps to stop the spread of fake news. Indeed, this has been highlighted as a potentially important way to counter its spread. So, would adding fact-checker tags, indicating that the content had been verified or was disputed, reduce the sharing of fake news by low conscientious conservatives? A third study found that it did not. The low conscientious conservatives were more likely to share fake news that aligned with, and so furthered, their own interests. It didn’t seem to matter whether they believed it to be true or not.</p>



<p>This conclusion was supported by the results of an even stronger intervention. When participants in a fresh study indicated they would share a fake news story, they were given an explicit warning that the content was probably false, and asked if they would still like to share. While conservatives were overall less likely than liberals to change their mind, this was especially true for low conscientiousness conservatives.</p>



<p>Based on the results of earlier work, the pair wondered whether this group might have a stronger &#8220;need for chaos&#8221; — a greater desire for anarchy — and that this might drive the effect. They ran yet further studies to investigate, and concluded that this does indeed seem to be the case. Other personality traits, level of trust in the mainstream media, attitudes towards Covid-19, age, gender and time spent on social media were all taken into account in their analyses.</p>



<p>Overall, when it came to the spreading of fake news, “disparities in sharing behaviour were nearly exclusively driven by low conscientiousness respondents”, with an “indiscriminate desire for chaos”, the pair writes. “To curtail the spread of misinformation, policymakers should focus on low conscientious conservatives.”</p>



<p>As low conscientious conservatives don’t seem to care whether a story that aligns with their beliefs and interests is true or not, it could be that interventions will need to target conscientiousness itself, rather than simply explaining that a story is fake, the pair writes. <em>How</em> to go about that is another matter entirely. But given the disastrous effects of the spreading of fake news on everything from public health to voter decisions, it’s surely vital that efforts are made to find out.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-spin-liquid-atom">Physicists have coaxed ultracold atoms into an elusive form of quantum matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>An elusive form of matter called a quantum spin liquid isn’t a liquid, and it doesn’t spin — but it sure is quantum.</p>



<p>Predicted nearly 50 years ago, quantum spin liquids have long evaded definitive detection in the laboratory. But now, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi8794">a lattice of ultracold atoms held in place with lasers</a> has shown hallmarks of the long-sought form of matter, researchers report in the Dec. 3 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>Quantum entanglement goes into overdrive in the newly fashioned material. Even atoms on opposite sides of the lattice share entanglement, or quantum links, meaning that the properties of distant atoms are correlated with one another. “It’s very, very entangled,” says physicist Giulia Semeghini of Harvard University, a coauthor of the new study. “If you pick any two points of your system, they are connected to each other through this huge entanglement.” This strong, long-range entanglement could prove useful for building quantum computers, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The new material matches predictions for a quantum spin liquid, although its makeup strays a bit from conventional expectations. While the traditional idea of a quantum spin liquid relies on the quantum property of spin, which gives atoms magnetic fields, the new material is based on different atomic quirks.</p>





<p>A standard quantum spin liquid should arise among atoms whose spins are in conflict. Spin causes atoms to act as tiny magnets. Normally, at low temperatures, those atoms would align their magnetic poles in a regular pattern. For example, if one atom points up, its neighbors point down. But if atoms are arranged in a triangle, for example, each atom has two neighbors that themselves point in opposite directions. That arrangement leaves the third one with nowhere to turn — it can’t oppose both of its neighbors at once.</p>



<p>So atoms in quantum spin liquids <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-quantum-spin-ice-fine-structure-constant">refuse to choose</a> (<em>SN: 9/21/21</em>). Instead, the atoms wind up in a superposition, a quantum combination of spin up and down, and each atom’s state is linked with those of its compatriots. The atoms are constantly fluctuating and never settle down into an orderly arrangement of spins, similarly to how atoms in a normal liquid are scattered about rather than arranged in a regularly repeating pattern, hence the name.</p>



<p>Conclusive evidence of quantum spin liquids has been hard to come by in solid materials. In the new study, the researchers took a different tack: They created an artificial material composed of 219 trapped rubidium atoms cooled to a temperature of around 10 microkelvins (about –273.15° Celsius). The array of atoms, known as a programmable quantum simulator, allows scientists to fine-tune how atoms interact to investigate exotic forms of quantum matter.</p>



<p>In the new experiment, rather than the atoms’ spins being in opposition, a different property created disagreement. The researchers used lasers to put the atoms into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-sized-molecules-created-lab">Rydberg states</a>, meaning one of an atom’s electrons is bumped to a very high energy level (<em>SN: 8/29/16</em>). If one atom is in a Rydberg state, its neighbors prefer not to be. That setup begets a Rydberg-or-not discord, analogous to the spin-up and -down battle in a traditional quantum spin liquid.</p>



<p>The scientists confirmed the quantum spin liquid effect by studying the properties of atoms that fell along loops traced through the material. According to quantum math, those atoms should have exhibited certain properties unique to quantum spin liquids. The results matched expectations for a quantum spin liquid and revealed that long-range entanglement was present.</p>



<p>Notably, the material’s entanglement is topological. That means it is described by a branch of mathematics called topology, in which an object is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-awarded-using-math-shapes-explain-exotic-matter">defined by certain geometrical properties</a>, for example, its number of holes (<em>SN: 10/4/16</em>). Topology can protect information from being destroyed: A bagel that falls off the counter will still have exactly one hole, for example. This information-preserving feature could be a boon to quantum computers, which must grapple with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">fragile, easily destroyed</a> quantum information that makes calculations subject to mistakes (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Whether the material truly qualifies as a quantum spin liquid, despite not being based on spin, depends on your choice of language, says theoretical physicist Christopher Laumann of Boston University, who was not involved with the study. Some physicists use the term “spin” to describe other systems with two possible options, because it has the same mathematics as atomic spins that can point either up or down. “Words have meaning, until they don’t,” he quips. It all depends how you spin them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-biology-studies-research-replication-reproducibility">A massive 8-year effort finds that much cancer research can’t be replicated</a></h4>

              
                <p>After eight years, a project that tried to reproduce the results of key cancer biology studies has finally concluded. And its findings suggest that like research in the social sciences, cancer research has a replication problem.</p>



<p>Researchers with the <a href="https://www.cos.io/rpcb">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> aimed to replicate 193 experiments from 53 top cancer papers published from 2010 to 2012. But only a quarter of those experiments <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67995">were able to be reproduced</a>, the team reports in two papers published December 7 in <em>eLife</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers couldn’t complete the majority of experiments because the team couldn’t gather <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67995">enough information from the original papers</a> or their authors about methods used, or obtain the necessary materials needed to attempt replication.</p>



<p>What’s more, of the 50 experiments from 23 papers that were reproduced, effect sizes were, on average, 85 percent lower than those reported in the original experiments. Effect sizes indicate how big the effect found in a study is. For example, two studies might find that a certain chemical kills cancer cells, but the chemical kills 30 percent of cells in one experiment and 80 percent of cells in a different experiment. The first experiment has less than half the effect size seen in the second one.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The team also measured if a replication was successful using five criteria. Four focused on effect sizes, and the fifth looked at whether both the original and replicated experiments had similarly positive or negative results, and if both sets of results were statistically significant. The researchers were able to apply those criteria to 112 tested effects from the experiments they could reproduce. Ultimately, just 46 percent, or 51, met more criteria than they failed, the researchers report.</p>



<p>“The report tells us a lot about the culture and realities of the way cancer biology works, and it&#8217;s not a flattering picture at all,” says Jonathan Kimmelman, a bioethicist at McGill University in Montreal. He coauthored a <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67527">commentary</a> on the project exploring the ethical aspects of the findings.</p>



<p>It’s worrisome if experiments that cannot be reproduced are used to launch clinical trials or drug development efforts, Kimmelman says. If it turns out that the science on which a drug is based is not reliable, “it means that patients are needlessly exposed to drugs that are unsafe and that really don&#8217;t even have a shot at making an impact on cancer,” he says.</p>



<p>At the same time, Kimmelman cautions against overinterpreting the findings as suggesting that the current cancer research system is broken. “We actually don&#8217;t know how well the system is working,” he says. One of the many questions left unresolved by the project is what an appropriate rate of replication is in cancer research, since replicating all studies perfectly isn’t possible. “That&#8217;s a moral question,” he says. “That&#8217;s a policy question. That&#8217;s not really a scientific question.”</p>



<p>The overarching lessons of the project suggest that substantial inefficiency in preclinical research may be hampering the drug development pipeline later on, says Tim Errington, who led the project. He is the director of research at the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Va., which cosponsored the research.</p>



<p>As many as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2786">19 out of 20 cancer drugs that enter clinical trials</a> never receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Sometimes that’s because the drugs lack commercial potential, but more often it is because they do not show the level of safety and effectiveness needed for licensure.</p>

<p>Much of that failure is expected. “We&#8217;re humans trying to understand complex disease, we&#8217;re never going to get it right,” Errington says. But given the cancer reproducibility project’s findings, perhaps “we should have known that we were failing earlier, or maybe we don&#8217;t understand actually what&#8217;s causing [an] exciting finding,” he says.</p>



<p>Still, it’s not that failure to replicate means that a study was wrong or that replicating it means that the findings are correct, says Shirley Wang, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School. “It just means that you&#8217;re able to reproduce,” she says, a point that the reproducibility project also stresses.</p>



<p>Scientists still have to evaluate whether a study’s methods are unbiased and rigorous, says Wang, who was not involved in the project but reviewed its findings. And if the results of original experiments and their replications do differ, it’s a learning opportunity to find out why and the implications, she adds.</p>



<p>Errington and his colleagues have reported on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-studies-get-mixed-grades-redo-tests">subsets of the cancer reproducibility project’s findings before</a>, but this is the first time that the effort’s entire analysis has been released (<em>SN: 1/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>During the project, the researchers faced a number of obstacles, particularly that none of the original experiments included enough details in their published studies about methods to attempt reproduction. So the reproducibility researchers contacted the studies’ authors for additional information.</p>



<p>While about a quarter of the authors were helpful, another third did not reply to requests for more information or were not otherwise helpful, the project found. For example, one of the experiments that the group was unable to replicate required the use of a mouse model specifically bred for the original experiment. Errington says that the scientists who conducted that work refused to share some of these mice with the reproducibility project, and without those rodents, replication was impossible.</p>

<p>Some researchers were outright hostile to the idea that independent scientists wanted to attempt to replicate their work, Errington says. That attitude is a product of a research culture that values innovation over replication, and that prizes the academic publish-or-perish system over cooperation and data sharing, says Brian Nosek, executive director at the <a href="https://www.cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> and a coauthor on both studies.</p>



<p>Some scientists may feel threatened by replication because it is uncommon. “If replication is normal and routine, people wouldn’t see it as a threat,” Nosek says. But replication may also feel intimidating because scientists’ livelihoods and even identities are often so deeply rooted in their findings, he says. “Publication is the currency of advancement, a key reward that turns into chances for funding, chances for a job and chances for keeping that job,” Nosek says. “Replication doesn’t fit neatly into that rewards system.”</p>



<p>Even authors who wanted to help couldn’t always share their data for various reasons, including lost hard drives or intellectual property restrictions or data that only former graduate students had.</p>



<p>Calls from some experts about science’s “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">reproducibility crisis</a>” have been growing for years, perhaps most notably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">in psychology</a> <em>(SN: 8/27/18</em>)<em>.</em> Then in 2011 and 2012, pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> reported difficulties in replicating findings from preclinical biomedical research.</p>



<p>But not everyone agrees on solutions, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/redoing-scientific-research-best-way-find-truth">whether replication of key experiments is actually useful or possible</a>, or even what exactly is wrong with the way science is done or what needs to improve (<em>SN: 1/13/15</em>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least one clear, actionable conclusion emerged from the new findings, says Yvette Seger, director of science policy at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. That’s the need to provide scientists with as much opportunity as possible to explain exactly how they conducted their research.</p>



<p>“Scientists should aspire to include as much information about their experimental methods as possible to ensure understanding about results on the other side,” says Seger, who was not involved in the reproducibility project.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if science is to be a self-correcting discipline, there needs to be plenty of opportunities not only for making mistakes but also for discovering those mistakes, including by replicating experiments, the project’s researchers say.</p>



<p>“In general, the public understands science is hard, and I think the public also understands that science is going to make errors,” Nosek says. “The concern is and should be, is science efficient at catching its errors?” The cancer project’s findings don’t necessarily answer that question, but they do highlight the challenges of trying to find out.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We often hear that we’re living in an age of polarisation and divisiveness, unable to transcend political boundaries to listen to those who we disagree with. But how do we feel about those people who share our views but who seek to understand opponents anyway?</p>



<p>This is the subject of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211011969#_i6">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, authored by the University of British Columbia’s Gordon Heltzel and Kristin Laurin. They find that while we generally prefer those who seek alternative views, this falters when they appear to be susceptible to changing sides. </p>



<span id="more-44804"></span>



<p>In the first study, 233 participants read about four contentious topics — affirmative action, climate change, immigration and welfare — choosing which of two stances they agreed with more (e.g. “support tougher immigration policies” or “oppose tougher immigration policies”). They then read about two individuals, both of whom shared their beliefs about one of the issues. One of these individuals, however, sometimes watched news reports or read articles espousing alternative views, while the other did not. Participants then completed a &#8220;feeling thermometer&#8221;, indicating how they felt about the two individuals, as well as indicating their approval of them as a friend, teacher, and politician and selecting words to describe them.</p>



<p>Participants preferred the individual who sought alternative views, and this seemed to be because they felt they were more tolerant and rational. However, they also had greater concerns that this individual could adopt opposition views. This preference was also found in two follow-up studies with a similar procedure.</p>



<p>In the next study, participants again reported their views on four hot button topics and read about individuals who either sought or avoided alternative views. But this time, the participants also learned about the individual’s motivations: in one condition, participants read that the perspective-seeker had co-operative motives, trying to end conflict, while in another they read this individual had competitive motives, trying to advance their own cause through understanding counterarguments. Similarly, those who read about the perspective-avoider either learned that this individual wanted to stop fighting with people with opposing views (again, a co-operative motive), or that they did not want to betray their principles by speaking to the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a competitive motive).</p>



<p>Participants again preferred those who sought different views to those who avoided different views. And while they liked both perspective-seekers similarly, they particularly <em>disliked</em> the “co-operative” individual who avoided seeking alternative views because of a dislike of conflict.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants indicated their stance on particular political issues before once again reading a vignette; this time, conditions were manipulated so some participants read about fully politically committed individuals while others read about those who were more on the fence. Unsurprisingly, participants preferred targets who were more committed to their own side, and again preferred those who sought rather than avoided different views — at least when they were committed, or partially committed, to their own side. However, when the individual was not committed to shared ideals, participants no longer preferred their seeking out different views, reflecting the concerns highlighted in the first study about potentially switching sides.</p>



<p>So, overall, when it comes to those who share our views, it seems there is a sweet spot. We prefer those who seek to understand and cooperate with opponents rather than avoid them, considering them tolerant and cooperative — but we also <em>dislike</em> them when they seem to validate opposing views and have the potential to change their minds, particularly when they appear less committed to shared political ideals.</p>



<p>This could be tricky ground to navigate for those hoping to hold onto friends with particularly strong ideological commitments. But if you run out of friends who share your beliefs, never fear — there’s always <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/11/people-prefer-strangers-who-share-their-political-views-to-friends-who-dont/">strangers</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/feathers-light-color-migrating-birds-cool-long-flights">Light-colored feathers may help migrating birds stay cool on long flights</a></h4>

              
                <p>From teeny hummingbirds to giant whooping cranes, roughly half of the world’s more than 10,000 bird species migrate. Longer wings and beefed-up flying muscles often help these birds crisscross vast expanses of air. But a study of nearly all bird species suggests many migrators share another unexpected flight aid: lighter-colored feathers.</p>



<p>Being a tad more lightly colored than non-migrating birds <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01492-5?utm_source=EA">may help these long-distance fliers stay cool</a> as they work hard under the hot sun to fly, researchers report December 6 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>It’s known that color can help birds hide from predators by blending in, or attract mates by standing out. But color has subtler effects too, including regulating temperature by absorbing or reflecting light, says Kaspar Delhey, an ornithologist at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Germany. For example, bird eggs laid in colder climates <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-eggs-laid-cold-climates-are-darker-may-keep-eggs-warm">tend to be darker</a>, which may help keep them warm (<em>SN: 10/28/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Migrating birds push their bodies to the physiological limit, which creates excess heat. Some <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(21)00745-4">species cope</a> by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33958477/">ascending to cooler air</a> during daytime. “If overheating is a problem in migratory birds, another way of dealing with that would be to evolve lighter colors” that absorb less heat, Delhey says.</p>





<p>Delhey and his colleagues analyzed over <a href="https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/home">20,000 illustrations</a> of 10,618 bird species, ranking plumage lightness for each species and comparing that with how far the birds fly. On average, lightness slightly increased with migratory distance, the team found. The longest-distance migrators were about 4 percent lighter than non-migrators, an effect that wasn’t explained by size, climate or habitat type for different species.</p>



<p>“It’s not a big difference,” Delhey says, noting that many migrators are darkly colored, perhaps for reasons unrelated to flight. But the trend was remarkably consistent.</p>



<p>“Very different groups with very different biologies show this pattern,” Delhey says. “That surprised us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong> (December 6, 2021)</p>



<p><strong>COVID-19 research freely accessible, but research data sharing and preprinting are low</strong></p>



<p>Levels of COVID-19 research data sharing have remained low during the pandemic, and preprinting of research on the virus has been lower than two initiatives tried to ensure it would be. This is according to a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17125394.v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report </a>that examines the effectiveness of initiatives taken by players in the research ecosystem to promote sharing of COVID-19 research by stepping up open science approaches.</p>



<p>While the efforts of scientific publishers and the research community have speeded up publication times for COVID-19 research, and made much of it freely accessible, more effort is needed if society is to truly benefit from open science, the <em>Scholarly Communication in Times of Crisis: The response of the scholarly communication system to the COVID-19 pandemic </em>report says.</p>



<p>The sharing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is seen as the poster child for open science, and the pandemic held up as a turning point for open science. Yet the report finds this has only partly been realised. It makes a series of key recommendations, three of which focus on opening up data, encouraging preprinting and strengthening collaboration across the scholarly communication ecosystem:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Only joint efforts will improve the availability and quality of research data sharing.</strong> Common data policy templates should be developed to require data sets and software to be posted to a trusted, FAIR-enabling repository, and to require formal citations to data sets and software.</li><li><strong>Mandating preprinting and rewarding researchers who use preprints </strong>could shift the needle.&nbsp; Publishers should include posting of preprints in their submission workflows and leaders should advocate for preprints.</li><li><strong>Publishers and other scholarly communication organisations</strong> should intensify their joint efforts to improve the availability and quality of data and metadata on scholarly publishing, allowing for robust evidence-informed approaches to innovation in scholarly communication.</li></ul>



<p>The report concludes that <strong>there is no magic bullet </strong>to improving scholarly communication. It is a joint responsibility that requires collaboration and coordinated action across stakeholders in the research system.</p>



<p>Early in 2020 a <a href="https://wellcome.org/press-release/sharing-research-data-and-findings-relevant-novel-coronavirus-ncov-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wellcome-coordinated COVID-19 statement</a>, signed by over 30 publishers, called for open or free access to all COVID-19 publications for the duration of the pandemic; for COVID-19 papers to be made available via preprint servers prior to journal publication; and data from COVID-19 research to be shared as early as possible.</p>



<p>A second initiative, launched by a group of publishers and related organisations, the <a href="https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 Rapid Review Initiative</a>, worked on implementing the commitments made in the Wellcome-coordinated COVID-19 statement and aimed to accelerate peer review of COVID-19 papers.</p>



<p><em>Scholarly Communication in Times of Crisis: The response of the scholarly communication system to the COVID-19 pandemic</em> has been written by a team comprising researchers, publishers, and other scholarly communication experts, all associated with the COVID-19 Rapid Review Initiative. It presents the results of research undertaken by the team and reviews research conducted by others, with a view to identify opportunities for the scholarly communication stakeholders to effect change that will extend beyond the pandemic and have long-lasting benefits.</p>



<p>The authors also conclude that obtaining robust evidence on the response of the scholarly communication system to the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging. Relevant publishing data is often not available or is of limited quality. To enable robust evidence-informed approaches to innovation in scholarly communication, joint efforts to improve the availability and quality of this type of data are needed.</p>



<p>Ludo Waltman, Associate Director, Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and Professor of Quantitative Science Studies,&nbsp; Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University says: &ldquo;Development of innovative new forms of peer review, for instance by @PREreview_ and @mitpress @RapidReviewsC19, is extremely important and deserves further attention from all relevant actors in the system. I hope that the pandemic will be an impetus for more innovation in this area.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Stephen Pinfield, Associate Director, Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and Professor of Information Services Management, University of Sheffield says: &ldquo;Approaches adopted during the pandemic have powerfully illustrated the benefits of openness. It is important that we apply those lessons in future to improve the scholarly communication system for the benefit of the research community and society more generally.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>About COVID-19 Collaboration Group</strong></p>



<p>On 27 April 2020, a group of publishers and scholarly communications organisations announced a joint initiative to maximize the efficiency of peer review, ensuring that key work related to COVID-19 is reviewed and published as quickly and openly as possible, supported by Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association ( https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-grasses-spread-wildfire-plants">Invasive grasses are taking over the American West’s sea of sagebrush</a></h4>

              
                <p>No one likes a cheater, especially one that prospers as easily as the grass <em>Bromus</em> <em>tectorum </em>does in the American West.<em> </em>This invasive species is called cheatgrass<em> </em>because it dries out earlier than native plants, shortchanging wildlife and livestock in search of nutritious food.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for those animals and the crowded-out native plants, cheatgrass and several other invasive annual grasses now dominate one-fifth of the Great Basin, a wide swath of land that includes portions of Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and California. In 2020, these invasive grasses covered <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13440">more than 77,000 square kilometers of Great Basin ecosystems</a>, including higher elevation habitats that are now accessible to nonnative plants due to climate change, researchers report November 17 in <em>Diversity and Distributions</em>.</p>



<p>This invasion of exotic annual grasses is degrading one of North America’s most imperiled biomes: a vast sea of sagebrush shrubs, wildflowers and bunchgrasses where pronghorn and mule deer roam and where ranchers rely on healthy rangelands to raise cattle.</p>



<p>What’s more, these invasive grasses, which are highly flammable when dry, are also linked to more frequent and larger wildfires. In parts of Idaho’s Snake River Plain that are dominated by cheatgrass, for example, fires now occur <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr276/int_gtr276_004_010.pdf">every three to five years</a> as opposed to the historical average of 60 to 110 years. From 2000 to 2009, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12046">39 out of 50 of the largest fires</a> in the Great Basin were associated with cheatgrass.</p>





<p>To add insult to injury, cheatgrass is more efficient at recolonizing burned areas after a fire than native plants, creating a vicious loop: More cheatgrass causes more fires, and more fires foster more of the weeds. This means that land managers are often behind the curve, trying to keep cheatgrass from spreading to prevent wildfires, while also attempting to restore native plant communities after fires so that the sagebrush ecosystems don’t transition into a monoculture of invasive grasses.</p>



<p>“We need to get strategic spatially to pinpoint where to protect intact native plant communities rather than constantly chasing the problem,” says Joseph Smith, a rangeland ecology researcher at the University of Montana in Missoula.</p>



<p>To do that, Smith and his colleagues quantified how much of the Great Basin has transitioned to invasive annual grasses over the last three decades. The researchers used the <a href="https://rangelands.app/rap/">Rangeland Analysis Platform</a>, or RAP, a remote sensing product powered by Google Earth Engine that estimates the type and percentage of vegetation at a baseball diamond–sized scale.</p>



<p>While the satellite imagery that RAP relies on can show where annual grasses turn brown in late spring in the West or where perennial plants stay green longer into the summer, the technology can’t delineate between native and nonnative plants. So researchers cross-checked RAP data with on-the-ground vegetation surveys collected through the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s assessment, inventory and monitoring strategy.</p>



<p>Invasive annual grasses have increased eightfold in area in the Great Basin region since 1990, the team found. Smith and colleagues estimate that areas dominated by the grasses have grown more than 2,300 square kilometers annually, a rate of take-over proportionally greater than recent deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.</p>



<p>Perhaps most alarmingly, the team found that annual grasses, most of which are invasive, are steadily moving into higher elevations previously thought to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climbing-high-save-threatened-west-coast-plant">at minimal risk of invasion</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/14</em>). Invasive annual grasses don’t tolerate cold, snowy winters as well as native perennial plants. But as a result of climate change, winters are trending more mild in the Great Basin and summers more arid. While perennial plants are struggling to survive the hot, dry months, invasive grass seeds simply lie dormant and wait for fall rains.</p>



<p>“In a lot of ways, invasive grasses just do an end run around perennials. They don’t have to deal with the harshest effects of climate change because of their different life cycle,” Smith explains.</p>



<p>Though the scale of the problem can seem overwhelming, free remote sensing technology like RAP may help land managers better target efforts to slow the spread of these invasive grasses and explore their connection to wildfires. Smith, for instance, is now researching how mapping annual grasses in the spring might help forecast summer wildfires.</p>



<p>“If we don’t know where the problem is, then we don’t know where to focus solutions,” says Bethany Bradley, an invasion ecologist and biogeographer at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who wasn’t involved in the research. “Mapping invasive grasses can certainly help people stop the grass-fire cycle by knowing where to treat them with herbicides.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tangier-island-virginia-climate-change-uninhabitable">Climate change could make Virginia’s Tangier Island uninhabitable by 2051</a></h4>

              
                <p>Virginia’s Tangier Island is rapidly disappearing. Rising sea levels are exacerbating erosion and flooding, and could make the speck of land in the Chesapeake Bay uninhabitable within the next few decades. For years, island residents, policy makers and others have debated whether to attempt to save the island or relocate its small community elsewhere. But time to decide is running out, says David Schulte, a marine biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>



<p>Crucially, that choice will signal how other groups most at risk from climate change, “which are often Native American, minority or low-income such as the isolated fishing community of Tangier, will have their needs addressed — or ignored,” Schulte and his colleague Zehao Wu write in a new study.</p>



<p>The island’s sole town, Tangier, is located on three upland ridges that have largely been protected from coastal erosion. By analyzing aerial photographs of the area from 1967 to 2019, Schulte and Wu, a field researcher at Biogenic Solutions Consulting in Newport News, Va., found that nearly 62 percent of the ridges have been lost to sea level rise. What’s left <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.779774/full">will convert completely to a wetland by 2051</a> — about a decade earlier than previously thought — the researchers report November 8 in <em>Frontiers in Climate</em>.</p>

Wu</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Already, frequent flooding has turned the front yards of many Tangier homes into marshland, Schulte says. Empty parking lots and elevated homes, schools and sidewalks “are all signs of just how bad it is out there.”</p>



<p>Just 436 people lived on the island as of 2020, and that number could drop to zero by 2053, Schulte and Wu’s analysis of population trends suggests. Many factors, including fewer employment opportunities, play a role in the island’s population decline, the researchers say. The shrinking area of dry land has probably convinced people to leave as well.</p>





<p>Protecting and restoring Tangier Island might persuade some residents to stay, but it comes with a hefty price tag: between $250 million to $350 million, Schulte and Wu estimate. That money would fund a medley of interventions, including installing stone along the shoreline to fight erosion and raising the upland ridges by 3 meters using sand from the Chesapeake Bay. Moving a cubic meter of sand from the bottom of the bay to the island costs about $20. Considering the amount of sand needed to raise the ridges, “it gets very expensive really quick,” Schulte says.</p>





<p>Relocating Tangier residents is about $150 million cheaper, the researchers calculate. That estimate is based on others from the Corps and the U.S. Government Accountability Office to relocate U.S. coastal communities such as <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1977456/native-american-people-tell-stories-of-climate-loss-and-resilience">the towns of Shishmaref, Kivalina and Newtok</a> in Alaska, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-05/rising-pacific-drives-native-village-s-quest-for-higher-ground">Quinault Indian Nation village of Taholah</a> in Washington and <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_b3ce8e12-0d0f-11ec-8b3e-efcab7617cd6.html">Isle de Jean Charles</a> in Louisiana.</p>



<p>But moving a town requires more than finding a place for residents to live, Schulte says. Infrastructure such as schools, medical facilities, grocery stores and restaurants need to be moved or rebuilt to provide the community with a similar lifestyle. For Tangier, the lack of land access to nearby towns adds to the cost of relocating, which must be done via boat, Schulte says.</p>

<p>As the planet warms and oceans swell, an increasing number of other coastal towns and cities in the United States and around the world will probably face a similar choice as Tangier. The cost to save or relocate each one would, of course, differ, Schulte says. Some communities may not be as expensive to move as offshore Tangier, he speculates, but would certainly be in the ballpark.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">Sea level rise</a> has been driven, in part, by human activities in bigger cities (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). But it is shorelines, often inhabited by Native Americans, minority or low-income communities, that are the first to bear the brunt of this consequence of climate change, Wu notes. That makes it even more essential to draw attention to these overlooked communities, he says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>When we learn that something in our environment signals <em>Threat!,</em> we start to react to every encounter with the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221;, or &#8220;fear&#8221;, response. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617743002">Recent work</a> has shown, though, that the presence of someone we’re close to — a friend or partner, say, — can reduce or even eliminate this response. Our brains seem to treat such people as a powerful &#8220;safety&#8221; signal.</p>



<p>This was thought to be a unique effect. But now a team led by Erica Hornstein at UCLA <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-98211-001.pdf">has shown that physical warmth does the same thing</a>. The work, published in <em>Emotion</em>, was prompted by research finding that we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/">implicitly associate physical warmth with social support</a>. It has potential implications for treating anxiety disorders, especially for people who live alone — or who find it hard to unlearn links between certain stimuli and threat, as can happen with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>



<span id="more-44799"></span>



<p>In the first of two studies, every time 31 participants were given a rubber ball, a soft fuzzy ball or a heated pack to hold, they were then given an electric shock. The shock was at a level that the researchers had previously established would be extremely uncomfortable, but not painful. One stimulus — a wooden block — was never paired with a shock.</p>



<p>The participants’ skin conductance (sweatiness) was monitored. This data showed that they quickly developed a fear response to the rubber ball and the fuzzy ball, but not the wooden block — <em>or</em> the warm pack. The warmth seemed to stop them from learning to associate the pack with a threat. When the team then gave the participants all the objects in turn, but without any shocks, the rubber ball and fuzzy ball still triggered a fear response (while the warm pack still did not).</p>



<p>A second study on 30 people supported and extended this finding. This time, the team paired pictures with electric shocks, so that participants developed a fear response to these pictures. They then showed participants the pictures again, while they held either a warm pack or a rubber ball. The warm pack, but not the ball, completely inhibited the fear response.</p>



<p>The team would love to see work exploring how, exactly, both supportive others and physical warmth interfere with the fear response. One possibility is that it’s to do with endogenous opioids — which have been found to be released both when we’re with a close other and by warmth, and which are known to affect fear learning.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known whether the warmth effect is innate, or reflects the learning in early life of an association between warmth and the presence and protection of a caregiver, which leads us to perceive warmth as a signal of safety. But however this effect works or emerges, the fact that it happens automatically is important.  Earlier work has certainly found that we can <em>learn</em> that certain stimuli signal &#8220;safety&#8221;. But, because this learning happens through classical conditioning, these &#8220;learned safety signals&#8221; really only work for the specific unpleasant event used in the training, the researchers point out. There’s also some evidence that they can even hinder fear reduction in the long term. But supportive others and physical warmth seem to have a more fundamental, blanket, ongoing effect.</p>



<p>For this reason, the researchers see potentially important implications for treating all kinds of anxiety disorders. Perhaps treatments that involve supportive others or — especially for people lacking in strong social bonds — physical warmth could be more effective than current methods for helping people with phobias or PTSD, for example. Clearly, there’s important work to be done. But I, for one, can’t wait to hear what comes out of it.</p>

          <p><strong>What does PLOS&rsquo; vision for Open Science mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>JD: There is growing support for the idea that knowledge production and dissemination should be more inclusive. How we actually operationalize that ideal is the challenge that PLOS is tackling, and I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunity to both learn from and support those efforts.</p>

<p><strong>What specific expertise do you bring to PLOS Water?</strong></p>



<p> JD: I&rsquo;ve been teaching and carrying out research in the water and sanitation field for more than 20 years. Most of my group&rsquo;s work has been in countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Having the opportunity to examine issues across a variety of contexts has really shaped the way I think about research design and the interpretation of findings </p>

<p><strong>What is the most exciting part of your job as an Editor-in-Chief?</strong><br><br>PH: Most of us are aware of the challenges we face in terms of planetary resources and inequality, and the inadequacies of our existing institutions to tackle them meaningfully.  Since journals are institutions that structure the delivery of knowledges, we have both responsibilities and opportunities in this regard. The most exciting part of my job as Co-Editor-in-Chief is to be equally attentive to each of these many ways of knowing. Sometimes that will involve challenging our societal and organisational structures.<br><br>JD: Working with my Co-EIC Pierre Horwitz to develop a vision for PLOS Water that catalyzes cross talk between the water services and water resources communities, and that supports historically under-represented researchers in publishing their work. I&rsquo;ve also loved meeting new colleagues and learning about their work&ndash;there is an amazing amount of scholarship in the water field!<br><br><strong>What will PLOS Water add to the field in the coming decade?</strong><br><br>PH: Water permeates, and is nearly universal in a disciplinary sense. The combined forces of industrialisation and population growth have meant a flourishing of types of water knowledge that belong, more often than not, to a set of languages and technologies. While they are essential coverage for the field of water, they have come at the expense of a diverse array of water knowledges that have been marginalised, and are more place-based, culturally defined, and ecologically literate. They include knowledges of Indigenous and local peoples, even formed over thousands of years and hundreds of generations, embedding understandings of water as the world has changed, and how societies have responded.<br><br>By addressing this imbalance, and providing a re-acquaintance for an international audience, while maintaining strong coverage of conventional and emerging fields, we may well be in a better position to contribute to a regenerative global agenda over the next ten years.<br><br><strong>What&rsquo;s a common misconception new authors have about the peer review or publication process?</strong><br><br>JD: I think some new authors may forget that reviewers, while very knowledgeable and typically more seasoned than they, are also colleagues in their scholarly community. Engaging them in constructive debate can benefit everyone.<br><br><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you at this time?<br></strong><br>JD: First, increased data availability and advances in data science are expanding opportunities for measuring and monitoring water resources, services, and access. Ideally this will enable better management and policy choices. I&rsquo;m also excited to see a broader conception of health being incorporated into the water services arena. Evaluating effects of service deficits on, for example, mental health and the quality of child caregiving helps paint a more complete picture of the costs and benefits of water sector investments.<br><br>Want to know more about the journal and how to submit your research?
