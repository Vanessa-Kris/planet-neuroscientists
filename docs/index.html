              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/01/03/two-million-articles-and-counting/">Two million articles and counting!</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> now hosts more than 2 million articles.</p>
<p>arXiv, stewarded by Cornell Tech, is a free resource for scholars around the world in fields including physics, math and computer science, who use the service to share their own cutting-edge research and read work submitted by others.</p>
<p>“These 2 million submissions represent 2 million opportunities for humanity to push forward the frontiers of our understanding,” said Tara Holm, professor of mathematics in the College of Arts and Sciences and arXiv advisory board member. “As we celebrate this achievement, we must also continue the drive to make our disciplines and our research more accessible to researchers and the public around the world.”</p>
<p>Founded three decades ago, arXiv pioneered the open access movement, providing a fast, free, digital service to share research results. This value became critically apparent in 2020 as the pandemic made the speed of research a matter of life and death. arXiv now hosts more than 5,400 submissions related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Today, up to 1,200 new submissions in eight major subject areas are received daily, in addition to as many as 1,000 revisions and other updates. Four staff members, 196 volunteer moderators around the world, and automated systems screen and curate the submissions, which are not peer reviewed.</p>
<p>The research, ranging from mathematical models of COVID spread to planetary astrophysics to machine learning, is submitted by graduate students and Nobel Prize winners alike.</p>
<p>“If I ask the question, ‘Are all or most of your papers on arXiv?’ to a mathematician in my field, they would look at me in disbelief and say, ‘Of course all of my papers are on arXiv.’” Holm said. “arXiv has transformed mathematics. It makes current research available to students and researchers across the globe. arXiv has become the lifeblood of mathematics research.”</p>
<p>arXiv founder Paul Ginsparg, professor of physics (A&amp;S) and information science (Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science), credits much of arXiv’s success to the no-frills design of the website, and notes that the service has served as a model for others, such as bioRxiv, operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>
<p>“It’s always gratifying to hear from a new generation of researchers that arXiv continues to have a profound effect on their daily research activities,” Ginsparg said. “And in turn they like to hear about my graduate student days, when we used to write our physics articles using feather quills on scrolls of parchment. It took 23-and-a-half years to get 1 million submissions, seven more years to get to 2 million submissions, and perhaps will be another four and a half years to get to 3 million.”</p>
<p>arXiv is supported by its global research community. Major funding is supplied by the Simons Foundation, in addition to contributions from donors and 243 libraries, universities, research organizations and professional societies.</p>
<p>“Researchers on the arXiv advisory board are its stewards and we owe it to our colleagues, friends and those we have yet to meet to sustain it and ensure its future,” said Holm. “The research community must fiercely advocate for the support of arXiv.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Open Access Doesn’t Need APCs Part 1: Charting a new course with Community Action Publishing</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Welcome to a new year and our new series exploring our APC-alternative models from <em>Sara Rouhi,</em> Director of Strategic Partnerships at PLOS</em>.</p>



<p>Open Access has always been at the heart of PLOS, beginning with <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> which notably helped change the publishing landscape more than 15 years ago. These journals broke boundaries at the time by making some of the most exceptional work in the field openly available to all readers without restrictions. They, and other early OA journals, helped pioneer the Article Processing Charge (APC) model. But as the demand for Open Access solutions has grown, it&rsquo;s become obvious that APCs alone cannot equitably fulfill the needs of all authors and readers. Which is why we set out to find a new solution that would make highly-selective Open Access publishing more sustainable while making publication <em>free</em> for authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer we developed was <a href="https://plos.org/publish/community-action-publishing-for-authors/">Community Action Publishing</a> (CAP).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What makes Community Action Publishing unique?</strong></p>



<p>So many things! At its core, Community Action Publishing functions similarly to a co-op. Institutional members of each journal community share an equitable portion of the journal&rsquo;s total publishing costs, based on the publication activity of their authors. Those authors therefore have unlimited opportunities to publish in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS Biology</em> or our new journal, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em> for free, giving authors more freedom to choose where to submit their work based on what&rsquo;s best for their research and their readers&ndash;not their budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get into exactly how CAP works we want to acknowledge that the model is currently also supported by non-member fees for publications, only when the authors&rsquo; institutions are not members. However, our ultimate goal is to make these journals open to read and open to publish. How? We are actively reaching out to institutions to encourage them to join CAP. Authors can help by filling out this <a href="https://plos.org/resources/refer/">form</a>, or contacting their institutional librarian directly to let them know that they want their support.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Community Action Publishing is not based on APCs, it&rsquo;s based on community</strong></p>



<p>This is not just a partnership deal to streamline institutional support for APCs. CAP is a new way of thinking about Open Access publishing in terms of total journal costs spread over as many stakeholders as possible, rather than individual article fees paid by a smaller author community. It&rsquo;s ideal for selective journals that serve as a platform for specific research communities and which incur higher costs by the nature of their services. This allows us to re-examine how we distribute costs more fairly based on researcher activity. The model also automatically includes institutions in Research 4 Life countries as members so that researchers in these regions can also publish for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Most importantly, Community Action Publishing is built on transparency, openness and collaboration.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>CAP moves Open Access beyond the APC to ensure the sustainability of highly-selective Open Access publishing for all of its stakeholders. We worked with both library and researcher communities to develop this model and we continue to seek their advice and share information as our pilot progresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we have made our total cost recovery targets for each journal transparent on our website, and our partners get a detailed breakdown of their authors&rsquo; publishing activity and pricing tier before they decide to work with us. We&rsquo;ve committed to capping our margins at 10% which will be used to reinvest in programs that support our mission and provide value to the research community. Because the pie isn&rsquo;t getting any larger, the more institutional partners who join in to support the journal community, the lower costs become for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since we first announced the new model in late 2020, more than 100 institutions have signed on to eliminate author fees and we&rsquo;ve been honored to be named as co-winners of the 2021 <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/plos-wins-innovation-in-publishing-award/">ALPSP Innovation in Publishing</a> award for our work on this model. We&rsquo;ll be reporting on progress to targets once we close the 2021 books. For now, we want to end this post with some of the feedback that energizes us for the work ahead!</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>&ldquo;I am looking forward to this expanded pilot, and knowing that we have a full three years will help us guide and educate our faculty about this OA choice, which we view as an important added step to move the MSU campus toward future models.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">&ndash;Michigan State University</p>



<p></p>



<p>We are continually experimenting to find new solutions that fulfill the needs of our distinct research communities. Each of our journals now offers APC-alternatives tailored to the publishing activity in that community. Keep a look out for future posts in this series with more about our Flat Fees and Global Equity models.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-hunter-gatherers-iron-metal-production-sweden">Arctic hunter-gatherers were advanced ironworkers more than 2,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hunter-gatherers who lived more than 2,000 years ago near the top of the world appear to have run ironworking operations as advanced as those of farming societies far to the south.</p>



<p>Excavations in what’s now northeastern Sweden uncovered ancient furnaces and fire pits that hunter-gatherers used for metalworking. A mobile lifestyle did not prevent hardy groups based in or near the Arctic Circle from organizing large-scale efforts to produce iron and craft metal objects, say archaeologist Carina Bennerhag of Luleå University of Technology in Sweden and colleagues. In fact, hunter-gatherers who moved for part of the year across cold, forested regions dotted with lakes and swampy patches <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/huntergatherer-metallurgy-in-the-early-iron-age-of-northern-fennoscandia/0BD3D4FF8DF8A6A65F74526242A98C66">apparently exchanged resources and knowledge related to metallurgy</a>, the extraction of metals from ores, the researchers report in the December <em>Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Ancient hunter-gatherers at two Swedish sites “probably manufactured more iron and steel, and were more socially organized and sedentary than we previously thought,” says Luleå archaeologist and coauthor Kristina Söderholm.</p>



<p>Groups must have settled down for substantial amounts of time at locations near crucial resources, such as ores for prospecting, wood needed to make charcoal and clay and stone required for building furnaces and fire pits used in iron production, the scientists say.</p>





<p>Many investigators <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-beads-push-back-origins-iron-working">regard ironworking as an invention of large agricultural societies</a> in southwest Asia more than 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 8/22/13</em>). From there, this technology has typically been thought to have spread elsewhere, eventually being adopted in simplified forms by people in northern Scandinavia and other Arctic areas between A.D. 700 and 1600.</p>



<p>But that view has been questioned in recent years. Increasing evidence indicates that ancient technologies, including metallurgy, were mastered relatively early by small-scale societies, says archaeological scientist Marcos Martinón-Torres of the University of Cambridge, who was not part of Bennerhag’s team.</p>



<p>“This study is particularly insightful because the metal is iron, typically considered a more challenging metallurgy than copper or gold; the makers are hunter-gatherers, historically assumed to use only basic technologies; and the location is in a region largely ignored in histories of technology,” he says.</p>



<p>Bennerhag first directed excavations at a site called Sangis. Investigators uncovered a rectangular iron-smelting furnace consisting of a frame of stone slabs with one open side. A clay shaft was built within and partly on the frame. Holes in the frame served as inlets for air blown on burning charcoal inside, probably by bellows placed on flat stones, the researchers say.</p>



<p>By-products of heating iron ore at high temperatures and remnants of a ceramic wall lining were found inside the furnace. Radiocarbon dating of furnace remains indicate that iron production occurred between around 200 and 50 B.C.</p>



<p>Areas that hunter-gatherers occupied about 500 meters from the furnace contained pottery fragments and other material dating to between around 500 B.C. and A.D. 900. Finds include numerous fish bones and at least three fire pits where iron from the furnace was reheated and refined. There, researchers found several iron items and others made of steel, a bronze buckle and metallic waste with copper droplets on the surface, suggesting that different metals were produced at Sangis.</p>



<p>The bronze buckle’s molding technique and decorative style resemble metal items found at hunter-gatherer sites in northwestern Russia dating to as early as around 2,300 years ago, the researchers say. Knives and other metal objects found at Sangis contained two or more layers that had been expertly welded together and, in some cases, exposed to either of two types of heating processes to enhance their strength.</p>



<p>Excavations at a second site, Vivungi, uncovered the remains of two iron-smelting furnaces that contained iron ore, by-products of iron production and shards of ceramic wall lining. Iron production at Vivungi started around 100 B.C., the scientists say. Vivungi yielded no evidence of fire pits where iron was further purified.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of animal bones found near the Vivungi furnaces indicates that hunter-gatherers repeatedly occupied this location from around 5300 B.C. to A.D. 1600.</p>



<p>Evidence of iron production in southern Scandinavia more than 2,000 years ago already existed. So discoveries of similarly old ironwork farther north make sense, says archaeometallurgist Thilo Rehren of the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia, who did not participate in the new study. Preliminary work indicates that iron production also began in East Asia more than 2,000 years ago, Rehren adds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-great-green-wall-trees-sahel-climate-change">Africa’s ‘Great Green Wall’ could have far-reaching climate effects</a></h4>

              
                <p>Africa’s “Great Green Wall” initiative is a proposed 8,000-kilometer line of trees meant to hold back the Sahara from expanding southward. New climate simulations looking to both the region’s past and future suggest this greening <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/805754">could have a profound effect on the climate of northern Africa</a>, and even beyond.</p>



<p>By 2030, the project aims to plant 100 million hectares of trees along the Sahel, the semiarid zone lining the desert’s southern edge. That completed tree line could as much as double rainfall within the Sahel and would also decrease average summer temperatures throughout much of northern Africa and into the Mediterranean, according to the simulations, presented December 14 during the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. But, the study found, temperatures in the hottest parts of the desert would become even hotter.</p>



<p>Previous studies have shown that a “green Sahara” is linked to changes in the intensity and location of the West African monsoon. That major wind system blows hot, dry air southwestward across northern Africa during the cooler months and brings slightly wetter conditions northeastward during the hotter months.</p>



<p>Such changes in the monsoon’s intensity as well as its northward or southward extent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monsoon-deluges-turned-ancient-sahara-green">led to a green Sahara</a> period that lasted from about 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, for example (<em>SN: 1/18/17</em>). Some of the strongest early evidence for that greener Sahara of the past came in the 1930s, when Hungarian explorer László Almásy — the basis for the protagonist of the 1996 movie <em>The English Patient</em> — discovered Neolithic cave and rock art in the Libyan Desert that depicted people swimming.</p>





<p>Past changes in the West African monsoon are linked to cyclical variations in Earth’s orbit, which alters how much incoming solar radiation heats up the region. But orbital cycles don’t tell the whole story, says Francesco Pausata, a climate dynamicist at the Université du Québec à Montréal who ran the new simulations. Scientists now recognize that changes in plant cover and overall dustiness can dramatically intensify those monsoon shifts, he says.</p>



<p>More vegetation “helps create a local pool of moisture,” with more water cycling from soil to atmosphere, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088728">increasing humidity and therefore rainfall</a>, says Deepak Chandan, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the work. Plants also make for a darker land surface compared with blinding desert sands, so that the ground absorbs more heat, Chandan says. What’s more, vegetation reduces how much dust is in the atmosphere. Dust particles can reflect sunlight back to space, so less dust means more solar radiation can reach the land. Add it all up, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.03.002">these effects lead to more heat and more humidity over the land</a> relative to the ocean, creating a larger difference in atmospheric pressure. And that means stronger, more intense monsoon winds will blow.</p>



<p>The idea for Africa’s Great Green Wall came in the 1970s and ’80s, when the once-fertile Sahel began to turn barren and dry as a result of changing climate and land use. Planting a protective wall of vegetation to hold back an expanding desert is a long-standing scheme. In the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt mobilized the U.S. Forest Service and the Works Progress Administration to plant walls of trees from the Great Plains to Texas to slow the growth of the Dust Bowl. Since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-climate-change-carbon-capture-deforestation">China has engaged in its own massive desert vegetation project</a> — also nicknamed the Great Green Wall — in an attempt to halt the southward march of sand dunes from the Gobi Desert (<em>SN: 7/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Led by the African Union, Africa’s <a href="https://www.unccd.int/actions/great-green-wall-initiative">Great Green Wall project</a> launched in 2007 and is now roughly 15 percent complete. Proponents hope the completed tree line, which will extend from Senegal to Djibouti, will not only hold back the desert from expanding southward, but also bring improved food security and millions of jobs to the region.</p>



<p>What effect the finished greening might ultimately have on the local, regional and global climate has been little studied — and it needs to be, Pausata says. The initiative is, essentially, a geoengineering project, he says, and when people want to do any type of geoengineering, they should study these possible impacts.</p>



<p>To investigate those possible impacts, Pausata created high-resolution computer simulations of future global warming, both with and without a simulated wall of plants along the Sahel. Against the backdrop of global warming, the Great Green Wall would decrease average summertime temperatures in most of the Sahel by as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>



<p>But the Sahel’s hottest areas would get even hotter, with average temperatures increasing by as much as 1.5 degrees C. The greening would also increase rainfall across the entire region, even doubling it in some places, the research suggests.</p>



<p>These results are preliminary, Pausata says, and the data presented at the meeting were only for a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">high-emissions future warming scenario</a> called RCP8.5 that may not end up matching reality (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>). Simulations for moderate- and lower-emissions scenarios are ongoing.</p>



<p>The effects of greening the Sahara might extend far beyond the region, the simulations suggest. A stronger West African monsoon could shift larger atmospheric circulation patterns westward, influencing other climate patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation and altering the tracks of tropical cyclones.</p>



<p>Chandan agrees that it’s important to understand just what impact such large-scale planting might have and notes that improvements in understanding what led to past changes in the Sahara are key to simulating its future. That the Great Green Wall’s impact could be far-ranging also makes sense, he says: “The climate system is full of interactions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-plumes-water-ocean-saturn">Enceladus’ plumes might not come from an underground ocean</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus sprays water vapor into space. Scientists have thought that the plumes come from a deep subsurface ocean — but that might not be the case, new simulations suggest.</p>



<p>Instead, the water could come from pockets of watery mush in the moon’s icy shell, scientists report December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>“Maybe we didn’t get the straw all the way through the ice shell to the ocean. Maybe we’re just getting this weird pocket,” says planetary scientist Jacob Buffo of Dartmouth College.</p>



<p>The finding is “a cautionary tale,” Buffo says. The hidden ocean makes Enceladus one of the best places to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-oceans-book-search-extraterrestrial-life-outer-solar-system">search for life in the solar system</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/20</em>). Concepts for future missions to Enceladus rely on the idea that taking samples of the plumes would directly test the contents of the ocean, without needing to drill or melt through the ice. “That could be true,” Buffo says. But the simulations suggest “you could be sampling this slushy region in the middle of the shell, and that might not be the same chemistry as is down in the ocean.”</p>





<p>Enceladus has beguiled planetary scientists since NASA’s Cassini spacecraft revealed the moon’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-small-feisty">dramatic plumes in 2005</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/05</em>). At the time, researchers wondered if the spray originated on Enceladus’ icy surface, where friction from quakes could melt ice and let it escape as pure water vapor into space. But later evidence collected by Cassini convinced most scientists that the geysers are from fractures in the shell that reach all the way to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moons-geysers-draw-water-subsurface-sea">salty, subsurface sea</a> (<em>SN: 8/4/14</em>).</p>



<p>One of the most convincing pieces of evidence was the fact that the plumes contain salts, said physicist Colin Meyer of Dartmouth in a talk at the meeting, which was held virtually and in New Orleans. Early versions of the quake idea couldn’t account for those salts, and instead suggested that any salts in the melted ice would be left on the surface as the water escaped into space, like the sheen of salt left on your skin after you sweat, he says.</p>



<p>But Meyer, who has studied the physics of sea ice on Earth, realized that pockets of meltwater in the ice shell could concentrate salts and other compounds. He, Buffo and colleagues applied computer simulations developed for sea ice on Earth to the observed icy conditions on Enceladus. The team found that Enceladus could easily generate pockets of mush within its shell and vent the contents of that mush out into space, salts and all.</p>



<p>That does not mean Enceladus doesn’t have an ocean, Meyer says — it almost certainly does. And it does not mean the ocean isn’t habitable, Buffo adds.</p>



<p>The implications of the results “are huge,” especially for proposed life-finding missions to Enceladus, says planetary scientist Emily Martin of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“If those plumes aren’t tapping into the ocean, it will really shift our perspective on what that plume is telling us about the interior of Enceladus,” Martin says. “And that’s a big deal.”</p>

The n=1 trial was the culmination of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal research funding, so I was kinda fascinated by why the clinical team chose this particular patient (which is protected health information, of course). In an <a href="https://psychiatry.ucsf.edu/news/treating-severe-depression-demand-brain-stimulation" target="_blank">interview</a>, Sarah said, “I was at the end of the line. I was severely depressed. I could not see  myself continuing if this was all I’d be able to do, if I could never  move beyond this. It was not a life worth living.”</p>The <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04004169" target="_blank">inclusion criteria</a> for the trial required that the current depressive episode is two or more years in length and treatment-resistant (failure to respond to four adequate  trials (including ECT), three classes of medications, one augmentation  strategy, and psychotherapy). In the present case, her most recent 4-year episode did not adequately respond to four antidepressants, augmentation with five other meds, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or psychotherapy. In other words, closed-loop DBS is only appropriate for the most severe unrelenting cases of depression.<br />&nbsp;</div><div><p></p><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-future-of-depression-treatment.html">The Future of Depression Treatment</a> is here, but will it work in other patients?

                <p>We&#8217;re in a golden age of merging AI and neuroscience. No longer tied to conventional publication venues with year-long turnaround times, our field is moving at record speed. As 2021 draws to a close, I wanted to take some time to zoom out and review a recent trend in neuro-AI, the move toward unsupervised learning to explain representations in different brain areas<sup>footnote</sup>. </p>



<h2 id="supervision-be-gone">Supervision be gone</h2>



<p>One of the most robust findings in neuro-AI is that artificial neural networks trained to perform ecologically relevant tasks match single neurons and ensemble signals in the brain. The canonical example is the ventral stream, where <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=i_xiyGq6FNT">DNNs trained for object recognition on ImageNet match representations in IT</a> (Khaligh-Razavi &amp; Kriegeskorte, 2014, Yamins et al. 2014). Supervised, task-optimized networks link two important forms of explanation: ecological relevance and accounting for neural activity. They answer the teleological question: what is a brain region for? </p>



<p>However, as Jess Thompson points out, these are far from the only forms of explanation. In particular, task-optimized networks are generally not considered biologically plausible. Conventional ImageNet training uses 1M images. For a human infant to get this level of supervision, they would have to receive a new supervised label every 5 seconds (e.g. the parent points at a duck and says &#8220;duck&#8221;) for 3 hours a day, for more than a year. And for a non-human primate or a mouse? Thus, the search for biologically plausible networks which match the human brain is still on.</p>

<p>This year, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway into finding ways around supervision, and alternatives to supervised training are now competitive.</p>



<h2 id="unsupervised-self-supervised-contrastive-multimodal">Unsupervised, self-supervised, contrastive, multimodal</h2>



<p>The alternatives to supervised training are many, and it&#8217;s not clear which method is <em>winning</em> right now. Let&#8217;s review the methods:</p>

<ul><li>Unsupervised learning aims to represent the data distribution. I&#8217;ve covered some <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/07/26/dimensionality-reduction-in-neural-data-analysis/">unsupervised techniques</a> in the context of dimensionality reduction in neuroscience. One of the most often used techniques in this space the variational autoencoder (VAE).</li><li><a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/11/10/self-supervised-learning.html">Self-supervised training</a> aims to find good data representations by solving pretext tasks (figure above). Many have been proposed over the years. Language models are almost universally trained with self-supervision these days; think BERT and GPT-3.</li><li><a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2021/05/31/contrastive-representation-learning.html">Contrastive learning is a particular flavor</a> of self-supervised learning where the pretext task is to predict whether a sample is from a positive or negative (or distractor) class (hence &#8220;contrast&#8221;). There are many different flavors of contrastive learning: MoCo, InfoNCE, SimCLR, CPC, etc. There are also closely related non-contrastive methods that do away with negative samples, including BYOL and BarlowTwins.</li><li>Multimodal learning is a particular flavor of self-supervised training which aims to find a common subspace for two different modalities (e.g. vision, text, audio, etc.) by predicting one from the other, or predicting a common subspace. CLIP is perhaps the most famous multimodal network &#8211; <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">it&#8217;s trained contrastively</a>. </li></ul>



<p>All of these methods allow us to learn a representation without the need for pesky supervision. If it turns out that this representation is aligned to a brain area, this is a win, as self-supervised and unsupervised methods are more biologically plausible than supervised methods. </p>

<p>I went through and reviewed this year&#8217;s MAIN conference, NeurIPS, CCN, as well as whatever papers and preprints happened to show in my Twitter feed. Of course, this review reflects my research interests (heavily skewed towards a certain flavor of neuro-AI and vision), but I hope it&#8217;s useful to many of you who want to see where the field is going.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2014196118">Zhuang and colleagues (2021)</a>. This paper was just published in PNAS this year and already has &gt; 60 citations. They found that unsupervised and self-supervised methods learned representations that are well-aligned to ventral stream (V1, V4, IT) neurons. Their significance statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Primates show remarkable ability to recognize objects. This ability is achieved by their ventral visual stream, multiple hierarchically interconnected brain areas. The best quantitative models of these areas are deep neural networks trained with human annotations. However, they receive more annotations than infants, making them implausible models of the ventral stream development. Here, we report that recent progress in unsupervised learning has largely closed this gap. We find the networks learned with recent unsupervised methods achieve prediction accuracy in the ventral stream that equals or exceeds that of today’s best models. These results illustrate a use of unsupervised learning to model a brain system and present a strong candidate for a biologically plausible computational theory of sensory learning.</p></blockquote>



<p>In particular, they found that SimCLR and other contrastive learning methods could explain ventral stream neurons almost as well as supervised methods. Very strong proof-of-concept that labels are not necessary; major milestone for the field IMO.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153247v3">Konkle and Alvarez (2021), bioRxiv</a>. This paper asked a similar question to the Zhuang et al. paper: can the ventral stream be accounted by a network trained without supervised learning? They used fMRI in humans rather than single neuron recordings to evaluate this. They find results which are broadly compatible with the Zhuang paper, with their own flavor of instance-contrastive self-supervision, as well as other along the same lines (SimCLR) accounting for the fMRI data. Interestingly, they find a disconnect between ImageNet classification accuracy and match to fMRI data. This paper has a really interesting discussion, where they seriously consider how you would actually implement self-supervision in a brain. They identify retinal distortions, saccades (<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yu8Q6341U7W">see also this recent NeurIPS paper</a>), efference copy, as well as a hippocampus-based buffering mechanism as means of instantiating self-supervision. I would love to see a modelling study instantiating these ideas &#8211; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re already on it!</p>



<h3 id="your-head-is-there-to-move-you-around-goal-driven-models-of-the-primate-dorsal-pathway">Your head is there to move you around:<br>Goal-driven models of the primate dorsal pathway</h3>



<p><a href="https://your-head-is-there-to-move-you-around.netlify.app/">Mineault et al. (2021)</a>. Super excited we got this accepted as a spotlight in NeurIPS this year. As I&#8217;ve discussed previously, ventral stream neurons are selective for shape. However, there&#8217;s an entirely separate stream, the dorsal stream, which is highly sensitive to motion. How does that work? I compared a number of supervised 3d (spacetime) networks to different dorsal stream areas and found that they could not account for the responses of single neurons in non-human primates. Taking the task-driven paradigm at face value, we asked: what kind of task would create the kinds of representations we see in the dorsal stream? I rigged up a pretext task in which an agent moving about in the world must determine the parameters of its self-motion from the patterns of images falling on its retina. This was super fun to program in Airsim, which is an Unreal-based simulation engine for drones. </p>

<p>The resulting network looked a lot like the dorsal stream, and this was true both qualitatively and quantitatively. Now, the training of this model is supervised, but from the agent&#8217;s perspective it&#8217;s self-supervised, multimodal learning: the agent learns to predict the parameters of its self-motion (vestibular, efference copy) from another modality (vision). That&#8217;s potentially biologically plausible (NHP experiments to follow). </p>

<p><a href="https://ventral-dorsal-model.netlify.app/">Bakhtiari et al. (2021)</a>. Very happy that we got not one but two spotlights in NeurIPS this year,  Shahab really knocked it out of the park with this one! Mammals have both dorsal- and ventral-like streams, whether it&#8217;s humans, non-human primates or mice. Can one artificial neural network explain both? Shahab used a contrastive predictive coding (CPC) network trained on movie clips and found that, with two separate parallel pathways, the network self-organized into a dorsal and a ventral stream. The dorsal stream pathway provided a nice match to mice dorsal areas, and the ventral stream was well matched to ventral stream. What&#8217;s more, networks trained with supervision, or networks with just one pathway did not match the brain of mice. I think it&#8217;s a very nice embodiment of the idea that with anatomical priors and a sprinkling of self-supervision, the brain can bootstrap itself into existence. </p>

This paper asks the question of how we can obtain better models of mouse vision using more ethologically relevant, more anatomically grounded models. They used mouse visual cortex data (static images) and compared it to supervised and self-supervised networks of different architectures. One interesting finding is that shallow networks with parallel branches explain mice data better. This corroborates Shahab&#8217;s findings. They make the argument that mice&#8217;s visual brain is a shallow “general purpose” visual machine, which is good for a variety of tasks, unlike the deep neural network in our brains, which is highly specialized to subtasks. I think these ideas fit very nicely with the idea that different brains are adapted to different ecological niches, which is one of my favorite theories of everything in neuroscience. </p>

Another paper on self-supervised learning in mouse visual cortex. This one is notable for the breadth of metrics and models considered: vision transformers, MLP mixers, taskonomy encoders, self-supervised models. Broadly speaking, the results are compatible with the previous two papers. I think the most notable finding is that some ethologically relevant taskonomy tasks stood out as better aligned to the brain: 2d segmentation, object recognition and semantic segmentation. Perhaps the mouse&#8217;s visual brain receives some multi-modal self-supervision from the whiskers?! It&#8217;s a very cool idea that an experimentalist should pick up.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07411">Geirhos et al. (2021), NeurIPS</a>. Humans are very good at performing classification of images under distortions, such as noise, changes in contrast, rotations, etc. Up to now, CNNs have performed poorly on this task. In this paper, they ask the question of whether newer models have closed this gap. Indeed, they have! They find that newfangled self-supervised and multimodal models are now at par with humans when it comes to robustness to distortions. One important factor underlying the results is how much data the network was trained on: models trained with orders of magnitude more data are more robust. CLIP performs exceptionally well here, for reasons that are still not clear. Newer models are also less sensitive to texture and more to shape: they seem to be taking less shortcuts. Nevertheless, newer models still make distinctly non-human mistakes, which they were able to show with extensive psychophysics.

The hippocampus contains &#8220;concept cells&#8221; (e.g. the infamous Jennifer Aniston cell) that are highly multimodal; they will respond to a textual representation of a concept or an image. Interestingly, CLIP does the same, and in fact can be fooled by adversarial labels (i.e. writing wrong labels into an image). In this workshop paper, the authors use publicly available fMRI data to show that multimodal networks, including CLIP, explain hippocampal data best. It&#8217;s wild that there&#8217;s something so special about CLIP, and we still don&#8217;t know what it means! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26751-5">Higgins et al. (2021)</a>, Nature Comms. The Deepmind gang is at it again comparing neural representations in face selective areas and unsupervised, disentangled neural networks. They ask whether single, face-selective neurons in IT are aligned to single disentangled causal factors. Perhaps a single neuron in IT encodes a single causal factor which affects the appearance of faces, e.g. skin tone, lighting, age, etc. The manifold perspective of neural representation, OTOH, is that neurons don&#8217;t have to be axis-aligned to represent interesting factors; arbitrary rotations of the latent factors are just as good candidates for representation. This would argue against axis-alignment.</p>



<p>They trained an unsupervised neural network, the beta-VAE, to represent faces. <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/08/12/from-autoencoder-to-beta-vae.html#vae-variational-autoencoder">A beta-VAE is a variational auto-encoder (VAE) </a>with a higher weight (=beta) on the KL term, which encourages the representation to be disentangled. They show in this case that <em>single neurons</em> in IT are aligned to <em>single</em> disentangled latent factors in the VAE, which argues against the manifold view and for the disentangled causal graph view. Like all good papers, asks more questions than it answer: how does disentangling happen in the brain? How do people learn disentangling? What&#8217;s the advantage of a disentangled representation?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01097-6">Storrs et al. (2021), Nature Human Behaviour</a>. This paper examines the question of how humans perceive gloss from surfaces. They train a pixel-VAE on an ensemble of textures and examine how the latent factors are aligned to how humans perceive surfaces. They find that the VAE naturally disentangles different factors, and furthermore, is well aligned to human perception! Furthermore, they find that supervised networks don&#8217;t perform nearly as well on this task. Very cool idea, and lots of nice psychophysics in this paper.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>This year has seen huge advances in matching unsupervised and self-supervised models to brains. They offer a number of advantages over the alternatives: potentially a better match to brain data, they can trained without labels.</p>



<p>We have to be careful though: learning without labels is better than with labels, but we still have to run through the numbers to see if the math works out. In particular, because labels are expensive, and self-supervision opens the door for learning without labels, the latest class of models often uses a tremendous amount of data for training. For instance, GPT-3 is trained on essentially all the text that&#8217;s ever been produced by humanity (~500 billion tokens). By contrast, children in the most talkative homes are exposed to ~30M words by the time they&#8217;re five. If we find an alignment between GPT-3 and representations of language in the human brain, it doesn&#8217;t follow that contrastive training on an immense corpus as in GPT-3 is a biologically plausible mechanism for language acquisition and representation; we&#8217;re still off by 4 orders of magnitude. </p>



<p>2022 will hopefully see a lot of work on ethologically-grounded learning. This, mixed with biologically plausible self-supervised and unsupervised learning, will lead to more refined models of how the brain can learn good representations during evolution and development.</p>

<p>During the last year, I have continued to work on the ideas described during previous year-end write-ups, resulting in a project proposal that is currently under evaluation. I will use this year’s write-up to talk about something different, although related, a recent book by Peter Robin Hiesinger: <em><a href="http://selfassemblingbrain.com/">The Self-Assembling Brain</a></em>.</p>



<p>Hiesinger, based in Berlin, is working in the field of developmental neurobiology. However, this book is rather a cross-over between multiple disciplines, ranging from developmental neurobiology, circuit neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, and many side-branches of the mentioned disciplines. Hiesinger masterfully assembles the perspectives of the different fields around his own points of interest. For example, his introductory discussion about the emergence of the field of artificial intelligence in the 1950s is one of the most insightful account that I have read about this period. He tells the stories how key figures like von Neumann, Minsky, Rosenblatt or McCarthy and their relationships and personalities influenced the further development of the field.</p>



<p>The main hypothesis of Hiesinger&#8217;s book is that the genetic code does not encode the <em>endpoint </em>of the system (e.g., the map of brain areas, the default state network, thalamocortical loops, interneuron connectivity, etc.). According to him, and I think that most neuroscientists would agree, the neuronal circuits of the brain are not directly encoded in the genetic code. Instead, the simple genetic code needs to <em>unfold </em>in time in order to generate the complex brain. More importantly, it is, according to Hiesinger, necessary to actually <em>run </em>the code in order to find out what the endpoint of the system is. Let&#8217;s pick two analogies brought up in the book to illustrate this <em>unfolding </em>idea.</p>



<p>First, in the preface Hiesinger describes how an alien not familiar with life on earth finds an apple seed. Upon analysis of the apple seed, the alien realizes that there are complex and intricate genetic codes in the apple seed, and it starts to see beauty and meaning in these patterns. However, the analysis based on its structural content would not enable the alien to predict the purpose of the apple seed. This is only possible by development (unfolding) of the seed into an apple tree. Unfolding therefore is the addition of both time and energy to the seed.</p>



<p>Second, Hiesinger connects the <em>unfolding </em>idea with the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a>, and in particular with the early work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>, a very influential but also controversial personality of complexity research, and his cellular automaton named rule 110. The 110 automaton is a very simple rule (the rule is described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110#Definition">wikipedia article</a>) that is applied to a row of 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s and results in another binary row. The resulting row is again subject to rule 110, etc., leading to a two-dimensional pattern as computed here in Matlab:</p>

<p>The pattern is surprisingly complex, despite the simplicity of the rule. For example, how can one explain the large solitary black triangle in the middle right? How the vertical line of equally sized triangles in the center that ends so abruptly? The answers are not obvious. These examples show that a very simple rule can lead to very complex patterns. From Hiesinger&#8217;s point of view, it is important to state that the <em>endpoint </em>of the system, let&#8217;s say line 267, cannot be derived from the rule &#8211; unless it is developed (<em>unfolded</em>) for exactly 267 iterations. Hiesinger believes that this analogy can be transferred to the relationship between the genetic code and the architecture of the brain.</p>



<p>The rest of Hiesinger’s book discusses the implications of this concept. As a side-effect, Hiesinger illustrates how complex the genome is in comparison with the simple 101 automaton. Not only is the code richer and more complex, but it is also, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor">transcription factor</a> cascades that include feedback loops, a system of rules where rules, unlike rule 110, <em>change </em>over time with development. Therefore, according to Hiesinger, the classical research in developmental biology that tries to match single genes (or a few genes) onto a specific function is ill-guided. He convincingly argues that the examples for such relationships that have been found as “classical” examples for the field (e.g., genes coding for cell adhesion molecules involved in establishing synaptic specificity) are probably the exception rather than the rule.</p>



<p>The implication of the <em>unfolding </em>hypothesis for research on artificial intelligence is, interestingly, very similar. That is, to stop treating intelligent systems like engineered systems, where the rules can be fully designed. Since the connection between the generative rules and the resulting endpoint system cannot be understood unless their unfolding in time is observed, Hiesinger is in favor of research that embraces this limitation. He suggests to build models based on a to-be-optimized (“genetic”) code and, letting go of the full control, make them unfold in time to generate an artificial intelligence. Of course, this idea reminds of the existing field of evolutionary algorithms. However, in classic evolutionary algorithms, evolving properties of the code are more or less directly mapped to properties of the network or the agent. If I understood the book right, it would be in Hiesinger’s spirit to make this mapping more indirect through developmental steps that allow for higher complexity, even though it would also obfuscate the mechanistic connection between rules and models.</p>



<p>Overall, I find Hiesinger’s approach interesting. He shows mastery of other fields as well, but it is pncing point that the idea of the unfolding code, the self-assembling brain, is reasonable, and he also brings up examples of research that goes into that direction. However, as a note of caution to myself, accepting the idea of self-assembly seemed a bit like giving in when faced with complexity. There is a long history of complexity research that agreed on the fact that things are too complex to be understood. Giving in resulted in giving vague names to the complex phenomena, which seemed to explain away the unknown but in reality only gave it a name. For example, the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">autopoiesis</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle">free energy principle</a> are in my opinion relatively abstract and non-concrete concepts that contributed to the halting of effective research by preventing incremental progress on more comprehensible questions. I get similar vibes when Hiesinger states that the connections between the self-organizing rules and the resulting product are too complex to be understood and require <em>unfolding </em>in time. The conclusion of this statement is either that everything is solved, because the final explanation is unfolding in time of a code that cannot be understood; or it is that nothing can be solved because it is too complex. In both cases, there seems to be some sort of logical dead end. But this just as a note of caution to myself.</p>



<p>So, what is the use of the <em>unfolding </em>hypothesis about the organization and self-assembly of the brain? I think it is useful because it might help guide future efforts. I agree with Hiesinger that the field of &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; should shift its focus on self-organized and growing neuronal networks. In my opinion, work focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">evolutionary algorithms</a>, actor-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> (e.g., something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution">neuroevolution</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_architecture_search">neural architecture search</a> or more generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning">AutoML</a> go into the right direction. Right now it seems a long shot to say this, but my guess is that these forms of artificial neuronal networks will become dominant within 10 years, potentially replacing artificial neuronal networks based on backpropagation. &#8211; After finishing the write-up, I came across <a href="https://sebastianrisi.com/self_assembling_ai/">a blog post by Sebastian Risi</a> that is a good starting point with up-to-date references on self-assembling algorithms from the perspective of computer science and machine learning &#8211; check it out if you want to know more.</p>



<p>For neurobiology, on the other hand, the <em>unfolding </em>hypothesis means that an understanding of the brain requires understanding of its self-assembly. Self-assembly can happen, as Hiesinger stresses, during development, but it can also happen in the developped circuit through neuronal plasticity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity">synaptic plasticity</a> on short and long time scales, as well as <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Intrinsic_plasticity">intrinsic plasticity</a>). I have written about this self-organizing aspect of neuronal circuits in <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/">my last year&#8217;s write-up</a>. Beyond that, if we were to accept the unfolding hypothesis as central to the organization of the brain, we would also be pressured to drop some of the beautiful models of the brain that are based on engineering concepts like modularity. For example, the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_column">cortical column</a>, the <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/1/4/480/5502/A-Canonical-Microcircuit-for-Neocortex">canonical microcircuit</a>, or the concept of segregated neuronal cell types. All those concepts have been obviously very useful frameworks or hypotheses to advance our understanding of the brain, but if the unfolding of the brain is indeed the main concept of its assembly, these engineering concepts are unlikely (although not impossible) to turn out to be true.</p>



<p>It is possible that most of the ideas are already contained in the first few pages, and the rest of the book is less dense and feels often a bit redundant. But especially the historical perspective in the beginning and also some later discussions are very interesting. Language-wise, the book could have benefitted from a bit more inference by the editor to avoid unnaturally sounding sentences, especially during the first couple of pages. But this is only a minor drawback of an otherwise clear and nice presentation. </p>

<p>The book is structured into ten “seminars”, which are each of them a slightly confusing mix of book chapter and lecture style. Each of the &#8220;seminars&#8221; is accompanied by a staged discussion between four actors: a developmental biologist, an AI researcher, a circuit neuroscientist and a robotics engineer (see the photo above). Theoretically, this is a great idea. In practice, it works only half of the time, and the book loses a bit of its natural flow because the direction is a bit missing. However, these small drawbacks are acceptable because the main ideas are interesting and enthusiastically presented.</p>



<p>Altogether, Hiesinger’s book is worth the time to read it, and I can recommend it to anybody interested in the intersection of biological brains, artificial neuronal networks and self-organized systems.</p>

                In September 2015, after a lengthy investigation, the Committee on Scientific Integrity (CSI) of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) advised the LUMC Board of Directors to ask for retraction of two publications because of major data manipulation in images.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-most-read-stories-2021">These are the most-read Science News stories of 2021</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Science News</em> drew over 21 million visitors to our website this year. Here’s a rundown of the most-read news stories and long reads of 2021.</p>



<h4>Top news stories</h4>



<h5>1. Space station detectors found the source of weird ‘blue jet’ lightning</h5>



<p>Instruments on the International Space Station detected the origins of an odd type of lightning called a blue jet. The bizarre bolt is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-station-detectors-found-source-weird-blue-jet-lightning">sparked by a “blue bang”</a> — a flash of bright blue light that may be brought on by the turbulent mixing of oppositely charged regions within a thundercloud (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 14</em>).</p>





<h5>2. A newfound quasicrystal formed in the first atomic bomb test</h5>



<p>The first atomic bomb test, in 1945, forged a peculiar, glassy material called trinitite — and within it, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal</a>. Quasicrystals’ atoms are arranged in an orderly structure like normal crystals, but the structure’s pattern doesn’t repeat (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p. 12</em>).</p>



<h5>3. An Indigenous people in the Philippines have the most Denisovan DNA</h5>



<p>The Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines set the record for the highest known level of Denisovan ancestry — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">about 5 percent of their DNA comes from the ancient hominids</a>. The finding suggests that several Denisovan populations independently reached Southeast Asia and interbred with <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups that arrived thousands of years later (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>4. Astronomers may have seen a star gulp down a black hole and explode</h5>



<p>In a first, astronomers caught a glimpse of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">a rare double cosmic cannibalism</a>: A star swallowed a black hole or neutron star, which then gobbled that star from within, resulting in an astonishing explosion (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Frog skin cells turned themselves into living machines</h5>



<p>Skin stem cells plucked from frog embryos organized themselves into miniature living robots, dubbed “xenobots,” that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">can swim, move around debris and even self-heal</a>. Xenobots may one day serve a useful purpose, but ethical questions need to be considered (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 8</em>).</p>

<h3>Favorite video</h3>



<p>Acrobatic rabbits bewitched online readers in our most-viewed YouTube video posted this year. The video — accompanying the story “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rabbit-handstand-front-paws-gene-defect-video">A gene defect may make rabbits do handstands instead of hop</a>” (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 13</em>) — shows a sauteur d’Alfort rabbit walking on its front paws (below). Such hop-less bunnies may have adopted the odd gait because of a mutation in a gene called <em>RORB</em>, scientists discovered.</p>

<h4>Top feature stories</h4>



<h5>1. New drugs that block a brain chemical are game changers for some migraine sufferers</h5>



<p>A class of drugs that inhibits a neurotransmitter called calcitonin gene-related peptide is helping some patients who suffer from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migraine-headache-new-drugs-block-brain-chemical">chronic, debilitating migraines</a> (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>2. Einstein’s theory of general relativity unveiled a dynamic and bizarre cosmos</h5>



<p>Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity has served as the bedrock of our understanding of the cosmos. In the last 100 years, scientists have confirmed its most radical predictions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">including black holes, gravitational waves and an expanding universe</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>3. Chemists are reimagining recycling to keep plastics out of landfills</h5>



<p>No matter people’s dedication to sorting and recycling plastics, most still end up in landfills because the materials are too difficult to transform into useful new products. Some chemists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">are trying to change that</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>).</p>



<h5>4. Psychology has struggled for a century to make sense of the mind</h5>



<p>In the last 100 years, psychologists and other social scientists have dug into the muddy “science of us” and developed conflicting theories about human thought and behavior. From the messy, contentious research bloomed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-behavior-human-mind-cognition-mental-health">insights into what makes humans tick</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 18</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Fossils and ancient DNA paint a vibrant picture of human origins</h5>



<p>From the Taung Child to Lucy, the last century of paleoanthropology has sketched a rough timeline of how humans came to be. Scientists now agree that human evolution has its roots in Africa, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">many mysteries in our history remain to be solved</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 20</em>).</p>

                <p>A range of cool discoveries, technological milestones and downright bizarre scientific feats — cows can be potty trained? — gave us a chance to gab about something other than the pandemic.</p>



<h3>Fusion of the future</h3>



<p>Hopes for making nuclear fusion the clean energy source of the future got a boost in August when a fusion experiment <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">released 1.3 million joules of energy</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 11</em>). A big hurdle for fusion energy has been achieving ignition — the point when a fusion reaction produces more energy than required to trigger it. The test released about 70 percent of the energy used to set off the reaction, the closest yet to the break-even milestone.</p>

<h3>Pig-to-human kidney transplant</h3>



<p>In a first, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">a pig kidney was attached to a human</a>, and the organ functioned normally during 54 hours of monitoring (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 6</em>). This successful surgical experiment marks a milestone toward true animal-to-human transplants, which would broaden the supply of lifesaving organs for people in need.</p>

<h3>Death stars</h3>



<p>In a bone-chilling event, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">astronomers caught a star swallowing a nearby black hole</a>, or perhaps a neutron star, and then getting eaten by its own meal. The resulting spectacular explosion left behind a black hole (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6</em>). Astronomers had theorized that such a star-eat-star supernova was possible, but had never observed one.</p>

<h3>Living machines</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">Frog cells transformed themselves into tiny living robots</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 8</em>). Scientists removed skin stem cells from frog embryos and watched the cells organize into little blobs dubbed “xenobots” that could swim around and even repair themselves, plus move particles in the environment. Xenobots might someday serve a useful purpose, such as cleaning up waterways, the scientists say.</p>

<h3>Brain teaser</h3>



<p>Scientists got an entirely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-map-neurons-connections-google-harvard">new view of the brain</a> when they took a tiny piece of a woman’s brain and mapped the varied shapes of 50,000 cells and their 100 million or so connections (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 6</em>).

<h3>Pluses are minuses</h3>



<p>People often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-numbers-people-add-default-subtract-better">add even when subtracting is the way to go</a>, scientists found after asking volunteers to tackle a variety of puzzles and problems, including stabilizing a Lego structure and optimizing a travel itinerary (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 8</em>). The tendency to think in pluses instead of minuses could be at the root of modern-­day excesses like cluttered homes, the researchers speculate.</p>

<h3>Potty training cows</h3>



<p>Can farmers reduce pollution by sending cows to the loo? The answer might very well be yes. In a unique experiment, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-cattle-pee-potty-training-bathroom-pollution-ammonia">trained cows to answer nature’s call</a> by using a bathroom stall that gathers urine (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 24</em>). In the future, collected cow urine, which could otherwise pollute the environment, might be used to make fertilizer.</p>

<h4>Crystal clear</h4>



<p>The intense heat and pressure of the first atomic bomb test, in 1945, left behind a glassy substance known as trinitite — and something even stranger. Within the trinitite, scientists discovered, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal</a> (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p. 12</em>). Quasicrystals have an orderly structure like a normal crystal, but that structure doesn’t repeat. Previously, these crystals had been found only in meteorites or made in the lab.</p>

<h3>Case of the missing genes</h3>



<p>A foul-smelling Southeast Asian plant named <em>Sapria himalayana </em>has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reeking-parasitic-sapria-plant-lost-body-much-genetic-code">lost about 44 percent of the genes found in most other flowering plants</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 13</em>). <em>S. himalayana</em> parasitizes other plants to get nutrients, so it’s not so surprising that it has entirely purged its chloroplast DNA. Chloroplasts are the structures where photosynthesis, or food making, typically occurs. <em>S. himalayana</em> appears to steal more than nutrients — more than 1 percent of its genes come from other plants, perhaps current or past hosts.</p>

<h4>DNA accounting</h4>



<p>Identical twins may not be genetically identical, after all. They differ by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-identical-twins-dont-have-identical-dna-genetics">5.2 genetic changes on average</a>, researchers reported (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 15</em>). That means differences between such twins may not be solely due to environmental influences. In other DNA accounting, scientists estimated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-our-dna-is-uniquely-human">1.5 percent to 7 percent of modern human DNA</a> is uniquely human, distinct from the DNA of Neandertals, Denisovans and other ancient relatives (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 7</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">How some of 2021’s major science stories evolved over time</a></h4>

              
                <p>A story doesn’t necessarily end once it goes online. Here, <em>Science News</em> offers status updates on some evolving stories we reported on earlier this year.</p>



<h4>Tulsa massacre answers</h4>



<p>This year marked the 100th anniversary of a race massacre in Tulsa, Okla., in which a mob of white people invaded the prosperous Black neighborhood of Greenwood. The death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, though the exact number is unknown, as is the exact location where victims were buried. In May, Helen Thompson reported on a collaboration between scientists, historians and community leaders to investigate an area in Oaklawn Cemetery that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tulsa-1921-race-massacre-mass-grave-greenwood-archaeology-dna">may hold a mass grave of victims</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/21</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: In June, archaeologists announced they had found 34 coffins at Oaklawn and were analyzing remains from 19 of them. Preliminary findings suggest the remains belonged to children and adults, forensic anthropology lead Phoebe Stubblefield said June 25 at a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=338768600964239">news conference</a>. Based on skull facial features, “ancestry so far when we can detect it has been primarily of African descent,” she said. One man had a bullet embedded in his shoulder, along with trauma consistent with expectations for the massacre’s victims, the project’s archaeology lead, Kary Stackelbeck, told <em>Science News</em> in November. The full analysis, expected to be released in early 2022, aims to determine the race, sex, age and any trauma patterns of all the recovered individuals. Those results will help determine the project’s next steps.</p>





<p>“This process has been a very sobering, very powerful experience,” Kavin Ross, chairman of the public oversight committee, said at the news conference. “We are so hopeful for more findings.”</p>





<h4>Finally, a malaria vaccine</h4>



<p>In June, Erin Garcia de Jesús reported that two malaria vaccine candidates <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-vaccine-live-parasites-drugs-results-small-trial">showed promise in small clinical trials</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/21</em>). One jab — tested in children in Burkina Faso — had 77 percent efficacy against malaria symptoms. The other, tested in adults from the United States, had around 87 percent efficacy against infection when paired with infection-fighting drugs. The results sparked hope that the world’s first approved malaria vaccine would soon become a reality.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Well, it happened, but for a different vaccine. In October, <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk">the World Health Organization gave a thumbs up to a vaccine</a> that was further along in testing, approving it for children who live in sub-Saharan Africa and other places with the deadliest species of the malaria-causing parasite, <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. Of the estimated 409,000 people who died from malaria in 2019, two-thirds were under age 5. Although groundbreaking, the vaccine — called RTS,S or Mosquirix — is not a magic bullet. The four-dose regimen prevents only about 4 in 10 malaria cases and 3 in 10 severe cases. Still, RTS,S plus existing tools could “save tens of thousands of young lives each year,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in an October 6 statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>GM mosquitoes hatch in Florida</h4>



<p>After about a decade of fierce debate, genetically modified mosquitoes flew free in the United States for the first time. Starting in April, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">modified eggs were deposited in several test spots</a> in the Florida Keys, Susan Milius reported (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). Designed as living pesticides by the biotech company Oxitec, male GM <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes mate with local females of this hard-to-eradicate species and pass along a gene that kills daughters in the wild before they can bite. Sons grow up to trick more females into doomed mating. Eventually, the population of this spreader of dengue and Zika should dwindle.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: GM males that hatched from eggs succeed in wooing Floridian females, test watchers report. After two temporary stops for big storms, managers restarted periodic releases and kept tests running into November. In August, Oxitec asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to allow two more years of testing in the Keys. The company also asked to start testing in to “up to 84,600 total acres” in California, which identified its first <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquito in 2013. Today, the pest is scattered throughout the state. In California, travelers account for all of the state’s dengue and Zika cases. But <em>Ae. aegypti</em> might someday spread these diseases within the state.</p>

<h4>Wildfire extinction threats</h4>



<p>In March, John Pickrell reported on how Australia’s wildlife was faring a year after the country’s devastating 2019–20 wildfires. Experts feared that more than 500 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">species may have become endangered</a> — and some even extinct (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>). While some of these species were charismatic marsupials such as the koala, many were plants and invertebrates that typically garner far less attention.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: A larger analysis published in July showed that <a href="https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/media/b2oi2hyc/8-3-1-assessment-of-the-impacts-of-the-2019-20-wildfires-of-southern-and-eastern-australia-on-invertebrate-species-final-report_v3.pdf">as many as 14,000 invertebrate species</a> had some part of their ranges badly burned by the fires. Jess Marsh, an arachnologist at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, says that researchers are formally adding 60 of about 240 invertebrate species that earlier in the year they suspected had become endangered to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List of Threatened Species</a>. But in a rare piece of good news, surveys in March and September turned up multiple individuals of two species that researchers had feared were extinct: the Kangaroo Island assassin spider (<em>Zephyrarchaea austini</em>) and Palethorpe’s pinwheel snail (<em>Rhophodon palethorpei</em>). Finding two assassin spiders that had managed to hang on in a tiny patch of unburnt habitat was “amazing,” Marsh says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>While a flurry of missions crowded around Mars this year, some lesser-explored parts of the solar system are about to get fresh eyes.</p>



<p>Three countries visited the Red Planet in 2021, sending orbiters, landers, rovers and even a helicopter. The United Arab Emirates successfully put <a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/">its first interplanetary spacecraft, called Hope</a>, into orbit in February, to study Mars’ climate. China’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">Zhurong rover</a> has been trundling around the planet’s surface since May, studying the local geology and searching for underground water ice (<em>SN Online: 5/19/21</em>). And NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover, which landed</a> in February, has been collaborating with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">a helicopter called Ingenuity</a> to explore an ancient lake bed and collect rocks for a future delivery mission to Earth (<em>SN Online: 2/17/21</em>; <em>SN Online: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>But while all eyes were on Mars, other missions are embarking on journeys to study even more far-flung places. After years of delays and billions of dollars over budget, the James Webb Space Telescope is finally set to launch, no earlier than December 25, to probe the universe’s earliest galaxies, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">among other things</a> (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26</em>).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, spacecraft are heading off to visit 11 asteroids in the solar system in search of clues to the origins of the planets, and water and life on Earth, as well as ways to keep our planet safe from errant space rocks.</p>





<p>Let’s meet those rock explorers.</p>

<h3>Lucy</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">NASA’s Lucy spacecraft</a> launched on October 16 on the first mission to explore <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-jupiters-orbit-goes-its-own-way">Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids</a>, two groups of space rocks that share an orbit with Jupiter around the sun (<em>SN Online: 10/15/21</em>;<em> SN: 5/13/17, p. 5</em>). The asteroids occupy areas known as Lagrange points, where the gravitational pulls of Jupiter and the sun cancel each other out. These regions are like cosmic dead zones and have been collecting planetary flotsam for billions of years. Those asteroids and other bits of debris are like fossils of the early solar system. (Fittingly, the mission was named for the famous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucy-species-brain-skull-heralded-rise-long-childhoods-hominids">hominid fossil Lucy</a>.)</p>



<p>Over the next 12 years, Lucy will make five flybys to observe seven Trojan asteroids, plus one asteroid in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter for good measure. By the end of its mission, Lucy will have visited more objects than any other NASA mission.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3>DART</h3>



<p>The next mission to head out was NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, which launched November 24 to deliberately ram into an asteroid in an attempt to alter its orbit. That collision will test a technique for deflecting dangerous asteroids that could crash into Earth in the future.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s destination is a pair of asteroids called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-moon-name-nasa-course-deflection-mission">Didymos and Dimorphos</a> (<em>SN: 8/15/20, p. 5</em>). In late September 2022, DART will crash-land on Dimorphos while moving at about 6.6 kilometers per second, which hopefully will shift its orbit around Didymos. Astronomers on Earth will be able to tell if the test worked by looking for a change in Dimorphos’ orbit time, and the European Space Agency will send a follow-up probe called Hera in 2024.</p>

<h3>Psyche</h3>



<p>Last up is Psyche, which is set to launch in August 2022. The NASA spacecraft will visit 16 Psyche, an asteroid that seems to be made up almost entirely of metal. It may be the exposed core of a protoplanet that lost its outer mantle and crust in cosmic collisions long ago. Since scientists can’t send a mission to Earth’s core, a trip to 16 Psyche may be the closest we can get to a journey to the center of the Earth.</p>



<p>Psyche will arrive at its destination in 2026 and spend 21 months measuring the asteroid’s magnetic field and composition from orbit. One question is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/abf63b">whether the asteroid truly is a planetary core</a>. Even if not, the asteroid is a new kind of world that no spacecraft has visited before.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">How electric vehicles offered hope as climate challenges grew</a></h4>

              
                <p>This was another year of bleak climate news. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">Record heat waves baked the Pacific Northwest</a>. Wildfires raged in California, Oregon, Washington and neighboring states. Tropical cyclones rapidly intensified in the Pacific Ocean. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">devastating flash floods</a> inundated Western Europe and China. Human-caused climate change is sending the world hurtling down a road to more extreme weather events, and we’re running out of time to pump the brakes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in August</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>The world needs to dramatically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and fast, if there’s any hope of preventing worse and more frequent extreme weather events. That means shifting to renewable sources of energy — and, importantly, decarbonizing transportation, a sector that is now responsible for about a quarter of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions.</p>



<p>But the path to that cleaner future is daunting, clogged with political and societal roadblocks, as well as scientific obstacles. Perhaps that’s one reason why the electric vehicle — already on the road, already navigating many of these roadblocks — swerved so dramatically into the climate solutions spotlight in 2021.</p>



<p>Just a few years ago, many automakers thought electric vehicles, or EVs, might be a passing fad, says Gil Tal, director of the Plug-in Hybrid &amp; Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis. “It’s now clear to everyone that [EVs are] here to stay.”</p>





<p>Globally, EV sales surged in the first half of 2021, increasing by 160 percent compared with the previous year. Even in 2020 — when most car sales were down due to the COVID-19 pandemic — EV sales were up 46 percent relative to 2019. Meanwhile, automakers from General Motors to Volkswagen to Nissan have outlined plans to launch new EV models over the next decade: GM pledged to go all-electric by 2035, Honda by 2040. Ford introduced electric versions of its iconic Mustang and F-150 pickup truck.</p>



<p>Consumer demand for EVs isn’t actually driving the surge in sales, Tal says. The real engine is a change in supply due to government policies pushing automakers to boost their EV production. The European Union’s toughened CO<sub>2</sub> emissions laws for the auto industry went into effect in 2021, and automakers have already bumped up new EV production in the region. China mandated in 2020 that EVs make up 40 percent of new car sales by 2030. Costa Rica has set official phase-out targets for internal combustion engines.</p>



<p>In the United States, where transportation has officially supplanted power generation as the top greenhouse gas–emitting sector, President Joe Biden’s administration set a goal this year of having 50 percent of new U.S. vehicle sales be electric — both plug-in hybrid and all-electric — by 2030. That’s a steep rise over EVs’ roughly 2.5 percent share of new cars sold in the United States today. In September, California announced that by 2035 all new cars and passenger trucks sold in the state must be zero-emission.</p>



<p>There are concrete signs that automakers are truly committing to EVs. In September, Ford announced plans to build two new complexes in Tennessee and Kentucky to produce electric trucks and batteries. Climate change–related energy crises, such as the February failure of Texas’ power system, may also boost interest in EVs, Ford CEO Jim Farley said September 28 on the podcast Columbia Energy Exchange.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more extreme weather events with global warming, and so people are looking at these vehicles not just for propulsion but for &#8230; other benefits,” Farley said. “One of the most popular features of the F-150 Lightning is the fact that you can power your house for three days” with the truck’s battery.</p>



<h4>More to navigate</h4>



<p>Although the EV market is growing fast, it’s still not fast enough to meet the Paris Agreement goals, the International Energy Agency reported this year. For the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 — when carbon emissions added to the atmosphere are balanced by carbon removal — <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050">EVs would need to climb from the current 5 percent of global car sales to 60 percent by 2030</a>, the agency found.</p>



<p>As for the United States, even if the Biden administration’s plan for EVs comes to fruition, the country’s transportation sector will still fall short of its emissions targets, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. To hit those targets, electric cars would need to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00921-7">make up 90 percent of new U.S. car sales by 2050</a> — or people would need to drive a lot less.</p>



<p>And to truly supplant fossil fuel vehicles, electric options need to meet several benchmarks. Prices for new and used EVs must come down. Charging stations must be available and affordable to all, including people who don’t live in homes where they can plug in. And battery ranges must be extended. Average ranges have been improving. Just five or so years ago, cars needed a recharge after about 100 miles; today the average is about 250 miles, roughly the distance from Washington, D.C., to New York City. But limited ranges and too few charging stations remain a sticking point.</p>



<p>Today’s batteries also require metals that are scarce, difficult to access or produced in mining operations rife with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-cobalt-mining-drc-needs-urgent-attention">serious human rights issues</a>. Although there, too, solutions may be on the horizon, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycled-lithium-ion-battery-charge">finding ways to recycle batteries</a> to alleviate materials shortages (<em>SN: 12/4/21, p. 4</em>).</p>



<p>EVs on their own are nowhere near enough to forestall the worst effects of climate change. But it won’t be possible to slow global warming without them. </p>



<p>And in a year with a lot of grim climate news — both devastating extreme events and maddeningly stalled political action — EVs offered one glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>“We have the technology. It’s not dependent on some technology that’s not developed yet,” Tal says. “The hope is that now we are way more willing to [transition to EVs] than at any time before.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/12/22/our-most-popular-posts-of-2021/">Our Most Popular Posts Of 2021</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>This time last year, we wrote that Covid-19 had rendered 2020 a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/22/our-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2020/">year like no other</a>. Yet it quickly became clear that 2021 was going to be pretty similar, with the pandemic continuing to affect the day-to-day lives even of those of us who were lucky enough not to contract the virus. It’s not surprising, then, that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/08/developments-in-psychologys-covid-research/">much of our coverage</a> this year has focused on the work of psychologists studying the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/09/first-hand-reports-of-brain-fog-highlight-struggles-of-those-living-with-long-covid/">effects of Covid-19</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/15/domestic-violence-increased-during-lockdown-in-the-united-states/">lockdowns</a>.</p>



<p>But the year also began with some hope: vaccines had just been approved, and were being rolled out across the world. Unfortunately, alongside this massive public health effort there was a proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation. So we’ve also focused on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">efforts</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">understand how false information spreads</a> — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/06/how-should-you-talk-to-a-loved-one-who-believes-in-conspiracy-theories/">and how to combat it</a>.</p>



<p>For me, the year began with hope of another kind: on 1<sup>st</sup> January I became a father. It’s no coincidence that a lot of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/20/describing-groups-to-children-using-generic-language-can-accidentally-teach-them-social-stereotypes/">my</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/15/at-just-16-months-old-toddlers-will-reward-someone-for-acting-fairly/">own</a> posts this year have been about child development. And while I was off on parental leave, <em>Research Digest </em>welcomed Emma Barratt, whose fascinating articles covered everything from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">video games</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/22/body-maps-reveal-the-range-of-sensations-and-feelings-experienced-during-hallucinations/">hallucinations</a> — and yes, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">Covid-19</a>.</p>



<p>So it’s been a year of ups and downs — and this is reflected in our most popular posts of the year, which are as wide-ranging as ever&#8230;</p>



<span id="more-44927"></span>



<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/07/hand-gestures-help-students-mentally-organise-new-information/"><strong>10) Hand Gestures Help Students Mentally Organise New Information</strong></a></p>



<p>Teachers might want to consider using more hand gestures in class, according to this study we covered in September. The researchers found that students were better at making inferences based on material they had just learned if their instructor had used “structure gestures”, which allocate spoken information to physical space. The team thinks this is because these gestures provide a scaffold that students can use to mentally organise information.  </p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/"><strong>9) Belief In Conspiracy Theories Is Associated With Lower Levels Of Critical Thinking</strong></a></p>



<p>This year’s vaccination drive was a huge public health undertaking — and one that inevitably attracted a small but vocal group of conspiracy theorists. This post from February looked at one factor associated with believing in conspiracy theories: reduced levels of critical thinking. Although the work is limited by its correlational design, it suggests that fostering critical thinking skills may help to protect people against conspiratorial thinking. And for practical advice on how to talk to loved ones who may have fallen for a conspiracy theory, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/06/how-should-you-talk-to-a-loved-one-who-believes-in-conspiracy-theories/">check out our feature</a> from July.</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/05/it-turns-out-you-can-bullshit-a-bullshitter-after-all/"><strong>8) It Turns Out You Can Bullshit A Bullshitter After All</strong></a></p>



<p>We all love a pithy saying — but they’re not always the most reliable sources of information about how the world works. This year, for instance, researchers found that it’s not true to say that “You can’t bullshit a bullshitter”. Using the delightfully-named “Bullshitting Frequency Scale” and “Bullshit Receptivity Scale”, the team found that people who bullshit out of a desire to impress or persuade others are also more susceptible to believing bullshit themselves. (See also “Money can’t buy happiness” — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/01/cant-buy-happiness-research-on-money-digested/">it’s a bit more complicated than that</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/22/the-experience-of-being-tolerated-rather-than-accepted-leads-to-lower-wellbeing-among-ethnic-minority-groups/"><strong>7) The Experience Of Being “Tolerated”, Rather Than Accepted, Leads To Lower Wellbeing Among Ethnic Minority Groups</strong></a></p>



<p>Tolerance is often seen as a virtue — and yet, if you “tolerate” someone, you’re not exactly giving them a warm welcome. This study found that for people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the experience of being tolerated is actually closer to discrimination than it is to acceptance.</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/"><strong>6) How To Cope With Failure, According To Psychology</strong></a></p>



<p>Countless articles tell us how to set ourselves up for success and live our best lives. But it’s equally important — or perhaps <em>more </em>important — that we learn how to deal with the inevitable failures. So in March we highlighted five evidence-based tips for coping with failure.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/25/study-explores-personalities-of-people-with-adult-separation-anxiety-a-neglected-clinical-syndrome/"><strong>5) Study Explores Personalities Of People With Adult Separation Anxiety, A “Neglected Clinical Syndrome”</strong></a></p>



<p>Separation anxiety in children is a well-known phenomenon. But a paper we covered in October looked at how it manifests in adults — and whether it is related to any particular personality traits. The team found links between adult separation anxiety and a number of personality measures, including negative emotionality, absorption, and aggression.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/24/cats-like-to-sit-in-squares-even-ones-that-are-really-optical-illusions/"><strong>4) Cats Like To Sit In Squares — Even Ones That Are Really Optical Illusions</strong></a></p>



<p>A story about cats <em>and</em> optical illusions?! No wonder it was one of our most read of the year.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/27/we-think-anger-is-a-sign-of-guilt-but-it-may-actually-be-a-better-sign-of-innocence/"><strong>3) We Think Anger Is A Sign Of Guilt — But It May Actually Be A Better Sign Of Innocence</strong></a></p>



<p>We tend to think that an accused person who makes an angry denial is more likely to be guilty than one who reacts calmly. And yet, this study showed, anger isn’t a good sign of guilt — in fact, it may be more likely that an angry person is innocent. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/17/ghosting-is-more-acceptable-to-people-with-dark-triad-traits/"><strong>2) Ghosting Is More Acceptable To People With “Dark Triad” Traits</strong></a></p>



<p>What kind of person thinks it’s OK to end a relationship by just disappearing? This study provided some clues, finding that people with Machiavellian and psychopathic traits are particularly likely to think that ghosting is acceptable.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/04/the-learning-styles-myth-is-still-prevalent-among-educators-and-it-shows-no-sign-of-going-away/"><strong>1) The “Learning Styles” Myth Is Still Prevalent Among Educators — And It Shows No Sign of Going Away</strong></a></p>



<p>I remember completing an exercise at school that taught me whether I was a “visual”, “auditory”, or “kinaesthetic” learner. The only issue? It’s simply not true that we each have a specific &#8220;learning style&#8221; that works best for us. And yet most educators continue to believe this myth. This paper reviewed existing work on the topic, finding that a whopping 89% of teachers or trainees across studies subscribed to the idea of learning styles.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it from us for this year — we&#8217;ll see you back here in 2022!</p>

                <h3>What am I really doing?</h3>
<p>RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.</p>
<p>Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
</code></pre></div>

<p>Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.</p>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. </p>
<p>I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained/</p>
<p>Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. </p>
<p>The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. </p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/1_efxp_yDIauT01oILEJjrVw-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When patients start dialysis, the overall goal is for these treatments to become part of their lives and try to maintain as much of their daily routine including family commitments and employment. Unfortunately, this situation is not the norm. It is known that end-stage kidney disease impacts quality of life and is often associated with feelings of loss of control or loss of their previous routines.  Employment has a role in feelings of self-sufficiency and productiveness beyond the financial impact. Maintaining employment can be difficult with the time-consuming treatments, disease-related symptoms, or the physical requirements of previous employment. <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2">Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em></a> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding employment rates in adults receiving dialysis or a kidney transplant. They found between January 1966 and August 2020 the employment rate for dialysis patients was 26.3%. This is similar to what is seen in individual countries. <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/13/2/265.long">Erickson <em>et al.</em></a> had a similar percentage (23-24%) among patients starting dialysis in the United States between 1996 and 2013. Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em> also examined employment around the time of transplant.  They found the employment rate was 36.9% pre-transplant and 38.2% post-transplant.</p>
<p>In this article, the predictors for employment during dialysis and post-transplant were male gender, absence of diabetes, peritoneal dialysis, and higher educational level.  This correlates with an older study from 1996 by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8678064/">Curtin <em>et al.</em></a> In this study, they conducted a survey of dialysis patients to identify characteristics of those employed vs unemployed.  They found that pre-dialysis employment and higher educational level are associated with a significantly higher likelihood of employment rates. Those patients with higher education usually have white-collar jobs, receive salaries greater than disability benefits, often do not have physical requirements related to their work, and have jobs that can provide accommodations for disabilities. While there may be some options such as disability, this often will not provide the same income level as before.</p>
<p>Looking at the dialysis population, many are on disability because they find it too difficult to continue working because of symptoms from end-stage kidney disease, post-dialysis fatigue, or the inability to be able to take on a different role at work. There are several jobs that individuals are not eligible for once they are on certain medications or have certain conditions. Currently, there are not many options for vocational rehabilitation for individuals that can no longer perform their job duties due to having kidney disease.  This further puts a burden on those with reduced resources. Home dialysis modalities may help with some of the challenges by allowing patients for flexibility with the timing of treatments to maintain a routine work schedule. In the <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2"><em>BMC Nephrology</em> article</a>, peritoneal dialysis was associated with employment and most likely similar patterns would be seen with home hemodialysis. But, this won’t address all the challenges that impact employment. Advocacy for vocational rehab or for work accommodations such as part-time schedules or to adjust for individuals&#8217; physical limitations needs to be part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Posttransplantation, there is an expectation that individuals can return to more normal routines as they are freed up from dialysis treatments. For those that had been on dialysis for many years prior to transplantation or had to stop working, there may be some challenges of re-entering the workforce. These are considerations that should be part of discussions with health care providers and patients.</p>
<p>What can we do as a nephrology community to help patients stay employed or rejoin the workforce? What resources do patients need?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2021-big-if-true">These discoveries from 2021, if true, could shake up science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Discoveries in 2021 dared the world to consider grand possibilities in physics, space and the origins of life. Will these bold claims hold up to scrutiny?</p>



<h4>Antistarry night</h4>



<p>Scientists may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-stars-antistars-milky-way-galaxy-space-astronomy">spotted stars made of antimatter</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 8</em>). Finding antistars challenges a basic tenet of cosmology — that the vast majority of the universe’s antimatter, matter’s oppositely charged doppelgänger, was destroyed long ago. In 10 years of observations from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, researchers found 14 points of light emitting gamma rays at energies that are expected when matter and antimatter meet and annihilate each other — a process that could happen on the surface of antistars. The discovery hints that substantial amounts of antimatter may have survived. But proving the existence of antistars will be extremely difficult because, aside from the studied gamma rays, the light such stars give off would look just like the light from normal stars.</p>



<h4>Misbehaving muons</h4>



<p>Nothing gets physicists more excited than evidence of a new fundamental particle. Researchers with the Muon g–2 experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., flung billions of muons around the lab’s giant magnet and found that the rate at which the orientation of the muons’ magnetic poles wobbled strayed from theoretical predictions. The odd behavior suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">hidden particles are influencing the muons’ magnetic properties</a>, challenging the standard model of particle physics describing the universe’s fundamental forces and elementary particles (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/21/21, p. 6</em>). But it will take more data to convince physicists, who are still refining their predictions of muon behavior.</p>

<h4>Cosmic curve ball</h4>



<p>In other news that may upend our understanding of the cosmos, scientists detected <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-giant-arc-3-billion-light-years-long-cosmology-space">a giant arc of galaxies</a> stretching across more than 3 billion light-years. Such a finding is counter to the assumption that matter in the universe is evenly distributed on large scales (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 9</em>). The arc, invisible to the human eye, came to light in an analysis of about 40,000 quasars — very bright cores of distant galaxies. But some skeptics argue that the arc may be just an artifact of the human tendency to pick up patterns where none actually exist.</p>

<h4>Early arrival</h4>



<p>This year brought new evidence that humans arrived in the Americas more than 15,000 years earlier than traditionally thought, throwing support behind last year’s claim that humans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-claims-big-news-if-confirmed-2020">reached North America by about 33,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/20 &amp; 1/2/21, p. 35</em>). In May, researchers reported that animal bones excavated at a cave in Mexico date to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">between about 33,000 and 28,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16</em>). Chipped and sharp-edged stones that may have functioned as tools were found near the bones, hinting that humans had been in the area. And the discovery of fossilized human footprints suggests people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">roamed what’s now New Mexico around 23,000 to 21,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 12</em>). If the tracks’ age is verified, it would show that humans were in North America during the pinnacle of the last ice age.</p>

<h4>Oldest animal fossils?</h4>



<p>Tiny tubes found in 890-million-year old rocks might be remnants of sea sponges. If that claim holds up, the tubes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-fossils-tubes-890-million-year-old-rock-ancient-sea-sponge">would push animal origins back by about 350 million years</a> to an oxygen-poor period considered unsuitable for animal life (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 6</em>). But some researchers aren’t convinced that the fossils are sea sponges. Skeptics point to the lack of mineralized skeletal parts, known as spicules, that are typical features of sea sponges, and the fact that many non­animal organisms can make similar tubes.</p>

<h4>Extragalactic planet</h4>



<p>Astronomers may have detected the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-exoplanet-discovery-outside-milky-way-galaxy-astronomy">first known planet outside of the Milky Way</a>, in a galaxy about 28 million light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 7</em>). Traditional exoplanet-hunting techniques don’t work well for such distances, so researchers looked to a type of paired star system known as an X-ray binary, which emits bright X-rays. A planet crossing, or transiting, in front of such a system would temporarily block those X-rays, alerting astronomers to the planet’s presence. Some scientists are skeptical because the discovery relied, metaphorically, on many stars to align: The planet needed to transit the X-ray binary while its orbit was perfectly in line with Earth’s point of view, just when a telescope was looking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/millipede-most-legs-eumillipes-persephone">A 1,306-legged millipede is the first to live up to its name</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millipedes, as we’ve known them, have been a lie. The Latin name for the arthropods implies an impressive set of 1,000 feet. Yet no millipede with more than 750 legs has ever been found, until now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02447-0">first millipede that lives up to its name</a> uses its 1,306 little legs to tunnel through soil deep beneath the semi-arid scrubland of Western Australia, researchers report December 16 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Dubbed <em>Eumillipes persephone</em>, it’s the leggiest creature ever known to crawl Earth.</p>



<p>Researchers nabbed the specimen and seven other curiously long, threadlike millipedes by dropping cups baited with leaf litter into drill holes used for mineral prospecting that were up to 60 meters deep. Eventually, the creatures were sent to entomologist Paul Marek at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg for a closer look.&nbsp;</p>

Marek et al/<em>Scientific Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The pale, cream-colored millipedes lack eyes, and massive antennae protrude from their drill bit<strong>–</strong>shaped heads — all signs of a subterranean lifestyle, Marek says. While inspecting a 95-millimeter-long female under a microscope, Marek realized he beheld something special. “I was like, Oh my god this has more than 1,000 legs,” he says. With 1,306 tiny feet in total, the specimen has nearly double that of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leggiest-animal-champ-millipede-located-after-79-year-gap">the previous record-holder</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/06</em>). “It’s pretty astounding.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers suspect <em>E. persephone’s</em> elongate, leg-packed body helps the creature maneuver through soil in up to eight different directions at once, like a tangled strand of mobile pasta. “We suspect it feeds on fungi,” Marek says, but the types of fungi living in these deep, dark habitats are unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <em>E. persephone </em>still holds many secrets, Marek is sure of one thing: “Textbooks are going to have to be changed,” he says. Paragraphs on millipedes will no longer require the caveat that technically, the name is a misnomer. “We finally have a real millipede.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">The omicron variant is surging. Here’s what we’ve learned so far</a></h4>

              
                <p>With omicron spreading globally at a dizzying pace, scientists are scrambling to learn as much as they can about the latest worrisome variant of the coronavirus. First spotted in South Africa and Botswana at the end of November, omicron is already poised to soon become the dominant variant — dethroning delta — in some regions, public health officials warn. In a few places, it already has. So answers, including how sick does omicron make people and how well do vaccines hobble it, can’t come fast enough.</p>



<p>A rising tide of data on omicron is beginning to provide a glimpse at what’s ahead as we enter year three of the global pandemic, though many questions linger. And with many people preparing to gather with family and friends for holidays, experts are bracing for yet more case surges, compounded by already high infection rates in some countries linked to the still-prevalent delta variant.</p>

<p>Omicron’s collision with the holidays and travel is “a perfect storm,” Thomas Denny, a vaccine expert at Duke University, said December 16 in a call with journalists. At this point, even vaccinated people should be taking precautions, such as wearing masks indoors and testing before family gatherings, he said. “This new variant has thrown us a curve ball at the worst possible time.”</p>





<p>Still, amid the worries, there are positive signals that vaccines can still protect people from the worst of COVID-19. As many countries hurtle toward a season of omicron, here’s what researchers are learning so far.</p>



<h3>Omicron is spreading fast, already outstripping delta in some countries.</h3>



<p>Omicron’s high number of mutations in important viral proteins, and signs that the variant was behind a surge of COVID-19 cases in South Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">quickly raised red flags</a>, hurling the pandemic into yet another tsunami of uncertainty (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>In the weeks since omicron emerged, the variant has been identified in more than 85 countries. Some, like Denmark, have identified some cases that <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101146">date before South African researchers revealed omicron’s presence to the world</a> — a hint that the variant had already slipped across borders from wherever it originated before its November discovery. In many of these places, omicron infections are rising fast.</p>



<p>Omicron is responsible for nearly all new COVID-19 cases in South Africa, and is already the predominant version of the coronavirus in London. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that omicron will be the <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-assessment-further-emergence-omicron-18th-risk-assessment-december-2021.pdf">most common variant across the European Union</a> by mid-January.</p>



<p>In the United States, omicron now appears to reign. The variant was responsible for <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">an estimated 73.2 percent of new infections</a> across the country for the week ending December 18, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s predictions. That’s up from an estimated 12.6 percent the previous week and 0.7 percent the week ending December 4. Omicron now accounts for an estimated 92 percent of new cases in New York and New Jersey and 96.3 percent in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.</p>



<p>Previous data suggested that estimates of omicron&#8217;s prevalence from earlier in December were lower. It takes time to collect and analyze viruses from patient samples, Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said in a December 14 call with journalists. So the numbers can &#8220;change quickly as more data comes in off machines in real time.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that in mind, omicron is likely to worsen the surge that is unfolding across the United States. Some places, including New York City, are already seeing large spikes in COVID-19 cases with numbers rising fast. It currently takes about two days for the number of omicron cases to double, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said December 15 in a White House news briefing. Highly infectious delta, in comparison, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">doubled every two weeks</a> at the beginning of its surge in the United States (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>It was a huge question whether omicron would compete with delta for global dominance. Now, some real-world studies show that omicron is coming on strong in many regions. Preliminary data from the United Kingdom show that omicron <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf">is around 3.2 times as likely to spread among households as delta is</a>, researchers with Public Health England, a U.K. health agency, reported December 9.</p>



<p>And people exposed to omicron may get sick faster — and therefore be able to spread the virus sooner — than people exposed to other variants. An analysis of an omicron outbreak at a company Christmas party in Norway found that the median time that a person exposed at the party <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101147">developed symptoms was three days</a>, researchers reported December 16 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. It takes slightly longer for delta infections to cause symptoms — around four days — and about five days for non-delta variants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons behind omicron’s swift spread are still fuzzy. It could be because omicron is more transmissible than delta or because it can dodge parts of the immune response. Or, more likely, it could be a mixture of both, says Kartik Chandran, a virologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Some preliminary studies done in lab-grown cells hint that omicron may turn out to be more transmissible than delta, though how much more is unclear. One reason may be because the new variant might <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267755v1.full.pdf">make more copies of itself inside host cells than other variants do</a>.</p>



<p>Omicron may also replicate <a href="https://www.med.hku.hk/en/news/press/20211215-omicron-sars-cov-2-infection">particularly well in bronchial cells</a> — which line the tubes that deliver air to the lungs — compared with how well it grows in lung tissue, researchers reported December 15 in preliminary data from the University of Hong Kong. If the virus is growing well in bronchial cells, symptoms like coughing could release a lot of viruses into the air.&nbsp;</p>





<h3>It’s still unclear if omicron causes milder disease.</h3>



<p>The Hong Kong results may be a sign that omicron might be less likely than variants like delta to invade the lungs of infected people and cause severe illness, but that’s far from definitive. “I don’t think you can really say that the virus is going to be less virulent based on that data alone,” Chandran says. “We’re going to have to wait and see what happens to people.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some hopeful hints from South Africa that omicron might cause less severe disease than what delta causes. But experts caution that it’s far too early to make solid conclusions.</p>



<p>“We should not be lulled into any type of complacency,” Ryan Noach, CEO of Discovery Health, a health insurance provider based in South Africa, said December 14 in a news conference.</p>



<p>The optimism comes because hospitalizations in South Africa aren’t rising as fast as they did in previous surges. What’s more, anecdotal reports from the country suggest that fewer hospitalized patients in the current wave <a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/news/tshwane-district-omicron-variant-patient-profile-early-features?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=1ac774787b-MR_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-1ac774787b-150094665">rely on medical interventions to breathe</a>, such as supplemental oxygen.</p>



<p>That information, however, comes with a massive caveat: More than 70 percent of people there have been exposed to the coronavirus in the last 18 months, Noach said. Protection provided by previous infections, or vaccinations, could be the reason people there tend to have milder symptoms.</p>



<p>Experts need to see what happens in other parts of the world before concluding that omicron is a less virulent virus than other variants, Glenda Gray, president and CEO of the South African Medical Research Council, said at the December 14 news conference. Monitoring the severity of COVID-19 cases in places with low vaccination rates and low infection rates will be particularly informative, she said.</p>



<p>A study from the United Kingdom found that so far there is <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-16-COVID19-Report-49.pdf">no indication that omicron might cause milder, or more severe, COVID-19</a> than delta, researchers report December 17. Data on hospitalizations there, however, are still limited.</p>



<p>Even if omicron is ultimately linked to milder disease, that doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous. More infections overall mean more hospitalizations and more deaths, even if the severe outcomes are a smaller proportion of overall omicron cases than with delta.</p>



<p>In the United States, where delta dominated until recently, the two variants are colliding — and that’s raising fears of this latest wave turning into a tsunami in some places.</p>



<p>“Our delta surge is ongoing and, in fact, accelerating,” Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, said in a December 14 call with reporters. “On top of that, we’re going to add an omicron surge. That’s alarming because our hospitals are already filling up. Staff are fatigued. We’re almost two years into the pandemic, and there may be limits on capacity to handle the kinds of caseloads that we see from an omicron wave superimposed on a delta surge.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Omicron can evade some antibodies.</h3>



<p>Even before omicron began to spread widely, scientists were immediately concerned that it might be able to hide from some virus-attacking antibodies. Recent studies suggest that yes, the virus can evade parts of the immune system. But as our immune defenses are multipronged, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>



<p>That worry initially came because omicron sports more than 50 mutations in various viral proteins. More than 30 of those changes are in the coronavirus’ spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells and is a major antibody target.</p>



<p>Since December 7, a slew of studies that have yet to be reviewed by other scientists has come out in support of the hypothesis that omicron can evade the immune response, showing that some antibodies don’t recognize omicron very well.</p>



<p>For example, among people vaccinated with two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, levels of immune proteins called neutralizing antibodies that stop the virus from infecting new cells were <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267417v2.full.pdf">41 times lower compared with antibodies against an older version</a> of the virus that rose to prevalence in mid-2020, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 11 at medRix.org. Previously infected people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">who have been vaccinated</a>, on the other hand, have a leg up (<em>SN: 8/19/21</em>). The study showed that antibody levels against omicron were lower in people who had received two doses of Pfizer&#8217;s shot than in similarly vaccinated individuals who had recovered from a previous infection.</p>



<p>The findings are in line with those from <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.21267646v1.full.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1?rss=1%22">other studies</a> that include other vaccines approved in the United States — Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — as well as ones used globally. The overall magnitude of the antibody drop differs from study to study, but all show the same pattern. Antibodies from people who had previously been infected but not vaccinated also perform poorly against omicron.</p>



<p>What’s more, omicron’s spike mutations may <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1.full.pdf">make treatments using lab-designed antibodies, called monoclonal antibodies, less effective</a>, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 14 at medRxiv.org. Out of nine monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical use, only two neutralized omicron in lab-grown cells.</p>



<p>The good news is that a different treatment, a yet-to-be-approved pill from Pfizer called Paxlovid, <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-additional-phase-23-study-results">should still work against the new variant</a>, the company said in a December 14 news release.</p>



<h3>T cells may fare better against omicron than neutralizing antibodies.</h3>



<p>Still, neutralizing antibodies that circulate in the blood are only one small piece of the immune response. Another arm appears largely undamaged.</p>



<p>Immune cells called T cells can either raise the call to arms when they detect the coronavirus or are capable of killing infected cells. T cells patrol the body searching for signs of the coronavirus. The cells identify fragments of viral proteins by doing cellular handshakes to check if cells are sending up red flags that the coronavirus has invaded. A red flag kicks the immune response into high gear.</p>



<p>It seems that many of the viral fragments that T cells recognize <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.06.471446v1">aren’t the parts of omicron with mutations</a>, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 9 at bioRxiv.org, meaning the immune cells will probably still help protect people from getting really sick.</p>

<h3>Omicron seems more likely to cause reinfections than delta.</h3>



<p>Immunity against infection wanes in the months afterward. That combined with the immune evasiveness of omicron has raised the odds that previously infected people might get infected again.</p>



<p>Data from the United Kingdom, for instance, suggest that recovered people are <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-16-COVID19-Report-49.pdf">five times as likely to be infected by omicron</a> as by delta, researchers from Imperial College London report December 19.</p>



<p>The same appears to be true in South Africa. People who caught the virus in South Africa’s first wave, which was driven by a variant called D614G, are 73 percent as likely to get reinfected with omicron as people without known prior infections. That’s higher than the 29 percent higher risk for recovered people in September and October 2021, when delta was prevalent there. Individuals infected in the second wave caused by the beta variant face a 60 percent higher risk, up from 27 percent in September and October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Vaccines may be less effective against omicron, but boosters offer hope.</h3>



<p>Early studies suggest that vaccines will still protect us, especially after getting a booster shot.</p>



<p>Lab-based studies of neutralizing antibody responses are a hint that protection from vaccines or previous infection might be diminished. Many of these same studies suggest that a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1?rss=1%22">third dose boosts antibodies back up to levels that should be protective against omicron</a>.</p>



<p>Boosters can even provide more protection than the original shots because the body churns out antibodies that have evolved to better recognize the virus every time we’re exposed to its proteins, Chandran says. So after a boost, the body doesn’t just make more antibodies, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">they’re better ones</a>, too (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). But because the immune response to infections is complex and varies from person to person, experts rely on studies from people in the real world to know for sure.</p>



<p>A study in South Africa, for instance, found that the <a href="https://www.discovery.co.za/corporate/news-room#/documents/press-release-dot-pdf-417948">effectiveness of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine at stopping infection dropped</a> from 80 percent pre-omicron to 33 percent during the omicron wave. There was a less dramatic drop in the shot’s effectiveness at preventing hospitalization. Before omicron, the jab was 93 percent effective; it decreased to 70 percent amid the new surge.</p>



<p>“It’s very heartening to see these results,” Gray, of the South African Medical Research Council, said at the December 14 news conference. Though the study didn’t look at the effect of booster shots, another dose should bring the vaccines’ effectiveness back up, she said. Analyses for comparing one or two doses of J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine are ongoing and should have results soon, Gray added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are similar to early estimates out of the United Kingdom, which show Pfizer’s two-dose shot is around 30 percent effective against symptoms. A booster dose <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf">increased the effectiveness to between 70 percent to 75 percent</a>, according to data from Public Health England. Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty because those findings are based on low numbers of cases. As time passes and more people get infected, researchers will get better estimates.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the worry about omicron has sparked a flurry of activity. People around the globe are upping their layers of protection with vaccinations, masks and pre-holiday COVID-19 tests. Experts expect that vaccines will largely keep vaccinated people out of the hospital. But with many people still unvaccinated across the United States, only time will tell whether the beginning of 2022 will be as devastating as the start of 2021.</p>



<p>“We are now waist-deep in the omicron wave,” infectious diseases physician Lemieux said in a December 20 call with journalists. The big question is how large the country’s omicron wave will be and what impact it will have on the health care system.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Watching lecture videos is now a major part of many students’ university experience. Some say they prefer them to live lectures, as they can choose when to study. And, according to a survey of students at the University of California Los Angeles, at least, many students also take advantage of the fact that video playback can be sped up, so cutting the amount of time they spend on lectures. But what impact does sped-up viewing have on learning? The answer, according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3899?af=R">new paper</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, is, within some limits, none. In fact, if used strategically, it can actually improve learning. However, what students <em>think</em> is going to be the best strategy isn’t actually what’s most beneficial, Dillon Murphy at UCLA and colleagues also report.</p>



<span id="more-44922"></span>



<p>First, the team assigned 231 student participants to watch two YouTube videos (one on real estate appraisals and the other on the Roman Empire) at normal speed, 1.5x speed, 2x speed or 2.5x speed. They were told to watch the videos in full screen mode and not to pause them or take any notes. After each video, the students took comprehension tests, which were repeated a week later. The results were clear: the 1.5x and 2x groups did just as well on the tests as those who’d watched the videos at normal speed, both immediately afterwards and one week on. Only at 2.5x was learning impaired.</p>



<p>When the team surveyed a separate group of UCLA students, they found that a massive 85% usually watched pre-recorded lectures at faster than normal speed. However, 91% said they thought that normal speed or slightly faster (1.5x) would be better for learning than 2x or 2.5x. These new results certainly suggest that this isn’t right: double-time viewing was just as good as normal viewing. It seems, then, that as long as the material can still be accurately perceived and comprehended, it’s okay to speed up playback.</p>



<p>So, a student could just watch videos at 2x speed and halve their time spent on lectures….Or, according to the results of other studies reported in the paper, they could watch a video at 2x normal speed twice, and do <em>better</em> on a test than if they’d watched it once at normal speed. The timing mattered, though: only those who’d watched the 2x video for a second time immediately before a test, rather than right after the first viewing, got this advantage.</p>



<p>The team also explored whether watching the videos at different speeds on separate occasions — initially at normal speed but then at double time, or vice versa — might make a difference to test performance immediately afterwards or a week later. Though 76% of the participants in this study said they thought watching first at normal speed then rewatching at double time would be best for learning, the order actually made no difference to test results. “Thus, although students may prefer certain study schedules or techniques, there are instances where their beliefs about self-regulated learning do not enhance learning outcomes,” the team writes.</p>



<p>The results offer some guidance for students at US universities considering the optimal revision strategy. In a standard college course, a midterm exam might test on material contained in 10 hours’ of lecture videos. So a student might want to watch them in double time when they are released and then again in double time just before the exam. However, the team did only look at one-week delays between video watching and testing, so this would need to be explored in further research.</p>



<p>The researchers do also add a few caveats. While 2x viewing was fine for learning about the material in their studies — real estate appraisals and the Roman Empire — perhaps it might not work for more complex subject matter; again, only more research will tell.</p>



<p>But as so many students do report watching at faster than normal speeds anyway, this work is clearly helpful: it suggests that as long as it’s not more than 2x faster, it’s far from being a bad idea.</p>

                <p>This year, animals of all shapes and sizes surprised us with amazing abilities we didn’t know they had. From powerlifting to walking on the underside of water, these are the creature capabilities that most impressed us in 2021.</p>



<h4>Sea slugs that grow new bodies</h4>



<p>In a spectacular feat of whole-body regeneration, some <em>Elysia</em> sea slugs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">can grow a new body from just the head</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 4</em>). This feat may come in handy when animals are riddled with parasites and need a fresh start. The head simply detaches itself, crawls away and regrows an entirely new body, including the heart. These are the only animals with a heart that are known to regenerate so much of themselves.</p>

</div><figcaption>To document the extreme regeneration of an <em>Elysia</em> sea slug, researchers tied a leash around a natural groove in a sea slug’s neck. The sea slug escaped by discarding most of its body. While the headless body died, the head regenerated the rest of the body within 17 days.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Squirrels that parkour</h4>





<p>We’ve all seen squirrels pull off death-defying maneuvers, but now we know more about how the rodents pull off their stunts. Like masters of parkour — the sport in which people leap, bounce and climb through an obstacle course — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squirrel-jump-leap-tree-branch-parkour-tricks">squirrels gauge the bendiness of branches when jumping</a>. The rodents also use parkour-style jumps off of vertical surfaces to slow down and stick landings, researchers found (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 14</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>Researchers trained squirrels to jump through an artificial forest obstacle course to study how they leap from branch to branch without falling. High-speed camera footage showed that squirrels can learn to stick landings in just a few jumps and consider both branch bendiness and distance when deciding to leap from a limb.</figcaption></figure>





<h4>Animals that eat surprising animals</h4>



<p>This year upended notions of predator and prey, revealing animals making meals of one another in surprising ways. Researchers found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">more than 40 species from 11 families of spiders eat snakes</a>, using sticky silk and venomous bites to subdue serpents up to 30 times their size (<em>SN Online: 8/4/21</em>). </p>

<p>What’s more, one Seychelles giant tortoise apparently didn’t get the memo that tortoises are gentle herbivores. It was spotted stalking, catching and eating a bird chick whole, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-tortoise-video-hunting-killing-eating-baby-bird">first documented example of a tortoise hunting prey</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 5</em>).</p>

<h4>A beetle that walks on water, underwater</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-springs-water">water strider</a>’s ability to walk on water is incredible enough, but the tiny water scavenger beetle flips the script: It <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beetles-walk-on-water-upside-down-underneath-surface">walks on water upside down</a>, clinging to the water’s surface from below (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 13</em>). The insect may use a small air bubble to pin its belly to the underside of the water’s surface, but just how it steps without breaking the water’s surface tension remains a mystery for now.</p>

<h4>A bird that mimics a flock</h4>



<p>The male superb lyrebird lives up to its name with its excellent vocal abilities, mimicking nearly any sound it hears in its Australian forest home — even chainsaws and cameras. Now scientists have recorded the bird <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lyrebird-mimic-entire-flock-deception-male-mating-call">mimicking the sounds of several other bird species at once</a> — replicating an entire soundscape. It’s the only known animal with this talent (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 12</em>). Because the lyrebird mimics multiple alarm calls in particular, researchers aren’t sure if it’s also trying to sound an alarm or just showing off for mates.</p>

</div><figcaption>At the close of trying to impress a female with an elaborate song and dance, the male lyrebird adds a remarkable flourish. Its voice re-creates the alarmed chirps and wingbeats of many birds of different species, a degree of mimicry prowess never seen before in birds.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Spiders that lift prey up to 50 times their own weight</h4>



<p>In an innovative take on a pulley system, some spiders, including black widows, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">can hoist heavy prey up, up and into their webs</a> using only strands of their silk (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 13</em>). Researchers observed the spiders attaching strand after strand from their main web to large prey such as lizards, with each strand just a bit shorter than the last so that the stretchy silk slowly reeled in the prize.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>Filmed in a lab box, a&nbsp;spider tries to capture a much bigger roach to feast on. The spider attaches one silk strand after another to the struggling roach until the silk supports all of the roach’s weight. Then the spider keeps adding shorter and shorter strands that tug the monster weight of the prey up toward the main part of the web.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Polar bears that wield weapons</h4>



<p>In a macabre example of tool use by animals, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bears-bludgeon-walrus-stones-tools-ice-inuit">polar bears sometimes kill walrus by bashing them with large chunks of stone or ice</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 16</em>). Inuit hunters have long reported polar bears attacking prey this way, and a review of historical and modern documentation confirms that stone-wielding polar bears are a real phenomenon. This puts polar bears on the list of tool-using animals, including crows, chimpanzees, elephants and, of course, humans.</p>

                <p>When I was in grad school, I wrote a lot of code which ended up biting me later. It wasn&#8217;t until I got a job as a software engineer at Google that I discovered better ways of organizing code. Writing reusable, easy-to-read code is a core skill to have when you&#8217;re spending half of your grad school days in front of the computer. </p>



<p>I realized that others might be interested in learning these core skills, and so I tweeted out a feeler, and I was really overwhelmed with responses. I gave a workshop to the grad students in neuro at Harvard, then at NMA 2021, and it seemed to really hit a nerve. I took a couple of weeks off to write a long-form version and went through several rounds of editing and improving, and now it&#8217;s finally ready for primetime. Enjoy!</p>

<p>About the tech behind the book: it&#8217;s all writing in markdown. <a href="http://jupyterbook.org/">Jupyterbook </a>takes care of translating markdown to html. I heavily customized the sphinx-book-theme template to use <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte.css</a> to make it look and feel like a book. A nice bonus is that tufte.css has a dark theme that&#8217;s easy on the eyes. The project is hosted on Github and deployed through netlify. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/surprising-science-records-superlatives-2021">6 surprising records science set in 2021</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a record-setting black hole to the oldest animal DNA ever recovered, discoveries in 2021 stretched the limits of scientific study — and our imaginations.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3>Oldest behemoth black hole</h3>



<p>More than 13 billion years ago, when the universe was a mere 670 million years old, a black hole was born. At a mass equal to 1.6 billion suns, the newly discovered supermassive black hole J0313-1806 is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">twice as heavy and 20 million years older</a> than the previous record holder for oldest known black hole (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 4</em>). The ancient behemoth is so big that it challenges notions of how supermassive black holes first formed, astronomers say.</p>

<h3>Gravity on the smallest scale</h3>



<p>Every object with mass has gravity too, according to both Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, even if it’s barely noticeable. Scientists have now measured the gravity of a gold ball 2 millimeters wide and weighing about 90 milligrams — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravity-measurement-smallest-object-mass-gold-ball">smallest object ever to have its gravitational pull measured</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 5</em>). The tiny tug revealed that gravity behaves as predicted, even for very small masses. Researchers still want to test how gravity behaves on the even smaller quantum scale, where different rules of physics may apply.</p>

<h3>Oldest opposable thumbs</h3>



<p>A 160-million-year-old pterosaur nicknamed Monkeydactyl is now the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">earliest known animal with opposable thumbs</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 16</em>). The flying reptile, officially named <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em>, may have used its thumbs and flexible joints to clamber up and through trees in what is now northeastern China. The digits could have helped it capture insects and other prey, scientists say.</p>

<h3>First-of-its-kind merger</h3>



<p>For the first time, a black hole has been seen <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">gobbling up a neutron star</a>, the collapsed remains of a dead supergiant star. Astronomers detected the event by measuring gravitational waves that emanated from the collision and eventually reached Earth (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 6</em>). All previously identified sources of these ripples in spacetime consisted of two like objects colliding, such as two neutron stars or two black holes.</p>

<h3>Oldest recovered animal DNA</h3>



<p>The tooth of a Siberian <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-dna-ever-recovered-mammoth-evolution">mammoth that lived more than a million years ago</a> has offered up the oldest DNA ever recovered from an animal (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 6</em>). The previous record holder was 700,000-year-old DNA from a fossilized horse. Scientists say the new find probably approaches the limit of how long DNA can persist. Genes from the mammoth suggest that it may have belonged to a previously unknown species.</p>

<h3>Most Denisovan DNA</h3>



<p>The mysterious hominid group known as the Denisovans died out long ago, but not without leaving a trace. The Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people of the Philippines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">get about 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans</a>, a genetic analysis revealed (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 16</em>). That’s the highest level of Denisovan ancestry yet found anywhere in the world. Researchers are using the result, along with genetic clues from other groups that carry Denisovan DNA, to retrace Denisovans’ movements through Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea and Australia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vikings-greenland-rising-sea-level-climate">Vikings may have fled Greenland to escape rising seas</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1721, a Norwegian missionary set sail for Greenland in the hopes of converting the Viking descendants living there to Protestantism. When he arrived, the only traces he found of the Nordic society were ruins of settlements that had been abandoned 300 years earlier.</p>



<p>There is no written record to explain why the Vikings left or died out. But a new simulation of Greenland’s coastline reveals that as the ice sheet covering most of the island started to expand around that time, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/810519">sea levels rose drastically</a>, researchers report December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in New Orleans.</p>



<p>These shifting coastlines would have inundated grazing areas and farmland, and could have helped bring about the end of the Nordic way of life in Greenland, says Marisa Borreggine, a geophysicist at Harvard University.</p>



<p>Greenland was first colonized by Vikings in 985 by a group of settlers in 14 ships led by Erik the Red, who had been banished from neighboring Iceland for manslaughter. Erik and his followers settled across southern Greenland, where they and their descendants hunted for seals, grazed livestock, built churches and traded walrus ivory with European mainlanders.</p>





<p>The settlers arrived during what’s known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts">Medieval Warm Period</a>, when conditions across Europe and Greenland were temperate for a handful of centuries (<em>SN: 7/24/19</em>). But by 1350, the climate had started taking a turn for the worse with the beginning of the Little Ice Age, a period of regional cooling that lasted well into the 19th century.</p>



<p>Researchers have long speculated that a rapidly changing climate could have dealt a blow to Greenland’s Norse society. The island probably became much colder in the last 100 years of Norse occupation, says paleoclimatologist Boyang Zhao at Brown University in Providence, R.I, who was not involved in the new research. Lower temperatures could have made farming and raising livestock more difficult, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lower temperatures would have had another impact on Greenland: the steady expansion of the island’s ice sheet, Borreggine and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Though rising sea levels usually go hand in hand with ice melting from ice sheets, oceans do not rise and fall uniformly in every place, Borreggine says. Around Greenland, sea level tends to rise when the ice sheet there grows.</p>



<p>This is for two main reasons: First, ice is heavy. The sheer weight of the ice sheet pushes the land it rests on down, meaning that as the ice sheet grows, more land is submerged. Second is gravity. Being massive, ice sheets exert some gravitational pull on nearby water. This makes the seawater around Greenland tilt upward toward the ice, meaning that water closer to the coast is higher than water in the open ocean. As the ice sheet grows, that pull becomes even stronger, and sea level close to the coast rises further.</p>



<p>Simulating the impact of the weight of the ice and its tug on Greenland’s waters, Borreggine and their colleagues found that sea level rose enough to flood the coast by hundreds of meters in some areas. Between the time the Vikings arrived and when they left, there was “pretty intense coastal flooding, such that certain pieces of land that were connected to each other were no longer connected,” they say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, some Viking sites are being inundated as a result of the overall rise in global sea level from climate change, which is being only marginally offset around Greenland by its melting ice sheet. Something similar could have happened back in the 14th and 15th centuries, destroying land that the Norse relied on for farming and grazing, Borreggine says.</p>



<p>“Previous theories about why Vikings left have really focused on the idea that they all died because it got really cold, and they were too dumb to adapt,” Borreggine says. But they say that archaeological digs have revealed a far more nuanced story, showing that Greenland’s Norse people did change their lifestyle by increasingly relying on seafood in the last century of their occupation.</p>



<p>But learning to adapt may have been too difficult in the face of an increasingly harsh landscape. The idea that rising sea levels may have been one of these challenges has merit, Zhao says, noting that the reasons why the Vikings disappeared from Greenland is nuanced.</p>



<p>As the climate changed, for example, these people may have also found themselves increasingly cut off from trade routes as the season for thick sea ice extended. And by the mid-14th century, the Black Plague was tearing through Europe, cutting into the Vikings’ biggest market for walrus ivory.</p>



<p>“Norse people came and left,” Zhao says. “But there are still a lot of unsolved questions,” including why exactly they left, he says.</p>



<p>The last written record of this society is a letter describing a wedding in 1408. A few years later, that couple moved to Iceland and started farming. Why the pair chose to leave is lost to history, but, as the new research suggests, sea level rise may have been part of the equation.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/12/20/fear-of-spiders-may-have-its-evolutionary-roots-in-aversion-to-scorpions/">Fear Of Spiders May Have Its Evolutionary Roots In Aversion To Scorpions</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>&#8220;But they won’t hurt you! They eat bugs. They’re our friends!&#8221; I’ve tried telling my now-12-year-old all these things many times over the years, but his fear of spiders persists. It’s hardly a rare fear; an estimated 6% of the general population suffer from full-blown arachnophobia. The leading explanation is that our ancestors evolved to fear spiders, and this has been passed on to us. But there are a few problems with this, point out the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01325-z">new paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Firstly: only 0.5% of spider species are potentially dangerous to humans. Secondly: these species are mostly found not in Africa, where modern humans evolved, but rather Australia and South America, the two continents that have been most recently colonised by people. Given this, the idea of an evolved, generalised fear of spiders doesn’t seem that compelling. Daniel Frynta at Charles University, Prague, and colleagues had another idea: perhaps we evolved to fear not “essentially harmless” spiders but a dangerous close relative with a similar body body plan: scorpions — and our brains over-generalise, reacting to spiders in the same way. To investigate this, they ran a study that would have left my 12-year-old with nightmares for months…</p>



<span id="more-44915"></span>



<p>The team collected together live specimens of 62 arthropod species: 15 spiders, 10 scorpions, 5 other arachnids (such as whip &#8220;spiders&#8221;), 10 cockroaches, 10 other &#8220;hemimetabolous insects&#8221; (a group that includes earwigs, stick insects and locusts), 6 myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and their relatives), 4 beetles and 2 crabs. Each of these animals was placed in a transparent box. These boxes were then lined up for inspection by 329 participants, who used 7-point scales to rate each on scales for fear, disgust and also beauty.</p>



<p>Let’s get beauty out of the way first: species that got high disgust ratings tended to get low beauty ratings, but there was no link between beauty and fear ratings. In other words, we can find an arthropod both scary and beautiful.</p>



<p>For fear, the team noted that the taxa fell into distinct groups. The &#8220;chelicerates&#8221; (the spiders, scorpions and other arachnids) got relatively high average scores, followed by the myriapods (which were definitely less fear-inducing) and finally the insects and crustaceans.</p>



<p>For disgust, the pattern was similar to that for fear. Myriapods did get the highest average score, but it wasn’t far off the score for spiders. Again, the beetles and crabs got the lowest scores. Overall, the fear and disgust ratings were highly correlated.</p>



<p>Bigger species did tend to trigger stronger emotional reactions — they got higher fear, disgust and beauty scores. But the deepest statistical split in the fear-and-disgust ratings was between the chelicerates cluster (spiders/scorpions/other arachnids) and a cluster of insects-plus-crustaceans. “This supports the notion that chelicerates are perceived as one cohesive group distinct from other arthropods,” the team argues.</p>



<p>Unlike the vast majority of spiders, scorpions <em>do</em> post a genuine threat, killing an estimated 2,600 people every year. Scorpions are also an ancient group, and species with a venom tailored to mammals are native to Africa and the Middle East — so our distant ancestors and dangerous scorpions could have evolved side-by-side. “Fear of scorpions therefore seems to be better warranted than fear of spiders,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Of course, the data don’t <em>show</em> that people generalise an evolved fear/disgust of scorpions to spiders. As the team acknowledges, this is a big limitation of the study. But it’s a sensible way to interpret the data, they argue. And, compared with other theories about why so many people are so scared of spiders (over dogs, say), it does indeed seem more compelling.</p>
