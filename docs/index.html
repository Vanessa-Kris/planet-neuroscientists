              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-inspired-glove-suckers-humans-grip-slippery-objects">This octopus-inspired glove helps humans grip slippery objects</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new high-tech glove totally sucks — and that’s a good thing.</p>



<p>Each fingertip is outfitted with a sucker inspired by those on octopus arms. These suckers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq1905">allow people to grab slippery, underwater objects</a> without squeezing too tightly, researchers report July 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“Being able to grasp things underwater could be good for search and rescue, it could be good for archaeology, [and] could be good for marine biology,” says mechanical engineer Michael Bartlett of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>





<p>Each sucker on the glove is a raspberry-sized rubber cone capped with a thin, stretchy rubber sheet. Vacuuming the air out of a sucker pulls its cap into a concave shape that sticks to surfaces like a suction cup. Pumping air back into the sucker inflates its cap, causing it to pop off surfaces. Each finger is also equipped with a Tic Tac–sized sensor that detects nearby surfaces. When the sensor comes within some preset distance of any object, it switches the sucker on that finger to sticky mode.</p>



<p>Bartlett and colleagues used the glove to pick up objects underwater, including a toy car, plastic spoon and metal bowl. Each sucker could lift about one kilogram in open air — and could lift more underwater, with the help of buoyancy, Bartlett says. Adding more suckers could give the glove an even stronger grip.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>The octopus-inspired suckers on a new wetsuit glove can pick up objects of various shapes and materials, from a metal toy car to a delicate, squishy hydrogel bead. Sensors on the glove activate suction at its fingertips whenever it approaches an object, allowing wearers to pick items up without even closing their hands.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The octopus-inspired glove barely brushes the surface of what octopuses and other cephalopods can do. Octopuses can individually control thousands of suckers across their eight arms to feel around the seafloor and snatch prey. The suckers do this using not only tactile sensors, but also chemical-detecting cells that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-taste-touch-arm-suckers">“taste” their surroundings</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>The new glove is far from turning fingers into extra tongues. But Bartlett is intrigued by the possibility of adding chemical sensors so that the suckers stick to only certain materials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-most-distant-rotating-light-13-billion-years-ago-big-bang">The most distant rotating galaxy hails from 13.3 billion years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is a galaxy spinning like a record in the early universe — far earlier than any others have been seen twirling around. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Astronomers have spotted signs of rotation in the galaxy MACS1149-JD1, JD1 for short, which sits so far away that its light takes 13.3 billion years to reach Earth. “The galaxy we analyzed, JD1, is the most distant example of a rotational galaxy,” says astronomer Akio Inoue of Waseda University in Tokyo.</p>





<p>“The origin of the rotational motion in galaxies is closely related to a question: how galaxies like the Milky Way formed,” Inoue says. “So, it is interesting to find the onset of rotation in the early universe.”</p>



<p>JD1 was discovered in 2012. Due to its great distance from Earth, its light had been stretched, or redshifted, into longer wavelengths, thanks to the expansion of the universe. That redshifted light revealed that JD1 existed just 500 million years after the Big Bang.</p>



<p>Astronomers used light from the entire galaxy to make that measurement. Now, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile for about two months in 2018, Inoue and colleagues have measured more subtle differences in how that light is shifted across the galaxy’s disk. The new data show that, while all of JD1 is moving away from Earth, its northern part is moving away slower than the southern part. That’s <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac7447">a sign of rotation</a>, the researchers report in the July 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>JD1 spins at about 180,000 kilometers per hour, roughly a quarter the spin speed of the Milky Way. The galaxy is also smaller than modern spiral galaxies. So JD1 may be just starting to spin, Inoue says.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> will observe JD1 in the next year to reveal more clues to how that galaxy, and others like ours, formed (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-space-travel-survival-humans">Tardigrades could teach us how to handle the rigors of space travel</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">No beast on Earth is tougher than the tiny tardigrade. It can survive being frozen at -272° Celsius, being exposed to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208008051">vacuum of outer space</a> and even being blasted with <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09553000500368453?journalCode=irab20">500 times the dose of X-rays</a> that would kill a human.</p>



<p>In other words, the creature can endure conditions that don’t even exist on Earth. This otherworldly resilience, combined with their endearing looks, has made tardigrades a favorite of animal lovers. But beyond that, researchers are looking to the microscopic animals, about the size of a dust mite, to learn how to prepare humans and crops to handle the rigors of space travel.</p>





<p>The tardigrade’s indestructibility stems from its adaptations to its environment — which may seem surprising, since it lives in seemingly cushy places, like the cool, wet clumps of moss that dot a garden wall. In homage to such habitats, along with a pudgy appearance, some people call tardigrades water bears or, adorably, moss piglets.</p>



<p>But it turns out that a tardigrade’s damp, mossy home can dry out many times each year. Drying is pretty catastrophic for most living things. It damages cells in some of the same ways that freezing, vacuum and radiation do.</p>



<p>For one thing, drying leads to high levels of peroxides and other reactive oxygen species. These toxic molecules chisel a cell’s DNA into short fragments — just as radiation does. Drying also causes cell membranes to wrinkle and crack. And it can lead delicate proteins to unfold, rendering them as useless as crumpled paper airplanes. Tardigrades have evolved special strategies for dealing with these kinds of damage.</p>

Yagi-Utsumi <em>et al</em>/<em>Scientific Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As a tardigrade dries out, its cells <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044209">gush out several strange proteins</a> that are unlike anything found in other animals. In water, the proteins are floppy and shapeless. But as water disappears, the proteins <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00724-6">self-assemble into long, crisscrossing fibers</a> that fill the cell’s interior. Like Styrofoam packing peanuts, the fibers <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.02.462891v1">support the cell’s membranes and proteins</a>, preventing them from breaking or unfolding.</p>



<p>At least two species of tardigrade also produce another protein found in no other animal on Earth. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12808">This protein, dubbed Dsup</a>, short for “damage suppressor,” binds to DNA and may physically shield it from reactive forms of oxygen.</p>



<p>Emulating tardigrades could one day help humans colonize outer space. Food crops, yeast and insects could be engineered to produce tardigrade proteins, allowing these organisms to grow more efficiently on spacecraft where levels of radiation are elevated compared with on Earth.</p>



<p>Scientists have already inserted the gene for the Dsup protein into human cells in the lab. Many of those modified cells <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrades-dna-damage-radiation-death">survived levels of X-rays or peroxide chemicals</a> that kill ordinary cells (<em>SN: 11/9/19, p. 13</em>). And when <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12033-020-00273-9">inserted into tobacco plants</a> — an experimental model for food crops — the gene for Dsup seemed to protect the plants from exposure to a DNA-damaging chemical called ethyl methanesulfonate. Plants with the extra gene grew more quickly than those without it. Plants with Dsup also incurred less DNA damage when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.</p>

<p>Tardigrades’ “packing peanut” proteins show early signs of being protective for humans. When <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.1c00572">modified to produce those proteins</a>, human cells became resistant to camptothecin, a cell-killing chemotherapy agent, researchers reported in the March 18 <em>ACS Synthetic Biology</em>. The tardigrade proteins did this by inhibiting apoptosis, a cellular self-destruct program that is often triggered by exposure to harmful chemicals or radiation. </p>



<p>So if humans ever succeed in reaching the stars, they may accomplish this feat, in part, by standing on the shoulders of the tiny eight-legged endurance specialists in your backyard.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pig-heart-organ-transplant-brain-dead-people">Two pig hearts were successfully transplanted into brain-dead people</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pig hearts beat for three days inside the chests of two brain-dead patients who were kept alive using ventilators. The feat helps researchers prepare for future clinical trials of pig-to-human transplants, surgeons at the NYU Langone Health in New York City announced at a news conference on July 12.</p>



<p>In mid-June, surgeons transplanted a heart from a genetically modified pig into Lawrence Kelly — a 72-year-old Vietnam veteran with a history of heart problems. A second patient received a porcine heart on July 6. The team monitored both patients for 72 hours before taking them off life support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those three days, the hearts kept the recently deceased patients’ blood flowing. “We learned a tremendous amount from the first operation,” surgeon Nader Moazami said at the news conference. The new heart was too small for Kelly’s chest. So surgeons had to adjust blood vessels to account for the size mismatch and blood flow wasn’t perfect.</p>

<p>Last year, another team at NYU Langone Health <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">transplanted a pig kidney into a brain-dead woman</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>). The first pig-to-human heart transplant happened in a living patient in January: 57-year-old David Bennet <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">survived two months with a pig heart</a> before dying of heart failure (<em>SN: 1/31/22</em>). All the organs had been genetically modified to avoid immediate rejection by the body and make them safe for people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear why Bennet’s <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201422">new heart ultimately failed</a>. Transplanting organs into brain-dead people allows for in-depth analyses that aren’t possible in living patients, NYU Langone surgeon Robert Montgomery said. Researchers can take tissue samples and pictures of the organ immediately following the procedure, while the focus for living people is on keeping them alive and comfortable.</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to do longer-term transplants in more brain-dead patients to determine how long pig hearts might last.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flower-shape-size-bee-gut-parasite-pollinator-health">Flower shape and size impact bees’ chances of catching gut parasites</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bees that land on short, wide flowers can fly away with an upset stomach. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Common eastern bumblebees (<em>Bombus impatiens</em>) are <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3730">more likely to catch a diarrhea-inducing gut parasite</a> from purple coneflowers, black-eyed Susans and other similarly shaped flora than other flowers, researchers report in the July <em>Ecology</em>. Because parasites and diseases contribute to bee decline, the finding could help researchers create seed mixes that are more bee-friendly and inform gardeners’ and land managers’ decisions about which flower types to plant.</p>





<p>The parasite (<em>Crithidia bombi</em>) is transmitted when the insects accidentally ingest contaminated bee feces, which “tends to make the bees dopey and lethargic,” says Rebecca Irwin, a community and evolutionary ecologist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “It isn’t the number one bee killer out there,” but bees sickened with it can struggle with foraging. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In laboratory experiments involving caged bees and 16 plant species, Irwin and her colleagues studied how different floral attributes affected transmission of the gut parasite. They focused on three factors of transmission: the amount of poop landing on flowers when bees fly and forage, how long the parasite survives on the plants and how easily the parasite is transmitted to new bees. Multiplied together, these three factors show the overall transmission rate.</p>



<p>Compared with plants with long, narrow flowers like phlox and bluebeards, short, wide flowers had more feces land on them and transmitted the parasite more easily to the pollinators, increasing the overall parasite transmission rate for these flowers. However, parasite survival times were reduced on these blooms. This is probably due to the open floral shapes increased exposure to ultraviolet light, speeding the drying out of parasite-laden “fecal droplets,” Irwin says.</p>



<p>The findings confirm a new theory suggesting that traits, such as flower shape, are better predictors of disease transmission than individual species of plants, says Scott McArt, an entomologist focusing on pollinator health at Cornell University who wasn’t involved with the study. Therefore, “you don’t need to know everything about every plant species when designing your pollinator-friendly garden or habitat restoration project.”</p>



<p>Instead, to limit disease transmission among bees, it’s best to choose plants that have narrower, longer flowers, he says. “Wider and shorter flowers are analogous to the small, poorly ventilated rooms where COVID is efficiently transmitted among humans.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>If ripping out coneflowers or black-eyed Susans isn’t palatable, don’t fret. Irwin recommends continuing to plant a diversity of flower types. This helps if one type of flower is “a high transmitting species,” she notes. In the future, she plans to conduct field experiments examining other factors that could influence parasite transmission, such as whether bees are driven to visit certain types of flowers more often in nature. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/07/reproducibility/">5 Open Science practices that improve reproducibility & support trust in science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by Lindsay Morton</p>



<p><em>Demonstrating reproducibility shows integrity, inspires trust and respect, and encourages reuse. That means you&rsquo;ll receive more attention for each individual article, exert a greater impact on your research community, and contribute to a more efficient research ecosystem overall. Here are five steps you can take to improve the reproducibility of your research.</em></p>



<ol><li><strong>Share </strong><strong>Open Methods</strong></li></ol>



<p>Reproducibility is in the details. It&rsquo;s difficult to reproduce results&mdash;much less adapt a methodology for reuse&mdash;based on the information in a research article alone. Whether your <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-methods/">methods</a> include protocols, code, or something else, making them accessible inspires trust, facilitates reuse, and extends the life of the work.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Fully document and report </strong><strong>materials</strong></li></ol>



<p>Materials are just as important to reproducibility as the procedures, protocols, and analytical tools used in conducting a study. From human specimens to microbes, the specific identity and provenance of samples can profoundly impact outcomes. In the life sciences, the <a href="https://osf.io/bj3mu/">MDAR checklist</a> provides researchers with a framework for capturing and reporting these details.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Post </strong><strong>Open Data</strong><strong> in a public repository</strong></li></ol>



<p>Open data provides the details necessary for researchers to validate, replicate and reproduce one another&rsquo;s results. Posting a FAIR-compliant dataset in a <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#repository">public repository</a> improves discoverability and ensures your data remains accessible as a permanent part of the scientific record.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Publish complementary or </strong><strong>&ldquo;scooped&rdquo; research</strong></li></ol>



<p>When different research groups achieve similar results around the same time, it reinforces the validity of both studies. That makes both investigations well <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/04/the-importance-of-being-second-plos-wide-edition/">worth sharing</a>.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Conduct and publish </strong><strong>replication and validation studies</strong></li></ol>



<p>Similarly, researchers who take the time to validate, replicate, and reanalyze previous work are providing a valuable service&#8213;one which can underscore the rigor of the original research, add nuance and deepen understanding, or help to correct the scientific record if necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780393881363">Virology</a><br><em>Joseph Osmundson<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $16.95</em></p>



<p>As a journalist covering COVID-19, I’ve had a front-row seat to the pandemic. I’ve been overwhelmed with despair over the death and suffering. I’ve been numb, trying to keep up with the deluge of COVID-19 studies. One balm has been the understanding of colleagues who also report on COVID-19.</p>



<p>I found solace too in <em>Virology</em>, microbiologist Joseph Osmundson’s book of 11 wide-ranging essays, in which he writes of the pandemic and calls for “a new rhetoric of care.” Osmundson includes journal entries from the pandemic, and some of his experi­ences are similar to mine. He dreams he’s at a gathering where no one is masked. He too felt the “density” of the pandemic: “Emotionally dense, with loss and struggle and even some­times joy,” he writes. “Scientifically dense, with papers and pre-prints out every day that need reading and some analysis.”</p>





<p>Osmundson doesn’t just focus on the coronavirus. He jumps from other viruses and the immune system to illness and metaphors for illness, to sex and HIV, to archiving history and whose stories get told. Parts of the book feel like an anthology, with quotes from many writers who have weighed in on these topics. Parts are a call to care for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, wealth or who one loves.</p>





<p>Overall, Osmundson questions how society thinks about viruses. “Viruses … are not evil, they don’t invade. They just are,” he writes. “The meaning we give a virus affects how we live with it.” When we describe viruses as enemies and illness as a war, it “assumes the necessity of casualties.” He argues instead to focus resources on caring for one another.</p>



<p>Born in the early 1980s, Osmundson, a gay man, is acutely aware of the messages that come with viruses. “Our generation of gay men came after the plague,” he writes. “HIV didn’t just kill bodies. It killed a type of sex as well, a type of pleasure.” But new therapies have saved lives and altered perceptions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can prevent infection, while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiv-aids-undetectable-virus-means-untransmittable-disease">treatment can render HIV untransmissible</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/19</em>). These advances changed our relationship with the virus, Osmundson writes. “I used to think that HIV would make it harder to find love and sex. Now we know that HIV-positive and undetectable is safe. It’s sexy.”</p>



<p>But the biomedicine that can change our relationship with viruses has not been wielded equitably, Osmundson observes. He returns throughout the book to our common humanity. “That fact of all our bodies, vulnerable together, necessitates mutual care.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">Here are the James Webb Space Telescope’s stunning first pictures</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-left">We’ve now seen farther, deeper and more clearly into space than ever before.</p>



<p>A stellar birthplace, a nebula surrounding a dying star, a group of closely interacting galaxies, the first spectrum of an exoplanet’s light. These are some of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope, released in a NASA news briefing on July 12. This quartet of cosmic scenes follows on the heels of the very first image released from the telescope, a vista of thousands of distant galaxies, presented in a White House briefing on July 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“First of all, it’s really gorgeous. And it’s teeming with galaxies,” said JWST Operations Scientist Jane Rigby at the July 12 briefing. “That’s been true of every image we’ve taken with Webb. We can’t take [an image of] blank sky. Everywhere we look, there’s galaxies everywhere.”</p>



<h4>Going deep</h4>



<p>The galaxies captured in the first released image lie behind a cluster of galaxies about 4.6 billion light-years away. The mass from those closer galaxies distorts spacetime in such a way that objects behind the cluster are magnified, giving astronomers a way to peer more than 13 billion years into the early universe.</p>



<p>Even with that celestial assist, other existing telescopes could never see so far.&nbsp; But the James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST,&nbsp;is incredibly large — at 6.5 meters across, its mirror is nearly three times as wide as that of the Hubble Space Telescope. It also sees in the infrared wavelengths of light where distant galaxies appear. Those features give it an edge over previous observatories.</p>



<p>“There’s a sharpness and a clarity we’ve never had,” said Rigby, of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. “You can really zoom in and play around.”</p>

<p>Although that first image represents the deepest view of the cosmos to date, “this is not a record that will stand for very long,” astronomer Klaus Pontoppidan of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said in a June 29 news briefing. “Scientists will very quickly beat that record and go even deeper.”</p>



<p>But JWST wasn’t built only to peer deeper and farther back in time than ever before. The cache of first images and data showcases space scenes both near and far, glimpses of single stars and entire galaxies, and even a peek into the chemical composition of a far-off planet’s atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;These are pictures just taken over a period of five days. Every five days, we’re getting more data,” European Space Agency science advisor Mark McCaughrean said at the July 12 briefing. (JWST is an international collaboration among NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.) “It’s a culmination of decades of work, but it’s just the beginning of decades. What we’ve seen today with these images is essentially that we’re ready now.”</p>

<h4>Cosmic cliffs</h4>



<p>This image shows the “Cosmic Cliffs,” part of the enormous Carina nebula, a region about 7,600 light-years from Earth where many massive stars are being born. Some of the most famous Hubble Space Telescope images feature this nebula in visible light, but JWST shows it in “infrared fireworks,” Pontoppidan says. JWST’s infrared detectors can see through dust, so the nebula appears especially spangled with stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We’re seeing brand new stars that were previously completely hidden from our view,” said NASA Goddard astrophysicist Amber Straughn.</p>



<p>But molecules in the dust itself are glowing too. Energetic winds from baby stars in the top of the image are pushing and sculpting the wall of gas and dust that runs across the middle. “We see examples of bubbles and cavities and jets that are being blown out from newborn stars,” Straughn said. And gas and dust are the raw material for new stars — and new planets.</p>



<p>“It reminds me that our sun and our planets, and ultimately us, were formed out of this same stuff that we see here,” Straughn said. “We humans really are connected to the universe. We’re made out of the same stuff.”</p>

<h4>Foamy nebula<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The Southern Ring nebula is an expanding cloud of gas that surrounds a dying star about 2,000 light-years from Earth. In previous Hubble images, the nebula looks like an oblong swimming pool with a fuzzy orange deck and a bright diamond, a white dwarf star, in the middle. JWST expands the view far beyond that, showing more tendrils and structures in the gas than previous telescopes could see.</p>

<p>“You see this bubbly, almost foamy appearance,” said JWST astronomer Karl Gordon, of the Space Telescope Science Institute. In the left hand image, which captures near-infrared light from JWST’s NIRCam instrument, the foaminess traces molecular hydrogen that formed as dust expanded away from the center. The center appears blue due to hot ionized gas heated by the leftover core of the star. Rays of light escape the nebula like the sun peeking through patchy clouds.</p>



<p>In the right-hand image, taken by the MIRI mid-infrared camera, the outer rings look blue and trace hydrocarbons forming on the surface of dust grains. The MIRI image also reveals a second star in the nebula’s core.</p>



<p>“We knew this was a binary star, but we didn’t see much of the actual star that produced this nebula,” Gordon said. “Now in MIRI this star glows red.”</p>

<h4>A galactic quintet<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Stephan’s Quintet is a group of galaxies about 290 million light-years away that was discovered in 1877. Four of the galaxies are engaged in an intimate gravitational dance, with one member of the group passing through the core of the cluster. (The fifth galaxy is actually much closer to Earth and just appears in a similar spot on the sky.) JWST’s images show off more structure within the galaxies than previous observations did, revealing where stars are being born.</p>

<p>“This is a very important image and area to study,” because it shows the sort of interactions that drive the evolution of galaxies, said JWST scientist Giovanna Giardino of the European Space Agency.</p>



<p>In an image from the MIRI instrument alone, the galaxies look like wispy skeletons reaching towards each other. Two galaxies are clearly close to merging. And in the top galaxy, evidence of a supermassive black hole comes to light. Material swirling around the black hole is heated to extremely high temperatures and glows in infrared light as it falls into the black hole.</p>

<h4>An exoplanet’s sky</h4>



<p>This “image” is clearly different from the others, but it’s no less scientifically exciting. It shows the spectrum of light from the star WASP 96 as it passes through the atmosphere of its gas giant planet, WASP 96b.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You get a bunch of what looks like bumps and wiggles to some people but it’s actually full of information content,” said NASA exoplanet scientist Knicole Colón. “You’re actually seeing bumps and wiggles that indicate the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of this exoplanet.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Probing a planet</h3>



<p>JWST took a spectrum of light from the star WASP 96 filtering through the atmosphere of its giant planet WASP 96b. The bumps and wiggles show how much light at various wavelengths gets absorbed by the atmosphere, revealing signs of water vapor, haze and unexpected clouds.</p>

<p>The planet is about half the mass of Jupiter and orbits its star every 3.4 days. Previously astronomers thought it had no clouds in its sky, but the new data from JWST show signs of clouds and haze. “There is evidence of clouds and hazes because the water features are not quite as large as we predicted,” Colón said.</p>

<h4>A long time coming</h4>



<p>These first images and data have been a very long time coming. The telescope that would become JWST was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">first dreamed up in the 1980s</a>, and the planning and construction suffered years of budget issues and delays (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>



<p>The telescope finally launched on December 25. It then had to unfold and assemble itself in space, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">travel to a gravitationally stable spot</a> about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, align its insectlike primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal segments and calibrate its science instruments (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). There were hundreds of possible points of failure in that process, but the telescope unfurled successfully and got to work.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are so thrilled that it works because there&#8217;s so much at risk,” says JWST senior project scientist John Mather of NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center. “The world has trusted us to put our billions into this and make it go, and it works.

<p>In the months following, the telescope team released <a href="https://twitter.com/ESA_Webb/status/1544788493871812611">teasers of imagery</a> from calibration, which already showed hundreds of distant, never-before-seen galaxies. But the images now being released are the first full-color pictures made from the data scientists will use to start unraveling mysteries of the universe.</p>



<p>“It sees things that I never dreamed were out there,” Mather says.</p>



<p>For the telescope team, the relief in finally seeing the first images was palpable. “It was like, ‘Oh my god, we made it!’” says image processor Alyssa Pagan, also of Space Telescope Science Institute. “It seems impossible. It’s like the impossible happened.”</p>



<p>In light of the expected anticipation surrounding the first batch of images, the imaging team was sworn to secrecy.&nbsp; “I couldn’t even share it with my wife,” says Pontoppidan, leader of the team that produced the first color science images.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re looking at the deepest image of the universe yet, and you’re the only one who’s seen that,” he says, of the first picture released July 11. “It’s profoundly lonely.” Soon, though, the team of scientists, image processors and science writers was seeing something new every day for weeks as the telescope downloaded the first images. “It’s a crazy experience,” Pontoppidan says. “Once in a lifetime.”</p>



<p>For Pagan, the timing is perfect. “It’s a very unifying thing,” she says. “The world is so polarized right now. I think it could use something that’s a little bit more universal and connecting. It’s a good perspective, to be reminded that we’re part of something so much greater and beautiful.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>JWST is just getting started as it now begins its first round of full science operations. “There&#8217;s lots more science to be done,” Mather says. “The mysteries of the universe will not come to an end anytime soon.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-strength-big-g-newton-gravitational-constant">Wiggling metal beams offer a new way to test gravity’s strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the quest to measure the fundamental constant that governs the strength of gravity, scientists are getting a wiggle on.</p>



<p>Using a pair of meter-long, vibrating metal beams, scientists have made <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01642-8">a new measurement of “Big G,”</a> also known as Newton’s gravitational constant, researchers report July 11 in <em>Nature Physics</em>. The technique could help physicists get a better handle on the poorly measured constant.</p>



<p>Big G is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/notorious-big-g-gets-little-larger">notoriously difficult to determine</a> (<em>SN: 9/12/13</em>). Previous estimates of the constant disagree with one another, leaving scientists in a muddle over its true value. It is the least precisely known of the fundamental constants, a group of numbers that commonly show up in equations, making them a prime target for precise measurements.</p>





<p>Because the vibrating beam test is a new type of experiment, “it might help to understand what’s really going on,” says engineer and physicist Jürg Dual of ETH Zurich.</p>



<p>The researchers repeatedly bent one of the beams back and forth and used lasers to measure how the second beam responded to the first beam’s varying gravitational pull. To help maintain a stable temperature and avoid external vibrations that could stymie the experiment, the researchers performed their work 80 meters underground, in what was once a military fortress in the Swiss Alps.</p>



<p>Big G, according to the new measurement, is approximately 6.82 x 10<sup>-11</sup> meters cubed per kilogram per square second. But the estimate has an uncertainty of about 1.6 percent, which is large compared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strength-gravity-gravitational-constant-newton">other measurements</a> (<em>SN: 8/29/18</em>). So the number is not yet precise enough to sway the debate over Big G’s value. But the team now plans to improve their measurement, for example by adding a modified version of the test with rotating bars. That might help cut down on Big G’s wiggle room.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/702418922/0/oupblogpsychology/">Were you prepared for this pandemic?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/07/were-you-prepared-for-this-pandemic/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/imageedit_1_4161647984-1-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Did you have a stock of fitted, unexpired N95 masks in your closet and a six-month supply of non-perishable foods in the pantry? Pretty much nobody was fully prepared, including me. Were you relying on the healthcare system to keep supplies on hand? In this case, the healthcare system was itself rapidly overwhelmed and close to collapse. Should we expect better preparedness from ourselves and our society?</p><p>“Way back” in 2003/4, with the SARS outbreak in Toronto, we were also surprised. We were not at all fully prepared for an outbreak of these proportions. Justice Archie Campbell,&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/e_records/sars/report/">in his investigation</a>&nbsp;of this, pointed out deficiencies in the system. These were not recommendations for treatment of patients. He made specific recommendations regarding systemic improvement. These improvements were only partially implemented, and the COVID-19 pandemic was as much a surprise in Ontario as it was elsewhere. His most important recommendation/suggestion/warning was that the precautionary principle was needed in future, in that “reasonable efforts to reduce risk need not await scientific proof.”</p><p>It may be that an expectation of full coordination, cooperation, communication, and logistical nimbleness is too much to ask of healthcare, public health, and societal systems that are not as much of an organized “system” as is believed. So, let’s leave that out of the discussion for now, and focus on the precautionary principle as the most important element of preparedness, as Campbell suggested.</p><p>In 2003 in Toronto, we were initially advised to take full airborne precautions; we wore N95 masks, with gowns and gloves. Why? Because the organism and the disease were totally unknown, and public health was taking few chances. What of the precautionary principle 19 years later? An&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00925-7">article in Nature in April 2022 by D. Lewis</a>&nbsp;pointed out several reasons why it took the World Health Organization (WHO) two years to declare that COVID-19 is airborne. A number of these reasons invoked a failure to use the precautionary principle. This required significant disregard for the WHO’s own documents and recommendations from two decades earlier. Ministers of both Health and Environment, for the Member States in the WHO European Region “way back” in 2004&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2092570/">declared</a>: “We reaffirm the importance of the precautionary principle as a risk management tool, and we therefore recommend that it should be applied”.&nbsp;As well, another&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/346211%20Downloaded%20Jun7">WHO publication from 2004</a>&nbsp;dealing entirely with the precautionary principle stated that, “If used intelligently, imaginatively and daringly, the precautionary principle will support efforts to strive towards a healthier and safer world”.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8220;At its simplest, the precautionary principle means that when there is serious risk, one should not wait for scientific confirmation before taking action.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>The precautionary principle had its origins in environmental protections in the 1970s. Although there is no universal definition, at its simplest, the precautionary principle means that when there is serious risk, one should not wait for scientific confirmation before taking action. There is a mistaken impression that the precautionary principle calls for jumping from the frying pan without scientific evidence of the characteristics of the fire. One may take action without waiting for scientific confirmation of the size of the fire, the number of BTUs produced, and the radius of the fire ring, if the frying pan is getting hot. Without full knowledge, there is indeed a risk of landing in the fire. However, if there is an estimate of the fire, then jumping may be a much safer alternative than waiting in the frying pan. The truth is that the precautionary principle is a clarion call for scientific evidence, as noted&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2092570/">by Dr Martuzzi</a>: “Thus, precaution requires more and better science.”</p><p>It seems reasonable to make preparations for catastrophe, if there is some evidence of impending catastrophe, even if the precise nature and extent of the catastrophe is not yet fully delineated. Should it turn out that there was no catastrophe, or that the risk was not great, “minimizers” look brilliant, having predicted the outcome correctly. As bets go, that would be a good bet—catastrophes are rare. In the process, they manage to fully protect the comfort of many people by minimizing danger and worry. More importantly, they also fully protect their budgets. A&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynewinegarden/2020/05/15/anti-science-precautionary-principle-jeopardizes-health-safety-and-risks-innovation/?sh=b0388046a35">Forbes article in 2020</a>, called the precautionary principle “Anti-Science” on the basis that it held up developments of medical advances whose releases were postponed, awaiting more scientific proof. This article, or its ilk, are worth consideration, but I do not agree that it is cause to outright reject the precautionary principle.</p><p>Should, in the end, there be no catastrophe, those who issued warnings using the precautionary principle will be assailed on the basis of having disturbed both comfort and budgets. On the other hand, should it turn out that the catastrophe was inevitable, those who used the precautionary principle do look very good. Regarding COVID-19, in January 2020, I said to my hospital staff “here we go again—maybe—take care.” A year later, the nurses were asking, “how did you know?” I knew because of my experience in Toronto in 2003/4. The accurate prediction of the possibility brought me no joy. I didn’t know the precise risk, but I knew there was a risk, and I thought information using the precautionary principle was important to communicate.</p><p>Why does the precautionary principle apply to pandemics? Because the downside of refusing to apply the precautionary principle to pandemics is dire. We have not yet left the current COVID-19 pandemic behind us, but it is a certainty that the next pandemic is coming. We don’t know where or when, but it is coming. Are you prepared? Are we all prepared? Are we prepared to face the costs of being prepared?</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/702418922/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/702418922/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f07%2fimageedit_1_4161647984-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/702418922/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/07/global-health-diplomacy-and-north-korea-in-the-covid-19-era/">Global health diplomacy and North Korea in the COVID-19 era</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/06/how-can-we-build-the-resilience-of-our-healthcare-systems/">How can we build the resilience of our healthcare systems?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/06/aduhelm-and-the-politics-of-drug-approval-in-the-united-states/">Aduhelm and the politics of drug approval in the United States</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/demond-mullins-mount-everest-black-people-outdoors-veterans-society">Demond Mullins climbed Everest to inspire more Black outdoor enthusiasts</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Demond “Dom” Mullins’ days as a student at Lehman College in New York were interrupted in 2004 when his National Guard unit was deployed to Baghdad. A year later, he returned home but struggled with depression and rage. Immersing himself in his studies helped him make sense of the world and his experiences. After completing degrees in Africana studies and political science, Mullins earned a Ph.D. in sociology, focusing his research on a subject he knew firsthand: how returning veterans reintegrate into society.</p>





<p class="has-normal-font-size">In 2015, the avid climber and adventure sportsman joined six other veterans and a journalist on a monthlong excursion to climb Alaska’s Denali, the highest peak in North America. To understand the health benefits of high-risk outdoor adventuring outside the clinical therapy framework, Mullins interviewed each participant and collected data about group cohesion and the impact of such high-risk activities on social bonds for his study “<a href="https://www.academia.edu/22881352/_Veterans_Expeditions_Tapping_the_Great_Outdoors_">Veterans Expeditions: Tapping the great outdoors</a>.”</p>



<p>Formerly an adjunct assistant professor at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City, Mullins has climbed Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. In May, he tackled his biggest climbing challenge yet: summiting Mount Everest, the world’s tallest mountain. He and seven other members of <a href="https://www.fullcircleeverest.com/">Full Circle Everest</a>, an all-Black mountaineering team, set out to make history. Seven of them reached the summit, coming very close to doubling the number of Black people who have achieved that feat.</p>

<p><em>Science News </em>asked Mullins, while he was preparing for the climb, about his research and why he wants more Black people in outdoor spaces. This interview was edited for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>When you returned home from Iraq, you cut yourself off from others and contemplated ending your life. What helped you get through the worst times?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins: </strong>Education. I was grappling with the discontents of coming home and struggling with what I had experienced in the Iraq War. Education allowed me to explore aspects of my experience intellectually through things that really engaged me — history and social theory.</p>



<p><em><strong>SN:</strong> </em><strong>Did the war change what you envisioned for yourself academically?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: It influenced my trajectory. Graduate school was not even on my radar before. When I came home, I had this great urgency to improve my future, learn more about global politics and understand how history could produce such a moment. I also wanted to know how all of that might influence veterans’ reintegration.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>How did the Denali research expedition follow on your work on veteran reintegration?</strong></p>



<p>I became an avid mountaineer, rock and ice climber and began training with <a href="https://www.vetexpeditions.com/">Veterans Expeditions</a> [a nonprofit that works to enhance the life of U.S. veterans]. By the time the Denali expedition came about in May 2015, the cofounder [Nick Watson] asked me to be a part of it. I wanted to tell the story of veterans summiting Denali in a way that makes sense, was scientifically rigorous and could contribute to the research. I wanted to answer certain questions about how interventions like hiking and climbing might come into play. Ethnography [the study of people in their environment] was the best way to do that.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>What did you learn about veterans and outdoor adventuring?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: Much more than in the past, my generation of veterans is more willing to talk about their experiences with each other to find affinity and solidarity. After leaving the service, some lose their identity, partly because there is no space reserved for them to perform the identities they have cultivated through military training, socialization and performance. I learned that they engage in these kinds of high-risk sporting events to support their identities. The outdoors is sort of a theater to perform the heroic identities they’ve developed in a way that can be conducive to greater physical and communal health. One veteran said to me, “The rock and the ice don’t lie to me.” He was reasserting that he is a warrior.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN: </em>How did you become a part of Full Circle Everest?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: Through Veterans Expeditions, I developed a relationship with [world-famous mountaineer] Conrad Anker. Conrad had this idea about putting together an all-Black expedition to Everest. He introduced me to [Full Circle expedition leader and organizer] Philip Henderson, who had been considering this for a long time. I met Phil and knew right away that I wanted to be a part of that expedition and help find other athletes.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>What, if anything, about your experience on Denali do you believe will benefit your attempt to summit Mount Everest?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: Everest is 9,000 feet taller than Denali. It’s a longer pursuit and a longer expedition, but the conditions will be similar. We got snowed in on Denali for 17 days, which I believe has prepared me for my expedition with Full Circle.</p>



<p>This pursuit is about developing relationships with people who have common experiences. It’s having someone who gets your drift, who understands what you mean without you needing to explain everything. It’s about building community and feeling like you belong. People want to feel like the group is better as a result of their participation. It’s all about social cohesion.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>Will you be conducting research on this expedition?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: This time, I’ll be studying myself — doing an autoethnography. I took time off from work to do this climb, so I don’t have any pressing job to get back to. I plan to take some time to reflect and write about this once it’s over, to help people understand the value of it for me.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em>The Full Circle team spent a few weeks together in January at the Khumbu Climbing Center in Nepal. Your teammates went home, then came back in April to start the climb, but you stayed in Nepal. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: It gives me an edge in so many different ways: having time for my body to properly acclimate to the elevation, understanding how to keep myself safe and comfortable in the elements. Also developing relationships with the locals, the Sherpas and the other Nepalese persons who are supporting the expedition.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>What do you want people to take away from your Full Circle Everest expedition?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mullins</strong>: Diversity in the outdoors matters. The military completely introduced me to outdoor sports. When I was a kid, I never went camping or even hiking. I thought [Brooklyn’s] Prospect Park was the wilderness. These activities have benefits for all people. Hopefully, Full Circle will help African Americans of all ages get outside to hike, camp and explore.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scent-zika-dengue-infection-mosquito-lure-acetophenone">The flowery scent of a Zika or dengue infection lures mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some mosquito-borne viruses turn mice into alluring mosquito bait.</p>



<p>Mice infected with dengue or Zika viruses — and people infected with dengue — emit <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867422006419">a flowery, orange-smelling chemical that tempts hungry mosquitoes</a>, researchers report June 30 in <em>Cell</em>. In mice, the infections spur the growth of skin-inhabiting bacteria that make the chemical, drawing in bloodsucking <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes that could then transmit the viruses to new hosts, including humans.</p>



<p>Previous studies showed that other mosquito species prefer to feed on animals carrying the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-molecule-makes-blood-extra-alluring-mosquitoes">parasite that causes malaria</a> (<em>SN: 2/9/17</em>). But it was unknown whether the same was true for viruses such as dengue or Zika, says Gong Cheng, a microbiologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing.</p>





<p>The chemical acetophenone — which to humans smells like orange blossom — may be that lure. Mice infected with dengue or Zika viruses give off approximately 10 times more acetophenone and attract more mosquitoes than uninfected animals, Cheng and colleagues found. People infected with dengue similarly release more of the chemical than healthy people. Samples of odors taken from the armpits of infected people also created potent mosquito magnets when smeared on filter paper attached to a volunteer’s palm.</p>





<p>Acetophenone typically comes from bacteria. Researchers found that <em>Bacillus</em> bacteria on mice were the likely culprits producing the chemical. An infection stops mice from making an antimicrobial protein called RELMα, allowing the acetophenone-emitting microbes to flourish.</p>



<p>But a component of some acne medications can bring back RELMα in mice, the team found. Infected animals fed a derivative of vitamin A called isotretinoin produced less acetophenone and become less attractive mosquito targets.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s possible that giving people isotretinoin could help reduce virus transmission among people by hiding infected people from the bloodsucking insects, Cheng says. He and colleagues are planning to test the strategy in Malaysia, where dengue circulates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brown-dwarf-sand-cloud-atmosphere-space">Sand clouds are common in atmospheres of brown dwarfs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clouds of sand can condense, grow and disappear in some extraterrestrial atmospheres. A new look at old data shows that clouds made of hot silicate minerals are common in celestial objects known as brown dwarfs.</p>



<p>“This is the first full contextual understanding of any cloud outside the solar system,” says astronomer Stanimir Metchev of the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada. Metchev’s colleague Genaro Suárez presented the new work <a href="https://coolstars21.github.io/">July 4 at the Cool Stars meeting</a> in Toulouse, France.</p>





<p>Clouds come in many flavors in our solar system, from Earth’s puffs of water vapor to Jupiter’s bands of ammonia. Astronomers have also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">inferred the presence of “extrasolar clouds</a>” on planets outside the solar system (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>But the only extrasolar clouds that have been directly detected were in the skies of brown dwarfs — dim, ruddy orbs that are too large to be planets but too small and cool to be stars. In 2004, astronomers used NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope to observe brown dwarfs and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/420707">spotted spectral signatures of sand</a> — more specifically, grains of silicate minerals such as quartz and olivine. A few more <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/505637">tentative examples</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/524726">sand clouds</a> were spotted in 2006 and 2008.</p>



<p>Floating in one of these clouds would feel like being in a sandstorm, says planetary scientist Mark Marley of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was involved in one of those early discoveries. “If you could take a scoop out of it and bring it home, you would have hot sand.”</p>



<p>Astronomers at the time found six examples of these silicate clouds. “I kind of thought that was it,” Marley says. Theoretically, there should be a lot more than six brown dwarfs with sandy skies. But part of the Spitzer telescope ran out of coolant in 2009 and was no longer able to measure similar clouds’ chemistry.</p>



<p>While Suárez was looking into archived Spitzer data for a different project, he realized there were unpublished or unanalyzed data on dozens of brown dwarfs. So he analyzed all of the low-mass stars and brown dwarfs that Spitzer had ever observed, 113 objects in total, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/4/5701/6576783?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">68 of which had never been published before</a>, the team reports in the July <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</em></p>



<p>“It’s very impressive to me that this was hiding in plain sight,” Marley says.</p>



<p>Not every brown dwarf in the sample showed strong signs of silicate clouds. But together, the brown dwarfs followed a clear trend. For dwarfs and low-mass stars hotter than about 1700˚ Celsius, silicates exist as a vapor, and the objects show no signs of clouds. But below that temperature, signs of clouds start to appear, becoming thickest around 1300˚ C. Then the signal disappears for brown dwarfs that are cooler than about 1000˚ C, as the clouds sink deep into the atmospheres.</p>



<p>The finding confirms previous suspicions that silicate clouds are widespread and reveals the conditions under which they form. Because brown dwarfs are born hot and cool down over time, most of them should see each phase of sand cloud evolution as they age. “We are learning how these brown dwarfs live,” Suárez says. Future research can extrapolate the results to better understand atmospheres in planets like Jupiter, he notes.</p>



<p>The recently launched <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> will also study atmospheric chemistry in exoplanets and brown dwarfs and will specifically look for clouds (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>). Marley looks forward to combining the trends from this study with future results from JWST. “It’s really going to be a renaissance in brown dwarf science,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pitcher-plant-underground-new-species-carnivorous">This pitcher plant species sets its deathtraps underground</a></h4>

              
                <p>Biologist Martin Dančák didn’t set out to find a plant species new to science. But on a hike through a rainforest in Borneo, he and colleagues stumbled on a subterranean surprise.</p>



<p>Hidden beneath the soil and inside dark, mossy pockets below tree roots, carnivorous pitcher plants dangled their deathtraps underground. The pitchers can look like hollow eggplants and probably lure unsuspecting prey into their sewer hole-like traps. Once an ant or a beetle steps in, the insect falls to its death, drowning in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-help-carnivorous-plants-drown-their-prey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a stew of digestive juices</a> (<em>SN: 11/22/16</em>). Until now, scientists had never observed pitcher plants with traps almost exclusively entombed in earth.&nbsp;</p>





<p><em>“</em>We were, of course, astonished as nobody would expect that a pitcher plant with underground traps could exist,” says Dančák, of&nbsp;Palacký University in Olomouc, Czech Republic.</p>



<p>That’s because pitchers tend to be fragile. But the new species’ <a href="https://phytokeys.pensoft.net/article/82872/">hidden traps have fleshy walls that may help them push against soil</a> as they grow underground, Dančák and colleagues report June 23 in <em>PhytoKeys</em>. Because the buried pitchers stay concealed from sight, the team named the species <em>Nepenthes pudica, </em>a nod to the Latin word for bashful.</p>



<p>The work “highlights how much biodiversity still exists that we haven’t fully discovered,” says Leonora Bittleston, a biologist at Boise State University in Idaho who was not involved with the study. It’s possible that other pitcher plant species may have traps lurking underground and scientists just haven’t noticed yet, she says. “I think a lot of people don’t really dig down.”</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Splitting sensory information into parallel pathways is a common strategy in
sensory systems. Yet, how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to
maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly
understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral
and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the
emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral
inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral
inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described
differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells.
Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted
cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating
that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may
be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">A supersensitive dark matter search found no signs of the substance — yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>The next generation of dark matter detectors has arrived.</p>



<p>A massive new effort to detect the elusive substance has reported its first results. Following a time-honored tradition of dark matter hunters, the experiment, called LZ, didn’t find dark matter. But it has done that <a href="https://lz.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/LZ_SR1_Paper_7July2022.pdf">better than ever before</a>, physicists report July 7 in a virtual webinar and a paper posted on LZ’s website. And with several additional years of data-taking planned from LZ and other experiments like it, physicists are hopeful they’ll finally get a glimpse of dark matter.</p>





<p>“Dark matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in particle physics today,” LZ spokesperson Hugh Lippincott, a physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara said during the webinar.</p>



<p>LZ, or LUX-ZEPLIN, aims to discover the unidentified particles that are thought to make up most of the universe’s matter. Although no one has ever conclusively detected a particle of dark matter, its influence on the universe can be seen in the motions of stars and galaxies, and via <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planck-satellite-picture-infant-universe-gets-final-tweaks">other cosmic observations</a> (<em>SN: 7/24/18</em>).</p>



<p>Located about 1.5 kilometers underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, S.D., the detector is filled with 10 metric tons of liquid xenon. If dark matter particles crash into the nuclei of any of those xenon atoms, they would produce flashes of light that the detector would pick up.</p>



<p>The LZ experiment is one of a new generation of bigger, badder dark matter detectors based on liquid xenon, which also includes XENONnT in Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy and PandaX-4T in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The experiments aim to detect a theorized type of dark matter called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shadows-two-failed-searches-loom-over-physics">WIMPs</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/16</em>). Scientists scaled up the search to allow for a better chance of spying the particles, with each detector containing multiple tons of liquid xenon.</p>



<p>Using only about 60 days’ worth of data, LZ has already surpassed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-particles-elude-scientists-biggest-search-wimps">earlier efforts</a> to pin down WIMPs (<em>SN: 5/28/18</em>). “It’s really impressive what they’ve been able to pull off; it’s a technological marvel,” says theoretical physicist Dan Hooper of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Although LZ’s search came up empty, “the way something’s going to be discovered is when you have multiple years in a row of running,” says LZ collaborator Matthew Szydagis, a physicist at the University at Albany in New York. LZ is expected to run for about five years, and data from that extended period may provide physicists’ best chance to find the particles.</p>



<p>Now that the detector has proven its potential, says LZ physicist Kevin Lesko of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, “we’re excited about what we’re going to see.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-short-arms-tyrannosaurus-rex-meraxes-gigas-paleontology">A newfound dinosaur had tiny arms before T. rex made them cool</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>’s tiny arms have launched a thousand <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/928881-t-rex-s-short-arms">sarcastic memes</a>: I love you <em>this</em> much; can you pass the salt?; row, row, row your … oh.</p>



<p>But back off, snarky jokesters. A newfound species of big-headed carnivorous dinosaur with tiny forelimbs suggests those arms weren’t just an evolutionary punchline. Arm reduction — alongside giant heads — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.05.057">evolved independently in different dinosaur lineages</a>, researchers report July 7 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p><em>Meraxes gigas</em>, named for a dragon in George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series, lived between 100 million and 90 million years ago in what’s now Argentina, says Juan Canale, a paleontologist with the country’s CONICET research network who is based in Buenos Aires. Despite the resemblance to <em>T. rex</em>, <em>M. gigas</em> wasn’t a tyrannosaur; it was a carcharodontosaur — a member of a distantly related, lesser-known group of predatory theropod dinosaurs. <em>M. gigas</em> went extinct nearly 20 million years before <em>T. rex</em> walked on Earth.</p>





<p>The <em>M. gigas</em> individual described by Canale and colleagues was about 45 years old and weighed more than four metric tons when it died, they estimate. The fossilized specimen is about 11 meters long, and its skull is heavily ornamented with crests and bumps and tiny hornlets, ornamentations that probably helped attract mates.</p>



<p>Why these dinosaurs had such tiny arms is an enduring mystery. They weren’t for hunting: Both <em>T. rex</em> and <em>M. gigas</em> used their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tyrannosaurus-rex-pulverized-bones-incredible-amount-force">massive heads to hunt prey</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/18</em>). The arms may have shrunk <a href="https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app67/app009212021.pdf">so they were out of the way</a> during the frenzy of group feeding on carcasses.</p>



<p>But, Canale says, <em>M. gigas’</em> arms were surprisingly muscular, suggesting they were more than just an inconvenient limb. One possibility is that the arms helped lift the animal from a reclining to a standing position. Another is that they aided in mating — perhaps showing a mate some love.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-college-campus-coronavirus-deaths-communities">College COVID-19 testing can reduce coronavirus deaths in local communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Getting a COVID-19 test has become a regular part of many college students’ lives. That ritual may protect not just those students’ classmates and professors but also their municipal bus drivers, neighbors and other members of the local community, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Counties where colleges and universities did COVID-19 testing saw <a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000065#pdig.0000065.s001">fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths</a> than ones with schools that did not do any testing in the fall of 2020, researchers report June 23 in <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>. While previous analyses have shown that counties with colleges that brought students back to campus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-college-university-campus-cases-testing">had more COVID-19 cases</a> than those that continued online instruction, this is the first look at the impact of campus testing on those communities on a national scale (<em>SN: 2/23/21</em>).</p>

<p>“It’s tough to think of universities as just silos within cities; it’s just much more permeable than that,” says Brennan Klein, a network scientist at Northeastern University in Boston.</p>



<p>Colleges that tested their students generally did not see significantly lower case counts than schools that didn’t do testing, Klein and his colleagues found. But the communities surrounding these schools did see fewer cases and deaths. That’s because towns with colleges conducting regular testing had a more accurate sense of how much COVID-19 was circulating in their communities, Klein says, which allowed those towns to understand the risk level and put masking policies and other mitigation strategies in place.</p>



<p>The results highlight the crucial role testing can continue to play as students return to campus this fall, says Sam Scarpino, vice president of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute in Washington, D.C. Testing “may not be optional in the fall if we want to keep colleges and universities open safely,” he says.</p>





<h4>Finding a flight path</h4>



<p>As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world in the spring of 2020, it had a swift impact on U.S. college students. Most were abruptly sent home from their dorm rooms, lecture halls, study abroad programs and even spring break outings to spend what would be the remainder of the semester online. And with the start of the fall semester just months away, schools were “flying blind” as to how to bring students back to campus safely, Klein says.</p>



<p>That fall, Klein, Scarpino and their collaborators began to put together a potential flight path for schools by collecting data from COVID-19 dashboards created by universities and the counties surrounding those schools to track cases. The researchers classified schools based on whether they had opted for entirely online learning or in-person teaching. They then divided the schools with in-person learning based on whether they did any testing.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a perfect comparison, Klein says, because this method groups schools that did one round of testing with those that did consistent surveillance testing. But the team’s analyses still generally show how colleges’ pandemic response impacted their local communities.</p>



<p>Overall, counties with colleges saw more cases and deaths than counties without schools. However, testing helped minimize the increase in cases and deaths. During the fall semester, from August to December, counties with colleges that did testing saw on average 14 fewer deaths per 100,000 people than counties with colleges that brought students back with no testing — 56 deaths per 100,000 versus about 70.</p>

<h3>College testing advantage</h3>



<p>During the fall of 2020, the first semester colleges and universities brought students back to campus during the pandemic, counties with schools that did COVID-19 testing had a lower death rate on average (red line) than schools that did not do testing (yellow line), a new data analysis shows. Counties with campus testing experienced 56 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents; that average rose to about 70 per 100,000 in counties without any testing. In comparison, the national death rate (black line) for that time period was about 59 deaths per 100,000 but often tracked a little lower than that of college counties, researchers found.</p>

<p>The University of Massachusetts Amherst, with nearly 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students in 2020, is one case study of the value of the testing, Klein says. Throughout the fall semester, the school <a href="https://www.umass.edu/coronavirus/news/update-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-program">tested students twice a week</a>. That meant that three times as many tests occurred in the city of Amherst than in neighboring cities, he says. For much of the fall and winter, Amherst had fewer COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents than its neighboring counties and statewide averages.</p>



<p>Once students left for winter break, campus testing stopped – so overall local testing dropped. When students returned for spring semester in February 2021, area cases spiked — possibly driven by students bringing the coronavirus back from their travels and by being exposed to local residents whose cases may have been missed due to the drop in local testing. Students returned “to a town that has more COVID than they realize” Klein says.</p>



<p>Renewed campus testing not only picked up the spike but quickly prompted mitigation strategies. The university moved classes to Zoom and asked students to remain in their rooms, at one point even telling them that they <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/amid-covid-outbreak-umass-amherst-prohibits-students-from-leaving-dorms-for-walks/2299189/">should not go on walks outdoors</a>. By mid-March, the university reduced the spread of cases on campus and the town once again had a lower COVID-19 case rate than its neighbors for the remainder of the semester, the team found.</p>



<h4>The value of testing</h4>



<p>It’s helpful to know that testing overall helped protect local communities, says David Paltiel, a public health researcher at the Yale School of Public Health who was not involved with the study. Paltiel was one of the first researchers to call for <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768923">routine testing on college campuses</a>, regardless of whether students had symptoms.</p>



<p>“I believe that testing and masking and all those things probably were really useful, because in the fall of 2020 we didn&#8217;t have a vaccine yet,” he says. Quickly identifying cases and isolating affected students, he adds, was key at the time.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>But each school is unique, he says, and the benefit of testing probably varied between schools. And today, two and a half years into the pandemic, the cost-benefit calculation is different now that vaccines are widely available and schools are faced with newer variants of SARS-CoV-2. Some of those variants spread so quickly that even testing twice a week may not catch all cases on campus quickly enough to stop their spread, he says.</p>



<p>As colleges and universities prepare for the fall 2022 semester, he would recommend schools consider testing students as they return to campus with less frequent follow-up surveillance testing to “make sure things aren’t spinning crazy out of control.”</p>



<p>Still, the study shows that regular campus testing can benefit the broader community, Scarpino says. In fact, he hopes to capitalize on the interest in testing for COVID-19 to roll out more expansive public health testing for multiple respiratory viruses, including the flu, in places like college campuses. In addition to PCR tests — the kind that involve sticking a swab up your nose — such efforts might also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">analyze wastewater</a> and air within buildings for pathogens (<em>SN: 05/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>Unchecked coronavirus transmission continues to disrupt lives — in the United States and globally — and new variants will continue to emerge, he says. “We need to be prepared for another surge of SARS-CoV-2 in the fall when the schools reopen, and we&#8217;re back in respiratory season.”</p>

<h2><span class="caps">CNS</span>*2022 Satellite tutorials: recap<a class="headerlink" href="#cns-2022-satellite-tutorials-recap" title="Permalink to this headline">⋆</a></h2>
<p>The primary agenda for the meeting was to discuss the software working group satellite&nbsp;tutorials.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>there were 256 registrants in&nbsp;total</li>
<li>for each session, more than 85 people had indicated that they would attend, but average turn out was at about 10&#8212;20 for each&nbsp;session</li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed ideas for the next round of satellite tutorials to increase turn&nbsp;out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we could send out daily reminders with links during the tutorial days<ul>
<li>per session e-mails could also be sent out, but would be too much work to do manually (and error&nbsp;prone)</li>
<li>needs to be automated in a way that e-mails don&#8217;t end up in spam: can be scripted using tool such as <a class="reference external" href="https://mailtrap.io/blog/python-mail-merge/">mailmerge</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>also generate and attach an <span class="caps">ICS</span> calendar file to e-mails so attendees can add to their&nbsp;calendars</li>
<li>we could require additional confirmation/cancellation before starting; this will give us better idea of who will attend, but won&#8217;t necessarily increase&nbsp;attendance</li>
<li>we could have a low registration fee: this will filter out people who &#8220;just sign up&#8221;, but may not increase actual attendance<ul>
<li>could include registration waivers for&nbsp;students</li>
<li>could make it free for <span class="caps">INCF</span>/<span class="caps">OCNS</span> members: encourage&nbsp;memberships</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>people may not have known enough about tools to know what sessions to attend<ul>
<li>we could have a starting keynote on introduction to comp neuro, and then it gives attendees an idea of what is going to be featured during the tutorials<ul>
<li>it&#8217;ll be good to get a high profile speaker who would be happy to do this to increase&nbsp;attendance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>see also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/61">https://github.com/<span class="caps">OCNS</span>/SoftwareWG/issues/61</a></li>
<li>we could also have a recording with a few minutes about each tool that&#8217;s featured in the satellite tutorials: teaser type video; so that people can watch a quick YouTube video and get an idea of all&nbsp;tutorials</li>
<li>we could also have a set of slides based on a template showing the features of each&nbsp;tool</li>
<li>these last few ideas require some extra work from participating&nbsp;tutors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spreading the sessions over weeks instead of days in a week may not necessarily increase&nbsp;attendance</li>
<li><span class="caps">ACTION</span>: Ankur create and send out feedback survey to registrants to gather information on what went well and why people were not able to attend; it&#8217;s important to understand if it was because people missed sessions because the information/calendar wasn&#8217;t clearly accessible so that we can improve on&nbsp;these</li>
<li>does it make sense to do it <em>after</em> the conferences to build on the momentum of the conference: can be done, the next ones in ~6 months time will be independent of the&nbsp;conference</li>
<li>we must push both <span class="caps">INCF</span> and <span class="caps">OCNS</span> to send out communications about the&nbsp;sessions</li>
<li>we may repeat this again in 6 months, with improvements: &#8220;Simulator week&#8221;?<ul>
<li>Depends on how many software <span class="caps">WG</span> folks can commit to spending time on helping with&nbsp;organisation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="caps">ACTION</span>: Ankur e-mail all tutors with our discussion and improvements for the next iteration, asking if they&#8217;d be happy to re-do sessions if we repeat in 6&nbsp;months.</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-stupa-tower-india-drinking-water-irrigation">How to build better ice towers for drinking water and irrigation</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a better way to build a glacier.</p>



<p>During winter in India’s mountainous Ladakh region, some farmers use pipes and sprinklers to construct building-sized cones of ice. These towering, humanmade glaciers, called ice stupas, slowly release water as they melt during the dry spring months for communities to drink or irrigate crops. But the pipes often freeze when conditions get too cold, stifling construction.</p>



<p>Now, preliminary results show that <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/hydrology22/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1027738">an automated system</a> can erect an ice stupa while avoiding frozen pipes, using local weather data to control when and how much water is spouted. What’s more, the new system uses roughly a tenth the amount of water that the conventional method uses, researchers reported June 23 at the Frontiers in Hydrology meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>





<p>“This is one of the technological steps forward that we need to get this innovative idea to the point where it&#8217;s realistic as a solution,” says glaciologist Duncan Quincey of the University of Leeds in England who was not involved in the research. Automation could help communities build larger, longer-lasting ice stupas that provide more water during dry periods, he says.</p>



<p>Ice stupas emerged in 2014 as a means for communities to cope with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/himalayan-glacier-melting-threatens-water-security-millions-people">shrinking alpine glaciers</a> due to human-caused climate change (<em>SN: 5/29/19</em>). Typically, high-mountain communities in India, Kyrgyzstan and Chile pipe glacial meltwater into gravity-driven fountains that sprinkle continuously in the winter. Cold air freezes the drizzle, creating frozen cones that can store millions of liters of water.</p>



<p>The process is simple, though inefficient. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.771342/full">More than 70 percent</a> of the spouted water may flow away instead of freezing, says glaciologist Suryanarayanan Balasubramanian of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.</p>



<p>So Balasubramanian and his team outfitted an ice stupa’s fountain with a computer that automatically adjusted the spout’s flow rate based on local temperatures, humidity and wind speed. Then the scientists tested the system by building two ice stupas in Guttannen, Switzerland — one using a continuously spraying fountain and one using the automated system.</p>



<p>After four months, the team found that the continuously sprinkling fountain had spouted about 1,100 cubic meters of water and amassed 53 cubic meters of ice, with pipes freezing once. The automated system sprayed only around 150 cubic meters of water but formed 61 cubic meters of ice, without any frozen pipes.</p>



<p>The researchers are now trying to simplify their prototype to make it more affordable for high-mountain communities around the world. “We eventually want to reduce the cost so that it is within two months of salary of the farmers in Ladakh,” Balasubramanian says. “Around $200 to $400.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593133231">An Immense World</a><br><em>Ed Yong<br>Random House, $30</em></p>



<p>Emerald jewel wasps know what cockroach brains feel like.</p>



<p>This comes in handy when a female wasp needs to turn a cockroach into an obedient zombie that will host her larvae and serve as dinner. First, the wasp plunges its stinger into the cock­roach’s midsection to briefly paralyze the legs. Next comes a more delicate operation: stinging the head to deliver a dose of venom to specific nerve cells in the brain, which gives the wasp control over where its victim goes. But how does a wasp know when it’s reached the brain? The stinger’s tip is a sensory probe. In experiments using brainless cockroaches, a wasp will sting the head over and over again, searching fruitlessly for its desired target.</p>





<p>A brain-feeling stinger is just one example of the myriad ways animals sense the world around them. We humans tend to think the world is as we perceive it. But for everything that we can see, smell, taste, hear or touch, there’s so much more that we’re oblivious to.</p>



<p>In <em>An Immense World</em>, science journalist Ed Yong introduces that hidden world and the concept of <em>Umwelt</em>, a German word that refers to the parts of the environment an animal senses and experiences. Every creature has its own <em>Umwelt</em>. In a room filled with different types of organisms, or even multiple people, each individual would experience that shared atmo­sphere in wholly different ways.</p>



<p>Yong eases readers into the truly immense world of senses by starting with ones that we are intimately familiar with. In some cases, he tests the limits of his own abilities. Dog noses, for instance, are better than human noses at sniffing out a scent long after the source is gone, as Yong demonstrates. While crawling around on his hands and knees with his eyes closed, he was able to track a chocolate-scented string that a researcher had put on the ground. But he lost the scent when the string was removed. That wouldn’t happen to a dog. It would pick up the trace, string or no string.</p>





<p>In exploring the vast sensory world, it helps to have a good imagination, as even familiar senses can seem quite strange. Scallops, for instance, have eyes and somehow “see” despite having a crude brain that can’t process the images. Crickets have hairs that are so responsive to an approaching spider that trying to make the hairs more sensitive might break the rules of physics. A blind Ecuadorian catfish senses raging water with durable teeth that cover its skin. The animal uses the dentures to find calmer waters.</p>



<p>Going through these imagination warm-up exercises makes it somewhat easier to ponder what it might be like to be an echolocating bat, a bird that detects magnetic fields or a fish that communicates using electricity. Yong’s vivid descriptions also help readers fathom these senses: “A river full of electric fish must be like a cocktail party where no one <em>ever </em>shuts up, even when their mouths are full.” In a forest, foliage may seem largely silent, but some insects “talk” through plant stems using vibration. With headphones hooked up to plants so that scientists can listen in, “chirping cicadas sound like cows and katydids sound like revving chainsaws.”</p>



<p>For all the book’s wonder, the last chapter brings readers crashing back to today’s reality. Humans are polluting animals’ <em>Umwelten</em>; we’re forcing animals to exist in environments con­taminated with human-made stimuli. And the consequences can be deadly, Yong warns. Adding artificial light in the dark­ness of night is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">killing birds and insects</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/peace-and-quiet-becoming-more-elusive-us-wild-areas">Making environments louder</a> is masking the sounds of preda­tors and forcing prey to spend more time keeping an eye out than eating (<em>SN: 5/4/17</em>). “We are closer than ever to understanding what it is like to be another animal,” Yong writes, “but we have made it harder than ever for other animals to be.” </p>



<p>Since each of us has our own <em>Umwelt</em>, fully understand­ing the foreign worlds of animals is close to impossible, Yong writes. How do we know, for instance, which animals feel pain? Researchers can dissect the signals or stimuli an ani­mal might receive. But what that creature experiences often remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trauma-ptsd-growth-myth-cultural-narrative-mental-health">The idea that many people grow following trauma may be a myth</a></h4>

              
                <p>“What does not kill me, makes me stronger,” 19th century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously wrote. Variations of that aphorism abound in literary, spiritual and, more recently, psychological texts.</p>



<p>That psychological research suggests that at least half of survivors not only recover from traumatic experiences but also go on to develop more appreciation for life, stronger relationships and emotional strength — a phenomenon researchers call “posttraumatic growth.”</p>



<p>The idea that bad events can often lead to good outcomes is appealing, especially in this present and difficult moment. More than 6.3 million people worldwide have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">died from COVID-19</a>, and deaths continue to mount (<em>SN: 5/18/22</em>). Russia’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-identity-nationalism-independence-putin-russia">invasion of Ukraine</a> has surpassed a hundred days (<em>SN 4/12/22</em>). And a recent string of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-violence-mass-shootings-increase-united-states-data-uvalde-buffalo">mass shootings</a> — including at a July 4 parade in Highland Park, Ill., an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y. — has left U.S. communities reeling (<em>SN: 5/26/22</em>).</p>





<p>But in a <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Program_Book_APS_2022-Online.pdf">series of talks</a> presented in May in Chicago at the Association for Psychological Science conference, some researchers called findings of posttraumatic growth “largely illusory.” Growth studies suffer from serious methodological flaws, these researchers say. That includes a reliance on surveys that require people to assess their personal growth over time, a task that most people struggle with.</p>



<p>Better research tools may not remedy the problem. That’s because these studies are fundamentally flawed, the researchers say. They argue that the impetus to study trauma in terms of growth stems from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/december-7-2019">Western mind-set</a> that tends to value positive emotions and devalue or even avoid negative emotions (<em>SN: 12/7/19</em>). That can pressure survivors to deny or suppress their negative feelings, which could have harmful consequences.</p>



<p>That yearning for positive outcomes can create “toxic cultural narratives,” says personality psychologist Eranda Jayawickreme of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. Referring to parents who lost a child in the Uvalde mass shooting, he says: “There is something grotesque about this expectation that people could come back from something like this.”</p>



<h4>Focusing on the good</h4>



<p>A half-century ago, psychologists largely treated a person’s difficulty in rebounding from traumatic events as a personal failing. But research on returning Vietnam War veterans and other trauma survivors began shifting that way of thinking. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association created a category for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-survivors-ptsd-mental-health">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, or PTSD, in its manual of mental disorders. Those struggling with the disorder might experience flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety.</p>



<p>“Thirty years ago, everyone was focused on the worst outcomes,” says trauma and resilience expert George Bonanno of Columbia University.</p>



<p>But only about one-fifth of people who experience trauma develop PTSD, psychologists realized. In the mid-1990s, psychologists Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun, both then at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, wrote in the 1996 <em>Journal of Traumatic Stress </em>that a focus on suffering obscured the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.2490090305">good that can emerge from trauma</a><em>.</em></p>



<p>The pair developed a now widely used “growth inventory” to assess positive outcomes that people reported after experiencing a traumatic event. In the 21-item survey, respondents rate statements such as “I have more compassion for others” and “I established a new path for my life.” Respondents can choose from a score of 0 for “I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis” to 5 for “I experienced this change to a very great degree as a result of my crisis.”&nbsp; The items reflect five broad categories: relating to others, personal strength, new possibilities, appreciation of life and spiritual change. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Posttraumatic growth is you go down to the depths and then at some later point, rise above that baseline into some other realm,” says Tedeschi, now the chair of Boulder Crest Institute for Posttraumatic Growth, an organization in Bluemont, Va., that uses research on posttraumatic growth to help combat veterans, first responders and their families.</p>



<h4>Cracks in the theory</h4>



<p>But some researchers soon began to question people’s ability to accurately respond to the growth survey.</p>



<p>In a now-seminal 2009 study in <em>Psychological Science, </em>researchers recruited about 1,500 undergraduate students and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02381.x">tracked them for eight weeks</a>. Once at the start of the study and once at the end, students responded to surveys for each of the five growth categories covered by the growth inventory, along with a modified version of the inventory.</p>



<p>Unlike Tedeschi and Calhoun’s inventory, which asks respondents to compare their present state of mind to the past, the five surveys and modified inventory asked respondents to reflect on the present. For instance, in the relationship quality category, respondents rated the statement: “I enjoy personal and mutual conversations with family members or friends.”</p>



<p>During that eight-week period, 122 students reported experiencing a traumatic event that caused high levels of distress. Those students also completed the standard growth inventory at the end of the eight weeks. The researchers found no correlation between high perceived growth scores on the standard inventory and actual growth scores on the modified inventory and five surveys related to well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That mismatch occurs because people are terrible at remembering how they felt in the past, says study coauthor Crystal Park, a clinical health psychologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. “I want to throw out the concept of people being able to accurately report that they have grown.”</p>



<p>Tedeschi counters that trauma cleaves one’s life into a before and after, making it more feasible for many people to distinguish changes over time. What’s more, growth takes time, he says. “You can’t expect people to change their spiritual beliefs in eight weeks.”</p>



<p>But how much time? And if enough time passes, how does one know that the growth arises from the trauma and not some other major life experience, like moving across the country or having children? Research shows that people are not great at introspection, Jayawickreme says. “We tend to come up with all types of stories for change, but those stories are just stories. They don’t really reflect what actually caused that change.”</p>



<h4>‘Pulling for growth’</h4>



<p>Other problems come with the design of the original inventory, Jayawickreme and others argue. For example, the questions account for positive changes only, and the worst or lowest outcome a respondent can give is that they experienced no change as a result of their crisis. That framing puts pressure on survivors to report growth when they may feel worse, Jayawickreme says. “The items are pulling for growth.”</p>



<p>Tedeschi and colleagues have recently developed <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304116#ec0005">a new growth survey</a> that also accounts for negative changes following trauma. But it’s not yet as widely used in research on posttraumatic growth as the original.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in unpublished work, trauma researcher Adriel Boals of the University of North Texas in Denton sought to overcome what he sees as the original survey’s growth bias in a different way. He asked people whether they changed <em>because </em>of a traumatic event, a measure of growth, or <em>despite</em> the event.</p>



<p>“Half the people are picking, ‘I changed despite this event,’” Boals says. That suggests that people who may report growth on the original inventory do not actually attribute that growth to the trauma but to other life experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, say Jayawickreme and others, unlike most psychological surveys, which require respondents to complete a single cognitive task along the lines of “how are you doing now” or “reflect on the present,” the original growth inventory requires four cognitive tasks. Respondents must consider how they are doing at the moment and how they were doing prior to the trauma. They then must compute that difference in well-being, as well as determine if the trauma, or some other life event such as aging or having a child, caused the change.</p>



<p>But people <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615806.2022.2047949?journalCode=gasc20">don’t actually go through those steps</a>. That finding was reported in March in <em>Anxiety, Stress and Coping</em> and at the May conference by Boals, Park and Elizabeth Griffith, a psychologist also at the University of North Texas.</p>



<p>When the team compared response times among college students taking the standard growth inventory with students taking a simplified version involving a single cognitive task, the researchers found that the students completing the standard inventory took just 8 percent longer than the other students. That equates to just a half-second longer response time per item, Boals says. “If you can go through steps 2, 3 and 4 … in half a second, you’re drinking stronger coffee than I am.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Avoiding negative emotions</h4>



<p>Beyond the methodological particulars, some researchers studying trauma across cultures question some Western psychologists’ focus on personal growth and, to a lesser degree, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/kids-will-be-all-right">resilience</a> — a phenomenon marked by stability during hard times, rather than a steep increase in well-being after an initial decline as observed in posttraumatic growth (<em>SN: 10/19/14</em>).</p>



<p>“In Euro-American societies, ‘resilience’ and ‘posttraumatic growth’ are commonly used metaphorical terms for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1363461519844355?journalCode=tpse">positive responses to extreme adversity</a>,” write University of Zurich psychologists Iara Meili and Andreas Maercker in 2019 in <em>Transcultural Psychiatry. </em>They attribute the popularity of these Western “metaphors” to individualistic societies’ emphasis on self-determination and agency, even in the face of illness or death. These concepts exist elsewhere, Maercker says. But they rarely take on such outsize significance — what he calls “almost a religious approach.”</p>



<p>A societal expectation of growth can put tremendous pressure on survivors to hide their suffering, Jayawickreme says.</p>



<p>Take, for instance, a study where researchers compared outcomes among about 380 Norwegian soldiers who deployed to Iraq in 2004. Soldiers who reported the most personal growth five months after returning home <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702614549800">also reported the most posttraumatic stress symptoms 10 months later</a>, researchers noted in 2015 in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>.</p>



<p>“Self-reports of posttraumatic growth should be highly correlated with doing well on other measurements, like less depression, more satisfaction with life, those types of things,” says Boals, who was not involved with this research. “But if anything, [growth] is positively correlated with PTSD symptoms.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, the most compassionate response to suffering is to validate survivors’ feelings, Jayawickreme says. “How people respond to adversity is nuanced. People can change in positive ways. People can change in negative ways. People cannot change at all. And that’s fine.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-anemone-venomous-stinger-launch-prey">Here’s how sea anemones launch their venomous stingers</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new look at the starlet sea anemone’s stinger gets right to the point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Live-animal images and 3-D computer reconstructions have revealed the complex architecture of the tiny creature’s needlelike weapons.&nbsp;Like a harpoon festooned with venomous barbs, the stinger <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31090-0">rapidly transforms as it fires</a>, biologists Matt Gibson, Ahmet Karabulut and colleagues report June 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists can now see in exquisite detail “what this apparatus looks like before, during and&nbsp;after firing,” says Gibson, of the&nbsp;Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Mo.</p>





<p>In the wild, the starlet sea anemone (<em>Nematostella vectensis</em>) can live in salty lagoons or shallow estuaries, where freshwater rivers meet the sea. Its tubular body burrows into the mud, and a crown of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-sea-anemone-grows-its-tentacles">Medusa-like tentacles</a> reaches up into the water, waiting for dinner to drift by (<em>SN: 5/7/13</em>). Each tentacle is packing heat: hundreds of stingers that can mean death for brine shrimp or free-floating plankton.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These stingers are among the fastest micromachines in nature. An anemone can jab a predator or nab some lunch in about a hundredth of a second, says Karabulut, also of the Stowers Institute. Scientists had an idea of how such stingers worked, but until now, had never gotten so up close and personal.</p>



<p>The researchers used fluorescent dye to see the stingers in action and scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct their three-dimensional structure. The work reveals the precise, step-by-step mechanics of the speedy shooters.</p>

<p>Packed inside a stinger’s capsule, a venomous thread coils around a central shaft.

Finally, the thread races up through the shaft, sending its barbs into an animal’s soft tissue.</p>



<p>Each stinger is good for just one shot. “It’s a one-hit wonder,” Karabulut says. “Once <em>Nematostella</em> uses it, it’s gone.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">Aliens could send quantum messages to Earth, calculations suggest</a></h4>

              
                <p>An intelligent alien civilization could beam quantum messages to Earth.</p>



<p>Particles of light, or photons, could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.123033">be transmitted over vast, interstellar distances</a> without losing their quantum nature, researchers report June 28 in <em>Physical Review D</em>. That means scientists searching for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-say-time-start-taking-search-aliens-seriously">extraterrestrial signals</a> could also look for quantum messages (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists are currently developing Earth-based <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-satellite-shatters-entanglement-record">quantum communication</a>, a technology that uses quantum particles to send information and has the potential to be more secure than standard, or classical, communication (<em>SN: 6/15/17</em>). Intelligent extraterrestrials, if they’re out there, may have also adopted quantum communication, says theoretical physicist Arjun Berera.</p>





<p>A major obstacle to quantum communication is decoherence, in which a quantum particle loses its quantumness as it interacts with its surroundings. “Quantum states you generally think of as very delicate, and if there’s any kind of external interaction, you kind of destroy that state,” Berera says.</p>



<p>Since the average density of matter in space is much less than on Earth, particles could be expected to travel farther before succumbing to decoherence. So Berera and theoretical physicist Jaime Calderón Figueroa, both of the University of Edinburgh, calculated how far light — in particular, X-rays — could travel unscathed through interstellar space.</p>



<p>X-ray photons could more than traverse the Milky Way, potentially traveling hundreds of thousands of light-years or even more, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Based on the findings, Berera and Calderón Figueroa considered strategies to search for E.T.’s quantum dispatches. One potential type of communication to search for is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-quantum-satellite-adds-two-new-tricks-repertoire">quantum teleportation</a>, in which the properties of a distant particle can be transferred to another (<em>SN: 7/7/17</em>). Since the technology requires both quantum and classical signals, scientists could look for such simultaneous signals to identify any alien quantum missives.</p>
