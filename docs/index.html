              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-dna-ancient-trade-network-arctic-siberia-europe-near-east">Dog DNA reveals ancient trade network connecting the Arctic to the outside world</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient Arctic communities traded with the outside world as early as 7,000 years ago, DNA from the remains of Siberian dogs suggests.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysis of the DNA shows that Arctic pups thousands of years ago were interbreeding with other dogs from Europe and the Near East, even while they and their owners were living in one of the most remote places on Earth. Along with previous archeological finds, these results suggest that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/39/e2100338118">Siberians long ago were connected to a vast trade network</a> that may have extended as far as the Mediterranean and the Caspian Sea, researchers report in the Sept. 28 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Dogs have been valuable commodities in the Arctic for the last 9,500 years and have been used for sledding, hunting, herding reindeer, clothing and food. Because the region is remote, scientists thought local dogs — and their owners — had been completely isolated from the rest of the world for much of that time, an idea supported by the fact that ancient Siberians didn’t exchange much DNA with people outside of the region, says Tatiana Feuerborn, an archeologist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>But previous archeological evidence — including the discovery of glass beads and other foreign goods entombed alongside 2,000-year-old dogs near the Yamal Peninsula in Russia — suggested that these communities were trading with other cultures beyond the Arctic.</p>

<p>After reading about the archeological evidence in the news, Feuerborn wanted to see if she could use remains from the 2,000-year-old dogs and others from around Siberia to reveal whether an ancient trade network existed.</p>



<p>Dogs rarely wander far from their humans, meaning researchers can “use dogs to understand human movement, like migrations and even trade interactions,” says Kelsey Witt, a geneticist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. For instance, archeologists have used ancient dog DNA <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dog-fossil-domestication-human-path-americas-migration">to push back the arrival date of people</a> in the Americas (<em>SN: 3/1/21</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, Feuerborn and colleagues analyzed DNA from the remains of 49 Siberian dogs, ranging from 11,000-year-old bone fragments to fur hoods used by Arctic explorers at the turn of the 20th century. The team found that Siberian dogs — unlike their owners — began mixing with other dog populations from the Eurasian steppes, the Near East and even Europe as far back as 7,000 years ago.</p>



<p>The result suggests that Siberians did bring in dogs from the outside world, Feuerborn says. This trade network could have helped transmit new ideas and technologies, such as metalworking, to the Arctic, and may have facilitated Siberian society’s transition from foraging to reindeer herding in the last 2,000 years. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dogs are a piece of our past,” Feuerborn says. “By looking at them, we can learn something about ourselves.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neanderthals-hunting-catching-birds">How catching birds bare-handed may hint at Neandertals’ hunting tactics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Juan Negro crouched in the shadows just outside a cave, wearing his headlamp. For a brief moment, he wasn’t an ornithologist at the Spanish National Research Council’s Doñana Biological Station in Seville. He was a Neandertal, intent on catching dinner. As he waited in the cold, dark hours of the night, crowlike birds called choughs entered the cave.</p>



<p>The “Neandertal” then stealthily snuck in and began the hunt.</p>



<p>This idea to role-play started with butchered bird bones. Piles of ancient tool- and tooth-nicked choughs bones have been found in the same caves that Neandertals frequented, evidence suggesting that the ancient hominids chowed down on the birds. But catching choughs is tricky. During the day, they fly far to feed on invertebrates, seeds and fruits. At night though, their behavior practically turns them into sitting ducks. The birds roost in groups and often return to the same spot, even if they’ve been disturbed or preyed on there before.</p>







<p>So the question was, how might Neandertals have managed to catch these avian prey?</p>



<p>To find out, Negro and his colleagues decided to act like, well, Neandertals. Wielding bare hands along with butterfly nets and lamps — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-made-oldest-known-string">proxy for nets</a> (<em>SN: 04/09/20</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-used-regularly-cooking-300000-years">fire</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/14</em>)&nbsp; that Neandertals may have had at hand— teams of two to 10 researchers silently snuck into caves and other spots across Spain, where the birds roost to see how many choughs they could catch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="503" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1.jpg" alt="a person inside a building attempting to catch a bird" class="wp-image-3104497" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-518x383.jpg 518w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-608x450.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-251x186.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104497">Researchers in Spain attempt to capture choughs with their bare hands in roosting sites such as this building. The effort was part of a study to see if Neandertals could have successfully hunted the birds.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104497">J.M. García</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Using flashes of light from flashlights to resemble fire, the “Neandertals” dazzled and confused the choughs. The birds typically fled into dead-end areas of the caves, where they could be easily caught, often bare-handed. Hunting expeditions at 70 sites <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.733062/full">snared more than 5,500 birds in all</a>, the researchers report September 9 in <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em>. The birds were then released unharmed. It was “the most exciting piece of research” Negro says he’s ever done.</p>



<p>The results demonstrate that through teamwork, choughs can be captured without fancy tools at night and offer a likely way that Neandertals could have captured choughs. But actual Neandertal bird-catching behavior remains unknown. If this is in fact how Neandertals hunted, it adds to claims that their behavior and ability to think strategically is more sophisticated than they are often given credit for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="439" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2.jpg" alt="several black birds inside a sack" class="wp-image-3104498" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2-593x383.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2-288x186.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104498">Red-billed choughs, captured as part of an experiment to see if Neandertals could have caught the birds, sit in a sack. The birds were released unharmed.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104498">Guillermo Blanco</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The regular catchment of choughs by Neandertals implies a deep knowledge of the ecology of this species, a previous planning for its obtaining, including procurement techniques, and the ability to plan and anticipate dietary needs for the future,” says Ruth Blasco. A taphonomist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, Blasco is an expert in Neandertal diet.</p>



<p>Such role playing, she notes, is “commonly used by scholars as valid analogies to infer processes that happened in the past.” For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-modern-javelin-throwers-hurled-neandertal-spears-hay-bales">reenactments with replicas of wooden spears</a> have suggested that Neandertals could have hurled the weapons to hunt prey at a distance (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers re-creating chough hunts used butterfly nets to catch birds fleeing sites with narrow entrances, as well as bigger nets partially covering larger openings. But “the easiest thing was to grab the birds by hand,” Negro says.</p>



<p>“You have to be intelligent to capture these animals, to process them, to roast and eat them,” he notes. Previous studies have shown that Neandertals may have been similarly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">adept at foraging for seafood</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). “We tend to think that [Neandertals] were brutes with no intelligence,” Negro says, “but in fact, the evidence is accumulating that they were very close to <em>Homo sapiens</em>.”</p>

<p>A chemical analysis of the volcanic rocks confirms that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7957">the moon remained volcanically active</a> far longer that its size would suggest possible, researchers report online October 7 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Chang’e-5 is the first mission <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-change-5-mission-moon-rocks-lunar-soil-sample">to retrieve lunar rocks and return them to Earth</a> in over 40 years (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). An international group of researchers found that the rocks formed 2 billion years ago, around when multicellular life first evolved on Earth. That makes them the youngest moon rocks ever collected, says study coauthor Carolyn Crow, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The moon formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Lunar rocks from the Apollo and Soviet missions of the late 1960s and 70s revealed that volcanism on the moon was commonplace for the first billion or so years of its existence, with flows lasting for millions, if not hundreds of millions, of years.</p>

<p>Given its size, scientist thought that the moon started cooling off around 3 billion years ago, eventually becoming the quiet, inactive neighbor it is today. Yet a dearth of craters in some regions left scientists scratching their heads. Parts of celestial bodies devoid of volcanism accumulate more and more craters over time, in part because there aren’t lava flows depositing new material that hardens into smooth stretches. The moon’s smoother spots seemed to suggest that volcanism had persisted past the moon’s early history. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Young volcanism on a small body like the moon is challenging to explain, because usually small bodies cool fast,” says Juliane Gross, a planetary scientist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., not involved in the study.</p>





<p>Scientist had suggested that radioactive elements might offer an explanation for later volcanism. Radioactive decay generates a lot of heat, which is why nuclear reactors are kept in water. Enough radioactive materials in the moon’s mantle, the layer just below the visible crust, would have provided a heat source that could explain younger lava flows.</p>



<p>To test this theory, the Chang’e-5 lander gathered chunks of basalt — a type of rock that forms from volcanic activity — from a previously unexplored part of the moon thought to be younger than 3 billion years old. The team determined that the rocks formed from lava flows 2 billion years ago, but chemical analysis did not yield the concentration of radioactive elements one would expect if radioactive decay were to explain the volcanism.</p>

<p>This finding is compelling scientists to consider what other forces could have maintained volcanic activity on the moon.</p>



<p>One theory, says study coauthor Alexander Nemchin, a planetary scientist at the Beijing SHRIMP Center and Curtin University in Bentley, Australia, is that gravitational forces from the Earth could have liquefied the lunar interior, keeping lunar magma flowing for another billion or so years past when it should have stopped.</p>



<p>“The moon was a lot closer 2 billion years ago,” Nemchin explains. As the moon slowly inched away from the Earth — a slow escape still at work today — these forces would have become less and less powerful until volcanism eventually petered out.</p>





<p>Impacts from asteroids and comets also could have kept the moon’s volcanic juices flowing, but “at this point, any guess is a good guess,” says Jessica Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“This is a good example of why we need to get to know our closest neighbor,” Barnes says. “A lot people think we already know what’s going on with the moon, but it’s actually quite mysterious.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/g_ChPbTdgoY/">Following through on our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Author: Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">my predecessor outlined</a> five key areas in which PLOS would redouble its efforts to make our journals a home for diverse voices. So how have we done?</p>



<p>Establishing our baseline was up first: we&rsquo;ve started to manually collate demographic data, while building new tech to streamline the process and ensure personal privacy is protected. Data about PLOS&rsquo; in-house leadership team are already feeding into hiring practices aimed at increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees. And a survey of our 10,000-strong Editorial Board members will be deployed soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An updated workflow for recruitment of new Editorial Board members ensures we&rsquo;re casting a wider net. (Want to be considered? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/join-editorial-board">Sign-up here</a>!) Our new editorial partners are helping us publish more research on inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations. Recent Collections on <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/health-gender-diversity/">Health &amp; Health Care in Gender Diverse Communities</a>, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/health-inequities/">Health Inequities and Disparities Research</a>, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/human-trafficking/">Trafficking, Exploitation and Health</a> and <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/diagnostic-tests-low-resource/">Diagnostic Tests in Low-Resource Settings</a> showcase these efforts.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/announcing-the-plos-scientific-advisory-council/">PLOS Scientific Advisory Council</a> is bringing the expertise of active researchers at different career stages and geographic areas to bear on organisational strategy. A key strategic pillar has been <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">the launch of new journals</a>: <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, <em>PLOS Water</em>, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>. Unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges from diverse, local perspectives, the new journals help us expand our international footprint. In this way, we ensure that we&rsquo;re co-creating&mdash;not dictating&mdash;paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities. Formal partnerships, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/partnering-with-tcc-africa/">such as that with TCC Africa</a>, are another way in which local needs can more-fully inform our ways of working.</p>



<p>Moving upstream in the research cycle, we&rsquo;re hoping to help inculcate change in the way research is conducted, as well as how it&rsquo;s communicated. A <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">new policy on inclusivity in global research</a> has just been rolled out. &lsquo;Parachute&rsquo; or &lsquo;helicopter research&rsquo; occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their studies and leave, often with little or poor understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants. Prompting PLOS authors to consider these issues is a small first step towards addressing neo-colonialism in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That publishing open access allows the benefits of research to be realised by a broader range of stakeholders is undeniable. But the predominant business model&mdash;an article-processing charge (APC) paid by an individual researcher&mdash;is a key stumbling block to participation. So PLOS has been experimenting with new payment paradigms. Our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">new Global Equity</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> models, for example, expand equitable partnership opportunities for researchers&rsquo; institutions to eliminate author-facing charges. Global Equity provides affordable pricing tiers reflective of regional economies in every area of the world while Community Action Publishing more fairly distributes the cost of selective publishing.</p>



<p>As well as working on our own policies, processes and people, we&rsquo;ll continue to use our platforms to amplify the voices of others who are working to dismantle structural inequities. If you&rsquo;re interested in hearing more, check out the <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/">inclusion-themed discussions</a> that were part of our recent <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/">Scientists for Open Science</a> event. Or blog posts describing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/06/the-ocean-womxn-program-supporting-a-new-generation-of-black-oceanographers/">support for a new generation of black oceanographers </a>and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/the-human-evolution-research-institute-challenging-traditional-narratives-and-fostering-a-new-generation-of-black-women-in-the-palaeosciences/">women in the palaeosciences</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve made a great start on our commitments&mdash;but there&rsquo;s much more to do. A newly-created Steering Committee will oversee all PLOS&rsquo; DEI-related initiatives, and we&rsquo;ll continue to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/2021-dei-goals-update/">report our progress to you</a>. As someone who&rsquo;s only recently joined PLOS, it&rsquo;s so refreshing to see DEI being truly centered, initiatives being properly resourced, and organisation-wide priority being given to this important work.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Each year since 2015, <em>Science New</em>s has featured the work of outstanding early- and mid-career scientists in our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/sn-10-scientists-to-watch">SN 10: Scientists to Watch list</a>. They’re nominated by Nobel laureates and members of the National Academy of Sciences, and are recognized because of their curiosity, passion, determination and, of course, their discoveries.</p>



<p>But we decided that 2021 begs for something different. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">coronavirus pandemic</a> continues to rage worldwide, with its burdens falling hardest on those least able to bear them — inequities already on our minds due to Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and other social movements. At the same time, we’re learning that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the window to reverse some of climate change’s most devastating effects is closing fast</a>. With all the upheaval, we wondered: How do these extraordinary times change a scientist’s work?</p>



<p>Here, we catch up with 10 noteworthy Scientists to Watch alumni. Emily Fischer, who studies wildfire smoke, has faced the threat of fires firsthand, cognitive neuroscientist Jessica Cantlon is fighting sexual harassment in the sciences and economist Parag Pathak is taking his efforts to make institutions more equitable from schools to hospitals. Other scientists reveal how their work has gained new urgency and meaning for them. The interviews that follow have been edited for length and clarity. </p>

<h4>Jessica Cantlon</h4>



<p><strong>Cognitive neuroscientist<br>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>



<p>Jessica Cantlon, featured in 2016, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jessica-cantlon-cognitive-neuroscientist-sn-10-scientists-watch">studies the evolution and development of complex mathematical thinking</a>, including the traits that set humans apart from other primates. In 2017, she was recognized as a <em>Time</em> Person of the Year, as <a href="https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/">a “silence breaker”</a> speaking out against sexual harassment during the height of the #MeToo movement.</p>



<h5>What has been the most notable progress in your research since 2016?</h5>



<p>We’ve expanded our repertoire to compare people across different cultures, who have different educational practices. We’ve been going to Bolivia to work with this group of people called the Tsimane, who live in rural parts of the Amazon forest. They don’t have the rigid, formal schooling where kids go through these particular curricula to achieve mathematical cognition. Instead, education there is more organic and more deeply connected to their way of life. That allows us to try to understand what effect does a particular type of education have on numerical thinking.</p>



<p>There was one study that we did, comparing species — nonhuman primates and humans — to understand the evolution of these concepts. Across all species and stages of development and cultural groups, there’s this bias that when you’re looking at a set of objects, and you’re trying to quantify it, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13968">you think about that set numerically</a>. And you don’t have to; you can think about that set of objects spatially, as an amount of stuff, you can think about how much surface area is there, or the perimeter around it. But primates, including humans, [tend to] think about that set as a set of discrete objects, and count them up.</p>



<h5>What is something that excites you right now in your work?</h5>



<p>We’ve looked at the similarities and differences between boys and girls as their brains develop. We’ve done some of the first, early studies comparing children’s brains that can truly allow us to collect evidence on the trajectory of similarity between boys and girls…. We’ve shown that very early in development, between around 3 and 8 years of age, there’s evidence during mathematical processing that most of the brain — over 95 percent — shows functional similarity in that processing between boys and girls.</p>



<p>But as we know, much later on in development, we see a severe underrepresentation of girls in mathematics-related fields. What’s happening? There’s evidence in the field … that what happens in late childhood and adolescence is that children’s interests are shaped culturally.</p>



<h5>What are some of the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2016?</h5>



<p>In 2016, [some of my colleagues at the University of Rochester and I] filed a sexual harassment complaint against a faculty member in our department who was sexually harassing women — undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. It became this situation that hijacked my career for a number of years.… We went public with our complaint, partly to protect ourselves, but also partly to let people know at other universities that this kind of thing is happening to students, and it’s affecting women’s career paths in ways that are discriminatory and unequal.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was really important. Our complaint went public in September of 2017. In October 2017, the Harvey Weinstein story came out in the <em>New York Times</em>, and that kicked off a series of reactions that ultimately culminated in millions of people saying #MeToo, which I think was really powerful and important, and was something that we got to be a part of.</p>



<p>I’ve had dozens of women reach out to me for advice, about how to file a complaint at their university, how to take legal action, if that’s what they’re thinking, what the risks and benefits are. And so, part of my career now — and I’m excited by it, and I think it’s really important work — is to be an advocate for women who are experiencing discrimination and harassment at universities.</p>



<p>One response that we thought was really great was that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24994/chapter/1">did a full study on sexual harassment in the sciences</a>…. It has a lot of ideas about what might effect larger-scale change. </p>

<h4>Parag Pathak</h4>



<p><strong>Economist</strong><br><strong>MIT</strong></p>



<p>Parag Pathak, featured in 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parag-pathak-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">strives to make public education more equitable</a>. He has used data and algorithms to overhaul school choice systems in Boston, New York and other U.S. cities. Now he’s applying his research to the question of how to equitably distribute vaccines and other medical resources.</p>



<h5>What’s the most notable progress in your work since 2019?</h5>



<p>Since we last talked, I released a paper on <a href="https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/research/the-long-term-effects-of-universal-preschool-in-boston/">the effects of universal preschool</a>. A lot of people are interested right now because [universal preschool, which is open to everyone with no income rule,] is part of the White House’s agenda. Because of the work we had done with Boston with their school choice algorithm over the years, we had some files on school admissions going back to the late 1990s. Boston was a leader nationwide in expanding slots for children in preschool. But, like many cities, there weren’t enough slots for demand, so they had to ration. And that’s where the lotteries come in.</p>



<p>Fast forward to now. We linked these applicant cohorts to standardized test scores and educational outcomes all the way into college. And what we found was pretty exciting: Those who won the [preschool] lottery are more likely to graduate high school, they score higher on SATs and they’re more likely to enroll in college. Boston has continued to refine and try to improve [the lottery system]. It’s a model for other cities that are expanding public preschool.</p>



<h5>Are you pursuing any new questions or projects?</h5>



<p>COVID-19 was this huge shock. We all were looking around for how we could be useful, using our respective toolboxes. Tayfun Sönmez, M.&nbsp;Utku Ünver and M. Bumin Yenmez, all of Boston College — the four of us — started to study how scarce medical resources are rationed. And it turns out, there are some parallels with the way school seats are rationed.</p>



<p>One of the ideas that we’ve explored is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00374">the idea of a reserve system</a>. In cases where people can’t agree on what’s fair, who should get a vaccine first? It’s very similar to who should get into a school. And the way that [schools] have handled that is they set up more elaborate versions of priority systems. With a vaccine reserve system, you basically have a [supply] that’s reserved for cardiac communities, and one that’s reserved for frontline medical personnel, so on and so forth…. States like California and Massachusetts have used some of our ideas [for their reserve systems].</p>



<p>My wife [Ruma Rajbhandari] is a medical doctor, and my sister [Sapana Adhikari] is an emergency room physician. A big part of my interest in medical rationing guidelines was their having to go to the hospital in March 2020 not knowing what the risks were and not having personal protective equipment. That was something that got me really keen on this debate about frontline health care workers, do they get first priority or not?</p>



<h5>How has the pandemic shifted how you view your work in the area of education?</h5>



<p>I have a kindergartner who was virtual this past year. And he did an amazing job with it. I think what the pandemic has done is rip the Band-Aid off on these lingering problems in society — inequitable access to health care, inequitable access to education, inefficiencies in both of the systems — and has made them much more pronounced. That’s been the theme of our research throughout. We hope more people take these issues on, because the way COVID-19 played out was really a scarring event in terms of haves and the have-nots. </p>

<h4>Jenny Tung</h4>



<p><strong>Evolutionary anthropologist</strong><br><strong>Duke University</strong></p>



<p>Jenny Tung, featured in 2018, studies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jenny-tung-sn-10-scientists-watch">how social environments </a>— including social status, relationships and isolation — influence primates’ genes and health. Her study subjects have included captive rhesus macaques and wild baboons.</p>



<h5>What has been the most notable progress in your work since 2018?</h5>



<p>We have built layers of complexity onto [our] initial story. A few years ago we were showing that it’s possible for social interactions to have profound effects on the function of our genome. And now we’re trying to derive a much better understanding of how and why and when, and what are the exceptions.</p>



<p>The other thing I’m really excited about is our ability to move away from this very powerful but very artificial system using captive primates and to ask about what’s going on in the field with wild monkeys. I’ve studied wild baboons in Kenya for many, many years. We know a lot about the social environments, the social experiences. And now with the ability to collect some simple blood samples, we’re also seeing strong signatures of things like social status and social integration, social bonds, social connectedness in the function of these animals’ genomes. That’s pretty exciting because lab studies are powerful and wonderful, but there’s always this question of, “Well, is this real in the real world?”</p>



<h5>You were named a <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2019/jenny-tung">MacArthur Fellow in 2019</a>. What have you been pursuing since?</h5>



<p>It was a real honor. It has encouraged us to continue down some of these paths … and to also do some more comparative work and think about species beyond the ones that I have traditionally studied. So in the past few years, I’ve picked up work in other social mammals — wild meerkats and these very social rodents called mole rats — that have their own advantages in giving us insight into how our social world has shaped both how we came to be, our evolutionary past, and how we do day to day in our present.</p>



<p>I’ve been doing more work on something that’s an old love of mine: trying to understand the evolutionary consequences of intermixing between different primates. The population of baboons that I study in Kenya actually sits right at the edge of where the ranges of two different species of baboons meet. And so this population is intermixed between one species, the Anubis baboon, and this other species, the yellow baboon.… We think those patterns of intermixture influence some things about what [the animals] look like, how they behave and so on.… </p>



<p>We know that [humans] have also intermixed a lot with some groups that don’t even exist today, like Neandertals and Denisovans. That process of admixture that we observe right now in living primates [is] potentially relevant to understanding our species’s history.</p>



<h5>What are some of the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2018?</h5>



<p>In many ways, I felt very fortunate during the pandemic; as an academic with tenure, I have a secure job. But we were also home with a 3-year-old for a long stretch. I spend usually at least a month a year in Kenya, and I have since 2006. But not in 2020. We had to figure out some way of keeping [the research] continuous without any ability to travel there. We have a permanent staff in Kenya — they are Kenyan — who are very important to us and have been working with our project in some cases for many decades, and they were having their own issues, and isolation, and risks in the face of a lot of uncertainty. </p>



<p>I spend a lot of time in my research life thinking about social interactions. And every species that I study … they live in groups. And humans, to a large extent, we live together. We didn’t evolve to be on our own for a long period of time. And so I spent a lot of time reading and thinking and working on, “Why when you don’t have the right sort of social connections, why does your risk of death just shoot up? What’s the consequence of chronic social stress?” One of the things that I really appreciate in a more visceral manner [now] is how important my social network is to me. I think that we’re all looking for ways to connect during the pandemic. And that’s when your personal experience and the things that you’re writing papers about and thinking about really collide. </p>

<h4>Isaac Kinde</h4>



<p><strong>Molecular biologist<br>Thrive Early Detection</strong></p>



<p>Isaac Kinde, featured in 2015, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/isaac-kinde-finding-cancer-altered-genes">developing tests to detect cancer early</a>, when treatment is more likely to be successful. In 2019, PapGene, a small biotech start-up where he was chief scientific officer, was acquired by Thrive, cofounded by Kinde. Just this year, it got the backing of the much larger cancer diagnostics firm Exact Sciences.</p>



<h5>Could you tell us about Thrive and what spurred this transition?</h5>



<p>Thrive basically acquired the predecessor company [PapGene]…. There was a lot more money, there’s a lot more expertise, but the core mission didn’t change, which is to develop cancer diagnostic products that we think will have an impact on the lives of people with cancer. We have essentially turbocharged and focused our efforts, leading with the most promising product, which is CancerSEEK.</p>



<p>The premise is we can reduce cancer morbidity and mortality through earlier detection. CancerSEEK is a blood test, and it is a multi-cancer test. That contrasts with the current paradigm, which is one test, one cancer.… Right now, all of our efforts are on making it commercially available.</p>



<h5>CancerSEEK, which is still in testing, picks up on DNA mutations and proteins associated with cancer. How many cancers can it detect at this time?</h5>



<p>There’s good evidence for detecting over 60 to 70&nbsp;percent of the cancers that cause the most deaths per year. That boils down to … colon, breast, lung…. But the [full] range is bigger than those three. There’s esophageal, gastric, kidney, pancreatic. There’s data that support maybe 12 to 13 different cancers.</p>



<h5>You published what you’ve referred to as a “landmark study” in <em>Science</em> last year. What did it find?</h5>



<p>We call it <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6499/eabb9601">a landmark study</a> because it was the first demonstration in a prospective setting of how a multicancer blood test could be used in real time to report results to patients with cancer.</p>



<p>We looked at 10,000 women in the Geisinger Health system. It’s primarily women who are in Pennsylvania…. In the study, 24 [women had cancers] detected with standard-of-care screening: colonoscopy, mammography or low-dose CT scan for lung. Then there were 26 cancers in which the CancerSEEK test detected the cancer first…. Sixty-five percent of the cancers we detected were at a stage prior to stage 4. So [the addition of CancerSEEK] doubled the number of cases that were [found before symptoms were reported] — in many, many cases early enough where some effective therapies could be implemented.</p>



<p>And then it was also safe…. There were very few false positives, and we could very quickly resolve the false positives with whole-body PET-CT imaging. At least two patients [who first had detections from CancerSEEK] had their cancers successfully removed and are thriving as of the last time we checked.</p>



<h5>Routine cancer screenings fell during the pandemic. Has this affected your work?</h5>



<p>It fans the flame, right? The reason why cancer screening went down is not because there was less cancer. It was [just] more difficult for whatever reason to get the appropriate standard-of-care test.… All this did was just strengthen the case that more tools, easier tools are needed for cancer screening. And I think maybe the other feeling is just wishing we could go even faster, but balancing a commercial launch with having all the right pieces in place that will set us up for success.</p>

She is now cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://www.qihanbio.com/">Qihan Biotech</a>, based in Hangzhou, China, which aims to develop animal organs that are safe for human transplant and to make cell therapies that can treat conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases more widely accessible.</p>



<h5>What is some of the most notable progress in your work since 2017?</h5>



<p>The concept of xenotransplantation is to use animal organs as an alternative resource for human transplantation, since there is a huge unmet need for organs. There are two fundamental issues to be addressed. One is [that] there are endogenous retroviruses in the pig genome — some virus sequences — and they can jump around within the pig genome. The viruses can also jump from the pig cell to the human cell. So there is a potential cross-species transmission, which is a huge safety and regulatory concern.… The second hurdle of using pig organs for human transplant, as you can imagine, is rejection, and it is tremendous.</p>



<p>Those are the two fundamental problems … and that’s where we think gene editing can come into play. By 2017, our team had knocked out 62 [retrovirus copies]. Since then, there are three notable milestones: First, we have created our Pig 2.0, with 15 modifications for immunology…. Last year in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00613-9"><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em></a>, we showed that those modifications are properly expressed in the pig cell, and the resulting pig is healthy, as well as fertile, and the genetic modification can be passed to the offspring. The second part is we combined the [retrovirus] knockout and the immune rejection–related modification in a single pig. We call it Pig 3.0. So that is a prototype close to clinical trial.</p>



<p>The third part is the most exciting part for us: We need to test the function. [In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331749/">a recent study published in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em></a>,] we put the pig kidney into a monkey. If it’s a normal pig kidney, it will be rejected in a few minutes. And right now the longest survival of our monkey is about one year.… The monkey experiment demonstrates the possibility of achieving long-term xenotransplantation.</p>



<h5>What was it like to move from the lab to leading a company?</h5>



<p>Being a leader in biotech is not all business. There are three components that are needed. The first part is to set the vision and strategy of the company. In such an innovative area, I think the scientific knowledge, the breadth of the exposure, I think that’s my strength.… The second part is to recruit, retain and train people. And the last part is some business judgment, like how to do fund-raising, how to organize a project, the accounting. I have to admit, I’m not the expert. But I think at my position, the key is to recruit the best people to do the job.… And I started to embrace that every leader has different strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<h5>How has the pandemic influenced your company’s international collaborations?</h5>



<p>I was hoping we could have more in-person meetings or travels, but right now, China still has the quarantine policy that makes it super inconvenient for international travel. Hopefully with the vaccine, the world will become what it was.</p>



<p>I feel the world is more divided compared with 10 years before. And I hope at least for medicine, we can see that our enemy is not a different country, but our enemy is cancer, is organ failure, is COVID, that we can keep and strengthen the collaboration across borders. </p>

<h4>Jeremy Freeman</h4>



<p><strong>Scientist and designer</strong><br><strong>CarbonPlan</strong></p>



<p>When he was featured in 2016, Jeremy Freeman was developing new tools and methods to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jeremy-freeman-neuroscientist-sn-10-scientists-watch">help scientists better analyze brain data</a>. Now he is executive director of <a href="https://carbonplan.org/">CarbonPlan</a>, a nonprofit organization that he founded in March 2020 to tackle the climate crisis through open-source data and research.</p>



<h5>You’ve shifted gears since 2016. Tell us about it.</h5>



<p>I moved very far from neuroscience, and I’m now exclusively working on climate change. Our focus [at CarbonPlan] is the scientific integrity and transparency of climate solutions. [We do] a combination of research on different areas of climate science and strategies for addressing climate change. We [also] produce a variety of resources and tools for both the research community and the public at large.</p>



<p>Despite being a radically different field, there are some interesting commonalities, in terms of the value of having very accessible, open, publicly available data that speaks to critical issues. [For climate change,] issues around both what is changing in the climate and how we might address that, in different strategies we might take. Having as much of that information be developed in the open, in a way that others can contribute to, and making work available for others to read and evaluate and criticize and engage with — those are [also] values I felt really strongly about in the world of biomedical science.</p>



<h5>What CarbonPlan work are you most proud of right now?</h5>



<p>We have done a lot of analysis identifying very specific ways in which the implementation of forest carbon offset programs [the planting or preservation of trees to attempt to compensate for carbon emissions] haven’t worked. We did a comprehensive analysis of the role of forest carbon offsets in California’s cap-and-trade program, which is a massive sort of market of offsets on the order of $2 billion, and we identified about $400 million worth of offset credits that in our analysis do not reflect real climate benefits because of errors in how they were calculated with respect to issues that involve fundamental problems in statistics and ecology.</p>



<p>That team effort, led by Grayson Badgley and Danny Cullenward, along with a lot of other work that we’ve done on the role of offsets, is really starting to change the conversation, and wake people up to the fact that these approaches to dealing with climate change haven’t been working.</p>



<h5>What other questions are you looking at?</h5>



<p>There’s an area known as carbon removal, which refers to any mechanisms that draw down CO<sub>2</sub><strong><sub> </sub></strong>from the atmosphere. And carbon removal is really, really complicated, because there are a&nbsp;lot of different ways to potentially accomplish that.… So that’s an area where we’ve been very involved, studying, analyzing, comparing. We helped write, edit and produce <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/">a book called the <em>CDR&nbsp;Primer</em></a> — carbon dioxide removal primer. It’s, of course, a publicly available resource.</p>



<h5>Have recent social justice movements influenced your work?</h5>



<p>Absolutely.… Climate change is so fundamentally an issue of equity and an issue of justice. The burdens of climate change are going to be borne by those who were not directly responsible for it, and those who in many ways have been responsible for it will be more able to avoid its impacts. And there’s a deep injustice in that.… How to think about that is an important aspect of our work.… We’re interested in finding a way to be really complementary to a lot of existing community efforts around these issues. </p>

<h4>Paula Jofré</h4>



<p><strong>Astrophysicist</strong><br><strong>Universidad Diego Portales</strong></p>



<p>Paula Jofré, featured in 2018, used the chemical composition of stars across the Milky Way like DNA to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/paula-jofre-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">map the stars’ family tree</a>. She recently filled in some details of the tree — and is filling a gap in the publishing world by writing a book about stars in Spanish.</p>



<h5>What progress have you made on your stellar family tree?</h5>



<p>In the first paper, <a href="http://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/467/1/1140/2966869">the tree had three main branches</a>. There was one that we could associate with a young thin disk, which is one of the populations in the Milky Way. Another was associated with an old, thick disk, which was the older component of the Milky Way. And then we had something in between…. Now, because we had more stars and more chemical elements and we made a better selection of which chemical elements to include, we could find that this strange population was actually an ancestor population of the thin disk. And one of the interpretations we had in the second paper [published in January in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>] <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/32/6081048">was that they were produced all very quickly</a>.</p>



<p>Other groups have found striking evidence of a galaxy that was merged into the Milky Way [billions of years ago]. And that [merging and mixing of gas] could have triggered what is called a star formation burst — lots of stars [forming] at the same time. So, it’s kind of exciting that we find in the tree a feature that could be attributed to a star formation burst … a few gigayears after the [merger of these two galaxies] that we know happened.</p>



<h5>You’re also writing a popular book on stars. Can you tell me more about the book,<em> Fósiles del cosmos: descifrando la historia de la Vía Láctea</em>, or <em>Fossils of the Cosmos: Deciphering the History of the Milky Way</em>, and why you decided to write it?</h5>



<p>It’s going to be published in November [in Chile]. It’s a book in Spanish for the public. I am teaching a class about stars in the Milky Way, a general astronomy class. And I’ve been finding that there is no proper literature in Spanish for the students.… The level is sometimes way too basic or too complex. So I wanted to write something for their level.</p>



<p>[The book] explains how stars create the chemical elements, what’s the role of Gaia [a satellite mission to map the galaxy], what’s the role of the Milky Way Mapper [another survey using Earth-based telescopes], about all these big surveys, why we care, what’s going on.</p>



<p>When I started writing it, of course, I started reading other books…. In all these general astronomy books, women are never highlighted. In my book, I have lots of quotes from 40 different women all around the world, working in my field.… I want to make the point that you can be a woman, you can be clever, you can dedicate yourself to something that is mentally challenging. You can be like any of these 40 women.</p>



<h5>What’s the greatest challenge that you’ve faced since 2018?</h5>



<p>The biggest challenge has been to promote hiring more women at the faculty level. Chile’s a very small country and they love new figures, young figures being highlighted by the United States. The moment I was in <em>Science News</em>,I became very popular [in Chile] very quickly. They needed the inspirational woman. And I kept saying, “I don’t want to be the only one. I want more women.”</p>



<p>I don’t know if you were aware of this collective Las Tesis; they made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB7r6hdo3W4">a dance for the social unrest that we had in Chile</a> before the pandemic. It was a feminist movement that resonated for so many people in the world. The movement [says]: We want to be treated with respect, we want the same salary, we want the same opportunities, we want to feel safe on the streets.… But then, when you are fewer in academia, you’re not going to start jumping on the table and dancing, right? You have to argue … it’s difficult. </p>

QI</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Stanley Qi</h4>



<p><strong>Bioengineer</strong><br><strong>Stanford University</strong></p>



<p>By disabling the DNA-cutting enzyme in the CRISPR system, Stanley Qi, featured in 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stanley-qi-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">created a new and versatile tool</a>. Attaching a range of molecules to these “dead Cas” enzymes has yielded an entire toolbox worth of DNA and RNA manipulators.</p>



<h5>Is the strategy of disabling Cas molecules still popular among researchers?</h5>



<p>I feel it’s getting more popular, for a number of reasons: One, people use … this tool to study how the genome works. Two, there are some new efforts using the tool to treat some genetic diseases. And three, there are some other exciting uses of this tool to think about other diseases, other topics that we can possibly tackle.</p>



<p>For example, this CRISPR system came from bacteria cells, right? They were used as weapons by the bacteria to fight against invading viruses. So we said, “OK, humans also have many foes like invading viruses. Can we repurpose this CRISPR to help us fight our infectious diseases?” That was the idea before the COVID-19 pandemic. We practiced first on influenza, seasonal flu…. We adapted a type of CRISPR system that targets a specific RNA molecule, and it works pretty well. I remember it working in January [2020] when the news started reporting, “Oh, there’s a new virus, it’s an RNA virus,” and we thought immediately, “What if we use this tool on this new RNA virus?”</p>



<p>Instead [of using the live virus], we used synthetic biology to mimic the RNA sequence.… [And we found] we can still very rapidly cleave and destroy this RNA virus and its fragments in the human lung cells. We were really excited. Since then we’ve been working very hard to follow up on the idea, to make this as fast as possible into a possible antiviral. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32353252/">We called it PAC-MAN</a>.</p>



<h5>Can you talk a bit about how the dead Cas, or dCas, approach has been improved and adapted?</h5>



<p>One bigger use is for treating disease like a gene therapy. However, there’s still a number of features that have not been ideal for easy use or testing in clinics.… [For patient care,] people always think about making the system very, very compact and suitable into a nanoparticle or into a viral particle, so we can deliver them with ease into the human body. So that requires <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(21)00648-1">a miniaturization of the CRISPR system</a>. And we actually did some work on that…. They are like two-thirds smaller than what people use.</p>



<p>And second is, many of these natural proteins from bacteria don’t work very well [in human cells].… So we did some protein engineering. Following these efforts, we actually created some highly compact, yet highly efficient dCas systems that can be easily delivered into the human body to turn on or off genes.</p>



<h5>What are the greatest challenges you’ve faced in the last couple of years?</h5>



<p>We are bioengineers and we think our strength is in creating stuff, modifying. Now as we step into the domain of applying these tools to solve real-world problems, the challenge is how to build a bridge between where we are to where we want to go. That usually requires learning a significant amount about a disease, about a new field, and thinking creatively on how to interface two fields. </p>

<h4>Emily Fischer</h4>



<p><strong>Atmospheric chemist</strong><br><strong>Colorado State University</strong></p>



<p>Emily Fischer, featured in 2020, is in the midst of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2020#fischer">one of the most comprehensive analyses of wildfire smoke ever attempted</a>. Since we last chatted with Fischer, her wildfire research and the way she talks about it have become more personal.</p>



<h5>Have you started any projects since 2020?</h5>



<p>We’re looking at the impact of smoke on the visible light range where photosynthesis occurs. There’s smoke blanketing the U.S. in summers now. Regardless of whether it’s at the ground, it’s somewhere in the atmosphere between the sun and the plants on the ground. In the Midwest, for example, over our corn and soybean belt, there’s smoke between a third to half of the days on average in July and August, during peak growing season. What does that mean for crops? How is that changing the light at the surface? If it’s boosting the diffuse fraction of radiation, and not decreasing the total radiation, that’s a boost to productivity.</p>



<h5>Last year, you helped launch a national group called Science Moms. What is that?</h5>



<p>We are a nonpartisan group of scientists who are also mothers. The goal of <a href="https://sciencemoms.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwy7CKBhBMEiwA0Eb7ag_v-5mGZoCRiGePqLzDycKpz0G8pnlxL-wrFmf7hg_yJbOwhvtwchoCPtcQAvD_BwE">Science Moms</a> is for us to speak directly [via a website, videos and events] on climate change to other mothers in ways that are accurate, digestible and also engaging. While roughly 60 percent of the U.S. population is worried about climate change, like 85 percent of moms are worried about climate change. But they don’t feel comfortable talking about it, or know how to talk to their representatives about it or even talk to their book club about it.</p>



<h5>How have people responded to your outreach efforts?</h5>



<p>I get all sorts of messages: “This is so different than any other climate communication that I’ve ever seen.” We’re trained as scientists to take the emotion out of things, but actually it’s very important for people to understand the feeling of climate change.</p>



<p>Last summer [2020], extreme fires impacted my own home. We had smoke here for multiple months, and my family ran from the Cameron Peak Fire.… For me, there was a shift from “These are the numbers, these are the graphs,” to “Oh, this is what my graphs feel like, this is what this trend feels like.”</p>



<h5>Did your experience fleeing a wildfire shift your perspective around your science?</h5>



<p>I’m the kind of person who studies what I see.… And so I should not have been surprised by that fire. I was out backpacking with my family, and it started one range over and my kids and I ran out, and we made it. So it was OK, but I was not sure it would be OK. When something like that happens to you, you have to respond to it. [Now] I think, when we calculate a change in something going forward, what does that mean? What are all the impacts that that could have?</p>



<p>Also, seeing the incident management teams working together to help people [during the fire] was very inspiring. I would say to my husband, “These teams are beautiful. They are functioning at such a high level under such hard conditions. If we could just harness this level of cooperation toward climate change action, or toward eliminating the pandemic, we [could] do anything.” </p>

KIPPING</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>David Kipping</h4>



<p><strong>Astronomer</strong><br><strong>Columbia University</strong></p>



<p>After being <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/david-kipping-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featured in 2017</a>, David Kipping and his colleagues formally reported in <em>Science Advances</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-may-have-spotted-first-known-exomoon">the first detection of a potential exomoon</a> — a moon orbiting a planet outside of the solar system. Signs of the Neptune-sized moon were spotted around a Jupiter-sized planet 8,000 light-years from Earth. Kipping has been hunting for more ever since, and has also become a hit on YouTube.</p>



<h5>Have you found any more exomoons?</h5>



<p>Well, I can’t really talk about that. We are close to releasing the results of a new survey of the ensemble of Jupiter-like planets discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Such planets are thought to be the best hunting ground for moons, being far from the gravitational influence of their star and large enough to support potentially massive moons. Unfortunately, the results are still not quite ready.</p>



<h5>How have other scientists reacted?</h5>



<p>The community is naturally skeptical. That was kind of the story of exoplanets. When researchers first discovered a hot Jupiter, no one believed it. It wasn’t until they discovered about 10 of them that people started to say that, actually, maybe these are real. I don’t know how it’s going to go with any exomoon candidate. Maybe what we’ve found is genuinely bogus, but I obviously hope not. We did our due diligence, and we’re very careful with the results.</p>



<p>It’s maybe not surprising that the first ones we find are going to be so large, because after all, they’re going to be the easiest to detect.… Actually, less than 1&nbsp;percent of sunlike stars have hot Jupiters, but they dominated all of the first exoplanet detections just because they were so easy to find. Maybe the same thing will play out here.</p>



<h5>In 2017, you had just launched a YouTube channel called Cool Worlds. How is that outreach going?</h5>



<p>It’s been pretty overwhelming to us, because I’d never expected to get anywhere near the number of people watching who have watched. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZRDONE4zng&amp;ab_channel=CoolWorlds">last video [on what’s called the red sky paradox] got 200,000 views</a>, and the one before it got 500,000. I mean, that’s just bonkers. I get e-mails from people, really amazing e-mails, that say how much the channel and the videos mean to them. That’s really incredible.</p>



<p>We have lots of people actually financially supporting us now. We give them special access to the videos and early access to the papers we’re writing. We hang out with some of them once every two months on a livestream and chat about science. It’s starting to be enough that I’m funding students through donations. I have this dream that I do research, it produces cool ideas, I talk about it on my outreach channel, people get excited about it and they support us, which enables me to do more research.</p>



<h5>What are the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2017?</h5>



<p>I’m still [working to earn] tenure. It’s obviously one of the most stressful periods of your career because you don’t have that safety net yet that some young tenured colleagues enjoy. At the same time, you’re trying to raise a family and make sure you see your kids growing up. You don’t want to be a ghost at home. And so that’s been tricky, but [the pandemic] enabled me to spend a lot more time at home with the family. </p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Do you think that an only child behaves differently to a kid with siblings? If you do, you’re hardly alone. Stereotypes about only children being spoiled, self-centred &#8220;little emperors&#8221; abound. In 2019, though, research in Germany concluded that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/15/the-stereotype-of-the-narcissistic-only-child-is-widespread-but-its-wrong/">while the idea that only children are more narcissistic is widespread, it&#8217;s wrong</a>. Now a team in China has failed to find any evidence for another of the clichés: that only children are more selfish.</p>



<span id="more-44039"></span>



<p>In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211038190">a paper</a> in <em>Social Psychology and Personality Science</em>, Xuegang Zheng at Shaanxi Normal University and colleagues first confirm that this particular stereotype indeed exists — among adults who grew up with siblings, at least. (In the paper, the team uses the term &#8220;only children&#8221; and &#8220;non-only children&#8221; to refer to adults without or with siblings.) This group consistently tended to rate &#8220;typical&#8221; only children as being less prosocial (or more selfish) than non-only children; however, the only children in this study rated both groups the same. The team used various scales to gather these ratings, including a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game">dictator game</a>, in which the participants were asked to judge how much of a given amount of money a &#8220;typical&#8221; only child or non-only child would be willing to share with them. </p>



<p>In a second study of 391 adults (169 of whom were only children), the researchers used the same altruism scales (including the dictator game), but this time asked the participants to rate themselves. They found no differences between the two groups; only children did not emerge as being any more selfish than children with siblings.</p>



<p>This particular stereotype is thought to stem, at least in part, from the idea that only children grow up as the sole focus of their parents’ attention. If this is the case, there may be upsides. Some earlier work has found, for example, that only children tend to report better, warmer relationships with their parents. Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, only children might be <em>more </em>altruistic (or less selfish) towards the people closest to them. So they investigated this idea in a third study.</p>



<p>A group of 99 Chinese students (about half were only children) first identified people at varying social distances from them — from parents, through friends and acquaintances, to strangers. Across a series of trials, each participant was offered a small sum of money and asked whether they wanted to keep it for themselves or share it with a given target person on their social distance scale. (The social distance between the participant and this target person varied across the trials, and the researchers did actually pay out a small proportion of the offered money.)</p>



<p>If the only children were actually <em>more</em> selfless than non-only children with the people closest to them — or perhaps more selfish than non-only children with people they knew less well — this should have been evident in the data. But it wasn’t. Again, there were no differences in the results for the two groups. Though the finding of equal results for only children and non-only children in the second study came only from self-report data, these findings on actual behaviour shore up&nbsp; the conclusion that the stereotype is wrong.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the sample sizes in these studies were small. And the results might not be generalisable beyond China (where of course the one-child policy has had a big impact), or even across China (as the samples were not nationally representative). Also, these studies were all on adults who had grown up with or without siblings, rather than only <em>children</em>. Still, the results do add to the growing evidence against common stereotypes about only children — or &#8220;only adults&#8221;, at least.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-ground-sloths-meat-scavenger-paleontology">Giant ground sloths may have been meat-eating scavengers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern sloths may be dedicated vegetarians, but at least one of their massive Ice Age cousins chowed down on meat when it had the chance. &nbsp;Darwin’s ground sloth — which could grow to over 3 meters long and weigh as much as about 2,000 kilograms — may have been an opportunistic scavenger, chemical analyses of fossil sloth hair suggest.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Julia Tejada of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues analyzed the chemical makeup of two amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, within the fossil hair of two <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-prove-humans-hunted-giant-sloths-during-ice-age">giant ground sloth species</a>: Darwin’s ground sloth (<em>Mylodon darwinii</em>) of South America and the Shasta ground sloth (<em>Nothrotheriops shastensis</em>) of North America (<em>SN: 4/25/18</em>). The team compared these with samples from living sloths, anteaters and other modern omnivores.</p>





<p>Nitrogen isotopes, different forms of the element, can vary a lot among different food sources as well as between ecosystems. Those isotope values in one amino acid, glutamine, change significantly with diet, increasing the higher the animal is on the food chain. But diet has little impact on the nitrogen values in another amino acid, phenylalamine. By comparing the nitrogen isotopes in the two amino acids found in the sloths’ hair, the researchers were able to eliminate ecosystem effects and zoom in on diets.</p>





<p>The data reveal that while the diet of the Shasta ground slothwas exclusively plant-based, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97996-9">Darwin’s ground sloth was an omnivore</a>, Tejada and colleagues report October 7 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The findings upend what scientists thought they knew about the ancient animals. Scientists have assumed the ancient creatures were herbivores. That’s in part because all six modern species of sloth are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/three-toed-sloths-are-even-more-slothful-two-toed-sloths">confirmed vegetarians</a>, and in part giant ground sloths’ teeth and jaws weren’t adapted for hunting or powerful chewing and tearing (<em>SN: 6/20/16</em>).</p>



<p>But Darwin’s ground sloth could have managed to ingest already-killed meat, Tejada and colleagues say. And that might help solve a long-standing puzzle: the apparent absence of large carnivorous mammals in South America at the time. Darwin’s ground sloth, the researchers add, may have filled a vacant ecological niche: the scavenger who wouldn’t say no to a meaty meal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-nobel-prize-2021-molecule-build-tool-list-macmillan">An easier, greener way to build molecules wins the chemistry Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making molecules is hard work. Atoms must be stitched together into specific arrangements through a series of chemical reactions that are often slow, convoluted and wasteful. The 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry recognizes two scientists who developed a tool at the turn of the century that revolutionized how chemists construct new molecules, making the process faster and more environmentally friendly.</p>



<p>Chemists Benjamin List of the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany and David MacMillan of Princeton University were awarded the prize for independently developing organic catalysts that speed up chemical reactions necessary for constructing specific molecules, a process called asymmetric organocatalysis. The two will share the prize of 10 million Swedish kroner (more than $1.1 million), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 6 in a news conference in Stockholm.</p>



<p>“This is a fitting recognition of very important work,” says H.N. Cheng, president of the American Chemical Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can think of chemists as magicians having magic wands in the lab,” Cheng says. “We wave the wand and a reaction goes on.” These Nobel laureates gave chemists “a new wand,” that’s drastically more efficient and less wasteful, he says.</p>





<p>Making new drugs or designing novel materials often requires building new molecules from simpler chemical building blocks. But these chemical building blocks can’t just be thrown together. Instead, they must be carefully combined in precise arrangements through a series of chemical reactions. Many chemical reactions produce two versions of a molecule that are mirror images of one another, and often those two versions can have very different effects. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/return-thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, a drug prescribed in the 1950s and ‘60s for morning sickness, caused birth defects in more than 10,000 babies because of one mirror image of this molecule (<em>SN: 12/24/94</em>). Consequently, building these asymmetric molecules and controlling which version of a molecule gets produced is extremely important, especially for drug development.</p>





<p>Chemical reactions can be coaxed along by catalysts — molecular workhorses that accelerate chemical reactions without being transformed by them. Historically, chemists have known about two kinds of catalysts: enzymes and metal complexes. Enzymes are big, clunky proteins that have been honed by evolution to perform very specific chemical actions in the body, but they can be difficult to use on a large scale in the lab. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-greener-catalysts-are-built-speed">Metals, such as platinum or cobalt, can kick-start some reactions too</a>, but many only work in airless, waterless environments that are difficult to achieve in manufacturing contexts (<em>SN: 2/21/17</em>). Additionally, many metal catalysts are also toxic to the environment and expensive to procure.</p>



<p>For much of the history of chemistry, these were the only tools available to chemists who wanted to make new molecules. “But in the year 2000, everything changed,” Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, a chemist at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the news conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin List, then at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., was studying the aldol reaction, which links two molecules together through carbon bonds. In organisms, such reactions are crucial for converting food into energy, and depend on a large and complex enzyme called aldolase A. Only a small part of the enzyme actually catalyzes the reaction, however, and List discovered that a single amino acid — proline — could do the work of this big clunky protein while also producing one version of the final product much more often than the other.</p>

<p>“When I did this experiment, I didn’t know what would happen and I thought maybe it’s a stupid idea,” List said during the news conference. “When I saw it work, I did feel it could be something big.”</p>



<p>Unbeknown to List, MacMillan was also looking for alternative organic catalysts around the same time. MacMillan, then at the University of California, Berkeley, focused on another chemical reaction, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/diels-alder-reaction-gains-nobel-prize">Diels-Alder reaction</a>, which forms rings of carbon atoms (<em>SN: 11/18/50</em>). It’s an important reaction, used today to make products as different as rubber and pharmaceuticals, but was very slow and relied on finicky metal catalysts that wouldn’t work when wet. MacMillan designed small organic molecules that mimicked the catalytic action of metals in a simpler way, while also favoring the production of one of two possible mirror images of the final product. He coined this new kind of catalysis “asymmetric organocatalysis<em>.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="477" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_nobel_chemistry_inline-2.jpg" alt="David MacMillan sitting in his office" class="wp-image-3104403" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_nobel_chemistry_inline-2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_nobel_chemistry_inline-2-546x383.jpg 546w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_nobel_chemistry_inline-2-642x450.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100621_nobel_chemistry_inline-2-265x186.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104403">David MacMillan of Princeton University designed small organic molecules that mimicked the catalytic action of metals in a simpler way, work that earned him the 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104403">Denise Applewhite/Office of Communications/Princeton University (2012)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>List’s and MacMillan’s discoveries set off an explosion of research into finding more organocatalysts over the next two decades, work that’s aided drug discovery among other uses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 35 percent of the world’s gross domestic product depends on catalysis, Peter Somfai, a chemist at Lund University in Sweden and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the news conference. “We now have a new powerful tool available for making organic molecules,” one that can be drastically more efficient and greener than previous methods.</p>



<p>Somfai highlighted this leap forward in efficiency using the neurotoxin strychnine. The molecule itself isn’t useful for chemists, but its complicated structure makes it a good benchmark for comparing different synthesis methodologies. Previously, chemists relied on an extremely wasteful process of 29 different reactions where just 0.0009 percent of the initial material became strychnine. Using organocatalysis, strychnine can now be synthesized in just 12 steps, and the whole process is 7,000 times more efficient, Somfai said. And because this extra efficiency is gained without using toxic metals, organocatalysis is a more environmentally friendly way of synthesizing chemicals.</p>



<p>If building new molecules is like playing chess, organocatalysis has “completely changed the game,” Somfai said. “It’s like adding a new chess piece that can move in different ways.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">When James Webb launches, it will have a bigger to-do list than 1980s researchers suspected</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The James Webb Space Telescope has been a long time coming. When it launches later this year, the observatory will be the largest and most complex telescope ever sent into orbit. Scientists have been drafting and redrafting their dreams and plans for this unique tool since 1989.</p>



<p>The mission was originally scheduled to launch between 2007 and 2011, but a series of budget and technical issues pushed its start date back more than a decade. Remarkably, the core design of the telescope hasn’t changed much. But the science that it can dig into has. In the years of waiting for Webb to be ready, big scientific questions have emerged. When Webb was an early glimmer in astronomers’ eyes, cosmological revolutions like the discoveries of dark energy and planets orbiting stars outside our solar system hadn’t yet happened.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/about-jwst/history">It’s been over 25 years</a>,” says cosmologist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago. “But I think it was really worth the wait.”</p>



<h4>An audacious plan<br></h4>





<p>Webb has a distinctive design. Most space telescopes house a single lens or mirror within a tube that blocks sunlight from swamping the dim lights of the cosmos. But Webb’s massive 6.5-meter-wide mirror and its scientific instruments are exposed to the vacuum of space. A multilayered shield the size of a tennis court will block light from the sun, Earth and moon.</p>



<p>For the awkward shape to fit on a rocket, Webb will launch folded up, then unfurl itself in space (see below, What could go wrong?).</p>



<p>“They call this the origami satellite,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute, or STScI, in Baltimore. Friedman is in charge of Webb’s postlaunch choreography. “Webb is different from any other telescope that’s flown.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A novel design</h3>



<p>Once all is unfolded, the James Webb Space Telescope’s sun shield will span the length of a tennis court to protect the main and secondary mirrors from the sun, moon and Earth’s light and heat. The solar panels, exposed to the sun, will convert light to electricity to power the instruments. Webb’s antenna will keep it communicating with scientists on Earth, sending data from the scientific instruments. The stabilization flap keeps the machine from veering off course.</p>

<p>Its basic design hasn’t changed in more than 25 years. The telescope was first proposed in September 1989 at a workshop held at STScI, which also runs the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>At the time, Hubble was less than a year from launching, and was expected to function for only 15 years. Thirty-one years after its launch, the telescope is still going strong, despite a series of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-new-trouble-probably-wont-doom-space-telescope">computer glitches and gyroscope failures</a> (<em>SN Online: 10/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>The institute director at the time, Riccardo Giacconi, was concerned that the next major mission would take longer than 15 years to get off the ground. So he and others proposed that <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA investigate a possible successor to Hubble</a>: a space telescope with a 10-meter-wide primary mirror that was sensitive to light in infrared wavelengths to complement Hubble’s range of ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared.</p>



<p>Infrared light has a longer wavelength than light that is visible to human eyes. But it’s perfect for a telescope to look back in time. Because light travels at a fixed speed, looking at distant objects in the universe means seeing them as they looked in the past. The universe is expanding, so that light is stretched before it reaches our telescopes. For the most distant objects in the universe — the first galaxies to clump together, or the first stars to burn in those galaxies — light that was originally emitted in shorter wavelengths is stretched all the way to the infrared.</p>



<p>Giacconi and his collaborators dreamed of a telescope that would detect that stretched light from the earliest galaxies. When Hubble started sharing its views of the early universe, the dream solidified into a science plan. The galaxies Hubble saw at great distances “looked different from what people were expecting,” says astronomer Massimo Stiavelli, a leader of the James Webb Space Telescope project who has been at STScI since 1995. “People started thinking that there is interesting science here.”</p>



<p>In 1995, STScI and NASA commissioned a report to design Hubble’s successor. The report, led by astronomer Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., suggested an infrared space observatory with a 4-meter-wide mirror.</p>



<p>The bigger a telescope’s mirror, the more light it can collect, and the farther it can see. Four meters wasn’t that much larger than Hubble’s 2.4-meter-wide mirror, but anything bigger would be difficult to launch.</p>



<p>Dressler briefed then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin in late 1995. In January 1996 at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting, Goldin challenged the scientists to be more ambitious. He called out Dressler by name, saying, “Why do you ask for such a modest thing? Why not go after six or seven meters?” (Still nowhere near Giacconi’s pie-in-the-sky 10-meter wish.) The speech received a standing ovation.</p>



<p>Six meters was a larger mirror than had ever flown in space, and larger than would fit in available launch vehicles. Scientists would have to design a telescope mirror that could fold, then deploy once it reached space.</p>



<p>The telescope would also need to cool itself passively by radiating heat into space. It needed a sun shield — a big one. The origami telescope was born. It was dubbed James Webb in 2002 for NASA’s administrator from 1961 to 1968, who fought to support research to boost understanding of the universe in the increasingly human-focused space program. (In response to a May petition to change the name, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1">NASA investigated allegations</a> that James Webb persecuted gay and lesbian people during his government career. The agency announced on September 27 that it found no evidence warranting a name change.)</p>

<h3>Mixed views</h3>



<p>Webb will observe the universe in wavelengths that are mostly longer than what humans can see (0.38 to 0.7 micrometers) and what the Hubble Space Telescope can observe, yet shorter than most of the Spitzer Space Telescope’s range. This infrared view lets telescopes observe farther and see through dust clouds.</p>

<p>Goldin’s motto at NASA was “Faster, better, cheaper.” Bigger was better for Webb, but it sure wasn’t faster — or cheaper. By late 2010, the project <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cost-overruns-and-delays-add-65-billion-nasas-next-gen-space-telescope">was more than $1.4 billion over its $5.1 billion budget</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/11, p. 22</em>). And it was going to take another five years to be ready. Today, the cost is estimated at almost $10 billion.</p>



<p>The telescope survived a near-cancellation by Congress, and its timeline was reset for an October 2018 launch. But in 2017, the launch was pushed to June 2019. Two more delays in 2018 pushed the takeoff to May 2020, then to March 2021. Some of those delays were because assembling and testing the spacecraft took longer than NASA expected.</p>



<p>Other slowdowns were because of human errors, like using the wrong cleaning solvent, which damaged valves in the propulsion system. Recent shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic pushed the launch back a few more months.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we ever imagined it would be this long,” says University of Chicago’s Freedman, who worked on the Dressler report. But there’s one silver lining: Science marched on.</p>



<h4>The age conflict</h4>



<p>The first science goal <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/stsci/org/hst-and-beyond-report.pdf">listed in the Dressler report</a> was “the detailed study of the birth and evolution of normal galaxies such as the Milky Way.” That is still the dream, partly because it’s such an ambitious goal, Stiavelli says.</p>



<p>“We wanted a science rationale that would resist the test of time,” he says. “We didn’t want to build a mission that would do something that gets done in some other way before you’re done.”</p>



<p>Webb will peek at galaxies and stars as they were just 400 million years after the Big Bang, which astronomers think is the epoch when the first tiny galaxies began making the universe transparent to light by stripping electrons from cosmic hydrogen.</p>



<p>But in the 1990s, astronomers had a problem: There didn’t seem to be enough time in the universe to make galaxies much earlier than the ones astronomers had already seen. The standard cosmology at the time suggested the universe was 8 billion or 9 billion years old, but there were stars in the Milky Way that seemed to be about 14 billion years old.</p>



<p>“There was this age conflict that reared its head,” Freedman says. “You can’t have a universe that’s younger than the oldest stars. The way people put it was, ‘You can’t be older than your grandmother!’”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Getting there</h3>



<p>Webb will orbit the sun from a stable point in space called L2, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The telescope will spend its first month after launch getting to this point and unfolding its sun shield and mirrors. The sun shield will face Earth and the sun at all times, keeping their light and heat away from the telescope’s sensitive instruments. Once at L2, the telescope will spend another five months turning on and testing its scientific instruments before collecting data.</p>



<h6>Webb travels to L2</h6>

<p>In 1998, two teams of cosmologists showed that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. A mysterious substance dubbed dark energy may be pushing the universe to expand faster and faster. That accelerated expansion means the universe is older than astronomers previously thought — the current estimate is about 13.8 billion years old.</p>



<p>“That resolved the age conflict,” Freedman says. “The discovery of dark energy changed everything.” And it expanded Webb’s to-do list.</p>



<h4>Dark energy</h4>



<p>Top of the list is getting to the bottom of a mismatch in cosmic measurements. Since at least 2014, different methods for measuring the universe’s rate of expansion — called the Hubble constant — have been giving different answers. Freedman calls the issue “the most important problem in cosmology today.”</p>



<p>The question, Freedman says, is whether the mismatch is real. A real mismatch could indicate something profound about the nature of dark energy and the history of the universe. But the discrepancy could just be due to measurement errors.</p>



<p>Webb can help settle the debate. One common way to determine the Hubble constant is by measuring the distances and speeds of far-off galaxies. Measuring cosmic distances is difficult, but astronomers can estimate them using objects of known brightness, called standard candles. If you know the object’s actual brightness, you can calculate its distance based on how bright it seems from Earth.</p>



<p>Studies using supernovas and variable stars called Cepheids as candles have found an expansion rate of 74.0 kilometers per second for approximately every 3 million light-years, or megaparsec, of distance between objects. But using red giant stars, Freedman and colleagues have gotten a smaller answer: 69.8 km/s/Mpc.</p>



<p>Other studies have measured the Hubble constant by looking at the dim glow of light emitted just 380,000 years after the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background. Calculations based on that glow give a smaller rate still: 67.4 km/s/Mpc. Although these numbers may seem close, the fact that they disagree at all could alter our understanding of the contents of the universe and how it evolves over time. The discrepancy has been called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">crisis in cosmology</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go">In its first year, Webb will observe</a> some of the same galaxies used in the supernova studies, using three different objects as candles: Cepheids, red giants and peculiar stars called carbon stars.</p>



<p>The telescope will also try to measure the Hubble constant using a distant gravitationally lensed galaxy. Comparing those measurements with each other and with similar ones from Hubble will show if earlier measurements were just wrong, or if the tension between measurements is real, Freedman says.</p>



<p>Without these new observations, “we were just going to argue about the same things forever,” she says. “We just need better data. And [Webb] is poised to deliver it.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>What could go wrong?</h3>



<p>For the James Webb Space Telescope, getting into space is just step one. The telescope must complete a complicated series of unfolding steps before it can observe the cosmos. The entire sequence, including getting the science instruments ready, will take about six months.</p>



<p>“A lot has to go right, that’s for sure,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who is in charge of this timeline. Webb will be heading to a point in space called L2, which is too far from Earth for astronauts to visit and make repairs. “There’s every reason to believe things will go very well,” Friedman says. “But we won’t know until we get there.”</p>

</div><figcaption><br>Here’s a timeline of what has to go right (all times are approximate).</figcaption></figure>
</div>



<h4>Exoplanets</h4>



<p>Perhaps the biggest change for Webb science has been the rise of the field of exoplanet explorations.</p>



<p>“When this was proposed, exoplanets were scarcely a thing,” says STScI’s Friedman. “And now, of course, it’s one of the hottest topics in all of science, especially all of astronomy.”</p>



<p>The Dressler report’s second major goal for Hubble’s successor was “the detection of Earthlike planets around other stars and the search for evidence of life on them.” But back in 1995, only a handful of planets orbiting other sunlike stars were even known, and all of them were scorching-hot gas giants — nothing like Earth at all.</p>



<p>Since then, astronomers have discovered thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars. Scientists now estimate that, on average, there is at least one planet for every star we see in the sky. And some of the planets are small and rocky, with the right temperatures to support liquid water, and maybe life.</p>



<p>Most of the known planets were discovered as they crossed, or transited, in front of their parent stars, blocking a little bit of the parent star’s light. Astronomers soon realized that, if those planets have atmospheres, a sensitive telescope could effectively sniff the air by examining the starlight that filters through the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003, and Hubble have started this work. But Spitzer ran out of coolant in 2009, keeping it too warm to measure important molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. And Hubble is not sensitive to some of the most interesting wavelengths of light — the ones that could reveal alien life-forms.</p>



<p>That’s where Webb is going to shine. If Hubble is peeking through a crack in a door, Webb will throw the door wide open, says exoplanet scientist Nikole Lewis of Cornell University. Crucially, Webb, unlike Hubble, will be particularly sensitive to several carbon-bearing molecules in exoplanet atmospheres that might be signs of life.</p>



<p>“Hubble can’t tell us anything really about carbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane,” she says.</p>



<p>If Webb had launched in 2007, it could have missed this whole field. Even though the first transiting exoplanet was discovered in 1999, their numbers were low for the next decade.</p>



<p>Lewis remembers thinking, when she started grad school in 2007, that she could make a computer model of all the transiting exoplanets. “Because there were literally only 25,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Transit advantages</h3>



<p>Webb will measure the composition of exoplanet atmospheres by looking at the light from the planet’s host star as the planet crosses in front of the star. Atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K), absorb certain wavelengths of the starlight, leaving a unique fingerprint in the spectrum of light that reaches Webb’s detectors.</p>



<div class="image-desktop"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="349" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_jwst_inline4_desktop.jpg" alt="measuring exoplanet atmospheres" class="wp-image-3104161" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_jwst_inline4_desktop.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_jwst_inline4_desktop-330x169.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3104161">ESO, David Sing</span></figcaption></figure></div>

</div>



<p>Between 2009 and 2018, NASA’s Kepler space telescope raked in transiting planets by the thousands. But those planets were too dim and distant for Webb to probe their atmospheres.</p>



<p>So the down-to-the-wire delays of the last few years have actually been good for exoplanet research, Lewis says. “The launch delays were one of the best things that’s happened for exoplanet science with Webb,” she says. “Full stop.”</p>



<p>That’s mainly thanks to NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/tess/">or TESS</a>, which launched in April 2018. TESS’ job is to find planets orbiting the brightest, nearest stars, which will give Webb the best shot at detecting interesting molecules in planetary atmospheres.</p>



<p>If it had launched in 2018, Webb would have had to wait a few years for TESS to pick out the best targets. Now, it can get started on those worlds right away. Webb’s first year of observations will include probing several known exoplanets that have been hailed as possible places to find life. Scientists will survey planets orbiting small, cool stars called M dwarfs to make sure such planets even have atmospheres, a question that has been hotly debated.</p>



<p>If a sign of life does show up on any of these planets, that result will be fiercely debated, too, Lewis says. “There will be a huge kerfuffle in the literature when that comes up.” It will be hard to compare planets orbiting M dwarfs with Earth, because these planets and their stars are so different from ours. Still, “let’s look and see what we find,” she says.</p>



<h4>A limited lifetime</h4>



<p>With its components assembled, tested and folded at Northrop Grumman’s facilities in California, Webb is on its way by boat through the Panama Canal, ready to launch in an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. The most recent launch date is set for December 18.</p>



<p>For the scientists who have been working on Webb for decades, this is a nostalgic moment.</p>



<p>“You start to relate to the folks who built the pyramids,” Stiavelli says.</p>



<p>Other scientists, who grew up in a world where Webb was always on the horizon, are already thinking about the next big thing.</p>



<p>“I’m pretty sure, barring epic disaster, that [Webb] will carry my career through the next decade,” Lewis says. “But I have to think about what I’ll do in the<em> next</em> decade” after that.<br><br>Unlike Hubble, which has lasted decades thanks to fixes by astronauts and upgrade missions, Webb has a strictly limited lifetime. Orbiting the sun at a gravitationally fixed point called L2, Webb will be too far from Earth to repair, and will need to burn small amounts of fuel to stay in position. The fuel will last for at least five years, and hopefully as much as 10. But when the fuel runs out, Webb is finished. The telescope operators will move it into retirement in an out-of-the-way orbit around the sun, and bid it farewell.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We investigate the molecular gene expressions studies and public databases for
disease modelling using Probabilistic Graphical Models and Bayesian Inference.
A case study on Spinal Muscle Atrophy Genome-Wide Association Study results is
modelled and analyzed. The genes up and down-regulated in 2 stages of the
disease development are linked to prior knowledge published in the public
domain and co-expressions network is created and analyzed. The Molecular
Pathways triggered by these genes are identified. The Bayesian inference
posteriors distributions are estimated using a variational analytical algorithm
and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Assumptions, limitations and
possible future work are concluded.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-venus-collision-planet-formation">Space rocks may have bounced off baby Earth, but slammed into Venus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Squabbling sibling planets may have hurled space rocks when they were young.</p>



<p>Simulations suggest that space rocks the size of baby planets struck both the newborn Earth and Venus, but many of the rocks that only grazed Earth went on to hit — and stick — to Venus. That difference in early impacts could help explain <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac19b1#fnref-psjac19b1bib8">why Earth and Venus are such different worlds today</a>, researchers report September 23 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“The pronounced differences between Earth and Venus, in spite of their similar orbits and masses, has been one of the biggest puzzles in our solar system,” says planetary scientist Shigeru Ida of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the new work. This study introduces “a new point that has not been raised before.”</p>



<p>Scientists have typically thought that there are two ways that collisions between baby planets can go. The objects could graze each other and each continue on its way, in a hit-and-run collision. Or two protoplanets could stick together, or accrete, making one larger planet. Planetary scientists often assume that every hit-and-run collision eventually leads to accretion. Objects that collide must have orbits that cross each other’s, so they’re bound to collide again and again, and eventually should stick.</p>





<p>But previous work from planetary scientist Erik Asphaug of the University of Arizona in Tucson and others suggests that isn’t so. It takes special conditions for two planets to merge, Asphaug says, like relatively slow impact speeds, so hit-and-runs were probably much more common in the young solar system.</p>



<p>Asphaug and colleagues wondered what that might have meant for Earth and Venus, two apparently similar planets with vastly different climates. Both worlds are about the same size and mass, but Earth is wet and clement while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">Venus is a searing, acidic hellscape</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>“If they started out on similar pathways, somehow Venus took a wrong turn,” Asphaug says.</p>



<p>The team ran about 4,000 computer simulations in which Mars-sized protoplanets crashed into a young Earth or Venus, assuming the two planets were at their current distances from the sun. The researchers found that about half of the time, incoming protoplanets grazed Earth without directly colliding. Of those, about half went on to collide with Venus.</p>



<p>Unlike Earth, Venus ended up accreting most of the objects that hit it in the simulations. Hitting Earth first slowed incoming objects down enough to let them stick to Venus later, the study suggests. “You have this imbalance where things that hit the Earth, but don’t stick, tend to end up on Venus,” Asphaug says. “We have a fundamental explanation for why Venus ended up accreting differently from the Earth.”</p>



<p>If that’s really what happened, it would have had a significant effect on the composition of the two worlds. Earth would have ended up with more of the outer mantle and crust material from the incoming protoplanets, while Venus would have gotten more of their iron-rich cores.</p>



<p>The imbalance in impacts could even explain some major Venusian mysteries, like why the planet doesn’t have a moon, why it spins so slowly and why it lacks a magnetic field — though “these are hand-waving kind of conjectures,” Asphaug says.</p>



<p>Ida says he hopes that future work will look into those questions more deeply. “I’m looking forward to follow-up studies to examine if the new result actually explains the Earth-Venus difference,” he says.</p>



<p>The idea fits into a growing debate among planetary scientists about how the solar system grew up, says planetary scientist Seth Jacobson of Michigan State University in East Lansing. Was it built violently, with lots of giant collisions, or calmly, with planets growing smoothly via pebbles sticking together?</p>



<p>“This paper falls on the end of lots of giant impacts,” Jacobson says.</p>



<p>Each rocky planet in the solar system should have very different chemistry and structure depending on which scenario is true. But scientists know the chemistry and structure of only one planet with any confidence: Earth. And Earth’s early history has been overwritten by plate tectonics and other geologic activity. “Venus is the missing link,” Jacobson says. “Learning more about Venus’ chemistry and interior structure is going to tell us more about whether it had a giant impact or not.”</p>



<p>Three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">missions to Venus</a> are expected to launch in the late 2020s and 2030s (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). Those should help, but none are expected to take the kind of detailed composition measurements that could definitively solve the mystery. That would take a long-lived lander, or a sample return mission, both of which would be extremely difficult on hot, hostile Venus.</p>



<p>“I wish there was an easier way to test it,” Jacobson says. “I think that’s where we should concentrate our energy as terrestrial planet formation scientists going forward.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/06/language-proficiency-can-determine-how-similarly-first-and-second-languages-are-represented-in-the-brain/">Language Proficiency Can Determine How Similarly First And Second Languages Are Represented In The Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Researchers widely agree that first and second languages are handled similarly in the brain. According to previous research, proficient bilinguals’ brain activity is broadly quite similar when accessing their first and second languages.</p>



<p>However, the literature exploring this until now has relied on imaging methods that can tell us <em>where</em> in the brain there is activity, but not <em>how</em> languages are represented in those areas. Distinct patterns of activation may have differentiated first and second languages in those same regions all this time, and by relying on traditional forms of imaging analysis alone, we could have been none the wiser.</p>



<p>Thanks to new imaging methods, however, we’re finally able to take a look at activation in these areas in a much more detailed way. Now, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25633?af=R">newly published work</a> from Emily Nichols at The University of Western Ontario and colleagues suggests that languages are represented more distinctly than we thought.</p>



<span id="more-44021"></span>



<p>For this study, the researchers gathered a sample of 32 bilingual English and Mandarin speakers living in Beijing. All participants spoke English as their first language, and Mandarin as their second. As might be expected, the age of acquisition (AoA) and proficiency of Mandarin — as measured by self-report and pre-testing, respectively — varied from person to person.</p>



<p>During their fMRI scans, participants were presented with a picture-word matching task in both English and Mandarin. For each trial of this task, they were shown a picture for 2.5 seconds, while an audio clip of a common two-syllable word, which either matched or didn’t match the image shown, was played. These audio clips alternated between English and Mandarin for all 160 trials, and participants were asked to indicate as quickly as possible via button press whether or not the audio given matched the contents of the image.</p>



<p>The team then used a technique known as representational similarity analysis (RSA) on imaging data collected during correct trials, in order to see which brain areas reliably showed different patterns of activation between languages. This fMRI technique is relatively new, and can reveal differences in similar activation patterns which were previously unmeasurable. For example, a previous study looking at reading in bilingual individuals used RSA to show distinct activation patterns in regions which handle visual word recognition when participants read text in each language. Here, the team hoped to apply this same method to probe brain activity during auditory, rather than visual, word recognition.</p>



<p>As expected, both English and Mandarin produced activity in an extensive network of language-related regions. When the team looked within those regions that were active for both languages, there were no overall significant differences in activation depending on language. However, the story changed when the team looked in more detail at the effects of AoA and proficiency on the levels of activation.</p>



<p>These analyses revealed that there were differences in how the two languages were represented, which could be predicted by AoA and proficiency. For example, people with a wider difference in first and second language proficiency showed more dissimilar patterns of activation in areas such as the left inferior fusiform gyrus and bilateral supramarginal gyrus, which are involved in articulation and auditory-motor integration, respectively. The more similar the proficiency between the two languages, the more similar the activation pattern. Likewise, the older the AoA, the more distinct the patterns of activation between first and second languages were.</p>



<p>In addition, results showed several areas that were more active in those with younger AoAs — the right insula, the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and the area prostriata of the calcarine sulcus. However, the relationship between these regions and bilingual auditory word recognition is less clear. It’s likely that differences in activation in these areas, at least in part, represent differences in the ability to inhibit other language responses. But, further research is needed to disentangle exactly what these differences mean, and how they relate to AoA.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there was also a distinct dissimilarity between participants with lower second language proficiency and those who acquired their second language later in ventral visual areas, which handle object recognition and concept representation. This, the authors suggest, is indicative that language can likely affect our perceptions of what we’re looking at. This idea isn’t totally unheard of, either — <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00054/full">previous research</a> outlining the label-feedback hypothesis also highlighted that variations in language can alter our ability to categorise, discriminate between, and even detect objects.</p>



<p>These findings not only support the current model of an integrated language system in bilinguals, but they extend our understanding of how individual differences dictate language representations within the brain. Future research to verify that these patterns are consistent across languages, or whether they vary by language similarity, are likely to give us a greater understanding of whether these results are in part due to the large differences between English and Mandarin. Research using RSA which looks into the effect grammar may have on differences in brain activation is also a topic for investigation. As it stands, this study represents a new and exciting approach for disentangling finer differences in how the brain represents and utilises first and second languages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physics-2021-complex-systems-climate">Work on complex systems, including Earth’s climate, wins the physics Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s climate is a vastly complex system on a grand scale. On a microscopic level, so is the complicated physics of atoms and molecules found within materials. The 2021 Nobel Prize in physics knits together the work of three scientists who illuminated such intricate physical systems by harnessing basic tools of physics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of the prize goes to climate scientists Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, for their work on simulations of Earth’s climate and predictions of global warming, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 5. The other half of the 10 million Swedish kronor (more than $1.1 million) prize goes to physicist Giorgio Parisi of Sapienza University of Rome, who worked on understanding the roiling fluctuations within disordered materials.</p>



<p>All three researchers used a similar strategy of isolating a specific piece of a complex system in a model, a mathematical representation of something found in nature. By studying that model, and then integrating that understanding into more complicated descriptions, the researchers made progress on understanding otherwise perplexing systems, says physicist Brad Marston of Brown University. “There’s an art to constructing a model that is rich enough to give you interesting and perhaps surprising results, but simple enough that you can hope to understand it.”</p>





<p>The prize, normally an apolitical affair, sends a message to world leaders: “The notion of global warming is resting on solid science,” said Göran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, during the announcement of the prize winners. Human emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, have increased Earth’s average temperature by more than 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times. That warming is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">affecting every region on Earth</a>, exacerbating extreme weather events such as heat waves, wildfires and drought (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="340" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3104316" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104316">Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University (left) and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (right) worked on early simulations of Earth’s climate, laying the foundation for today’s more detailed climate models that are used to grapple with the potential impacts of global warming.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104316">From left: Bengt Nyman/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0); Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Manabe’s work laid the foundation for climate modeling, said John Wettlaufer of Yale University, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics. “He really did construct the models from which all future climate models were built,” Wettlaufer explained during an interview after the prize announcement. “That scaffolding is essential for the improvement of predictions of climate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manabe studied how rising carbon dioxide levels would change temperatures on Earth. A <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/24/3/1520-0469_1967_024_0241_teotaw_2_0_co_2.xml">simplified climate model</a> from a 1967 paper coauthored by Manabe simulated a single column of the atmosphere in which air masses rise and fall as they warm and cool, which revealed that doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased the temperature by over 2 degrees C. This understanding could then be integrated into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/computing-link-between-sea-and-air">more complex models</a> that simulated the entire atmosphere or included the effects of the oceans, for example (<em>SN: 5/30/70</em>). </p>





<p>“I never imagined that this thing I would begin to study had such huge consequences,” Manabe said at a news conference at Princeton. “I was doing it just because of my curiosity.”</p>



<p>Hasselmann studied the evolution of Earth’s climate while taking into account the variety of timescales over which different processes operate. The randomness of daily weather stands in contrast to seasonal variations and much slower processes like gradual heating of the Earth’s oceans. Hassleman’s work helped to show how the short-term jitter could be incorporated into models to understand the long-term change in climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prize is an affirmation of scientists’ understanding of climate, says Michael Moloney, CEO of the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Md. “The climate models which we depend on in order to understand the impact of the climate crisis are world-class science up there with all the other great discoveries that are recognized [by] Nobel Prizes of years past.”</p>

<p>Much like the weather patterns on Earth, the inner world of atoms within materials can be complex and disorderly. Parisi’s work took aim at understanding the processes within disordered systems such as a type of material called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changes-mathematical-state">spin glass</a> (<em>SN: 10/18/02</em>). In spin glasses, atoms behave like small magnets, due to a quantum property called spin. But the atoms can’t agree on which direction to point their magnets, resulting in a disordered arrangement. </p>



<p>That’s similar to more familiar types of glass — a material in which atoms don’t reach an orderly arrangement. Parisi came up with a mathematical description for such spin glasses. His work also touches on a variety of other complex topics, from turbulence to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-turns-match-math-quantum-matter">flocking patterns</a> that describe the motions of animals such as starlings (<em>SN: 7/31/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although his work doesn’t directly focus on climate, in an interview during the Nobel announcement, Parisi commented on that half of the prize: “It’s clear that for the future generation we have to act now in a very fast way.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radiometric-dating-history-carbon-century-science">Radiometric dating puts pieces of the past in context. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a researcher picks up an object — whether it’s a scrap of leather from a dig site, a fossil from a museum drawer or a newly fallen meteorite — their first question might be, “What is this thing?” A natural follow-up: “How old is it?” The first question is fundamental, no doubt. But the second is powerful, too. It helps place the object in its proper archaeological, geologic or cosmological context. “Without knowing the ages of things, there is no narrative,” says Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Up until a century or so ago, researchers studying rocks and the fossils they contain could answer the age question only vaguely if at all. Using guidelines established by geologists in the 1600s, they could gauge a rock’s age only in relative terms: For example, Sample A was considered older than Sample B if it came from a lower and presumed older layer of sediment or rock. But Earth is a dynamic place. Missing layers, as well as disturbances from earthquakes, landslides or other upheavals, meant even relative ages for rocks could be difficult to determine. Ditto for the bones, tools and other artifacts within the earth: Previous excavations, or even the day-to-day activities of a site’s ancient residents, could churn the soil and thus disrupt the layers.</p>

<p>The discovery of radioactivity in the mid-1890s paved the way for scientists to ascertain the absolute ages of some objects, says Doug Macdougall, a geochemist formerly at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the author of <em>Nature’s Clocks</em>. Within less than a decade, he notes, several physicists had proposed methods for doing so. The methods are based on the finding that each type, or isotope, of a radioactive atom has its own particular half-life — the time that it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay. Because radioactive decay occurs in the nucleus of the atom, half-life doesn’t change with environmental conditions, from the hellish heat and crushing pressures deep inside Earth to the frigid realm of the far solar system. That makes radioactive isotopes wonderful clocks.</p>



<p>Today, radiometric dating spans the ages, from recent times to the birth of our solar system. Carbon-14 dating is most suited to something that lived during the last 50,000 years or something made from such organisms — the wooden shafts of arrows, the leather in a moccasin or the plant fibers used to weave fabrics or baskets. Longer-lived isotopes of uranium and thorium can help peer deep into Earth’s past — back to when our planet’s first rocks were forming, or even further, to when our solar system was coalescing from gas and dust.</p>



<p>There are several different methods for estimating ages using half-lives, Macdougall explains. For isotopes with relatively rapid decay rates, researchers determine the proportion of a radioactive isotope relative to other atoms of the same element and compare it with how much of that isotope a fresh sample would be expected to have. With that information, along with the known half-life, it’s possible to estimate the age of the original sample.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="371" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1.jpg" alt="composite image of 5,500-year-old shoe, with close-ups on laces and heel" class="wp-image-3103879" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1-330x180.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103879">With radiocarbon dating, this leather shoe, well-preserved in a cave in Armenia, was determined to be 5,500 years old.

<p>This approach works well for carbon-14, possibly one of the most familiar isotopes used in radiometric dating. While a plant or animal is alive, it takes in carbon from the environment. But when the organism dies, that intake stops. Because carbon-14 is created high in Earth’s atmosphere at a fairly constant rate, scientists can readily estimate the amount of that isotope that should be present in a living organism.</p>



<p>Carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5,730 years — which means that 5,730 years after an organism dies, half of the isotope present in the original sample will have decayed. After another 5,730 years, half of the carbon-14 that remained has decayed (leaving one-fourth of the amount from the original sample). Eventually, after 50,000 years or so (or almost nine half-lives), so little carbon-14 remains that the sample can’t be reliably dated.</p>



<p>Besides carbon-14, this technique can be used for short-lived isotopes of sulfur, silicon, phosphorus and beryllium, Macdougall says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="457" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2.jpg" alt="portion of Egyptian coffin depicting a human face" class="wp-image-3103880" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2-570x383.jpg 570w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2-670x450.jpg 670w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline2-277x186.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103880">Chemist Willard Libby tested this wood from an ancient Egyptian coffin and other artifacts during his development of radiocarbon dating.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103880">Jean Lachat/University of Chicago</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another method is more suitable for isotopes with long half-lives (and therefore slow rates of decay), Macdougall says. In this approach, scientists measure the amount of a particular isotope in a sample and then compare that with the amounts of various “daughter products” that form as the isotope decays. By taking the ratios of those amounts — or even the ratios of amounts of daughter products alone — and then “running the clock backward,” researchers can estimate when radioactive decay first began (that is, when the object formed).</p>



<p>Scientists still have to be careful. A radiometric clock can be “reset” if either the original isotope or its daughter products are lost to the environment. Robust crystals called zircons, for example, are long-lasting and present in many rocks. But extreme temperatures can drive lead, a daughter product of radioactive uranium and thorium, out of the crystal.</p>



<p>Despite the potential challenges, scientists have used radiometric dating to answer all sorts of questions. Researchers used lead-lead dating — which looks at two lead isotopes, both daughter products of a uranium isotope — to analyze an inclusion inside an ancient meteorite; in 2010, they reported that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solar-system-older-estimated">the tiny bleb was about 4.568 billion years old</a>, making it one of the earliest building blocks of our solar system. The team used an aluminum-magnesium dating technique to confirm that great age. Others have used similar techniques to estimate the age of Earth’s oldest known rocks (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/precious-little-gems">about 4.4 billion years</a>) and when plate tectonics might have begun (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plate-tectonics-got-early-start">more than 4 billion years ago</a>, according to one study).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="405" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline3.jpg" alt="Yarrabubba crater in Western Australia" class="wp-image-3103881" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline3-643x383.jpg 643w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline3-312x186.jpg 312w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103881">Yarrabubba crater in Western Australia dates to 2.2 billion years ago, according to recent radiometric dating, making it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-crater-is-earth-oldest-recorded-meteorite-impact">the site of the oldest known meteorite impact</a>.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103881">T.M. ERICKSON</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And even though some of these techniques are estimating ages billions of years in the past, “they can do so with error bars of only 100,000 years or so,” says Marc Caffee, a physicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. “I marvel at the precision these chronometers have,” he adds.</p>



<p>Dating techniques that rely on isotopes with half-lives measured in millions of years can be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quick-bite-some-gorges-carved-surprisingly-fast">estimate long-term rates of erosion</a> — to help gauge how quickly a canyon was carved, for example — or to infer the onset of glacial activity during recent ice ages.</p>



<p>At least half a dozen radiometric dating techniques can be applied to the last few million years when humans and our kin evolved, says Potts. For example, by using argon-argon dating to pin down the age of tiny crystals in ancient layers of volcanic ash — crystals that had formed during the eruptions themselves — researchers have estimated that the <em>Australopithecus</em> dubbed Lucy lived about 3.18 million years ago. Today’s archaeologists and paleontologists also benefit from another half dozen or so absolute dating techniques beyond radiometric approaches, expanding the types of materials that can be dated, Potts says.</p>



<p>Advances in techniques over time have let researchers analyze increasingly smaller and smaller samples. That, in turn, is less destructive of rare — or even one-of-a-kind — artifacts or fossils. Whereas once researchers had to destroy large samples of material to perform an analysis, “now we can date a single kernel of maize,” says Ryan Williams, an anthropological archaeologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.</p>

<p>Other advances, which have made radiometric dating techniques cheaper and more precise, send researchers back to the lab to reanalyze artifacts, says Suzanne Pilaar Birch, an archaeologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. And more samples and more precision yield more refined chronologies. By radiocarbon dating nearly 100 samples from a mountaintop site in southern Peru, for instance, Williams and his colleagues determined that the site was occupied for more than four centuries.</p>



<p>The results of all this dating, Pilaar Birch notes, are “changing our understanding of the past.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Anyone who has worked from home will probably be familiar with the miserable, draining feeling of having spent too much time on Zoom. Such is the pressure of all-day-every-day video calling that some companies have even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/24/zoom-refuseniks-why-companies-are-banning-constant-video-calls">announced</a> Zoom-free Fridays to give employees a little time away from their screens.</p>



<p>The fact that video-calling is tiring, then, will not be news to many of us. But a new study in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology </em>explores in more detail who is affected the most, finding that both gender and length of time spent within an organisation both impact fatigue. And this suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to combatting video call burnout may not work for everyone.</p>



<span id="more-44030"></span>



<p>Participants were recruited from a company with a largely remote workforce, used to online meetings even before the pandemic. The company has a camera-optional policy, with around 50% of staff turning their cameras off before the study started. Over nineteen working days, participants were asked to participate in meetings with cameras either on or off for two weeks before switching to the opposite option for the following two weeks.</p>



<p>Every day after work they also completed measures assessing how fatigued they had felt during the day, how engaged they had felt in meetings, and whether or not they felt they had a voice in the meetings.</p>



<p>The results showed that having cameras turned on did indeed make participants feel more fatigued. And this had a knock-on effect. Those who were more fatigued also felt less like they had a voice in their meetings, and felt less engaged.</p>



<p>Gender and length of time at the organisation also had an impact. The relationship between having the camera turned on and fatigue was stronger for women than men, and for those who were new to an organisation compared to those who had been there for a longer time. The indirect impact on voice and engagement was also stronger in women than in men and in newer than older employees.</p>



<p>These results confirm that video calling with a camera on can cause people to feel fatigued, leading them to incur other costs in terms of voice and engagement in meetings. The study also suggests that certain demographics are more likely to have such experiences, potentially affecting their performance and comfort in the workplace.</p>



<p>The team hypothesise that these penalties are incurred due to issues around self-presentation — that is, that being or feeling &#8220;watched&#8221; increases the need to manage others’ impressions and “directs our focus inwards”, tiring us out.  Women and new hires may be particularly prone to anxious self-presentation because of existing appearance standards and a heightened need to appear competent and effective.</p>



<p>The team also notes that other forms of camera — those placed at different angles, for example — may reduce this fatiguing effect; it would also be interesting to see whether having the camera on but hiding the feed from your own screen has similarly negative effects. It would also be worth exploring the long-term impact of Zoom fatigue on general wellbeing.</p>



<p>There may also be <em>positive</em> impacts of having your camera on. People may feel more connected with others when they turn their video on; they may feel more comfortable when presenting; or they may contribute more confidently in meetings. And there may be a secondary positive impact — being in a meeting with <em>others</em> with their camera on could be more reassuring or connecting than one where everyone else’s camera is off. These are all questions that could be addressed in future research.</p>



<p>Overall, however, it seems that employers could benefit from allowing staff to take a flexible approach to turning cameras on, even switching to phone calls or audio-only options if desired by workers. While turning cameras off may have other costs (an inability to see facial expressions, for example), allowing workers to decide what works best for them will likely improve their experience at work.</p>

<html><body><p>Researchers rely on access to scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research, for purposes of verification, replication and reanalysis, to guide future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Depositing data in a repository (as opposed to offering it upon request, or publishing as Supporting Information) further prevents data loss, improves discoverability, and removes barriers to replication and reuse. <strong>For all these reasons, <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is excited to introduce a new technology solution that makes depositing data simpler and more accessible for our authors.</strong></p>



<h2>Announcing a<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> / Dryad Integration</h2>



<p>As part of a one-year trial beginning <strong>October 5, 2021</strong>, <em>PLOS Pathogens </em>authors now have the option to upload their data files directly to <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/">Dryad Digital Repository</a> during manuscript submission or revision&mdash;without even leaving our submission system. It takes just minutes to upload a dataset and receive a unique, citable Dryad DOI. If a manuscript is accepted for publication, the associated dataset will undergo Dryad&rsquo;s screening and curatorial process and become public on the site, with links to and from the published research article. Datasets that are part of the trial will be hosted in perpetuity at no cost to authors. Thanks to a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">grant from the Wellcome Trust</a>, we&rsquo;ll be seeking to deeply understand the experience<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/"> </a>researchers have with this new solution, and will share what we learn with the community.</p>



<h2>Making data deposition free &amp; easy</h2>



<p>Data repositories like Dryad offer <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#dryad">important advantages</a>, including data preservation and tracking, facilitating reproducibility, demonstrating rigor, and attracting citations. This integration offers a simple, intuitive interface that makes depositing data with Dryad a part of our authors&rsquo; normal submission workflow. The process is no more challenging than uploading data as Supporting Information, but much more effective as a vehicle for sharing. The year-long trial will show whether a more streamlined process inspires authors to take advantage of the benefits of a data repository.</p>



<h2>What comes next</h2>



<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is among the first journals in our field to offer this new service. We look forward to sharing the outcomes of the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> / Dryad Integration trial with the research and scientific publishing communities, and we welcome your feedback on your experience, both as a submitting author, and a reader referencing deposited datasets.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging based on two-photon scanning microscopy is a standard method to record the activity of neurons in the living brain. Due to the point-scanning approach, sampling speed is limited and the dwell time on a single neuron reduces with the number of recorded neurons. Therefore, one needs to trade off the number of quasi-simultaneously imaged neurons versus the shot noise level of these recordings.</p>



<p>To give an simplified example, one can distribute the laser power in space and time over 100 neurons at 30 Hz, or 1000 neurons at 3 Hz. Due to the lower sampling rate, the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the 1000 neurons will decrease as well.</p>

<p>To compare the shot noise levels across recordings, in our recent paper (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5">Rupprecht et al., 2021</a>) we took advantage of the fact that the slow calcium signal is typically very similar between adjacent frames. Therefore, the noise level can be estimated by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu++%3D+%5Cfrac%7BMedian_t+%5Cmid+%5CDelta+F%2FF_%7Bt%2B1%7D+-+%5CDelta+F%2FF_t+%5Cmid%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bf_r%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu  = &#92;frac{Median_t &#92;mid &#92;Delta F/F_{t+1} - &#92;Delta F/F_t &#92;mid}{&#92;sqrt{f_r}}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>The median makes sure to exclude outliers that stem from the fast onset dynamics of calcium signals. The normalization by the square root of the frame rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_r" class="latex" /> renders the metric comparable across datasets with different frame rates.</p>



<p>Why the square root? Because shot noise decreases with the number of sampling points <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise">with a square root dependecy</a>. The only downside of this measure is that the units seem a bit arbitrary (% for dF/F, divided by the square root of seconds), but this does not make it less useful. To compute it on a raw dF/F trace, simple use this simple one-liner in Matlab:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">noise_level = median(abs(diff(dFF_trace)))/sqrt(framerate)</pre>



<p>Or in Python:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">import numpy as np
noise_level = np.median(np.abs(np.diff(dFF_trace)))/np.sqrt(framerate)</pre>



<p>If you want to know more about this metric, check out the Methods part of our paper on more details (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">bioRxiv</a> / <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5#Sec13">Nature Neuroscience</a>, subsection &#8220;Computation of noise levels&#8221;).</p>



<p>The metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> comes in handy if you want to compare the shot noise levels between calcium imaging datasets and understand whether noise levels are relatively high or low. So, what is a &#8220;high&#8221; noise level?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Comparison of noise levels and neuron numbers across datasets</strong></p>



<p>I collected a couple of publicly available datasets (links and descriptions in the appendix of the blog post) and extracted both the numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons and the shot noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />. Each data point stands for one animal, except for the MICrONS dataset, where each dataset stands for a separate session in the same animal.</p>

<p>As a reference, I used the Allen Brain Institute Visual Coding dataset. For excitatory neurons, typically 100-200 neurons were recording with a standard noise level of 1 (units omitted for simplicity). If you distribute the photons across an increasing number of neurons, the shot noise levels should increase with the square root of this multiple (indicated by the black line). Datasets with inhibitory neurons (de Vries et al., red) have by experimental design fewer neurons and therefore lie above the line.</p>



<p>A dataset that I recorded in zebrafish with typically 800-1500 neuron per recording lies pretty much on this line, similar to the MICrONS dataset where they used a mesoscope to record from several thousand cortical neurons simultaneously, at the cost of lower frame rate and therefore higher noise levels, similar to the dataset by Sofroniew et al., which recorded ca. 3000 neurons, but all from one plane in a large FOV.</p>



<p>Two datasets acquired by Pachitariu and colleagues stands out a bit by pushing the number of simultaneously recorded neurons. In 2018, this came at the expense of increased noise levels (pink). In 2019 (a single mouse; grey), despite a dataset with ca. 20,000 simultaneously recorded neurons, the noise level was impressively low.</p>



<p>In regular experiments, in order to mitigate possible laser-induced photodamage or problems due to overexpression of indicators, noise levels should not be maximized at the cost of physiological damage. For example, the mouse from the MICrONS dataset was later used for dense EM reconstruction; any sort of damage to the tissue, which might be invisible at first glance, could complicate subsequent diffusive penetration with heavy metals or the cutting of nanometer-thick slices. As a bottom line, there are often good reasons not to go for the highest signal yield.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Spike inference for high noise levels</strong></p>



<p>To give an idea about the noise level, here is an example for the MICrONS dataset. Due to the noisiness of the recordings (noise level of ca. 8-9), only large transients can be reliably detected. I used <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">spike inference through CASCADE</a> to de-noise the recording. It is also clear from this example that CASCADE extracts useful information, but won&#8217;t be able to recover anything close to single-spike precision for such a noise level.</p>

<p>Above are shown the smooth inferred spike rates (orange) and also the discrete inferred spikes (black). The discrete spikes (black) are nice to look at, but due to the high noise levels, the discretization into binary spikes is mostly overfitting to noise and should be avoided for real analyses. For analyses, I would use the inferred spike rate (orange).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> can be used to quantitatively compare noise levels across recordings. I hope that other people can use this noise level metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> for their work.</p>



<p>As a note of caution, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />  should never be the sole criterion for data quality. Other factors like neuropil contamination, spatial resolution, movement artifacts, potential downsides of over-expression, etc. also play important roles. Low shot noise levels is not a guarantee for anything. However, high shot noise levels on the other hand are always undesirable.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Appendix: Details about the data shown in the scatter plot</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0550-9">de Vries et al. (2020; red and black)</a> describes the Allen Visual Coding Observatory dataset. It includes recordings from more than 100 mice with different transgenic backgrounds in different layers of visual-related cortices. Red dots are datasets from mice that only expressed calcium indicators in interneurons, while black dot are datasets with cortical principal neurons of different layers. The datasets are highly standardized and of low shot noise levels (standardized level of ca. 1.0), with relatively few neurons per dataset (100-200).</p>



<p>Rupprecht et al. (unpublished; green) is a small dataset in transgenic Thy-1 mice in hippocampal CA1 that I recorded as a small pilot earlier this year. The number of manually selected neurons is around 400-500, at a standardized noise level of 2.0-3.0. With virally induced expression and with higher laser power (here, I used only 20 mW), lower noise levels and higher cell counts could be easily achieved in CA1.</p>



<p><a href="https://rdcu.be/creIt">Rupprecht et al. (2021; violet)</a> is a dataset using the small dye indicator OGB-1 injected in the homolog of olfactory cortex in adult zebrafish. At low laser powers of ca. 30 mW, 800-1500 neurons were recorded simultaneously at a standardized noise level of 2.0-4.0.</p>



<p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/14472">Sofroniew et al. (2016; light green)</a> recorded a bit more than 3000 neurons simultaneously at a relatively low imaging rate (1.96 Hz). Different from all other datasets with &gt;1000 neurons shown in the plot, they recorded only from one single but very large field of view. All neuronal ROIs had been drawn manually, which I really appreciate.</p>



<p><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Recordings_of_ten_thousand_neurons_in_visual_cortex_in_response_to_2_800_natural_images/6845348">Pachitariu et al. (2018; pink)</a> is a dataset recorded at a relatively low imaging rate (2.5 Hz), covering ca. 10,000 neurons simultaneously. The standardized noise level seems to be rather high according to my calculations.</p>



<p><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Recording_of_19_000_neurons_across_mouse_visual_cortex_during_sparse_noise_stimuli/9505250">Pachitariu et al. (2019; black)</a> is a similar dataset that contains ca. 20,000 neurons, but at a much lower standardized noise level (4.0-5.0). The improvement compared to the 2018 dataset was later explained by Marius Pachitariu in <a href="https://twitter.com/marius10p/status/1445758640044924942">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-data">MICrONS et al. (2021; red)</a> is a dataset from a single mouse, each dot representing a different session. 8 imaging planes were recorded simultaneously at laser powers that would not damage the tissue, in order to preserve the brain for later slicing, with the ultimate goal to image the ultrastructure using electron microscopes. The number of simultaneously imaged neurons comes close to 10,000, resulting in a relatively high standardized noise level of 7.0-10.0.</p>



<p>The black line indicates how the noise level scales with the number of neurons. For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_1+%3D+150&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_1 = 150" class="latex" /> neurons (Allen dataset, de Vries et al.), a standardized noise level of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu_1+%3D+1.0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu_1 = 1.0" class="latex" /> can be assumed. For higher numbers of neurons <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_2" class="latex" />, the noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu_2" class="latex" /> scales with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu_2+%3D+%5Cnu_1%2A%5Csqrt%7Bn_2%2Fn_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu_2 = &#92;nu_1*&#92;sqrt{n_2/n_1}" class="latex" />.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-severe-depression-activity-stimulation">A custom brain implant lifted a woman’s severe depression</a></h4>

              
                <p>A personalized brain implant eased the crushing symptoms of a woman’s severe depression, allowing her to once again see the beauty of the world. “It’s like my lens on the world changed,” said Sarah, the research volunteer who requested to be identified by her first name only.</p>



<p>The technology, described October 4 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>, brings researchers closer to understanding how to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality">detect and change brain activity</a> in ultraprecise ways (<em>SN: 2/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>The device was bespoke; it was built specifically for Sarah’s brain. The details of the new system may not work as a treatment for many other people, says Alik Widge, a psychiatrist and neural engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Still, the research is “a really significant piece of work,” he says, because it points out a way to study how brain activity goes awry in depression.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco implanted temporary thin wire electrodes into Sarah’s brain. The 36-year-old woman had suffered from severe depression for years. These electrodes allowed researchers to monitor the brain activity that corresponded to Sarah’s depression symptoms — a pattern that the researchers could use as a biomarker, a signpost of trouble to come. In Sarah’s case, a particular sign emerged: a fast brain wave called a gamma wave in her amygdala, a brain structure known to be involved in emotions.&nbsp;</p>





<p>With this biomarker in hand, the researchers then figured out where to stimulate the brain to interrupt Sarah’s distressing symptoms. A region called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, seemed to be the key. That’s not surprising; previous research suggests the region is involved with feeling good and other emotions. When researchers applied tiny jolts of electrical current to this region, Sarah’s mood improved. “We could learn the road map of Sarah’s brain in a way that we could really improve her depression symptoms,” Katherine Scangos of UCSF said in a Sept. 30 news briefing.</p>



<p>During this mapping phase of the experiment, Sarah felt joy when the right spot was stimulated. “I laughed out loud,” she said in the briefing. “This was the first time I had spontaneously laughed and smiled where it wasn’t faked or forced in five years.”</p>

This process allows her clinicians to find the most effective dose, duration and location of her deep brain stimulation.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104281">Maurice Ramirez/UCSF 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Surgeons then implanted a more permanent device into Sarah’s brain last June. Scientists programmed the device to detect when gamma signals were high in Sarah’s amygdala, and respond with a tiny jolt to her VC/VS. This happened about 300 times a day. The stimulation was calibrated so Sarah didn’t feel any zaps, but she said they left her feeling a little more energetic.</p>



<p>The research paper describes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01480-w">Sarah’s improvements as the technology did its work</a> in her head over two months; it’s unclear how long the benefits might last, though she’s now had the device implanted for over a year. “As time has gone on, it’s been this virtuous cycle, a spiral upwards,” Sarah said. “Everything has gotten easier and easier and easier.”</p>



<p>The approach used by the UCSF researchers required a lot of sophisticated imaging and machine learning technology. That complexity may prevent it from being a wider treatment, cautions Helen Mayberg, a neurologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>



<p>Still, the results — which add to a variety of ways to detect and change problematic brain activity — contain valuable information about how depression takes hold of a brain, and how brain stimulation can change that, says Mayberg, whose research has helped build and refine the field of deep brain stimulation for mood disorders. “What we all want to know is, ‘How does this work?’”</p>

                <p>Mistakes happen — especially in quantum computers. The fragile quantum bits, or qubits, that make up the machines are notoriously error-prone, but now scientists have shown that they can fix the flubs.</p>



<p>Computers that harness the rules of quantum mechanics show promise for making <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">calculations</a> far out of reach for standard computers (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>). But without a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">mechanism for fixing the computers’ mistakes</a>, the answers that a quantum computer spits out could be gobbledygook (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Combining the power of multiple qubits into one can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03928-y">solve the error woes</a>, researchers report October 4 in <em>Nature</em>. Scientists used nine qubits to make a single, improved qubit called a logical qubit, which, unlike the individual qubits from which it was made, can be probed to check for mistakes.</p>



<p>“This is a key demonstration on the path to build a large-scale quantum computer,” says quantum physicist Winfried Hensinger of the University of Sussex in&nbsp;Brighton, England, who was not involved in the new study.</p>





<p>Still, that path remains a long one, Hensinger says. To do complex calculations, scientists will have to dramatically scale up the number of qubits in the machines. But now that scientists have shown that they can keep errors under control, he says, “there’s nothing fundamentally stopping us to build a useful quantum computer.”</p>



<p>In a logical qubit, information is stored redundantly. That allows researchers to check and fix mistakes in the data. “If a piece of it goes missing, you can reconstruct it from the other pieces, like Voldemort,” says quantum physicist David Schuster of the University of Chicago, who was not involved with the new research. (The <em>Harry Potter</em> villain kept his soul safe by concealing it in multiple objects called Horcruxes.)</p>



<p>In the new study, four additional, auxiliary qubits interfaced with the logical qubit, in order to identify errors in its data. Future quantum computers could make calculations using logical qubits in place of the original, faulty qubits, repeatedly checking and fixing any errors that crop up.</p>



<p>To make their logical qubit, the researchers used a technique called a Bacon-Shor code, applying it to qubits made of ytterbium ions hovering above an ion-trapping chip inside a vacuum, which are manipulated with lasers. The researchers also designed sequences of operations so that errors don’t multiply uncontrollably, what’s known as “fault tolerance.”</p>



<p>Thanks to those efforts, the new logical qubit had a lower error rate than that of the most flawed components that made it up, says quantum physicist Christopher Monroe of the University of Maryland in College Park and Duke University.</p>



<p>However, the team didn’t quite complete the full process envisioned for error correction. While the computer detected the errors that arose, the researchers didn’t correct the mistakes and continue on with computation. Instead, they fixed errors after the computer was finished. In a full-fledged example, scientists would detect and correct errors multiple times on the fly.</p>



<p>Demonstrating quantum error correction is a necessity for building useful quantum computers. “It’s like achieving criticality with [nuclear] fission,” Schuster says. Once that nuclear science barrier <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/anniversary-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction">was passed in 1942</a>, it led to technologies like nuclear power and atomic bombs (<em>SN: 11/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>As quantum computers gradually draw closer to practical usefulness, companies are investing in the devices. Technology companies such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computing-steps-forward-50-qubit-prototype">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">Intel</a> host major quantum computing endeavors. On October 1, a quantum computing company cofounded by Monroe, <a href="https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2021-ionq-listed-on-nyse">called IonQ</a>, went public; Monroe spoke to <em>Science News</em> while on a road trip to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>



<p>The new result suggests that full-fledged quantum error correction is almost here, says coauthor Kenneth Brown, a quantum engineer also at Duke University. “It really shows that we can get all the pieces together and do all the steps.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-2021-physiology-medicine-julius-patapoutian-temperature-touch">Discovering how we sense temperature and touch wins the 2021 medicine Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some touching research took the 2021 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. David Julius of the University of California, San Francisco and Ardem Patapoutian of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., were awarded the prize October 4 for their research to identify sensors on nerve cells that detect heat, cold and pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The laureates discovered proteins called receptors that turn the burning heat from chili peppers or a hot stove, menthol’s cooling sensation or the pressure from a hug into nerve signals that can be sent to the brain. Those proteins are crucial to the sense of touch and for feeling pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing basic research on touch is important because “it’s such an elemental function of the nervous system, which is how we react with our environment,” says Walter Koroshetz, director of the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>The temperature sensors warn of danger from fire or extreme cold, said Abdel El Manira, a neuroscientist and a member of the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, which awards the physiology or medicine prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Touch receptors are important for feeling where our body parts are in space. “Without them, we would not be able to stand. We would not be able to touch or feel our surroundings,” El Manira said. “Over the last year, we’ve been social distancing from one another. We have missed the sense of touch, the sense of the warmth we get from one another like during a hug.”</p>



<p>Despite its importance, “touch is perhaps the sense that people take mostly for granted,” Patapoutian said during a news conference.</p>



<p>Scientists had been searching for touch and temperature receptors for many years before Julius and Patapoutian began their work, Koroshetz said. “Everybody knew [the receptors] were there, but nobody could find them,” he says. Then the two laureates came up with some clever ways to probe for the elusive proteins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Julius, a biochemist and molecular physiologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute trustee, used capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their heat, to discover receptor proteins that allow people to feel chili’s burn. At the time, he didn&#8217;t know that the receptor, TRPV1, also responds to heat, he said during a news conference. That discovery came later. </p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the great advances &#8230; in medicine started off with people just following their curiosity, without knowing in advance that they could one day be useful,&#8221; Julius said.</p>



<p>The protein is an ion channel, a type of molecular gate nestled in a cell’s membrane that opens or closes to control the flow of charged atoms or molecules into or out of the cell. In this case, when TRPV1 encounters capsaicin or heat, it opens, allowing charged calcium ions into the cell. That flood of calcium triggers electrical signals that are sent to the brain to warn of hot stuff.</p>



<p>Exactly how small changes in the protein’s shape allow it to communicate to the brain small differences in temperature, such as sensing when a room gets a few degrees warmer than usual, is still a mystery that Julius hopes to solve, he said.</p>



<p>Julius used the winter-fresh compound menthol to uncover TRPM8, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cool-discovery-menthol-triggers-cold-sensing-protein">cold-sensing receptor protein</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/02</em>). Working independently, Patapoutian, a neuroscientist and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator,  simultaneously discovered that receptor.</p>



<p>After spending about a year poking nerve cells in lab dishes, Patapoutian also discovered a receptor protein, PIEZO1, that opens in response to mechanical pressure. That protein, named after the Greek word for pressure, and another called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/main-protein-sensing-touch-identified-mammals">PIEZO2</a> allow people to feel touch (<em>SN: 12/4/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>PIEZO2 is the receptor on nerve cells in the skin called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/role-merkels">Merkel cells that sense light touches</a> and caresses (<em>SN: 6/18/09</em>). It also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/force-detecting-protein-senses-when-lungs-fill-air">helps nerves in the lungs keep the organs from overinflating</a> and is important for bladder and bowel functions (<em>SN: 12/21/16</em>). &nbsp; Children who lack PIEZO2 have balance problems and can’t feel where their limbs are, Koroshetz says. “They have to look to see where their fingers are when they reach out to grab something.”&nbsp; Abnormal pressure sensing may contribute to glaucoma and high blood pressure, too. PIEZO1 also is involved in regulating iron levels in the blood.</p>

<p>Touch and temperature receptors may also be involved in processing pain. But despite the potential for drug development, pharmaceutical companies have struggled to develop new treatments using these channels, says Gary Lewin, whose lab at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin studies the molecular physiology of somatic sensation.</p>



<p>A major stumbling block comes from the fact that drugs targeting TRPV1, the receptor involved in sensing heat, tend to induce fever. Other closely related receptors may be more promising, says Lewin. “Both discoveries really boosted the field of pain research. But we’re really at the beginning — there’s a huge amount still to be discovered.” Treatments based on these receptors could provide an alternative to addictive pain medication, like opioids.</p>



<p>Because the touch receptors are involved in so many body processes, treatments aimed at them will need to be localized, such as with skin patches or delivering medication directly to the affected organ, Patapoutian said.</p>



<p>Julius and Patapoutian will split the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, or more than $1.1 million.</p>



<p>Unlisted numbers and cell phones set on mute meant the Nobel committee had to track down the winners through relatives. Julius learned of the award through a sister-in-law. Patapoutian got a call from his 94-year-old father relaying the message. “I guess even if you have ‘do not disturb’ [on], people in your favorites can still call you,” he said. “It ended up being a very special moment.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>You may be aware of misophonia — an automatic, intense hatred of certain types of sounds, such as chewing, tapping, and breathing, to name a few. Misophonia entered mainstream awareness relatively recently, but hot on its heels is an extremely similar condition which relates not to sound, but to movement: misokinesia.</p>



<p>There are several well-established online support groups for those who relate to having strong negative affective responses to certain types of stimuli — typically small, repetitive movements, such as leg shaking or finger tapping. And, while it appears to be widespread, there has been a lack of dedicated research into the phenomenon — until now.</p>



<p>To properly introduce this under-recognised condition, Sumeet Jaswal and her colleagues based at the University of British Columbia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4">recently published a set of studies</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> which aimed to establish key facts about the prevalence of misokinesia and what may cause it.</p>



<span id="more-44013"></span>



<p>In order to get a feel for the prevalence of misokinesia, as well as the viability of future studies, the team first conducted a pilot study. A total of 2751 undergraduates from the university’s psychology department were recruited for an online study in which they were asked two yes/no questions. The first, which aimed to measure the prevalence of misokinesia sensitivities, asked: “<em>Do you ever have strong negative feelings, thoughts, or physical reactions when seeing or viewing other peoples&#8217; fidgeting or repetitive movements (e.g., seeing someone&#8217;s foot shaking, fingers tapping, or gum chewing)?” </em>The second question was similar, but instead probed the sounds made by these kinds of actions; common triggers for the sound-related misophonia.</p>



<p>In total, 38.8% of students responded that yes, they did experience the described sensitivity to certain movements. The prevalence of misophonia sensitivites appeared to be higher, with 51.1% of students reporting that they related to the given description. Interestingly, female participants reported misokinesia sensitivities significantly more than their male counterparts (43.1% vs 24.7%, respectively), and there was a high level of overlap between those who reported sensitivity to sounds and movements. Similar patterns are seen in clinical populations with misophonia, which the authors interpreted to indicate the validity of their pair of questions.</p>



<p>This potentially high prevalence was taken as a green light to proceed to two more in-depth studies, the first of which looked at confirming these sensitivity prevalence rates and extending into two areas: the individual differences in misokinesia, and whether there was an association with heightened visual-attentional sensitivities.</p>



<p>In order to measure the presence of misokinesia sensitivities, which as of yet has no standardised measure, the researchers repurposed the previously established Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MpAQ) to measure sensitivity to visual, rather than auditory, stimuli. Both this Misokinesia Assessment Questionnaire (MkAQ) and the MpAQ were completed by 689 participants, alongside two measures of behavioural attention.</p>



<p>The first of these attentional measures asked participants to detect a target at a fixation point while ignoring brief moving distractor stimuli in the peripheries. This gave the team an idea of how well participants could &#8220;block out&#8221; distractions to their attention. The second test of attention, in contrast, measured how well participants were able to attend to stimuli in to their peripheries.</p>



<p>Analyses found that a huge 60.3% of the sample for this study experienced misokinesia sensitivities to some extent, in line with the estimates provided by the pilot study, and the team classified about one third of participants as having “high” misokinesia sensitivies. When it came to misophonia, 70.8% of participants experienced some level of sensitivities, and 37.8% had scores indicative of both misokinesia and misophonia, further suggesting co-morbidity between the two conditions.</p>



<p>However, the results of the attentional tasks provided no evidence that people with misokinesia show any differences from the control group in visuospatial attention. These participants were no more easily distracted by movement in their peripheries and were just as able to orient attention to items in the peripheries as those without misokinesia sensitivities.</p>



<p>In all, data collected in this first study suggest that misokinesia is a widespread phenomenon within non-clinical populations. The wide range in scores on the MkAQ suggest that it is not necessarily a binary phenomenon, but may be a spectrum with many individuals experiencing mild sensitivities, and others, much more intrusive ones. It also appears that reflexive visual attention is not a particular issue for those with misokinesia.</p>



<p>The second study in this paper looked at prevalence of misokinesia senstitivies in an older, more diverse population of 765 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk).</p>



<p>In total, 38.1% of female participants and 35.3% or male participants responded <em>yes</em> to the same misokinesia question used in the first study, while 69.3% of females and 76.6% of males had MkAQ scores indicative of what this study determined to be low to high levels of misokinesia sensitivites. In fact, a massive 67.3% had scores suggesting high levels of misokinesia — many more than in the first study.</p>



<p>These findings suggest that misokinesia is not only prevalent within the wider population (or, at least in those with an MTurk account), but also that the severity of sensitivity may increase with age, or differ by sex or ethnicity. This may be addressed in future research in other demographics that are less strongly White and male.</p>



<p>This paper paints a picture of misokinesia being quite prevalent in the general population. The authors are also keen to emphasise that while their studies into visual attention showed null results, differences in visual attention among this population could still exist. It’s possible that those who experience misokinesia are well practiced at controlling their visual attention, which may have made their performances more typical, or that the stimuli included weren’t appropriate for measuring the condition. It’s also possible that, given the relatively prevalent co-morbidity with misophonia, those sudden negative reactions to movement may be tied to heightened reactivity. Some misophonia research has also pointed towards the possibility that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/17/excessive-mirroring-could-explain-why-people-with-misophonia-react-strongly-to-sounds-of-chewing-or-drinking/">“over-mirroring” in the brain’s motor areas may be the root cause of discomfort for suffers</a>; it’s possible that misokinesia may stem from this, too. These are all potentially fruitful avenues for future research.</p>



<p>As this is a newly established topic, the measures used within these studies were somewhat exploratory, and are likely to have slightly suboptimal levels of validity. For example, it is unknown whether the MpQA’s adaptation into the MkQA really captures the experience of misokinesia. Additionally, in this study the cut-off points to classify people as having “no”, “low”, and “high” misokinesia were chosen so as to divide participants into three relatively equal groups; these thresholds of severity will require further study to verify. Further explorations, potentially including qualitative measures, will be needed to truly establish misokinesia as a research topic. Even so, this first paper represents a solid first step.</p>

<h4>Viral buzz cut</h4>



<p><em>The coronavirus razes cells’ hairlike cilia, which protect a person’s respiratory tract from foreign objects, <strong>Erin Garcia de Jesús </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-cell-cilia-invade-lungs-covid-pandemic">How COVID-19 sabotages cells</a>” (</em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 18<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Ron Kern </strong>asked if the mowed-down cilia can grow back.</p>



<p>The cilia can eventually regrow, says viral immunologist <strong>Lisa Chakrabarti</strong> of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. While the coronavirus destroys cells’ cilia, the cells themselves seem to live on. <strong>Chakrabarti </strong>compares the regrowth to a forest recovering after a fire. “The roots are still there, and it will grow back.” By the time cilia regrow, though, the virus may have already invaded the lungs, potentially causing severe COVID-19, she says.</p>





<h4>Clearing the air</h4>



<p><em>Pluto became a dwarf planet 15 years ago when the International A­stronomical Union, or IAU, instituted a new definition for a planet, which requires a celestial body to clear other objects from its orbit,<strong> Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">The definition of planet is still a sore point – especially among Pluto fans</a>” (</em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 20<em>).</em></p>



<p>Several readers expressed confusion over why planets that share their orbits with asteroids, such as Jupiter and its Trojan asteroids, weren’t also demoted.</p>



<p>Such asteroids are effectively in the same category as satellites, <strong>Grossman</strong> says. “These cases don’t violate the IAU’s definition because the planets are still the most gravitationally significant objects around,” she says. Jupiter, for instance, controls the Trojans’ orbit. In contrast, Pluto’s gravity does not significantly affect the objects in its Kuiper Belt neighborhood.</p>



<h4>Balding black holes</h4>



<p><em>Black holes born with magnetic fields quickly shed those fields, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-magnetic-field-hair-computer-simulations-physics">Magnetized black holes go bald</a>” (</em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 18<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Dave Foss</strong> wondered how a black hole could exhibit a magnetic field if nothing can escape its gravity.</p>



<p>“Scientists don’t expect a black hole itself to exhibit a magnetic field since anything inside the black hole that could generate that field would be cut off from the outside world,” <strong>Conover</strong> says. But if a massive object that already has a magnetic field, such as a neutron star, collapses to form a black hole, that field won’t disappear instantly, she says. In such cases, plasma surrounding the black hole maintains the magnetic field until the field blasts outward or falls into the black hole, simulations suggest.</p>

<h4>Passion for Pluto</h4>



<p>Pluto’s status in the solar system continues to be a sore point for many, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">reported</a>. A <em>Science News</em> poll on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1430135446714175489">asked users their opinion on whether Pluto is a planet</a>. The results from nearly 5,000 respondents reveal the perennial divide:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-things-come-to-astronomers-who-wait">Good things come to astronomers who wait</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists and journalists share a deep fascination with what’s new, but our patience can be tried when a promised big new thing is delayed. That’s particularly true of the protracted wait for the James Webb Space Telescope, which has stretched from a promised 20 years or so to 32 years — enough to make the project the butt of many jokes.</p>



<p>Finally the massive telescope, designed to capture faint hints of infrared light from the distant reaches of the universe, is poised to launch in December. And astonishingly, it’s not past its freshness date. In this issue, astronomy writer Lisa Grossman explains that the long delay <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">may end up making the instrument actually more useful</a>. Advances in the last few decades, including the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, have raised exciting questions, including whether there’s life on those planets, that the telescope is now poised to explore.</p>



<p>The telescope is also beautiful, with a golden sunflower-like mirror and horizontal “sails” that shield the spacecraft from the sun. I’m a word person, and one of the great pleasures of my job is to see how our design team uses images and graphics to explain complex science. In this case, it involved sifting through many images to find an illustration that reveals how the craft, which will be folded like an umbrella for launch, will look once it’s unfolded and flying in space. It’s a joyous expression of science in action that requires no words. </p>



<p>Also in this issue, you’ll find an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-alumni-2021">update on our SN 10: Scientists to Watch</a>. In years past, this project has introduced early- and mid-career scientists doing fascinating, significant work. This year, because of the tumult in science and the world, we chose to check back in with several of the scientists we profiled in years past to see how their research, and their perspectives, have changed. Theirs are inspiring stories of adaptability, creativity and perseverance, and speak to how essential science is in answering the challenges that humankind and our planet face. They give me hope for our shared future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">A new antiviral pill cuts COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates</a></h4>

              
                <p>An at-home pill against coronavirus halves the chance that people newly diagnosed with COVID-19 will land in the hospital or die, early results released by the drug’s developer indicate.</p>



<p>The pill, an antiviral drug called molnupiravir, was tested against a placebo in people at high risk of developing severe disease. Of the 377 people who got the placebo, 14.1 percent, or 53, were hospitalized within 29 days of starting the trial, with eight dying. By comparison, 7.3 percent, or 28, of the 385 patients who got the drug were hospitalized in the same time period. <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat/">None died</a>, officials with the pharmaceutical company Merck announced October 1 in a news release. Similar numbers of people taking the drug and the placebo reported side effects, but fewer people in the drug group stopped treatment because of those side effects. The news release did not describe what those side effects were.</p>



<p>About 40 percent of participants in the interim trial were infected with the gamma, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta</a> or mu variants of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Molnupiravir was as effective against those variants as it was against earlier versions of the virus, the company reported. Full results from the study aren’t yet available and other scientists have not reviewed the data.</p>

<p>Finding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">drugs that can work early in an infection</a> hasn’t been easy (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). Currently, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">only some lab-made antibodies are authorized</a> for newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to go to the hospital (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). Those antibodies must be given through an IV, making it difficult for some people to get treatment.</p>



<p>“Antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,” Wendy Holman, chief executive officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said in the news release. Ridgeback and Merck have partnered to develop molnupiravir and will share profits.</p>



<p>The most exciting aspect of the drug is that it can be taken in pill form, rather than as an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">intravenous infusion like remdesivir</a>, says Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>). He did much of the early lab testing of molnupiravir, previously known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">EIDD-2801</a> or MK-4482, but was not involved in the clinical trials (<em>SN: 8/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>In some of the children Denison treats as the director of pediatric infectious diseases at VUMC, remdesivir treatment comes too late. The same is true for many adults hospitalized with COVID-19. “At that point, why don’t you just pour the drug on their heads instead of giving it to them IV, because you’ve already moved past the window where it can be effective.” Delaying antiviral treatment is akin to waiting to give antibiotics until a wound is infected down to the bone, he says.</p>

<p>Giving antivirals early in an infection has a chance of stopping the virus before it can do much damage or prod the immune system to overreact. Molnupiravir could potentially be prescribed as soon a patient gets a positive COVID-19 test result, perhaps heading off floods of COVID-19 patients that are overwhelming medical systems as the highly transmissible delta variant circulates. In combination with vaccines, an effective early treatment might help get the pandemic under control.</p>



<p>Interim results from the molnupiravir study were so encouraging, an independent review panel decided to stop the global trial early. Merck said it plans to seek emergency use authorization for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and will apply for authorization in other countries as well.</p>



<p>“To stop a trial for futility is pretty common, when a drug isn’t working or when it’s showing a negative effect,” Denison says. “But to stop a trial because of efficacy, because the drug is working so well is really unusual. He adds, “I’m amazed but not surprised” that the antiviral performed well in humans. In his experiments with cells grown in lab dishes and in animal tests, “I was blown away by its effectiveness against multiple coronaviruses.”</p>



<p>Like the FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir, molnupiravir mimics building blocks of the coronavirus’s genetic material, RNA. The fake building blocks interfere with the polymerase enzyme the coronavirus uses to copy its RNA. But the two drugs work differently. Remdesivir is a delayed stop sign, Denison says. When it is inserted into a growing strand of RNA, it slows the polymerase, eventually causing it to grind to a halt, much like a car entering an intersection as the traffic light turns yellow may stop in the middle of the intersection, he says. Molnupiravir instead pockmarks the RNA with many mutations, causing the breakdown of the polymerase and other viral components, much like a pothole-strewn road can cause a car to break down. Those mutation potholes don’t just stop the RNA-copying enzyme, they also cause damage to other proteins the virus needs to infect cells and replicate.</p>





<p>Viruses can develop resistance to some antivirals, like the anti-influenza drug osteltamavir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu. But with molnupiravir, “resistance mutations can’t emerge because the drug makes too many other damaging mutations,” Denison says.</p>



<p>Merck says it can make as many as 10 million doses of molnupiravir by the end of the year. The company has entered into agreements with generic drug makers in more than 100 low and middle-income countries to produce the drug as well.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-antoinette-letters-ink-analysis-hidden-words-censor">Ink analysis reveals Marie Antoinette’s letters’ hidden words and who censored them</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a world torn apart by the French Revolution, doomed Queen Marie Antoinette exchanged secret letters with a rumored lover. Someone later censored them — and now scientists know who.</p>



<p>Chemical analyses of the ink <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg4266">reveal not only the obscured words, but also the identity of the censor</a>, researchers report October 1 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>From June 1791 to August 1792, as Marie Antoinette and the rest of the royal family were confined to Paris’ Tuileries Palace following an escape attempt, the queen managed a clandestine correspondence with Swedish Count Axel von Fersen.</p>



<p>Whether the correspondents exchanged words of love or state secrets was a longstanding mystery, says Anne Michelin, a chemist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Michelin and colleagues unraveled this mystery using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy.</p>



<p>XRF, a noninvasive technique, works by shooting an X-ray beam at a sample, kicking the atoms in the sample into a higher-energy state. The sample then emits its own X-rays along a spectrum characteristic of its elemental makeup. With XRF, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-fossil-seen-new-light">paleontologists have scrutinized fossils</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/x-rays-reveal-portrait-hiding-beneath-degas-masterpiece">art restorers have found hidden paintings</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/10</em>; <em>SN: 8/4/16</em>).</p>

<p>Here, the researchers zoomed in on the ink. Both correspondents used common gall ink made from iron sulfate, but different inks contain different proportions of trace elements, depending on the source, Michelin says. The team scanned the letters pixel by pixel, finding consistent differences in the copper-to-iron and the zinc-to-iron ratios of the original and redacting inks. By mapping each pixel’s elemental differences onto a gray scale, the hidden words emerged — words such as &#8220;beloved,&#8221; &#8220;tender friend&#8221; and &#8220;madly.”</p>



<p>As for the censor, it was von Fersen himself, Michelin says. The count was known to make copies of Marie Antoinette’s letters — and the ink used for the redactions was a match to those copies.</p>



<p>How much of their relationship was personal versus political may never be known, she adds, but we do know that “he kept these letters, even though it was risky for him.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/01/left-wing-authoritarianism-is-real-and-needs-to-be-taken-seriously-in-political-psychology-study-argues/">Left-Wing Authoritarianism Is Real And Needs To Be Taken Seriously In Political Psychology, Study Argues</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Authoritarianism has been well-studied by psychologists. Well, right-wing authoritarianism has. In fact, as that’s typically the only type that’s studied, you might be forgiven for thinking that’s what authoritarianism <em>is</em>. The very idea of <em>left-wing</em> authoritarianism (LWA) has received not only little academic attention, but a lot of scepticism from psychologists. “I think I have not found any authoritarians on the left because if there ever were any, most of them have dried up and blown away….” wrote Bob Altemeyer, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-08573-000">pioneer of work on right-wing authoritarianism</a>, in 1996.</p>



<p>But as Thomas Costello at Emory University and colleagues write in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-74485-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences</em>, “From Maoist China to the Khmer Rouge (and perhaps even the French Reign of Terror), history abounds with examples of LWA at the broader societal level, rendering psychology’s inability to identify left-wing authoritarians puzzling.”</p>



<p>Puzzling is right. Perhaps predominantly left-leaning researchers have been unwilling to even go there…. But in their new paper, Costello and his colleagues absolutely go there. They conclude that LWA does indeed exist, and they define not only its characteristics but the characteristics of the people who subscribe to it. They also reveal substantial similarities between authoritarians on the political right and the left.</p>



<span id="more-44007"></span>



<p>First, the team used a bottom-up approach to devise a scale to get at LWA. As well as scouring research papers for items that might relate to authoritarianism, they solicited ideas for items from psychologists, political scientists and philosophers. Using multiple batches of online participants, the team gradually whittled down and revised these items. They ended up with 39 items that reflected three conceptually distinct dimensions of LWA. I’ll take the definitions directly from the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Antihierarchical Aggression</strong> &#8211; <em>the belief that those currently in power should be punished, the established order should be overthrown, and that extreme actions, such as political violence, are justifiable to achieve these aims.</em><br></li><li><strong>Anticonventionalism</strong> &#8211; <em>the rejection of traditional values, a moral absolutism concerning progressive values and concomitant dismissal of conservatives as inherently immoral, and a need for political homogeneity in one’s social environment.</em><br></li><li><strong>Top-Down Censorship</strong> &#8211; <em>preferences for the use of governmental and institutional authority to quash opposition and bar offensive and intolerant speech.</em></li></ul>



<p>Looking over that list, I certainly know some people who I’m sure think of themselves as being extremely liberal but who would score pretty highly on the anti-conventionalism dimension, at least.</p>



<p>The researchers then ran studies using fresh batches of participants and an impressive array of self-report scales to look at everything from personality, to mood, to cognition. They found a few differences between left-wing and right-wing authoritarians. People who scored highly on the LWA scale reported more negative emotions and were more neurotic than average (unlike RWAs). They were also more likely to report schadenfreude. The RWAs, meanwhile, scored higher for unjustified certainty in their beliefs and confirmatory thinking (a tendency to favour information that supports your beliefs). RWA was also more strongly linked to cognitive rigidity and low openness, as well as a lower than typical belief in science.</p>



<p>However, there were a <em>lot</em> more similarities between the two groups than differences. So much so, that it seems there is a shared constellation of traits “that might be considered the ‘heart’ of authoritarianism”, the team writes. These shared traits include (and again, I’ll quote directly from the paper): a “preference for social uniformity, prejudice towards different others, willingness to wield group authority to coerce behaviour, cognitive rigidity, aggression and punitiveness towards perceived enemies, outsized concern for hierarchy and moral absolutism.”</p>



<p>In terms of potentially dangerous implications for others, both left- and ring-wing authoritarianism was linked to the endorsement of political violence; but for the LWAs, that was violence directed <em>at</em> the state (violent protests, for example), whereas for the RWAs, it was <em>in support of </em>the state (supporting police crackdowns, say).</p>



<p>As well as analysing this self-report data, the team ran a study designed to look at LWA and actual behaviour. Online participants selected the difficulty level of a set of puzzles that they believed they were giving to another participant to complete. Before they chose the puzzles, though, they were shown what they were told was the Facebook profile of this ‘partner’. Those who’d scored highly for LWA ‘punished’ partners with right-wing profiles with harder puzzles and ‘helped’ those with left-wing profiles with easier puzzles. This was the case even when participants’ political ideology was taken into account, showing that LWA can be linked to actual aggressive behaviour towards the political outgroup above and beyond any effects of political ideology, the team concluded.</p>



<p>None of these studies were on groups of participants who were representative of a general population, however. So the researchers ran a fresh study on 834 who were selected to be representative of the population of the US. Again, they found large correlations between LWA scores and dogmatism, as well as schadenfreude, moral disengagement and violence towards out-groups. This included actual participation in the use of force for a political cause over the preceding five years. It also included support of violent group action during protests against police brutality towards Black Americans over the summer of 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, then, the team present a lot of studies — and a lot of analyses. There are some limitations to the work, however. Because of the nature of the scales, it’s not possible to tell whether right-wing authoritarians are more authoritarian than the left-wing type, or vice versa, say. Also, the route to LWA may be more well-meaning than the route to RWA, the researchers write; for example, someone who wants passionately to challenge inequality in society may end up thinking violent protest is the only option. “Any similarities across LWA and RWA notwithstanding, we endorse no claims of motivational or moral equivalence (or lack thereof) across the two constructs at present,” they write.</p>



<p>Their body of results surely suggests, though, that arguments that the search for LWA should be abandoned should themselves be abandoned. In fact, excluding left-wing features from studies of authoritarianism “has limited the kinds of knowledge we can produce as psychological scientists,” the team argues. And given the relevance of authoritarianism to politics, globally, and to how societies respond to and fight for change, surely it’s high time for that to shift.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/children-climate-change-generation-burden-extreme-heat">2020 babies may suffer up to seven times as many extreme heat waves as 1960s kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The kids are not all right. Children born in 2020 <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi7339">could live through seven times as many extreme heat waves</a> as people born in 1960.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;the projected&nbsp;generational disparity&nbsp;if global greenhouse gas emissions are curbed by the amount currently promised by the world’s nations, climate scientist&nbsp;Wim Thiery&nbsp;of Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium and colleagues report September 26 in&nbsp;<em>Science</em>. Under current&nbsp;pledges,&nbsp;Earth’s average temperature is expected to&nbsp;increase by&nbsp;about 2.4 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times by 2100. While the older generation will experience an average of about four extreme heat waves during their lifetime, the younger generation could experience an average of about 30 such heat waves, the researchers say.</p>



<p>More stringent reductions that would limit&nbsp;warming to just&nbsp;1.5 degrees C would shrink — but not erase — the disparity: Children born in 2020 could still experience four times as many extreme heat waves as people born in 1960.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously outlined how climate change <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">has already amped up extreme weather events</a> around the globe, and how those climate impacts are projected to increase as the world continues to warm (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). The new study is the first to specifically quantify how much more exposed younger generations will be to those events.</p>



<p>An average child born in 2020 also will experience two times as many wildfires, 2.8 times as many river floods, 2.6 times as many droughts and about three times as many crop failures as a child born 60 years earlier, under climate scenarios based on current pledges. That exposure to extreme events becomes even higher in certain parts of the world: In the Middle East, for example, 2020 children will see up to 10 times as many heat waves as the older cohort, the team found.</p>



<p>With this possible grim future in mind, student climate activists in the #FridaysforFuture movement have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">among the most powerful voices of protest in recent years</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). Thiery and colleagues note that these findings come at a crucial time, as world leaders prepare to gather in Glasgow, Scotland, in late October for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference to negotiate new pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

The subject was a young woman about to graduate from college. As far as she could tell, she's always had these experiences, and for most of her life she didn't know they were unusual. This <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank">surprise</a> upon discovering the uniqueness of one's one internal experience is similar to what is reported by many contemporary individuals with less typical phenomenology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> (the inability to generate visual images).</p><p>Pierce noted that the subject was anosmic (<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">had a loss of smell), although this was not formally tested. Nonetheless, he observed:</span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"></span></p><blockquote>Coffee burning upon a stove is not noticed, though she may be close by. Camphor placed in the nostrils gives only a stinging sensation. Ammonia can be sniffed without discomfort. And, as with all anosmics, foods are discriminated on the basis of the pure taste qualities, or by the characters of texture, astringency, and so on, which any food-complex may possess. These sensory defects are worth noting for their possible significance in connection with the theory of this special case of synæsthesia.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some aspects of the report were rather quaint by modern standards (e.g., the first person narration), but others were quite prescient.<br /></p><blockquote>But what evidence have we that an actual case of synæsthesia is here being reported, and not a case of artificial association due to a lively dramatic fancy? This is a point that must be raised, for it is very easy to entertain a suspicion that these phenomena are essentially ungenuine. Now, of course, in matters of this kind general impressions and personal knowledge of the subject count heavily. And on both these grounds I have no hesitation in asserting my conviction that the above-cited equivalents are the expression of a genuine synæsthesia.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br /><br />One key piece of evidence was the consistency of gustatory experiences associated with the same words at a later date:<br /></p><blockquote>...the equivalents possess a constancy which would hardly be possible apart from a true synæsthesia. After an interval of six months a number of words were given at random from the original list, with the result that the identical equivalents were described in almost precisely the same language.</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotopic_arrangement" target="_blank">somatotopic</a>-like arrangement for some of the gustatory experiences:<br /></p><blockquote>Many of the experiences are given quite definite locations in the mouth. Thus the equivalents of <i>Ethel</i> and <i>Hall</i> (tactual) are felt at  the tip of the tongue; of <i>lox</i> (irritation) at the back of the throat; of <i>Judith</i> (salt) at the sides of the tongue; of <i>Sarah</i> (cold) on the lips; of <i>amethyst</i> (bitter) "at the back of the mouth, on the roof, where the root of the tongue seems to hit it" ...</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p>Pierce tried to discern whether similar sounds could be related to similar gustatory experiences, but that wasn't the case. Nor were they related to similarities in articulation. He still preferred a physiological explanation, yet...<br /><blockquote>In attempting to decide whether the above-cited experiences are to be explained by the physiological or by the psychological theory, we are, apparently, in no better and in no worse case than in respect to all varieties of synæsthesia. No decisive facts are at hand.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An interesting <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/444104" target="_blank">commentary</a> in <i>JAMA</i> predated <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=MRI+connectivity+synesthesia&amp;sort=date&amp;size=50" target="_blank">MRI connectivity</a> studies of synesthesia by nearly a century in its speculation about alternative brain wiring:</p><p></p><blockquote>There is little evidence one way or the other as to whether or not this phenomenon is to be explained on purely physiologic grounds, depending on a cross circuiting of the association fibers between different brain centers. </blockquote><p></p><br /><br />Pierce concludes his paper with a pithy aphorism that acknowledges the inconclusiveness of the study:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="color: black;">Still, here no less than in all known cases of synaesthesis, </span><b>we can only regret that our theory is so lame while our facts are so secure.</b></span></blockquote><br /><br /> <p> <b>References</b><br /><br />Pierce AH.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/zhqT8cxAkyg/">2021 DEI goals update</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>In April 2021&nbsp;we launched our dedicated <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> where we outline our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our commitment not only includes how we run our organization but also extends to how we execute our mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Truly Open Science requires direct action.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> is, however, more than just the words of our commitment. It is also where we transparently share our specific <a href="https://plos.org/dei/#goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI goals</a> in order to be held accountable to them. We&rsquo;ve committed to sharing regular progress on this blog, and this is the first of those updates. (PLOS staff will continue to write their own posts about their particular thoughts and activities around DEI, also.)</p>



<p>Some of the goals will suit incremental updates, and some suit annual reporting. We&rsquo;ll link each update below to the particular goal it relates to, and provide links when relevant. We will also be transparent about key setbacks or if we miss any targets, rather than simply glossing over these. </p>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented external contributors (e.g. authors, editors, reviewers) and strategic partners.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our journals are committed to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equitable participation</a>, and we&rsquo;re pleased with our progress to create representative editorial boards for our newly launched journals <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Sustainability &amp; Transformation</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Water</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></li><li>We have been particularly successful with diverse representation for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a>, and at the end of this post is a video recorded with the journal&rsquo;s Co-Editors-in-Chief and Executive Editor, where they discuss how they managed to assemble this truly global and diverse editorial board.</li><li>Day 1 of our week of programming for the start of our <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientists for Open Science</a> campaign was dedicated to <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusion</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>We are in the final stages of drafting a survey to assess contributor diversity, which will be deployed in Q4 of 2021.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Developing editorial processes that recognize and minimize bias in the publication process, along high ethical standards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>PLOS has <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instituted a new policy</a> to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities in order to prevent &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;). Watch a recorded conversation, below, with some of the stakeholders who helped develop this policy.</li><li>*PLOS has formally joined the multi-publisher initiative to accelerate research culture change, coordinated by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) &ndash;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.rsc.org/new-perspectives/talent/joint-commitment-for-action-inclusion-and-diversity-in-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joint commitment for action on inclusion and diversity in publishing</a>. We had been participating and contributing from the start, but this update serves to make the collaboration official, and with pooled resources helps all publishers drive towards this goal.&nbsp;</li><li>*PLOS is also a member of the <a href="https://c4disc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications</a> (C4DISC) and as such commits to uphold its <a href="https://c4disc.org/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles</a>.</li></ul>



<p>*A note on industry collaborations: we believe that collaborating with other publishers will help us all develop the methods and metrics to understand the diversity of our collective journals&rsquo; editorial boards, conscious of regional privacy laws and cultures, which in turn will help enable us <em>all </em>to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees at PLOS, with an emphasis on managerial employee roles.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Through September 2021, we have met our internal sub-goal that every PLOS Leadership Team vacancy (4 vacancies filled in 2021) has included final candidates historically underrepresented in leadership, particularly Black, Latina/o, Indigenous and transgender people. In early 2022, we will report on how this has affected hiring outcomes for 2021.</li><li>We have increased investment by more than 50% to develop our recruiting function and interview methods , which are instrumental in meaningfully changing the way we hire. In September, we conducted a leadership team retrospective on the progress we&rsquo;ve made, what the challenges are, and where we&rsquo;ll focus our efforts in 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the quantifiable signals of an inclusive work environment that values divergent perspectives, encourages critical inquiry, and ensures equitable advancement and rewards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>In early 2021, we translated our ideals of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, &ldquo;equity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; into three distinct sets of competencies in which to anchor our goals and development activities</li><li>In March, every leader at PLOS set DEI goals for 2021: goals ranged from raising awareness around key issues to changing processes to produce more equitable outcomes.</li><li>Our Chief People and Equity Officer, Kristina Martin, participated in a C4DISC panel discussion &ldquo;<a href="https://c4disc.org/2021/06/15/ssp-session-the-glass-ceiling-you-dont-know-about-yet-removing-barriers-for-people-with-disabilities-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Glass Ceiling You Don&rsquo;t Know About Yet: Removing Barriers for People with (Dis)abilities at Work</a>&rdquo;</li><li>On October 12, 2021 we&rsquo;re hosting an internal PLOS &ldquo;Listening Session&rdquo; in which neurodiverse leaders share their lived experiences with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder.&nbsp;</li><li>In November, managers and employees will have practice sessions for strategies we&rsquo;ve previously introduced to identify and reduce bias.</li><li>While barriers related to privacy, data collection and storage have prevented us from capturing broad diversity data across PLOS&rsquo; global employee population, we are working through the issues and plan to have the systems in place in 2022 to accurately capture data related to hire, retention and progression of employees at PLOS, disaggregated by identity group. In the meantime, we are collecting data for two smaller groups: the PLOS Leadership Team and our DEI Steering Committee. We will share this data in early 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the publication of research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations (within the scope of each of our journals).</strong></p>



<ul><li>We are still looking into the best way to meaningfully feature articles across our portfolio of journals in this way, and will report in the future. In the meantime, we will share this blog post regarding the mission of <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, from the Co-Editors: <a href="https://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2021/06/14/plos-global-public-health-charting-a-new-path-towards-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS Global Public Health, charting a new path towards equity, diversity and inclusion in global health</a></li></ul>



<p>Thank you for reading, and please look out for the next update before the end of the year!</p>

<p><strong>Probing pharaohs with X-rays</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/probing-new-kingdom-pharaohs-x-rays"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 9, 1971</p>



<p>The 29 mummies of pharaohs and queens were examined without disturbing their present positions.… [Researchers using portable X-ray equipment] found evidence of rheumatoid inflammation of the vertebrae of Amenophis II, ruler of Egypt from 1436 to 1413 B.C…. [A queen] was buried with what was thought to be her mummified infant. But radiography of the object confirmed its identification as a mummified adolescent baboon.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists now investigate Egyptian mummies with advanced imaging devices that were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scans-show-first-x-rayed-mummy-new-light">unavailable in 1971</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">Micro-CT scans and virtual reality models</a> have provided detailed life history and embalming information about three animal mummies — a cat, a bird and a snake (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p.&nbsp;17</em>). 3-D printing has enabled scientists to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3d-printed-vocal-tract-ancient-mummy-voice-speak-beyond-grave">reconstruct the vocal tract and simulate the voice</a> of a 3,000-year-old mummified priest (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 14</em>). And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infrared-images-reveal-hidden-tattoos-egyptian-mummies">infrared scanner</a>s have revealed tattoos on seven mummies dating to about 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/21/19 &amp; 1/4/20, p. 8</em>).</p>

<html><body><p>We don&rsquo;t often toot our horn at PLOS, but we&rsquo;d be remiss not to acknowledge the wonderful work our institutional partnership team has done in changing the scholarly landscape with respect to how papers are paid for. The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> honored PLOS&rsquo; work at the ALPSP annual meeting last week. The PLOS team was named co-winners for Innovation in Publishing 2021. PLOS shares this honor with <a href="https://mindscapecommons.net/login">Mindscape Commons</a> by Coherent Digital, which is the first and largest collection of Virtual Reality (VR) video content for teaching and learning in mental health.</p>



<p>PLOS journals are underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the Article Processing Charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee agreement</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a>.&nbsp; The award was specifically for Community Action Publishing, a non-APC based model that uses collective action by institutions to pay for publication fees.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Community and partnerships are built on trust and we&rsquo;re so grateful to our current and future library partners for the trust and openness they&rsquo;ve brought to developing this model,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;This award would also not have been possible without the amazing collaboration of our team and Raym Crow at the Chain Bridge Group, who specializes in Open Access business models.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/09/30/early-adopters-arxiv-membership/">Thank you to the early adopters of arXiv’s new membership model!</a></h4>

              
                <p>We’re pleased to announce that <strong>Caltech, CERN, Georgia Institute of Technology, and MIT</strong> have pledged to become “arXiv champions of open science” for 2022. Each of these institutions has chosen to contribute $10,000 each &#8212; and this support will have a significant impact on arXiv’s ability to serve researchers. Thank you for leading the global research community towards truly open science!</p>
<p>&#8220;arXiv has become an indispensable platform for scientific exchange in particle physics and beyond and submitting to arXiv is today a standard practice across CERN and the entire community,&#8221; said Joachim Mnich, CERN’s Director for Research and Computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Caltech Library is pleased to contribute to arXiv at the Champion Level. For many, many years our researchers have been heavy contributors and users of arXiv. The Library recognizes the importance of this resource to the Caltech community,&#8221; said Joy Painter, Physics, Math &amp; Astronomy Librarian at Caltech.</p>
<p>arXiv membership is open to universities, libraries, and research institutes. The vast majority of <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">arXiv’s 2021 members</a> plan to renew in January, and we would like to extend a very special thank you to the organizations listed below that have already proactively confirmed their 2022 arXiv membership.</p>
<p>arXiv was founded strictly for research and education &#8212; not profit. That’s why we rely on the generosity of members, affiliates, sponsors, and other donors to support daily operations, critical infrastructure updates, and new initiatives.</p>
<p>We understand that the pandemic has affected many organizations’ budgets, and we are grateful that, despite the challenges, many institutions are renewing their commitment to open science. For institutions struggling with budget constraints, the flexible “Community Membership” option is available &#8212; support in any amount strengthens open science at arXiv.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us on this journey! The following institutions have proactively confirmed their 2022 arXiv membership. <em>(Is your institution missing from this list? There’s still plenty of time to confirm your 2022 support. <a href="mailto:membership@arxiv.org">Email us</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership_confirm">confirm your membership here</a>.) </em></p>

                Kyoto University has fired a researcher after determining that he committed fraud in at least five papers about the deadly Kumamoto earthquake of 2006. In a report released earlier this week (Sept 28), the institution said it found Aiming Lin guilty of 37 counts of “fraudulent activity” in four of the articles, not including a &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/09/30/kyoto-university-fires-researcher-for-fraud-in-kumamoto-earthquake-studies/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Kyoto University fires researcher for fraud in Kumamoto earthquake studies</span></a>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruptions-rainy-period-earth-climate-dinosaur-friendly">A volcano-induced rainy period made Earth’s climate dinosaur-friendly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The biggest beasts to walk the Earth had humble beginnings. The first dinosaurs were cat-sized, lurking in the shadows, just waiting for their moment. That moment came when four major pulses of volcanic activity changed the climate in a geologic blink of an eye, causing a 2-million-year-long rainy spell that coincided with dinos rising to dominance, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Clues found in sediments buried deep beneath an ancient lake basin in China <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2109895118">link the volcanic eruptions with climate swings and environmental changes</a> that created a globe-spanning hot and humid oasis in the middle of the hot and dry Triassic Period, researchers report in the Oct. 5 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. During this geologically brief rainy period 234 million to 232 million years ago, called the Carnian Pluvial Episode, dinosaurs started evolving into the hulking and diverse creatures that would dominate the landscape for the next 166 million years.</p>



<p>Previous research has noted the jump in global temperatures, humidity and rainfall during this time period, as well as a changeover in land and sea life. But these studies lacked detail on what caused these changes, says Jason Hilton, a paleobotanist at the University of Birmingham in England.</p>



<p>So Hilton and his colleagues turned to a several-hundred-meter-long core of lake-bottom sediments drawn from the Jiyuan Basin for answers. The core contained four distinct layers of sediments that included volcanic ash that the team dated to between 234 million and 232 million years ago, matching the timing of the Carnian Pluvial Episode. Within those layers, the team also found mercury, a proxy for volcanic eruptions. “Mercury entered the lake from a mix of atmospheric pollution, volcanic ash and also being washed in from surrounding land that had elevated levels of mercury from volcanism,” Hilton says.</p>

<p>Further evidence for the link between volcanism and environmental change during the Carnian Pluvial Episode came from corresponding layers in the core that showed different types of carbon, indicating four massive releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Finally, microfossils and pollens changed within the same core section, from species that prefer drier climates to ones that tend to grow in warm and humid climates.</p>



<p>The reconstructed history suggests that the volcanic pulses injected huge amounts of CO₂ into the atmosphere, says coauthor Jacopo Dal Corso, a geologist at the University of Leeds in England. That boosted temperatures and intensified the hydrologic cycle, enhancing rainfall and increasing runoff into lakes, he says. At the same time, terrestrial plants evolved, with humidity-loving flora becoming predominant. As the rains created wet environments, turtles, large amphibians called metoposaurids — and dinosaurs — began to thrive.</p>



<p>Together, these diverse lines of evidence reveal that the Carnian Pluvial Episode was actually four distinct pulses of significant environmental change — each triggered by massive volcanic eruptions, Dal Corso says.</p>

<p>The mercury and carbon data together suggest the increase in mercury came from a “major source of volcanism that was capable of impacting the global carbon cycle,” rather than local eruptions, the team writes. That volcanism likely came from the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province eruption in what is now British Columbia and Alaska, which has previously, but tenuously, been linked to the Carnian Pluvial Episode. If true, it means the Wrangellia eruption occurred in pulses, rather than one sustained eruption. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper marks the “first time that mercury and carbon isotope data are so well correlated across the Carnian Pluvial Episode,” says Andrea Marzoli, an igneous petrologist at the University of Padua in Italy who has studied Wrangellia but was not involved in this research.&nbsp; “The authors make a strong argument in favor of volcanically induced global climate change pulses.” However, Marzoli notes, “the link to Wrangellia is still weak, simply because we don’t know the age of Wrangellia.”</p>







<p>Alastair Ruffell, a forensic geologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Ireland not involved in this study, agrees, saying he’d like to see more evidence of cause and effect between Wrangellia and the environmental changes. This study offers some of the best proxies and data from terrestrial sources to date, but more terrestrial records of the Carnian Pluvial Episode are needed, he says, to “understand what this actually looked like on the ground.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The climate changes marked a tipping point for life that couldn’t adjust, and those groups went extinct. Animals like dinosaurs and plants like cycads, says Ruffell, were “waiting in the wings” to seize their opportunity. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-sauropod-jurassic-herbivores">similar cycle of volcanic activity and environmental change</a> starting about 184 million years ago may have paved the way for the biggest of all dinos, long-necked sauropods, to lumber into dominance (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/30/blind-and-sighted-people-understand-colour-similarly/">Blind And Sighted People Understand Colour Similarly</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Colour is generally thought of as something experienced only by those with sight. It’s often assumed that those who’re born blind can learn facts about colours — that a banana is yellow, say — but won’t have the same complex understanding of colour that sighted people have.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2020192118">new research</a> in <em>PNAS</em> from Judy Kim and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University shows that this is not the case. Instead, the researchers find that blind people have a rich understanding of colour developed through language alone.</p>



<span id="more-43991"></span>



<p>The team looked at different kinds of knowledge about colour in both sighted (N=19) and congenitally blind (N=20) participants. The research was split into three distinct experiments:</p>



<p>The first aimed to probe causal-explanatory and associative memory knowledge of real objects’ colours. Participants were asked to generate common colours for 54 specific objects which were either natural (e.g. strawberry) or artificial. In this latter group, the colour of some objects served a purpose (e.g. stop sign), but for others did not (e.g. book). Participants also indicated whether two of the same objects would be likely to have the same colour.</p>



<p>In experiment two, participants were asked to make inferences about colour consistency in novel natural and artificial objects in an “imaginary island scenario”. Participants were asked to imagine having discovered an undocumented civilisation on a remote island, complete with all that culture’s unknown objects; for example, green “Enly” gems, used for power, and yellow “Kanpa”s, used to spray odorless chemicals in the home. As objects were presented, participants were asked to guess how likely the next such one they come across would be the same colour. This task assessed the extent to which participants believed that objects within the same category (i.e. natural or artificial, with or without functional colour) would also share a colour. These beliefs would indicate that participants were able to build generalisable theories about why objects had certain colours that could be applied more widely.</p>



<p>The final experiment was more open ended; participants were asked to provide explanations as to why particular objects have their colour (eg. “Why is a carrot orange?”), and were able to give any reasons they thought to be correct. This provided further insight into the specifics of both groups’ knowledge about causal mechanisms of colour.</p>



<p>Some findings were consistent with the idea that colour knowledge is acquired through sight. For example, blind people were less likely to agree on associative colour facts; when asked to generate a common colour for a banana, only 50% of blind participants said that bananas were “yellow”, compared to practically all sighted participants. This would suggest that, at least in some cases, directly seeing the colour of an object is more informative than acquiring facts about its colour through other means.</p>



<p>However, both groups agreed more on the likely colour of both natural and artificial objects with functional colours than artificial objects whose colour served no purpose. Both blind and sighted participants also expected two natural objects (e.g. two strawberries), or two artificial objects with functional colours (e.g. two stop signs) to share the same colour, but believed it less likely that two artificial objects whose colour served no purpose (e.g. two books) would have the same colour. Similar findings were observed in the imaginary island scenario, even though neither group had ever seen the novel objects (e.g. “Enly” gems and novel cleaning devices) described in this vignette.</p>



<p>When it came to providing explanations of why object colours differed, the groups were also relatively similar. For natural objects, around a third of sighted and blind participants said that “it just is that way”, and a similar number appealed to processes to explain colouration; for example, describing how photosynthesis makes plants green. When it came to artificial objects without functional colour, both groups commonly explained that colour depended on aesthetic choices (64% vs 44%), or referred to the material from which the object was made (18% vs 13%). And finally, for functionally coloured objects, about half of both groups explained that the colour was the result of cultural convention, and a quarter of both groups said that a specific colour was used to make the object more visibile.</p>



<p>This study wonderfully illustrates that blind and sighted people share common knowledge about colour. Though the two groups differ in some domains — particularly when it comes to associative knowledge about the colour of objects (eg. bananas are yellow) — they are largely similar in their understanding of the natural occurrence and application of colours. Blind individuals are able to draw upon deep understandings of how colours function, and make inferences about totally new objects based on their category alone, in a way that closely resembles those with sight.</p>



<p>The authors take this data to suggest that those living in the same wider societal culture, sighted or blind, develop similar intuitive theories of colour which can be applied to totally novel situations. The source of this knowledge is almost certain to be linguistic, and future research may determine at what ages this framework for colour knowledge develops in both sighted and congenitally blind individuals.</p>
