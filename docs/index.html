            <p align="justify"><b></b>Where to send computational and theoretical neuroscience papers? A list of journals can be found on <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~perlewitz/journals.html">Jim Perlewitz’s page</a>. First, many journals belong to one of the scientific publishing companies who make huge profits from the free work of academics (margins around 30-40%), with questionable added value. In computational neuroscience, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="justify">Journal in Computational Neuroscience (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience; in Neuroinformatics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Biological Cybernetics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">The Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Cognitive Neurodynamics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Neuroinformatics (Springer Nature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Network: Computation in Neural Systems (Taylor &amp; Francis)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Then we have Neural Computation, run by MIT Press, which is non-profit. Unfortunately, papers are behind paywalls. In my case, the library does not have a subscription.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, there is PLoS Computational Biology, a highly respected journal in the field. However, even in this non-profit journal, open access is very expensive ($2250 per paper). I find these costs hard to justify, when any scientist can publish on archives for free (eg <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv</a> or <a href="http://biorxiv.org/">biorxiv</a>). The solution to this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal">overlay journals</a>: the papers are linked to an archive site; the journal only deals with peer-review.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/795530330052493312">I was also recently rather disappointed</a> by PLoS CB, after a paper got rejected 10 month after submission on the sole basis of interest. Based on the reactions I received, this is not an isolated case. Anyway, PLoS CB practices editorial pre-selection, which is highly subjective. As for other prestigious journals, its prestige is precisely based on its relatively low acceptance rate. But this is a highly questionable model, because it is wasteful: wasting the time of authors who submit the same paper to many journals, wasting the time of reviewers who write reports that are thrown away. In my opinion, it is also perverse. It gives a label of quality to individual papers and scientists based on the opinion of just a couple of scientists, sampled by one editor, and this <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/you-are-not-a-good-scientist-if-you-use-impact-factors-for-evaluating-research/">insignificant label</a> is then used by various committees (grants, promotions, hiring). It also pushes authors into boosting their claims to pass the editorial barrier. The solution to this is <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-praise-of-post-publication-review/">post-publication review</a> (see also <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1718">Michael Eisen’s post)</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">So ideally, I would like to see an overlay journal practicing post-publication review in my field. The question now is: should we create one? What would be needed is the technical infrastructure, but I am not sure it is fully available yet (as regards the post-publication review system, indexing etc).</p>
<p align="justify">Alternatively, we could use a general post-publication review journal. There is for example <a href="https://f1000research.com/">F1000 Research</a>. <a href="https://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a> also does this partially (publishing the reviews is an option). Both cost about $1000 per article; both are run by companies. But they are less expensive than alternative open access journals (PLoS ONE: $1495; eNeuro: $1950 for members, $2925 otherwise), and more open. None of these two journals is ideal, but they represent some progress over conventional journals.</p>
<p align="justify">There are two issues with choosing a general journal. First, there is the question of editors. I have no experience with these journals so I am not sure there is the relevant expertise in the editorial board. I have seen a couple of computational neuroscientists in PeerJ though. The second issue is visibility. One idea could be to manage a list of computational neuroscience papers, to which anyone could submit a reference or preprint, in addition to automatic additions (say from relevant journals + keyword alerts). One would simply subscribe to the list (RSS feed or email alert).</p>
<p align="justify">Any good ideas are welcome!</p>

            Did Charles Darwin's thirst for skulls contribute to the near-extinction of the Aboriginal Tasmanian people?





If you believe certain creationists, Darwin sought examples of Tasmanian skulls in order to prove that this unfortunate race was a 'missing link' between humans and apes. However, according to John van Wyhe in a new paper called Darwin's body-snatchers?, this story has zero basis in fact.
As a Darwin scholar, I thought I had heard all the myths concerning Charles Darwin but on

            <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">A lot has been written about impact factors, and why </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">they are a poor indicator </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of article quality </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(just <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=impact+factor">google it</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Even for the one thing that the impact factor is meant to measure, ie, future citations, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">it performs badly</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">There are now many empirical studies on this</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Sadly, in 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">scientists in hiring or promotion committees still </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">value impact factors very highly, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">especially in life sciences</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Yes, in a domain of science that is meant to be highly empirical, scientists </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">still</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> prefer to </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">look away </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">from compelling evidence </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">that impact factors should not be used for evaluating research</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Recently, in a PhD thesis committee, we were discussing the grade and one member, a</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">n</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> experimental biologist, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">raised the issue that the candidate had not published in the highest ranked journals</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We opposed that we were there precisely to evaluate the manuscript itself </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">as a whole</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">not some elements of CV</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">He admitted later that he had not read the thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">I could </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">simply cite the overwhelming evidence</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">But I want to make a simpler point </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">of statistics</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Many things are wrong with using impact factors, but let us just consider the one thing it is meant for, ie, predicting the number of future citations of papers. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">We know that </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">for any journal,</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> the </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">distributions of citations is very broad and highly skewed</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2126010/pdf/9056804.pdf">Seglen (1997)</a>, “articles in the most cited half of articles in a journal are cited 10 times as often as the least cited half”. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">In practice, if you are given the name of the journal in which a paper has been published, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">you will </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">not </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">know </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">its future number of citations</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">E</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">xamples are sometimes more convincing that hard facts. So from the </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">paper </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> just cited, </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">number of citations vs. impact factor for all publications of 4 scientists</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">N</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">ow look at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lEHiPU4AAAAJ">my own publication statistics</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">To be more rigorous, I should calculate the citations per year, but the point is obvious enough. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">My top 3 cited papers </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">were published in</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">: </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">J. Neurophys </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(IF 2.8); </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">J. Comp.

 Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts by definition, recent studies have shown that a fraction of putative small open reading frames within lncRNAs are translated. However, the biological significance of these hidden polypeptides is still unclear. Here we identify and functionally characterize a novel polypeptide encoded by the lncRNA LINC00961. This polypeptide is conserved between human and mouse, is localized to the late endosome/lysosome and interacts with the lysosomal v-ATPase to negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. This regulation of mTORC1 is specific to activation of mTORC1 by amino acid stimulation, rather than by growth factors. Hence, we termed this polypeptide ‘small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response’ (SPAR). We show that the SPAR-encoding lncRNA is highly expressed in a subset of tissues and use CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to develop a SPAR-polypeptide-specific knockout mouse while maintaining expression of the host lncRNA. We find that the SPAR-encoding lncRNA is downregulated in skeletal muscle upon acute injury, and using this in vivo model we establish that SPAR downregulation enables efficient activation of mTORC1 and promotes muscle regeneration. Our data provide a mechanism by which mTORC1 activation may be finely regulated in a tissue-specific manner in response to injury, and a paradigm by which lncRNAs encoding small polypeptides can modulate general biological pathways and processes to facilitate tissue-specific requirements, consistent with their restricted and highly regulated expression profile.

 Lymphatic vessels are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and are critical for health. However, the role of metabolism in lymphatic development has not yet been elucidated. Here we report that in transgenic mouse models, LEC-specific loss of CPT1A, a rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation, impairs lymphatic development. LECs use fatty acid β-oxidation to proliferate and for epigenetic regulation of lymphatic marker expression during LEC differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor PROX1 upregulates CPT1A expression, which increases acetyl coenzyme A production dependent on fatty acid β-oxidation. Acetyl coenzyme A is used by the histone acetyltransferase p300 to acetylate histones at lymphangiogenic genes. PROX1–p300 interaction facilitates preferential histone acetylation at PROX1-target genes. Through this metabolism-dependent mechanism, PROX1 mediates epigenetic changes that promote lymphangiogenesis. Notably, blockade of CPT1 enzymes inhibits injury-induced lymphangiogenesis, and replenishing acetyl coenzyme A by supplementing acetate rescues this process in vivo.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21028">doi: 10.1038/nature21028</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/Ie0nU-NTj4k" width="1" />

 Embryonic development is driven by tightly regulated patterns of gene expression, despite extensive genetic variation among individuals. Studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) indicate that genetic variation frequently alters gene expression in cell-culture models and differentiated tissues. However, the extent and types of genetic variation impacting embryonic gene expression, and their interactions with developmental programs, remain largely unknown. Here we assessed the effect of genetic variation on transcriptional (expression levels) and post-transcriptional (3′ RNA processing) regulation across multiple stages of metazoan development, using 80 inbred Drosophila wild isolates, identifying thousands of developmental-stage-specific and shared QTL. Given the small blocks of linkage disequilibrium in Drosophila, we obtain near base-pair resolution, resolving causal mutations in developmental enhancers, validated transcription-factor-binding sites and RNA motifs. This fine-grain mapping uncovered extensive allelic interactions within enhancers that have opposite effects, thereby buffering their impact on enhancer activity. QTL affecting 3′ RNA processing identify new functional motifs leading to transcript isoform diversity and changes in the lengths of 3′ untranslated regions. These results highlight how developmental stage influences the effects of genetic variation and uncover multiple mechanisms that regulate and buffer expression variation during embryogenesis.

 Ash trees (genus Fraxinus, family Oleaceae) are widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but are being devastated in Europe by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, causing ash dieback, and in North America by the herbivorous beetle Agrilus planipennis. Here we sequence the genome of a low-heterozygosity Fraxinus excelsior tree from Gloucestershire, UK, annotating 38,852 protein-coding genes of which 25% appear ash specific when compared with the genomes of ten other plant species. Analyses of paralogous genes suggest a whole-genome duplication shared with olive (Olea europaea, Oleaceae). We also re-sequence 37 F. excelsior trees from Europe, finding evidence for apparent long-term decline in effective population size. Using our reference sequence, we re-analyse association transcriptomic data, yielding improved markers for reduced susceptibility to ash dieback. Surveys of these markers in British populations suggest that reduced susceptibility to ash dieback may be more widespread in Great Britain than in Denmark. We also present evidence that susceptibility of trees to H. fraxineus is associated with their iridoid glycoside levels. This rapid, integrated, multidisciplinary research response to an emerging health threat in a non-model organism opens the way for mitigation of the epidemic.

            <p>Chromatin structure at the length scale encompassing local nucleosome–nucleosome interactions is thought to play a crucial role in regulating transcription and access to DNA. However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1–3 nucleosome (50–500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA–DNA contacts that are spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome–nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20781">doi: 10.1038/nature20781</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/mU8_3ztJDWU" width="1" />

<p>We’re supposed to be hungry for workplace feedback: after all, it can help us to eliminate blind spots in our self-knowledge, give us focus and surpass relationship issues. Often, though, it can be a bit hard to take. On the wrong day, when the feedback’s particularly upsetting, it may even bring us to tears. If this happens to you and you’re a man, according to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-52938-001/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, it could spell bad news for your career prospects.</p>
<p><span id="more-16302"></span></p>
<p>Daphna Motro and Aleksander Ellis from the University of Arizona recruited 169 adults based in the US, with an average age 32 and mostly in active employment, and presented them with one of several versions of a 6-minute video showing a performance evaluation of a grocery store manager named Pat: a scripted role performed by actors in their early twenties, a male one in some videos, a female one in others. Participants were asked to imagine they were the supervisor, and the video was staged so that they viewed the action over the shoulder of the supervisor with Pat right in front of them. The evaluation wasn’t good: Pat had recently been rude, frequently late, and oversaw declining sales. In some versions of the video, this feedback was too much, provoking male or female Pat to tears.</p>
<p>In post-viewing ratings of how typical the behaviour in the meeting was, participants who viewed the version featuring a tearful female Pat didn’t find her behaviour any more strange than participants who viewed the video showing female Pat remaining dry-eyed. But for participants who saw male Pat, tears were seen as significantly atypical, and they also tended to rate him lower for competence and fitness for leadership. Men and women alike made these harsher judgments of male criers.</p>
<p>Concrete consequences also followed. After the video screening, participants were told that Pat was moving away from the area and was after a short recommendation letter to help her/him find new work, which the participant should draft. As an employee, despite his/her recent poor performance, Pat wasn’t a complete disaster – participants had seen a positive resume at the start of the experiment – and many participants gave positive feedback, using phrases like “I have nothing but praise for him.” However, participants who watched the video depicting a crying male Pat wrote recommendation letters with the most negative tone, as evaluated by independent judges. The article offers one particularly harsh example:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well, I have to be honest, I’m not putting my name on the line for a slacker like Pat, I suggest that he get to the nearest McDonald’s and start working his way up from the bottom. Based on the reports I received I can’t in good conscience recommend that anywhere hire him. With that being said, good luck, if all else fails maybe he can get a gig flipping signs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Publicly crying is a signal of vulnerability: a state that we are less surprised to see in women, who are meant to be tender and emotional according to stereotypes. But when men cry, it violates cultural expectations that they should be firm and in control. The new experimental data suggest that, at least in simplified scenarios, this effects our evaluations of and actions toward crying men. Now it would be important to see if this holds true in real-world contexts between people with an active history, and explore it in samples outside of the US, to establish whether for men at work – as Motro and Ellis suggest – “crying is not an option”.</p>

<p><strong>Sex stereotypes influence adults’ perception of babies’ cries</strong></p>
<p>Gender stereotypes (widely held beliefs about characteristics and behaviors based on gender) shape various aspects of human psychology and behavior; these include facets of parental behavior which contribute to the development of gender identity. A study <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0123-6">published</a> by David Reby and colleagues in April, investigated whether stereotypical expectations arising from sex differences in adults voices influenced how adults perceived babies’ cries.</p>
<img class="wp-image-8326 size-medium alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Crying-baby-Aurimas-Mikalauskas-Flickr-CC-300x200.jpg" title="Aurimas Mikalauskas (Flickr CC)" width="300" />
<p>The researchers recorded spontaneous cries from babies of both sexes (average 4 months of age) and analyzed the acoustic structure of the cries; interestingly they found no differences between the cries of both sexes, including no difference in the pitch of the cries. They then conducted playback experiments of the natural recorded cries and re-synthesized cries to investigate whether variation in the pitch of the cries affected adult listeners’ identification of the baby’s sex, and perception of the level of discomfort expressed by the cry. Interestingly adults were significantly more likely to attribute low-pitched cries to boys and high-pitched cries to girls, despite the absence of sex differences in pitch. Adult listeners also rated higher-pitched cries as expressing more discomfort than lower-pitched cries. The researchers concluded that the adult listeners generalized the sex dimorphism that characterizes the voice of adult speakers to their perception of the cries – meaning that gender stereotypes may influence how adults attribute gender traits to babies at a very early age, which may potentially translate into differential treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Improving mental health and well-being via email.</strong></p>
<p>Well-being is not just absence of mental disorders, it is a broad concept that includes happiness as well as other factors that make up a good life. We all want to lead happy and fulfilling lives, and email-based exercises may be one simple way of improving our psychological well-being.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-8328 size-medium alignright" height="197" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/hand-1030571_1920-300x197.jpg" title="Pixabay" width="300" />In May, Minna Torniainen-Holm and colleagues <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0125-4">published</a> research examining the effectiveness of email-based exercises in promoting psychological well-being and healthy lifestyle. The researchers used a novel method to recruit participants, by aid of a Finnish reality TV program. The TV program followed five Finnish celebrities who were being trained to improve their well-being and cope with setbacks in their everyday life; the program advertised a website, that allowed people to fill out a questionnaire about their health, lifestyle, psychological well-being and resilience to stress. 73,000 completed the questionnaire and over 42,000 started the email-based intervention, combining exercises that increase well-being and enhance coping with stress; 16,500 people participated in at least one follow up. Despite high drop-out rates, the researchers found that people who chose email-based training for mental health showed improvements in levels of stress, confidence in the future and gratitude at both two-month and two-year follow ups; participants who completed the email exercises according to the instructions they were given, showed the most sustained improvement in psychological well-being at the two-year follow up.</p>

<p><strong>Mid-life social participation is associated with better cognitive function at age 50</strong></p>
<p>As we get older, a certain amount of decline in both cognitive and physical functioning is a normal part of aging. The extent to which an individual will experience cognitive decline (or indeed pathological cognitive impairment) is governed by a complex interplay between genetic, environmental and social factors. So what can we do to maintain cognitive function as we age?</p>
<img class="wp-image-8327 size-medium alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/5435835223_46d0b37183_z-300x200.jpg" title="The Hawthorne Park Trust (Flickr CC)" width="300" />
<p>In a study <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0164-x">published</a> in December, Ann Bowling and colleagues used data from the <a href="http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=724&amp;sitesectiontitle=National+Child+Development+Study">British National Child Development Study</a>, a general population sample in England, Scotland and Wales, to investigate associations between people’s social engagement throughout their adult life and cognitive function at age 50. Baseline data was collected at birth in 1958 and study participants were followed up at several points later in life. The researchers’ analyzed data from more than 9,000 participants who had completed surveys at both age 11 and age 50, with 8,129 participants also completing cognitive tests at these ages. They found that social engagement through civic group activities, such as being a member of a political party, an environmental group, neighborhood watch, a voluntary service group or other community based groups, was associated with better cognitive function at age 50. So, what better excuse to get involved in your community!</p>

<p><strong>Psychology: replication and beyond</strong></p>
<p><img alt="reliability" class="size-full wp-image-8330 alignright" height="129" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Reliability.jpg" width="170" />Psychology has been subject to criticism over claims of questionable research practices and has been historically plagued by the under-reporting of both replications and null findings. As a result the psychology literature has become distorted, skewed towards exciting results that are often not reproducible. Improving the links between reliability and believability in psychology is key to facilitate future scientific knowledge in which we can trust. At the end of May <em>BMC Psychology</em> published a collection of articles which highlight the need to improve reproducibility in Psychology. An overview of the collection, <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/psychology-replication">Psychology: replication and beyond</a>, edited by Section Editor <a href="http://www.psy.herts.ac.uk/pub/klaws/index.html">Keith Laws</a>, is summarized in this <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0135-2">editorial</a>. One of the articles in the collection that was particularly popular with our readers was a <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0134-3">debate article</a> by <a href="http://www.coyneoftherealm.com/">James C. Coyne</a>, where he discussed his viewpoint that replication initiatives do not provide a general solution to the problem of reproducibility in psychology.</p>

<p>Many of the findings in published psychological literature are unreliable; an excess of positive results, methodological limitations, and an absence of null findings has distorted the evidence base, leading to false conclusions and undermining scientific progress. In December, <em>BMC Psychology</em> officially launched our Results free peer review trial with the publication of an <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0167-7">editorial</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Publication bias is a serious issue in academic publishing because it distorts the evidence available to clinicians, researchers and policymakers – potentially leading to false conclusions that could have severe consequences – <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/psychology/staff/kate-button/index.html">Katherine Button</a>, University of Bath</p></blockquote>
<p>‘Results-free’ means that editors and reviewers will be blinded to the study’s results during the initial stage of peer review. Research articles will be primarily assessed based on the scientific merits of the rationale and soundness of the methods alone, in the absence of results or discussion sections, which will be included later. It is thought that this could ensure the research is judged on the validity of the study’s design, and the question it is addressing, rather than the results or outcome of the study.</p>

            <p><em><img />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Is the job of introductory psychology textbooks to present students with a favourable and neat impression of psychology or to give them a warts and all account of the field? This is a key question raised by a new analysis of the treatment of controversial theories and <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/foundations-sand">recognised myths</a> by 24 best-selling US introductory psychology texts.</p>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-016-9539-7">Writing in <em>Current Psychology</em></a>, Christopher Ferguson at Stetson University and his colleagues at Texas A&amp;M International University conclude that intro textbooks often have difficulty covering <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/the-10-most-controversial-psychology.html">controversial topics</a> with care, and that whether intentionally or not, they are frequently presenting students with a liberal-leaning, over-simplified perspective, as well propagating or failing to challenge <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/29/10-of-the-most-widely-believed-myths-in-psychology/">myths</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/psychologys-10-greatest-case-studies.html">urban legends</a>.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the daunting task that confronts textbook authors, Ferguson and his colleagues call on them to aspire to tell the full story. “That may mean telling our students about a psychology that is a little messy, muddled, and doesn’t always have definitive answers,” they write. “But, if that’s the truth, that’s what the psychology students are paying to learn about, not the fantasy we may like to believe is true.”</p>
<p><span id="more-16176"></span></p>
<p>Ferguson and his team examined textbook coverage of seven areas of research consisting of findings which might be considered particularly appealing or unappealing to textbook authors with liberal leanings, and/or which could be prone to alarmist interpretation. This included research on whether media violence incites aggression; the stereotype threat (the notion that performance differences between groups are exaggerated by the fear of conforming to stereotypes); the narcissism epidemic (the idea that today’s youth are more narcissistic than youth in the past); that smacking/spanking children leads to aggression and other negative outcomes; that there are multiple intelligences; that human behaviour is explained by evolutionary theories related to mate selection and sexual competition (in this case, the authors assumed liberal authors would prefer not to cover this research); and controversy around antidepressant medication.</p>
<p>The researchers looked to see if textbook authors presented the evidence as more definitive than it is in these areas, or only presented one side of the arguments. They found that there was biased treatment of media violence and stereotype threat by half or more of the books, and of multiple intelligences and spanking by a third. A quarter of books failed to deal with controversy around antidepressants. Evolutionary theories were neglected by a fifth of the books and presented in biased fashion by one quarter. “We believe that these errors are consistent with an indoctrination, however intentional, into certain beliefs or hypotheses that may be ‘dear’ to a socio-politically homogenous psychological community,” Ferguson and his colleagues said.</p>
<p>They also looked at textbook treatment of various psychology myths and urban legends, including <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/23/the-truth-behind-the-story-of-kitty-genovese-and-the-bystander-effect/">the frequently exaggerated story of the murder of Kitty Genovese</a>, which is often cited as a perfect example of the “bystander effect”: our reduced likelihood of intervening to help when in the company of a greater number of other people who could help. Nearly half the books perpetuated the myth that 33 witnesses watched the killing of Genovese  without doing anything to help her. Meanwhile, nearly three quarters of the books failed to challenge <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-10-brain-myth-explained-in-60-seconds/">the popular misconception that we only use ten per cent of our brains</a>, or that listening to Mozart makes us smarter. And 70 per cent of the books gave the French neurologist Paul Broca undue credit for localising speech function in the brain: the researchers say that the theory of the cortical localisation of speech was first put forward by Ernest Auburtin. “It is surprising to see so few textbooks addressing common misconceptions about psychology,” they said.</p>
<p>Ferguson and his co-authors acknowledged that some of the textbooks they examined were excellent, and they admitted that their selection of topics and myths to investigate was far from random: this subjectivity must surely weaken their claims that there is an ideological agenda influencing textbook coverage. It’s worth remembering too that the textbooks they examined were American, so the same biases and oversights may not be present in European and other texts. Also, they looked at editions available in 2012: it’s possible that textbook authors may have updated to a more balanced and considered approach in more recent additions, especially since <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">the replication crisis</a> in psychology has only intensified in recent years.</p>
<p>But despite these caveats, this new analysis is just the latest to suggest that some of our leading introductory texts may be presenting an oversimplified and sometimes error-prone version of psychology to our students. After all, in recent years, we’ve also covered research by Richard Griggs at Florida State University that’s found <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/30/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-about-psychologys-most-famous-case-study/">biased textbook treatment of Milgram’s classic studies on obedience</a>, outdated accounts of the story of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/30/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-about-psychologys-most-famous-case-study/">Phineas Gage</a>, biased coverage of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/25/textbook-coverage-of-this-classic-social-psychology-study-has-become-increasingly-biased/">Asch’s studies of conformity</a>, and of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment</a>.

<p>Vacant job roles should be filled on the candidate’s skills, experience and knowledge, not their identity. But that means dodging our deeply held stereotypes, such as men being a natural fit for decision-making roles like management and women for care-giving professions. Evidence suggests this also applies to sexual orientation, meaning, for instance, that CVs that indicate the candidate is homosexual (by mentioning college experience in a group promoting gay rights, for example) are <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00669.x/full">likely to be seen by recruiters</a> as a better match for care-giving roles. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/101/12/1687/">New research</a> from the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em> adds to this, suggesting that merely looking gay is enough for a candidate to be treated in a biased way by recruiters.</p>
<p><span id="more-16158"></span></p>
<p>Nicholas Rule and his colleagues from universities at Toronto and Stanford conducted several studies, each involving between 68 and 201 participants. In every study, participants read about a target job, in most cases either a nurse or engineer, and then estimated the likely success of 90 different candidates, based only on a photo provided of each one. These cropped photos were originally taken from dating sites, ensuring that sexual orientation data was known by the researchers for each candidate.</p>
<p>Participants repeatedly predicted gay candidates would have more success applying to nursing positions than heterosexual candidates, and they predicted the reverse pattern for the engineer position. This effect was also found when participants were asked to say who they would prefer to teach their child maths (straight men preferred) or English (gay men). In another study, there was also a relative preference for gay men applying to paediatric roles over surgeon roles, although heterosexual men were predicted to have more success than gay men for both medical roles. Participants who had previous hiring experience were just as influenced by sexual orientation cues as other participants.</p>
<p>What’s going on? <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/07/30/mens-sexual-orientation-recognised-in-a-fraction-of-a-second/">Previous evidence from this research group</a> suggests that people can rapidly detect sexual orientation from viewing faces, and that this “gaydar” goes beyond interpreting stereotypical cues like clothing or gesture, reflecting instead our ability to read something more phenotypic, coded into the face or body. However <a href="http://https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4731319/pdf/nihms706356.pdf">recent research</a> that used photos from a dating site to attempt to replicate Rule’s general gaydar effect revealed a potential confound: photo quality tended to be higher for men who were gay. If this was true of the photos used in the current research, it would muddy the researchers’ conclusions.</p>
<p>Even if photo quality happens to be what we use to judge sexual orientation (the alternative hypothesis that we simply don’t trust people who take good photos to be good engineers seems implausible), we should still take heed of these new findings, especially when other people’s prospects are in our hands. Thankfully, there was a suggestion that the bias was assailable, at least to some extent. When each photo was accompanied by a GPA score showing the candidate’s success in studying for the profession, a low-GPA score seemed to trump any effect of sexuality cues in facial appearance.</p>
<p>As real life job picks always involve considering some relevant information, this is somewhat reassuring; however Rule’s team thought a single relevant score may be <em>too</em> obvious a guide for decision making, and that the effect of sexuality cues in facial appearance would hold their own when accompanied by more complex (and representative) supporting information, as would be found in real-life contexts. They conducted a further study that supported this view, suggesting facial cues to sexuality are likely to persist in spite of more relevant information.</p>
<p>However, I wasn’t entirely comfortable with the methodological design of this particular study, so I’m skeptical that sexuality cues would have such strong influence. For instance, it used photos (and profiles) procured from LinkedIn rather than from a dating site, and the researchers presumed sexual orientation based on the person’s workplace – LGBT organisation or otherwise – which seems a noisy and inaccurate criterion to use.</p>
<p>Another of the new studies provided more reason for hope. It showed that simply asking participants to be fair and objective in their judgments stopped them from favouring heterosexual men for the engineering role, although their bias for gay men for nursing positions remained. This suggests diligence on the part of recruiters could help correct this ‘insidious’ tendency.</p>

<p>Cosmic ray induced radiation contains heavy-ions such as <sup>56</sup>Fe which could have detrimental effects on the cognition of humans. Astronauts exposed to such radiation may experience long term health risks while on timely space missions. New research presents the effects of cosmic radiation on the cognition of mice, which helps us identify potential risks for space travelers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_eNvL3Xqnrk"><em><br />
</em></a>Researchers assessed cognitive functioning in mice exposed to <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation at various doses. At two-weeks, a degradation of object recognition and network stability was found at the lowest (0.1 Gy) and highest (0.4 Gy) irradiation doses. However, this was not apparent from the intermediate dose (0.2 Gy).</p>
<p>This study shows how exposure to <sup>56</sup>Fe ions at particular doses has a direct effect on object recognition in mice. Astronauts in space are likely to be subject to the lowest irradiation dose, and so, could be at risk of cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Cyanobacteria have the ability to thrive in extreme environmental conditions, such as extreme cold where they are key primary producers. As many lineages survive such harsh conditions, it is uncertain how they do and whether this is the result of an evolutionary adaption.</p>
<img alt="ice #4" class="alignright wp-image-8322 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Ice-Thomas-Leth-Olsen-Flickr-CC-300x200.jpg" title="Thomas Leth-Olsen (Flickr, CC)" width="300" />
<p>The Cyanobacterium <em>Phormidesmis priestleyi </em>can be found in the Arctic, Antarctic and cold alpine habitats. In this study, the sequencing of a <em>P. priestleyi</em> BC1401 isolate from the Greenland Ice Sheet has been undertaken. Researchers examined the specific genes associated with cold shock response and extracellular polymeric substance generation.</p>
<p>The results show that these substances may enable cyanobacteria to withstand the effects of extreme cold. However, this feature is found throughout the phylum and is not a unique characteristic of <em>P. prisetleyi. </em>It is implied that the key to understanding why this extremophile is so successful in cold systems may be found in its regulation of the extracellular polymeric substances.</p>

<p><a href="http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2936-3"><strong>Canine fear and aggression</strong></a></p>
<p>Why are some dogs more prone to stress, separation anxiety and aggression than others? These behaviors can cause a burden in our society, though let’s not be quick to point the finger at the dogs themselves, as the answer may be down to canine genomic expression.</p>
<img alt="smilling-dog-allen-skyy-flickr-cc" class="wp-image-8323 size-medium alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Smilling-Dog-Allen-Skyy-Flickr-CC-300x200.jpg" title=" Allen Skyy (Flickr, CC)" width="300" />
<p>Hundreds of dogs from a variety of breeds were analyzed using genome-wide association (GWA) mapping for fear and aggression traits. Key associations were discovered between particular genes and specific behaviors. The results showed that known loci variants IGF1 and HMGA2 (for small body size) were associated with separation anxiety, touch sensitivity, owner directed aggression and dog rivalry. Two loci between GNAT3 and CD36 (on chr18, near IGSF1 on ChrX) correlated with touch-sensitivity, non-social fear, as well as aggressive behavior towards unfamiliar dogs and humans.</p>
<p>In dogs, these loci are known to correlate with particular morphologies, and to be highly evolutionarily-selected. CD36 was found to be enriched in regions of the amygdala and hypothalamus, while other genes were well expressed in the amygdala to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  It is implied that at these loci, the variants of reduced fear may be an after effect of canine domestication.</p>

 CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity by employing short sequences, termed spacers, that guide Cas proteins to cleave foreign DNA1,2. Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems are streamlined versions in which a single Cas protein bound to RNA recognizes and cleaves targeted sequences3,4. The programmable nature of these minimal systems has enabled their repurposing as a versatile technology that is broadly revolutionizing biological and clinical research5. However, current CRISPR-Cas technologies are based solely on systems from isolated bacteria, leaving untapped the vast majority of enzymes from organisms that have not been cultured. Metagenomics, the sequencing of DNA extracted from natural microbial communities, provides access to the genetic material of a huge array of uncultivated organisms6,7. Here, using genome-resolved metagenomics, we identified novel CRISPR-Cas systems, including the first reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life. This divergent Cas9 protein was found in little-studied nanoarchaea as part of an active CRISPR-Cas system. In bacteria, we discovered two previously unknown systems, CRISPR-CasX and CRISPR-CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet identified. Notably, all required functional components were identified by metagenomics, enabling validation of robust in vivo RNA-guided DNA interference activity in E. coli. Interrogation of environmental microbial communities combined with in vivo experiments allows access to an unprecedented diversity of genomes whose content will expand the repertoire of microbe-based biotechnologies.

In recognition of the long-standing importance of microscopy and increasing use of video for understanding cell biological processes, PLOS sponsored the 2016 American Society for Cell Biology Celldance video contest. With support from ASCB, the “<strong><a href="http://www.ascb.org/2016/ascb-post/three-new-ascb-celldance-video-awards-take-you-inside-living-cells/" target="_blank">Tell Your Own Cell Story</a></strong>” videos document membrane remodeling during cell migration, invasion and metastasis; dendritic cell migration during the immune response and chromosome movement during cell division. Through these videos attendees at the ASCB meeting were able to see the personal, creative side of scientists not typically presented to a wide audience.  PLOS interviewed these scientists by email following the conference.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/193753945/38c3a4a14a" target="_blank"><strong>Daniela Cimini’s lab at Virginia Tech University</strong></a> studies the molecules and structures during mitosis that ensure accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Related work of the Cimini group addresses the causes and consequences of abnormal chromosome numbers in normal and cancer cells, including <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147420" target="_blank">kinetochore-microtubule attachment</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006564" target="_blank">chromosome segregation irregularities</a></strong>. She has a <strong><a href="http://www.faculty.biol.vt.edu/cimini/movies.html" target="_blank">long-standing interest in use of video</a></strong> to describe the dynamic nature of mitosis and considers video microscopy “particularly important for disseminating ideas to non-scientists or scientists that are not expert in a particular field, which may include funders and policymakers.” In creating the videos, scientists in Cimini’s lab – comfortable giving lectures or presenting work to colleagues – experienced how difficult it was to present their work in front of a camera. During production, scientists, writers and videographer interacted to plan and execute the project, said Cimini. “It was very interesting to see all these different perspectives and areas of expertise come together.” Cimini has been publishing with PLOS since 2009.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/193753622/2824ddc8d7" target="_blank">Roberto Weigert’s lab at the National Institutes of Health</a></strong> focuses on unraveling basic molecular mechanisms regulating <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081987" target="_blank">trafficking events</a></strong> in mammalian tissues, with a particular emphasis on membrane remodeling. The lab pioneered a new technique to <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699287/" target="_blank">image these processes live</a></strong> in multicellular organisms and to investigate <strong><a href="http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/6/4/a017012.long" target="_blank">membrane dynamics during endocytosis</a></strong>, tumor progression, invasion and metastasis. The work in their Celldance video highlights this technique but also the collaborative use of new technologies to enhance research discussions among lab members. For Weigert’s team, while the most difficult part in making the video was “avoiding the use of jargon and other technical terms that are part of our daily life,” the experience provided them an exciting opportunity “to talk about the overall theme of our research rather than focusing on a single project.” Wiegert personally thinks scientists play an important role in direct dissemination of research findings. “I find that when scientific messages are disseminated more widely by an intermediary, there is a loss in translation. Hearing the voice of the scientists that are doing the job is a more compelling and direct way to communicate the messages.”</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/193754229/305f258b22" target="_blank"><strong>Matthieu Piel’s lab at the Institut Curie, National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)</strong></a> is fascinated by how cells determine front and back – cell polarity – in the context of cell migration and cell division. Members of the Piel lab documented through video that when dendritic cells – key participants of the immune response responsible for presenting antigens to T cells – <strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10997" target="_blank">migrate through narrow passages</a></strong> they can be squeezed so hard that nuclear proteins leak out of and cytosolic proteins leak into the nucleus. This has serious implications for cell survival. For Piel, the most challenging part of creating the video was not what to show or how to show it, “I knew which movies I wanted to show and I wrote in a way that included them all,” he says, but how to tell this dynamic story in five minutes. Piel often watches short science videos and thinks there is a need for more of this forum for communicating science—kids especially should watch more of them, he says. When asked about funders and policy makers, however, he is less certain. “Maybe they would be more interested to know about scientists. The few I know are usually more interested about people.” Piel has been publishing with PLOS since 2008; his early work examined <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002462" target="_blank">structural proteins involved in membrane ruffling</a></strong>. In addition to basic research, the lab uses nano- and micro-fabrication techniques to develop (and patent) tools to study cell polarity through control and modulation of key physical and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004795" target="_blank">chemical parameters of the cell microenvironment</a></strong>.</p>

<p>All three labs embraced the challenge of presenting complex science in a visually engaging yet comprehensible way that is also representative of dynamic cellular movements observed in response to environmental stimuli.

<p>Men with tattoos are likely to provide serious competition for a woman’s attention, at least in the eyes of other guys, but women themselves actually aren’t that impressed. That’s according to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691631087X">research</a> published in the journal <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em>, where 2584 heterosexual men and women from Poland viewed photos of shirtless men, sometimes digitally modified so that their arm was emblazoned with a smallish black tattoo depicting a generic symbol. The 215 men among the participants rated the inked bods as more attractive than tattoo-free comparison models, which presumably reflects in part what they think women are looking for in an ideal male partner. But the female participants didn’t rate the tattooed gentlemen as more attractive; moreover, they considered them worse prospects as partners and parents.</p>
<p>Women did rate tattooed men as healthier, which researchers Andrzej Galbarczyk and Anna Ziomkiewicz think might be because tattooing is a costly signal of strong health, involving as it does a painful experience and risk of infection. Normally, perceived health correlates with perceived attractiveness, but this positive connotation of the tattoos might have been counteracted by the fact the women also associated the tats with masculinity and aggression: not such a positive thing if you consider that another marker of masculinity, high testosterone, is known to be associated with affairs and higher risk of assault on a partner. All in all, the women’s judgments were swayed by the (admittedly small) tattoos far less than were the male participants’ judgments. Heterosexual men who are planning a trip to their local tattoo parlour might be surprised to learn from this research that their new ink is likely to cause a bigger stir among the gentlemen than the ladies.</p>

<p>Group loyalty is woven into our DNA. After being allocated to a category on the flimsiest of grounds, such as their matching shirt colour, children will show impressive favouritism toward their new group members, and antipathy toward outsiders. No wonder that once children learn about genders, and become aware of their own – which begins to happen in earnest from around age three – they soon after usually begin to show profound signs of loyalty toward and preference for their own gender. As the authors of a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12642/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new study</a> in <em>Child Development</em> put it, “Around the world, girls tend to play with girls, whereas boys tend to play with boys. Such stark separation is stunning, yet as adults we tend to accept this segregation without a thought and sometimes even encourage it.”</p>
<p>The aim of the new research was to find out how gender-biased beliefs and behaviour develop from age four to five. The researchers hope their findings might help encourage children to be less biased against the opposite gender, and therefore “benefit relationships between girls and boys, and future relationships between women and men.”</p>
<p><span id="more-15947"></span></p>
<p>May Ling Halim and her colleagues measured the gender-based beliefs and attitudes of 246 girls and boys in northeastern USA when they were aged four, and then caught up with them again when they were aged five, to test more attitudes and look for signs of gender bias in their behaviour. The children were from a range of ethnic backgrounds, including Mexican, Chinese, Dominican and African American.</p>
<p>When the kids were age four, the researchers asked them about: their happiness at being a boy or girl (most were happy, although 9 per cent were not); belief in gender stability (“when you grow up will you be a mommy or daddy?”); and awareness of gender stereotypes (“here’s a boy and a girl, which of them do you think likes trucks? The girl, the boy, or both?”). The children chose the stereotypical answers around 66 per cent of the time.</p>
<p>At age five, the researchers asked some of the same questions again, plus new ones, including about “gender consistency”, which tapped the children’s awareness of the fact that gender remains unchanged even following behaviours atypical for that gender, such as: “If a girl had her hair cut really short, would she become a boy?”.</p>
<p>The researchers also measured awareness of “gender flexibility”: instances where the children had shown knowledge of gender stereotypes when they were four, but now aged five showed a more liberal attitude, for instance saying that both the boy and girl would like trucks. And the researchers asked the five-year-olds how they felt about boys and girls in general (they answered using a scale made up of happy, neutral and frowning faces) and what they thought about how smart and mean girls and boys tend to be.</p>
<p>Overall, at age five, the children were very positive about their own gender, but twelve per cent felt negatively. Conversely, on average the children were somewhat negative about the opposite gender, with girls being more negative about boys than vice versa. The researchers surmised this might be because girls had internalised the stereotype that “girls are nice and good, whereas boys are bad”.</p>
<p>Then there were the two behavioural measures at age five: the children were asked to allocate coins to a drawing created by a group of boys or to another created by a group of girls (on average the children allocated more coins to their own gender); and the children indicated where they would choose to sit in a row of chairs if a boy was sat on the first chair, or a girl. A boy choosing to sit near the boy but far from the girl was taken as a sign of own-gender bias. Overall, to the researchers’ surprise, the children didn’t show an own-gender bias in where they chose to sit.</p>
<p>The researchers were most interested in how early gender attitudes and knowledge shape later attitudes and behaviour. One key finding was that four-year-olds who were happier about belonging to their own gender, and who were more aware of gender stereotypes, tended to express more favourable attitudes toward their own gender at age five. On the other hand, holding more favourable attitudes toward the opposite gender tended to go together with greater awareness of gender consistency (realising your gender doesn’t change just because you act in gender atypical ways), and a more flexible view of stereotypes, such as coming to realise that both boys and girls might like trucks.</p>
<p>What about signs of gender bias in the children’s behaviour? The only measure related to behaviour was how much the children believed the other gender was smart and not mean. That is, more positive views of the other gender correlated with less own-gender bias in the coin allocation and seating tests.</p>
<p>One other tidbit: there was some suggestion that own-gender favouritism was greater among children from ethnic cultures, such as Dominican and Chinese-American, where there is a greater emphasis on gender roles.</p>
<p>Halim and her colleagues cautioned that their findings need replication, but they believe they may offer clues to how to help foster more friendly interpersonal relationships between boys and girls. The researchers don’t make this explicit, but presumably their thinking is that if we encourage young children to challenge gender stereotypes, and to see gender as a more flexible concept, then they might be more inclined to display more friendly behaviour towards the opposite gender, which could eventually trickle down to reduce sexism when they grow into adults.</p>

<p>Life would be awfully confusing if we weren’t able to recognise familiar faces. It’s a skill most of us take for granted, and we rarely stop to consider the impressive cognitive wizardry involved. But some of us are better at it than others: in the last decade or so it’s become apparent that around two per cent of the population are born with a severe face-recognition impairment (known as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/12/20/whats-it-like-to-be-face-blind/">congenital prosopagnosia</a>), that there is a similar proportion of “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/10/super-recognisers-more-than-just-clever-lab-rats/">super-recognisers</a>” with unusually exceptional face-recognition skills, and that the rest of us are on a spectrum in between.</p>
<p>Where do you think your abilities lie? A <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17470218.2016.1161058">new study</a> in the <em>Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</em> suggests that, unless you are severely impaired at face-recognition, you probably don’t have much insight into this question. When participants were confronted with the question: “Overall, from 1-‘very poor’ to 9-‘very good’, how would you describe your general ability to recognise faces?”, the research found that most participants’ answers bore no relation to their performance on a range of lab-based face-recognition tests.</p>
<p><span id="more-15734"></span></p>
<p>Romina Palermo at the University of Western Australia led a large multi-national team that tested the face-recognition skills of nearly 300 undergrads recruited in Italy, Australia, and Belgium. The research involved established face-recognition tests and specially designed new ones. These tasks required participants to look at specific faces and then pick them out from among a larger range of faces later on, including in new lighting conditions and from different angles. One newly designed task involved watching film clips of people conversing, and then later identifying the actors’ faces from a display that featured several new faces.</p>
<p>Before they completed the face-recognition challenges, the participants answered questions about how well they thought they would do, including the single item question mentioned above or another that read “How well do you think you will perform (from 1 to 9) on studying and recognising faces from your own race”. There was also an established 15-item survey that involved questions like “I can easily follow actors in a movie” but this scale has been criticised for also including a few items not related specifically to face-recognition; and finally, there was a new, mammoth in-depth survey with 77-items that tapped participants’ beliefs about their basic face-recognition skills, but also what friends and family said about their skills, and there were other items covering experiences in specific contexts, such as “I have difficulty recognizing a colleague / student if I see his/her face outside my workplace / study.”</p>
<p>Overall, there was no correlation between participants’ scores on the single-item questions about their abilities and their actual face-recognition performance. There was minimal correlation between the 15-item survey and one of the face tests (the correlation was -0.14; note that higher scores on this test equal greater perceived difficulty hence the negative correlation). And there was a moderate correlation (0.30) between answers to the 77-item survey and test performance: this modest level of insight is similar to what’s seen when people are asked about their general memory abilities. So we might be capable of some insight into our face-recognition skills, but only if we’re led through a comprehensive series of nearly 80 questions, and even then it’s likely our answers will only correlate modestly with our actual performance.</p>
<p>The researchers also tested 13 participants who had registered with a congenital prosopagnosia website as having everyday problems with face recognition: they rated themselves as having poorer face-recognition skills than the students on the 15-item survey, which isn’t really a surprise as they complained of face-recognition problems. But crucially the prosopagnosics were no better than the students at identifying their level of ability relative to other people with prosopagnosia. In other words, they knew they had problems, but they didn’t have much insight into just how bad they were. However, a larger sample is needed to confirm this result.</p>
<p>“In summary,” the researchers said, “the ability of self-report questionnaires to measure insight into face recognition ability, even when the items concentrate on face recognition, appears limited.” They added that: “People with very poor face recognition skills may be more aware of their difficulties than the typical population, but such insight is clearly not universal.”</p>
<p>Assuming these results are accurate, why are most of us fairly useless at judging our face recognition abilities? The researchers speculated that part of the reason might be that, compared with, say, our language skills, which are tested regularly through schooling, we never actually receive any formal tests of our face recognition abilities. Also, they suggested that perhaps our subjective sense of our facial recognition skills is easily confused by our sense of our more general person-recognition abilities, which could be based on other cues, such as clothing, gait or tone of voice.</p>
<p>One limitation of this research was its focus on young adults. Face-recognition skills are known to mature and peak at around age 30. It will be interesting to see if middle-aged and older adults have better insight into their face identification skills than young people do.</p>

<p>Ten years ago on this day, <em>PLOS ONE</em> published its first papers, thus embarking on its stated mission to be an open public venue for all rigorous scientific research from every discipline: a journal that promotes open science and access to the peer-reviewed literature for all.</p>
<p>Being designed to be a home for all research, <em>PLOS ONE</em> always had the potential to be a large journal. Yet who would have foreseen the publication of more than 165,000 articles in its first decade? This enormous success would not have been possible without the support of the academic community submitting these papers, the efforts of the editorial board, the peer reviewers assessing submitted papers and last but not least the staff at the journal, past and present. Thank you all! An appreciation of <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s history and its achievements is the topic of a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2016/12/20/the-ride-of-your-life-one-to-the-power-of-10/" target="_blank">separate post on the EveryONE blog</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As the newly-appointed Editor-in-Chief of <em>PLOS ONE</em>, I am privileged and very lucky indeed to be leading this great journal into its second decade. The environment that we are operating in has changed significantly during the past decade, stimulated to a degree by our own success. Other journals are now using similar publishing models, which is a welcome development. The more Open Access journals operating without any subjective selection criteria of their published output beyond scientific validity, the better it is for science. At <em>PLOS ONE</em>, we continue to be a <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/missing-pieces" target="_blank">home to all research</a></strong>, whether it is a step-wise advance, a replication, a negative result or a study that fundamentally changes the thinking in a field.</p>
<p>We cannot rest there, and <em>PLOS ONE</em> needs to continue its mission to facilitate and drive open science. Making scientific papers open to read, to utilize them and to distribute them is only one facet of the scientific process. Opening this process further promises significant advances. An example is the sharing of primary research data, which in many instances can stimulate follow-up studies by others. Already we have a strong data availability policy in place, and we will continue to refine its implementation and will continue to drive further efforts towards rewarding those scientists who do share their primary data.</p>
<p>Sharing scientific results and conclusions more broadly also needs to take place earlier in the process, so that others can build on new findings as soon as possible. At PLOS, we are strong supporters of preprint servers to communicate research. <em>PLOS ONE</em> is an ideal partner for such efforts, given our mission to publish all rigorous scientific conclusions. Embedding preprints into the publishing process, <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/" target="_blank">as we have already done with bioRxiv</a></strong>, increases its transparency. Going forward, we need to strive to also open our peer review process, lending strong support to the wider adoption of this model.</p>
<p>Other publishers and journals are working on similar themes, and we applaud this. While these initiatives mean a faster and larger increase in the global number of open articles published and available globally to the scientific community, the submissions to <em>PLOS ONE</em> have decreased, posing the question of our continuing unique value in this market. There will be challenges, but irrespective of our size, <em>PLOS ONE</em> will always play an important role towards PLOS’ broader goal as a nonprofit organization to <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/11/a-plos-response-to-open-in-action-with-open-science/" target="_blank">support and advocate open science</a></strong>.</p>
<p>We are driven by the belief that open science benefits everyone involved in the scientific process, which thrives best in an environment of collaboration. We are driven by serving the community and not by the need for the high profit margins made elsewhere in publishing, so that funding resources in the sciences are used in the most productive way—to conduct scientific research. And at <em>PLOS ONE</em> in particular we are driven to publish a journal that serves communication among scientists from all the natural sciences and engineering, from medical research, as well as from the related social sciences and humanities. Our strong board of academic editors from all disciplines enables the entire scientific community to come together, making <em>PLOS ONE</em> their journal.</p>
<p>As part of this mission, <em>PLOS ONE</em> has the opportunity as well as the obligation to play its role in addressing the challenges science and society are facing. We can and need to assume a strong role promoting scientifically rigorous, open, fact-based debates that facilitate solutions to these challenges. As we advance towards this goal, we all at <em>PLOS ONE</em> are truly grateful for the continuing, strong support of the scientific community, and building on this we are confident that we can be as successful going into our second decade as we have been these past ten years.</p>

<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0056-1">Group size, survival and surprisingly short lifespan in socially foraging bats</a></p>
<p>While many bat species roost in large flocks, more stable social groups with individuals also foraging together are relatively rare. The South American Pallas’s mastiff bat lives in such groups, with individuals eavesdropping on the echolocation calls of other group members to help locate their insect prey.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at Max Planck Institute of Ornithology, led by Yann Gager, conducted the first detailed investigation of social structure in these bats. They predicted that the bats would live in small groups, because of the difficulty of co-ordinated flight and likelihood of acoustic interference if the bats foraged in big groups. Or, to put it another way, too many bats would just get in each other’s way. This prediction was proven correct: Pallas’s mastiff bats live in small (but stable) groups of 3-13 individuals.</p>
<p>A more surprising finding was the short lifespan of these bats; just 1.8 years on average, over three times less than the average bat lifespan. The researchers suggest this result’s from the Pallas’s mastiff bats highly specialised diet, feeding on ephemeral insect swarms that only appear at dawn and dusk. A life lived on this “energetic edge” seems to be a short one.</p>
<p><strong>Nematodes in the tropics</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0069-9">What’s in the tank? Nematodes and other major components of the meiofauna of bromeliad phytotelms in lowland Panama</a></p>
<p>Nematode worms are a diverse group of more than 20,000 species (including the classic model species <em>C.elegans</em>) and are remarkably abundant; one estimate suggested that 4 out of every 5 multicellular organisms on the planet are nematodes. Yet for all their abundance, we know astonishingly little about their lives in the wild. For example, there are some indications that nematodes are less species-rich in the tropics than in temperate zones, which would be in stark contrast to most other animal groups. However, this might just reflect our ignorance of nematode diversity and abundance in these regions.</p>
<p>Gerhard Zotz and Walter Traunspurger looked to fill these gaps by investigating nematode diversity in the freshwater habitats created by water trapped in the crowns of tank bromeliad plants in Panama. They found 89 species of nematodes, of varying feeding types, with individual plants containing up to 25 different species. Notably, after rotifers, nematodes were the most abundant animals in these micro-habitats. This suggests that nematodes are actually likely to exist in considerable diversity and abundance in the wider tropical ecosystem; we just need to look for them.</p>

<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0071-2">Vertebrate bacterial gut diversity: size also matters</a></p>
<p>An increasing body of research suggests that diversity of bacteria in the gut has significant implications for their animal hosts. While many factors seem to affect bacterial diversity within an individual’s gut, a relatively simple one had not previously been studied: size. It is well established that in other habitats greater size generally means greater diversity, so is this also true in the habitat of an animal’s gut?</p>
<p>A team of French researchers at the INRS, led by Jean-Jacques Godon, compared bacterial diversity in the guts of 71 species of birds, reptiles, and mammals (including humans). They found a strong correlation between gut size and diversity, with larger animals generally having a wider range of bacteria present in their guts. Gut volume should therefore be considered along with other parameters when explaining why diversity varies among species.</p>
<p><strong>Boundaries are important for urban rabbits</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0083-y">Importance of latrine communication in European rabbits shifts along a rural-to-urban gradient</a></p>
<p>For many mammals, communication networks are based around deposition of excreta in latrines. These latrines can be formed at the edge of territorial boundaries, for between-group communication, or around key areas of the home range, for within-group communication.</p>
<p>Which type of latrine communication is more important for European rabbits seems to depend on whether they live in rural or urban areas. Urban rabbits locate latrines in higher proportions at the edge of their territories, in contrast to rural rabbits who locate more latrines around their burrows.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8262" style="width: 250px;"><img alt="European rabbit" class="size-medium wp-image-8262" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Rabbit-240x300.jpg" width="240" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">European rabbit</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Rural rabbits seem then to prioritise communication within their social groups. For urban rabbits, with their smaller group sizes but higher population densities, between-group communication seems to be more important; when you have so many neighbours crammed around you, ensuring everyone knows their boundaries becomes crucial. This research provided a novel insight into the alterations man-made habitats can make to animal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen science: through the looking glass</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-16-supplement-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Citizen science through the OPAL lens</span></a></p>
<p>Citizen science – the collection of data by members of the public in collaboration with professional scientists – has particular potential for the field of ecology. Ecological studies often require data to be collected from far-flung locations over a period of many years; very difficult for a single – or even multiple – research groups to gather. Utilising the wider public can allow the collection of more expansive data sets, with the added benefit of engaging the public in ecological research.</p>
<p>Of course citizen science comes with many challenges, which were discussed in this collection of articles evaluating the success of the UK’s Open Air Laboratories national citizen science network, now approaching its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. What makes lay-people keen to become involved with research, the quality of the data they gather, and the results arising from these studies were among the topics discussed.</p>
<p>Collection organiser Poppy Fraser Lakeman discussed these issues in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/07/22/citizen-science-looking-glass/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">on our blog</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>A cockroach in disguise</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0089-5"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chemical disguise of myrmecophilous cockroaches and its implications for understanding nestmate recognition mechanisms in leaf-cutting ants</span></a></p>
<p><em>Attaphila</em> cockroaches make a living by sneaking into the nests of leaf-cutter ants. These ants farm a fungus that provides an ideal food source for the invading cockroaches. Research led by Volker Nehring and Patrizia d’Ettorre at the University of Copenhagen investigated how the cockroaches steal food from a heavily guarded ant colony without being detected.</p>
<p>Behavioural experiments suggest that cockroaches are able to disguise themselves with the colony-specific cuticular chemical profile used by the ants to recognise their nest-mates; cockroaches were not attacked by ants from the same colony they live in, but were attacked by ants from other colonies. Chemical analysis confirmed that the cockroaches copy their host colonies specific cuticular chemical profile.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8263" style="width: 293px;"><img alt="An Attaphila male on the fungus garden of a leaf-cutting ant colony" class="size-medium wp-image-8263" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Cockroach-283x300.jpg" width="283" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">An <em>Attaphila</em> male on the fungus garden of a leaf-cutting ant colony. From Nehring et al. 2016</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Studying these cockroaches also enables us to learn more about how the ants themselves communicate. Cockroach species with lower concentrations of cuticular chemicals were less likely to be attacked by ants from other colonies. This supports the asymmetric model of ant nest-mate recognition; rather than ‘knowing’ their colonies specific profile, ants just respond to any unfamiliar cues; hence cockroaches with fewer chemical cues are less likely to find their disguise being uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>Hunting as a management tool?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0098-4"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hunting as a management tool? Cougar-human conflict is positively related to hunting pressure</span></a></p>
<p>When large predators roam near human settlements, conflict can become inevitable. A common approach to managing these pressures is to allow human hunters to remove predators near human settlements. The assumption is that this reduces human-predator conflict: an assumption this research challenges.</p>
<p>Analysing a 30 year dataset on hunter-caused cougar mortality in Canada, researchers found a clear pattern of greater cougar trophy-hunting <em>increasing</em> human-cougar conflict. They note that trophy hunters focus on the largest males, yet it is usually smaller, younger males that are more likely to come into conflict with humans. Removing large resident males may also disrupt cougar social structures, dispersing cougars over larger areas and making conflict with humans more likely.</p>
<p>The work adds to a growing body of evidence that hunting provides a poor – and often counter-productive – method for managing conflict with large predators.</p>
<p>Authors Kristine Teichman, Bogdan Cristescu and Chris Darimont discussed their research in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/10/27/trophy-hunting-unexpected-consequences-cougar-human-conflict/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">on our blog</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dinosaur distributions</strong></p>

<p>A long-standing – and somewhat perplexing – problem in dinosaur ecology is the apparent high levels of diversity of large-bodied dinosaurs in North America during the Cretaceous period. Unlike modern-day large-bodied vertebrates where a few species, such as wolves and caribou, roam across very large areas, their dinosaur equivalents of 70 million years ago lived in much narrower ranges.</p>
<p>Thomas Cullen and David Evans at the University of Toronto assessed the reasons behind these patterns by studying fossil microsites from the late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada. Microsites are concentrated assemblages of small bones and teeth, thought to provide a good representation of community composition at the time they were deposited.</p>
<p>The prevailing theory to explain high dinosaur diversity is that these species were particularly sensitive to environmental changes, preventing them from roaming across large areas. The researchers tested this by comparing dinosaur diversity at two environmentally distinct microsites from the same time period. Contrary to this theory, there was no difference in relative abundance of different dinosaur taxa in these differing environments. A different explanation would appear to be required to explain this perplexing historical pattern.</p>

<p>The Clanwilliam cedar is one of South Africa’s most iconic trees. It is also one of its most endangered. Tracking declines in long-lived species like the Clanwilliam cedar is difficult due to a lack of historical data, but this study demonstrated a novel way of doing so using repeat photography.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Cape Town, led by Joseph White, tracked down 87 historical photos of Clanwilliam cedars (stretching back 80 years) and meticulously recreated these photos, creating a visual record of population changes. The photos suggest tree numbers declined significantly over this period, but also suggest which habitats are best suited to their survival, which should help focus future conservation efforts.</p>

            <p><em><img />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>To see a man’s face light up as he strokes a dog, to hear a child’s laughter as her hamster tickles her skin, it just seems obvious that animals are good for our state of mind. Let’s hope so because not only do millions of us own pets, but also animals are being used therapeutically in an increasing number of contexts, from residential care homes to airports, prisons, hospitals, schools and universities. Unfortunately, as detailed by psychologist Molly Crossman in her <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.22410/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience">new review</a> in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>, the research literature has simply not kept pace with the widespread embrace of animal contact as a form of therapy in itself, or as a therapy adjunct. In short, we don’t know whether animal contact is psychologically beneficial, and if it is, we have no idea how.</p>
<p><span id="more-15634"></span></p>
<p>After several decades of animal-human interaction research, Crossman explains that the evidence is mixed: some studies have found benefits, others have not. And the research has tended to be of poor quality. In relation to animal-based therapy or animal-assisted therapy, for example, those studies showing benefits have usually only looked over short-term outcomes; they’ve not compared the generalisability of effects from one animal to another; and they’ve typically had no control condition, so there’s no way of knowing if the apparent positive outcomes are simply due to the passage of time, or to any kind of sociable or pleasurable activity.</p>
<p>Another issue is that, for obvious reasons, animal-based therapy always requires the presence of a human handler, but existing studies have always failed to account for the effect of this person. This means it’s possible that any benefits are solely or partly down to the friendliness and company of the handler, as opposed to the animal.</p>
<p>Similarly most research on the benefits of pet ownership (as opposed to animal therapy) has been observational, rather than involving any experimental allocation of pets to some participants, with other participants placed in a no-pet control condition. Again, this makes it difficult to source any apparent benefits to animal companionship per se. “There is not yet sufficient evidence to conclude that companion animal ownership conveys benefits for human health,” Crossman writes.</p>
<p>Even if we assume that the apparent psychological benefits of animals are real, Crossman also explains that there has been virtually no research into the mechanisms. She identifies several possibilities, all of which need testing, including: the simple pleasure of the interaction; the passing of positive emotions from animal to human; feeling that the animal is providing unconditional love; and the benefits of tactile contact. There is also likely to be a large placebo effect.</p>
<p>Finding out how and why animal contact is psychological beneficial and for whom would help to maximise the positive impact of using animals for therapeutic reasons. Crossman points out that the idea of there being positive emotional contagion from animal to human also reminds us that it’s important to consider the effect of animal therapy on animals, and not to sacrifice their welfare in the process of helping people.</p>
<p>Some may wonder whether it matters that there is such a dearth of quality research in this field. As Crossman says, many people just feel they “know” that animal contact is beneficial and “they’re often sceptical of the need for empirical evidence.” But the wider psychotherapy literature teaches us that there are dangers in assuming interventions are always going to be helpful – animal therapy or ownership might not work for everyone, and in some cases it could even be detrimental. For instance, the responsibility of a pet might backfire for someone who is struggling to cope with stress.</p>
<p>“Researchers and practitioners have called for methodological improvements and advancements [in human-animal interaction research] for nearly half a century, but those calls remain largely unanswered,” Crossman writes. “At this point, the clearest conclusion in the field is that we cannot yet draw clear conclusions.”</p>

<p>In an effort to fight global poverty, the United Nations has launched the <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> project to encourage countries to ‘mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind’. A major part of this process is ensuring the availability of data on key development indicators to assess inequalities between and within countries and determine how these change over time. Monitoring health inequalities can uncover the effect of health policies, programs and interventions on specific disadvantaged subgroups and involves collecting, analysing, interpreting and reporting various types of health data. This article describes a toolkit developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to display and assess the health inequalities in any given country: the <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/assessment_toolkit/en/">Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT)</a>.</p>

The software allows the assessment of inequalities within a country using over 30 reproductive, maternal, new-born and child health indicators and five dimensions of inequality (economic status, education, place of residence, sub-national region and child’s sex) providing information about health interventions and health outcomes. The development of the toolkit marks a huge step forward in the monitoring of health inequalities which could in the future help to inform policy makers and national priority-setting for healthcare.</p>

Their study revealed that meta-analysis results generally did not differ significantly when different combinations of databases were searched and that the majority of relevant studies can be found within a limited number of databases. The study provides information which can be used to increase the efficiency of systematic reviews, and provides further guidance for the assessment and development of more recent forms of knowledge synthesis such as <a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-4053-1-10">rapid reviews</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-016-0247-7">Why sex and gender matter in implementation science</a></p>
<p>Researchers are being encouraged more and more to take sex and gender into account when carrying out medical research. This debate article considers the progress that has been made in taking sex and gender into account in implementation science, which considers how research findings are put into practice. A review of the current literature, including assessment of the top ten articles published in the journal <a href="http://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Implementation Science</em></a> in 2015, revealed that few studies mention sex and gender as a consideration. This is despite the fact that there is now guidance on these considerations available from groups such as the <a href="http://methods.cochrane.org/equity/welcome">Cochrane Collaboration’s Methods Equity group</a>.</p>
<p>The article then goes on to define the difference between sex and gender; the former being a classification based on the biology of the individual (according to genetics, anatomy and physiology) and the latter being a construct that is fluid and influenced by social and cultural context. Whilst biological sex is generally simple to measure, the measurement of an individual’s gender is more nuanced with the authors separating it into four constructs: gender roles, gender identity, gender relations and institutionalised gender. They highlight the need for both the qualitative and quantitative measurement of these factors in order to inform implementation research methods. They describe their importance at multiple points along the implementation process, from the content and messaging surrounding an intervention, to decision making around the uptake of an intervention.</p>

The classic methods of meta-analysis and systematic review can be labour intensive and so researchers are investigating ways to simplify this process whilst still maintaining accuracy and rigour. An emerging evidence synthesis method is evidence mapping which can be used as a first step in conducting a broad systematic review and can clarify where there is sufficient evidence to inform policy makers as well as identify research dense areas where systematic reviews could be pursued. Areas where there is a lack of evidence can also be identified, known as research gaps, where further studies may be needed.</p>
<p>There are currently no methodological standards for evidence mapping which led the authors of this study to describe the process and methodology of creating an evidence map database using the topic of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) and selected health outcomes of interest as an example. With the help of a stakeholder panel, a comprehensive literature search strategy was developed and refined. Outcomes from the studies identified in this search were classified into clinically and biologically meaningful outcome categories which were then analysed to identify how data have been reported on each outcome and where there are research gaps. Assessment of the frequency of publications in each outcome category revealed areas where research outputs increased over specific periods of time. An example of a research gap that was uncovered was the assessment of appetite and dietary intake outcomes using a LCS intervention with a sugar intake comparison in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>The steps presented in this article can be applied to create an evidence map database for any research topic of interest. Through the creation of this database, researchers and practitioners can easily acquire information necessary for decision-making, such as directions for future research and the basis for evidence synthesis, in a fraction of the time needed to conduct comprehensive literature reviews.</p>

This brings many benefits including increasing the clinical relevance of research questions, gaining access to clinical settings for research, and bringing clinical expertise and insider perspectives. However, there are ethical and methodological implications that should be considered when clinicians undertake a research role. In this study, the authors systematically reviewed published articles looking at the clinician-researcher dual-role and summarise the key findings from the literature.</p>
<p>The main finding was that clinician-researchers cannot adopt a wholly non-clinical research identity. This was attributed to the fact that it was not possible to maintain a strict researcher-participant relationship when the participant had previously been treated as a patient by the clinician-researcher. Consciously and subconsciously, the clinician and patient roles are present in the research setting, creating shared ground and a connection that resembles a clinician-patient relationship. Clinicians also described their struggles with separating themselves from the clinical role when carrying out research, suggesting that there are deep rooted characteristics which cannot be shed when a clinician moves into a research context. The authors recommend that clinician-researchers should be encouraged to accept and explore the factors surrounding the dual-role phenomenon, consider both roles throughout the research process, and ensure that clinical and research roles are not artificially separated in research protocols, ethics applications, and research practice.</p>

<p>Exposing your body to cold water has been promoted as a health tonic since at least the Roman period, so it’s about time we gave this a thorough investigation. In <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161749">a new paper</a> in <em>PLOS One</em> Geert Buijze and his colleagues report on the health and wellbeing effects of the “cool challenge” – a 30-day event in the Netherlands that involved more than 3000 people taking daily showers that ran cold for at least the last 30 seconds each time.</p>
<p>The clearest finding was a 29 per cent reduction in sickness absence for those who took cold showers compared with their colleagues who weren’t involved in the challenge; the length of the cold blast, whether 30 seconds or 90, didn’t matter. However cold showers didn’t provide an immunisation against sickness as such. The challenge participants felt ill as frequently as their colleagues, it’s just that somehow they were better able to fight through it and make it to work.</p>
<p>Most of the psychological factors that the researchers measured were not influenced by the chilly treatment. Participants reported a small increase in quality of life after 30 days, but that disappeared when re-measured later; meanwhile work productivity and levels of anxiety were unaffected. But the participants did report some other benefits such as higher energy levels, comparable to drinking a coffee, and over two thirds chose to continue the challenge for a further two months.</p>
<p>On this evidence, cold showers don’t refresh all the parts we might desire, but seem to insulate against the effects of illness and provide some yet to be determined energetic effects. Why? Maybe thanks to effects on the levels of hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine, which respond in the short-term to a cold dousing. Or simply the benefit of a short daily physical activity – the power of a good shiver.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We model the effects of excitation and inhibition on the gain of cortical neurons. Previous theoretical work has concluded that excitation or inhibition alone will not cause a multiplicative gain change in the curve of firing rate versus input current. However, such gain changes in vivo are measured in the curve of firing rate versus stimulus parameter. We find that when this curve is considered, and when the nonlinear relationships between stimulus parameter and input current and between input current and firing rate in vivo are taken into account, then simple excitation or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change. In particular, the power-law relationship between voltage and firing rate that is induced by neuronal noise is critical to this result. This suggests an unexpectedly simple mechanism that may underlie the gain modulations commonly observed in cortex. More generally, it suggests that a smaller input will multiplicatively modulate the gain of a larger one when both converge on a common cortical target.</p>

            <p>A provocative new report suggests a low-cost, non-invasive testing protocol may identify older individuals at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
<p>Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators discovered testing individuals’ ability to recognize, remember and distinguish between odors provided similar recommendations as genetic, imaging, and more detailed memory tests.</p>
<p>The report — suggesting testing of both olfactory and cognitive abilities as a means to designate candidates for treatments designed to halt or slow Alzheimer’s symptom development — has been published online in Annals of Neurology.</p>
<p>Mark Albers, M.D., Ph.D., of the MGH Department of Neurology, the principal investigator and corresponding author of the report says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is increasing evidence that the neurodegeneration behind Alzheimer’s disease starts at least 10 years before the onset of memory symptoms. The development of a digitally-enabled, affordable, accessible, and non-invasive means to identify healthy individuals who are at risk is a critical step to developing therapies that slow down or halt Alzheimer’s disease progression.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is well-known that brain circuits that process olfactory information can be affected by Alzheimer’s disease, and several studies have documented a diminished ability to identify odors in affected individuals.</p>
<p>Other studies have associated deficits in odor identification with established Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and with greater rates of cognitive decline. However, the most commonly used test of olfactory ability — the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test — has a number of limitations and does not take into account the great variation in olfactory ability among healthy individuals.</p>
<p>In the research the MGH team used a battery of four tests to addresses both olfactory and cognitive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the OPID (Odor Percept IDentification)-10 test, participants are presented with a battery of 10 odors — menthol, clove, leather, strawberry, lilac, pineapple, smoke, soap, grape, or lemon. After experiencing each odor for two seconds, they are asked whether the scent is familiar and then asked to choose among four words — from the names listed above — for the one that best describes the odor.</li>
<li>Participants then complete the Odor Awareness Scale (OAS), a previously validated questionnaire that assesses their overall attention to environmental odors and how they are affected emotionally and behaviorally by scents.</li>
<li>The OPID-20 test includes the 10 odors previously presented and an additional 10 — banana, garlic, cherry, baby powder, grass, fruit punch, peach, chocolate, dirt, and orange. Participants are first asked whether a presented odor was included in the OPID-10 test and then asked which word best describes the odor. Their ability to remember odors from the first test determines their POEM (Percepts of Odor Episodic Memory) score.</li>
<li>In the Odor Discrimination (OD) test, participants are presented with two consecutive odors and asked whether they were different or the same, a process that is repeated 12 times with different paired scents.</li>
</ul>
<p>The study recruited 183 participants, most of whom were enrolled in ongoing studies at the MGH-based Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.</p>
<p>At the time of the olfactory testing, 70 were cognitively normal, 74 tested normal on cognitive tests but were personally concerned about their cognitive abilities, 29 had mild cognitive impairment, and 10 had been diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>As part of the studies they were enrolled in, all of them had comprehensive medical and neurological examinations — including annual tests of their memory and cognitive abilities — and several had brain imaging studies of Alzheimer’s-associated factors.</p>
<p>Results of the OPID-20 test significantly differentiated among the four groups of participants, and those results correlated with the thinning of two brain regions — the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex — previously associated with Alzheimer’s risk.</p>
<p>Participants’ ability to remember a previously presented aroma, as reflected in the POEM score, also showed significant differences between the two cognitively normal groups and participants with Alzheimer’s disease, whose results were no better than chance.</p>
<p>Because the ability of normal individuals to recognize and discriminate between odors can vary by as much as 40 times, the POEM scores of the two cognitively normal groups were compared with what would have been predicted based on their ability to identify and differentiate between odors, as reflected in the OAS and OD tests.</p>
<p>That comparison determined whether each individual was a good or poor POEM performer, and poor POEM performers were more likely to have the variant of the APOE gene associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk. While results of an annual test of short-term memory improved year-to-year for the good POEM performers, no such improvement was seen among the poor performers, who also showed thinning of the entorhinal cortex.</p>
<p>Albers and his colleagues are currently recruiting participants for a larger-scale study to validate these results:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is well recognized that early diagnosis and intervention are likely to produce the most effective therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease — preventing the onset or the progression of symptoms. If these results hold up, this sort of inexpensive, noninvasive screening could help us identify the best candidates for novel therapies to prevent the development of symptoms of this tragic disease.”</p></blockquote>

Under the new system, the editors no longer take responsibility for inviting peer reviewers to evaluate each manuscript. Instead, the would-be authors are expected to find two reviewers themselves, and to submit the reviews along with their paper.

mSphere call this approach 'author-initiated peer review', but I like to think of it as the "Pick-Your-Own" system.

            <p>Arduino is a fantastic microcontroller platform, but the IDE can feel quite limiting once you go beyond “Hello world” projects. If you’ve outgrown the Arduino IDE, consider <a href="http://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 750px;"><img alt="PlatformIO IDE for IoT development" height="689" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.platformio.org/images/platformio-ide-for-atom.c6645c5e.png" width="750" />PlatformIO IDE for IoT development screenshot, from <a href="http://platformio.org/" rel="nofollow">http://platformio.org/</a></figure>
<p>PlatformIO is a a powerful IDE for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with some great features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports Arduino, ARM Cortex, and many other IoT platforms</li>
<li>Full-featured code editor based on Atom with tab-completion, inline help, multiple cursors, refactoring, the works</li>
<li>Supports Build, Upload, Unit Test actions with continuous integration options</li>
<li>Build files with sane library management</li>
<li>Serial port monitor with automatic restart</li>
</ul>
<p>These features really shine when you start building more complex projects.</p>
<p>Here I showcase how you can build and upload a simple multi-Arduino device project that would be a pain to manage otherwise.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Let’s say you want to build a system build out of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sender – an Arduino device with some attached sensors – captures information from the environment, and beams it into the air via XBee, Bluetooth, plain-jane RF, etc.</li>
<li>a receiver – a second Arduino device that reads the information from the first, remote Arduino device and actuates, e.g. some motors or servos</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arduino IDE is not well-adapted to this kind of problem, because it uses a paradigm where one sketch = one device. If you want to work on a project that uses two devices you have to use two separate .ino sketches, running in two separate processes. You have to manage these two projects separately, test and upload them on different schedules. Then what if you need to share some common headers, like, let’s say, a .h file which contains an encryption key for RF? That’s not straightforward at all.</p>
<p>PlatformIO makes it easy to work with multiple devices.</p>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p><a href="http://platformio.org/platformio-ide">Install the PlaformIO IDE</a>, fire up Atom, and start a new project. Add whatever device you want to support – I’m using the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-rfm69hcw-module?view=all">Adafruit Feather</a>, specifically the model which has an RFM69 RF module on it for radio communication. This will initialize a minimalist project with nothing in it:</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Now create a new file under src/sender/blink.cpp, which will contain Arduino’s version of Hello world, the blink sketch:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

// The Hello world of the Arduino world! Blink at 5Hz.

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
}
</pre>
<p>Now connect your initial Arduino to a USB port, and hit Upload from the PlatformIO menu.</p>
<p>That’s it – you should get some output to the effect that the code was successfully built, your code should be uploaded to your Arduino, and the builtin LED should start flashing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hint: You can access all the build actions – build, upload, and test – using the F7 key.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Static address</h1>
<p>Use the PlatformIO &gt; List Serial Ports menu item to find which serial port your Arduino device is using. On Linux, the name of the device you be of the form `/dev/ttyACMXXX`; Macs instead have the form `/dev/USBXXX`. Now open the platformio.ini file at the root of your project, which was auto-generated for you. Mine looks like:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
</pre>
<p>We’re going to start by giving it a meaningful name, and assigning it to a specific upload port:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4_sender]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
upload_port=/dev/ttyACM0
</pre>
<p>Save the file, and upload again, you should get exactly the same result. While it seems like we haven’t done much, we’ve created the skeleton for our future build file for multiple devices. When you work on bigger project, you will also manage dependencies, and many other aspects of the project, through <a href="http://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/projectconf.html">the platformio.ini file</a>.</p>
<h1>Two devices</h1>
<p>To extend this to two devices, it’s very straightforward. Make a new file in the project, src/receiver/blink.cpp. Set the interval for this one so it blinks more slowly:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

// Blink this pup at 1Hz.

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
}
</pre>
<p>Now connect your second device, list serial devices through the menu, and find out the name of the new device, e.g. /dev/ttyACM1. Now we’re ready to update the platformio.ini file:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">[env:feather32u4_sender]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
src_filter = +&lt;*&gt; +&lt;sender/&gt; -&lt;receiver/&gt;
upload_port = /dev/ttyACM0

[env:feather32u4_receiver]
platform = atmelavr
board = feather32u4
framework = arduino
src_filter = +&lt;*&gt; -&lt;sender/&gt; +&lt;receiver/&gt;
upload_port = /dev/ttyACM1
</pre>
<p>We’ve added a second section corresponding to the second device. The important thing here is the addition of src_filter, which specifies which files are to be compiled and sent to each device. We specified – and + to specifically include and exclude subdirectories of the source folder.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>When you hit F7 this time, you’ll see many more options — you can Build, or Upload, which will send both sketches one after the other to their respective Arduinos. You can also build and upload for a specific environment, in which case only one Arduino will be updated.</p>
<p>If you upload both sketches, you will see your designated sender blink fast, and the designated receiver blink slowly.</p>
<h1>Shared files</h1>
<p>With this structure, it’s very easy to share a file between the two sketches. Simply create the src/constants.h file, with content, for example:</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate">#DEFINE secret_key "OMGSOSECRet"
</pre>
<p>Then #include it in both the cpp files. Easy.</p>
<h1>Optional: static addresses</h1>
<p>The scheme here will work as long as you remember to reconnect your Arduinos in the right order — otherwise they’ll be assigned different TTY addresses and you’ll be uploading each sketch to the wrong place. To avoid this, you can change your udev rules to assign a static /dev address, e.g. `/dev/receiver`, to a given Arduino. <a href="http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/">Follow this tutorial here</a>, and update your platformio.ini file accordingly. It’s a bit of work but it will pay off later in the hassle you save.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5903/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5903/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=xcorr.net&amp;blog=3084329&amp;post=5903&amp;subd=xcorr&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

In today’s post, we review our 2016 accomplishments in this area and the progress we’ve made toward <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/placing-authors-at-the-center-of-the-scientific-endeavor/" target="_blank">our goals</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ORCID Implementation</strong></p>
<p>In January, PLOS, eLife, the Royal Society and other major publishers developed and signed an <strong><a href="https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter" target="_blank">Open Letter</a></strong> committing to follow best practices when collecting, processing and displaying ORCID iDs. Signatories further agreed to begin requiring by year end that each corresponding author associate their name with an ORCID iD and 15 signatories have already implemented this policy. As of December 7 this is now also PLOS policy—corresponding authors on manuscripts coming in to either of our submission systems (Editorial Manager or Aperta™) must provide an authenticated ORCID iD.</p>
<p>In preparing for the launch of this requirement, we tackled both technical and operational hurdles. But there were – and still are – behavioral changes needed. PLOS began capturing ORCID iDs in Editorial Manager in 2014. By the beginning of 2016 there were more than 27,000 authenticated iDs in our database. Throughout this year, we have actively engaged with our authors, editors and reviewers to encourage sign-ups; in addition to email campaigns and messaging in the submission system we have posted an <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">informational page</a></strong> on our web site, updated our <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship#loc-author-identification" target="_blank">author instructions</a></strong> and provided <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">how-to videos</a></strong> to assist our contributors.</p>
<p>As of this week, we have upwards of 54,000 authenticated ORCID iDs, more than doubling the count in less than a year. We still have a long way to go, however, as there are many more in our database who have yet to register!</p>
<p><strong>How PLOS Uses ORCID IDs</strong></p>
<p>From early 2016, we have been passing authors’ iDs on published articles through to Crossref with our metadata deposits. Crossref, in turn, communicates that information to ORCID; if the author has agreed to allow for updates their ORCID profile is enhanced to include the new publication. This <strong><a href="https://orcid.org/blog/2015/10/26/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-next-level" target="_blank">auto-update</a></strong> function makes it possible for authors to maintain their records going forward without having to take action. It’s vitally important that authors provide their permission for this process to work.</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #339966;">Are you an author who’s provided an ORCID iD to us and published a PLOS article during 2016? Are you wondering why credit isn’t showing up in your ORCID profile? <span style="color: #333399;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcclfuvtxQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" style="color: #333399;" target="_blank">Watch our short video</a></span> to see how to ensure you’ve given the needed permission.</span></h3>
<p><strong>CRediT Implementation</strong></p>
<p>While ORCID allows us to know and unambiguously credit WHO participated in published articles, CRediT goes a step further and allows us to provide attribution for WHAT those individuals did in relation to the articles. Such attribution improves the ability of institutions and funders to more accurately evaluate researchers based on their actual contributions to published works, rather than by the journals in which those articles appear.</p>
<p>While PLOS has for many years required contributions for each of the named authors to any submitted work, in 2016 we <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/" target="_blank">adopted the CRediT taxonomy</a></strong> of contributions. CRediT is a community-developed open standard intended to replace over time the many disparate lists – or free-text – that publishers have been using for this purpose. <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship#loc-author-contributions" target="_blank">More information</a></strong> is provided in our instructions for authors.</p>
<p>We are gathering data on how the CRediT taxonomy is being used by our authors and will be analyzing and sharing that out in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Progress in these two areas – uniquely identifying and crediting authors and gathering standardized author contributions – are major steps along the path of providing improved attribution and transparency in scholarly publishing. PLOS will continue to provide or adopt new tools and services that help accelerate the pace and transparency of scientific research and will <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/04/where-next-for-plos-working-together-to-make-waves-in-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">continue to collaborate with others</a></strong> to establish ways to speed publication, improve the author experience and advance standards for reporting and reproducing research.</p>

<p>Alcohol consumption ranks 5th among the 20 leading risk factors for global burden of disease and <em>BMC Public Health</em> has published an array of articles this year on harmful drinking. Theresa Marteau et al. carried out a study in an eating and drinking establishment in Cambridge, England, which reports the effects of wine glass size on wine sales. During the study, the size of wine glasses were <img alt="Wine" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8230" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/wine-300x201.jpg" width="300" />changed at fortnightly intervals and, over a 16-week period, the establishment alternated between the standard 300ml wine glass, to the larger 370ml and smaller 250ml glasses. Data showed that the volume of wine purchased was nearly 10 percent higher when sold in larger glasses compared to standard-sized glasses. Interestingly, Marteau et al. did not see the opposite effect when they switched to smaller wine glasses.  The results indicate that avoiding the use of large wine glasses could reduce the amount that people drink. However, more research is required to confirm the effect and, should this suggest glass size might be an effective target for intervention, the next step would be to explore how this might be implemented.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2720-y">Mental health outcomes in times of economic recession</a></p>
<p><span class="AuthorName">Economic recessions are known to affect people’s health and wellbeing. </span><span class="AuthorName">Diana Frasquilho et al. have carried out a systematic review which looks at the recent evidence of the possible association between economic recessions and mental health outcomes. They found that, in general, evidence on the impact of economic crises and recessions on mental health is accruing, but comprehensive studies are lacking. Although periods of economic recession are possibly associated with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, including common mental disorders, substance disorders, and ultimately suicidal behavior, most of the research is based on cross-sectional studies, which seriously limits causality inferences. Diana Frasquilho explains more about the review’s findings <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/02/09/mental-health-outcomes-times-economic-recession/">here.</a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3151-5">Do you know what you are smoking?</a></p>
<p><img alt="smoke" class="size-medium wp-image-8233 alignleft" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/smoke-300x169.jpg" width="300" />Marcella Boynton et al. conducted a nationally-representative phone survey of U.S. adults with questions related to tobacco constituent information, knowledge, and perceptions. Surprisingly, the authors’ results reveal that groups one might presume to be the least psychologically motivated to look for this information, young adults and smokers, were more likely to say that they had previously looked for it. Furthermore, more than 80% of U.S. smokers reported intending to eventually quit smoking, suggesting that many smokers are in the contemplation stage of behavior change and would therefore benefit from greater access to constituent information. The researchers also asked respondents whether they had heard that each of 4 constituents are in cigarette smoke and found that, with the exception of nicotine, most people were largely unaware of what chemicals are present in tobacco products.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3223-6">Smokers trying to kick the habit tend to also give up drinking</a></p>
<p>Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption have a close and complex relationship which warrants research sometimes looking at these major public health problems in conjunction. Jamie Brown et al. looked at whether, at a population level, smokers who have recently attempted to quit smoking are more likely than other smokers to report lower alcohol consumption and trying to reduce their drinking.  A total of 31,878 adults in England were surveyed between March 2014 and September 2015 and the researchers found that smokers who reported attempting to stop within the last week had lower levels of alcohol consumption, especially bingeing, and were less likely to be classified as having higher risk alcohol consumption compared with those who did not report an attempt to quit smoking in the last week. Results indicate that smokers in England may be following best-practice advice to restrict their alcohol consumption during a smoking cessation attempt. However, due to the nature of the study, it is not clear whether the effects seen are due to reverse causation: ie, that the association between quitting and consumption is actually driven by people with lower alcohol consumption being more likely to attempt to quit smoking. In either case, the study findings have important implications for policy evaluation and justify a coordinated strategy on alcohol and tobacco control.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3415-0">Live broadcasts of online suicides </a></p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, suicide is the second leading cause of youth death globally. With social media becoming <img alt="online" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8236" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/online-300x200.jpg" width="300" />a central part of everyone’s lives, more young suicidal people are going online and this may provide increased opportunity for a crisis response. Jing Ma et al. explored live-broadcast suicide in Chinese emerging adults and collected data on the suicide incidents, stages/process, participants and their behaviors. Findings revealed that important information can be obtained from accounts of these incidents, which could contribute to a better understanding of suicidal people, those who encourage suicidal behaviors in others, and, most importantly, how suicide could be prevented in an online environment.</p>

<p>In this study, Simon Moore and colleagues examine for the first time how people judge their drunkenness and the health consequences of their drinking whilst they are intoxicated in social drinking environments. The authors carried out breath alcohol testing of 1,862 people and asked a subset of them about their perceptions of their drunkenness and the health consequences of their drinking. Their results show that people base judgements regarding their drinking on how their level of intoxication ranks relative to that of others of the same gender around them, not on their actual levels of intoxication. These findings have implications for strategies looking at increasing the numbers of sober people in night time environments.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3660-2">Owners of big dog breeds more likely to walk their pets</a></p>
<p><img alt="dog" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8234" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/dog-300x201.jpg" width="300" />Although dog ownership is associated with increased physical activity through walking, many people who live with dogs do not walk them regularly. Carri Westgarth and co-authors carried out a study examining the demographic and behavioral factors that contribute towards owners reporting having a strong sense of encouragement and motivation to walk provided by their dogs. They found that factors such as owning a larger dog, having an increased level of attachment to their dog, knowing their dog enjoys going for a walk, believing walking keeps dogs healthy and having high social support from family to go walking, were positively associated with both outcomes ‘dog encouragement to walk’ and ‘dog motivation to walk’. These factors may be targeted in future interventions to increase and maintain physical activity levels of both people and pets.</p>

<p>Yvonne Kelly and colleagues have found that UK 11-year-olds whose parents drink heavily are almost twice as likely to drink themselves than if their parents are non-drinkers – and particularly if their mother rather than their father is a heavy or regular binge drinker. Children who said their friends drank were also more than four times as likely to drink themselves as those children who had friends who didn’t drink. The researchers carried out an analysis of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 10,498 11-year-olds and results obtained suggest that their perceptions of risk, their expectancies towards alcohol and relationships with their families were independently related to the likelihood of drinking. Yvonne Kelly explains more about this work in a blog <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/03/04/11-year-olds-drink-hint-parents/">here. </a></p>

<p><img alt="Soda" class="size-medium wp-image-8231 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/soda-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Up to 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) are estimated to arise from agriculture and associated land use change and therefore changing food consumption patterns may contribute substantially to reducing these gas levels. However, in attempting to reduce the consumption of foods with high GHGEs, other unhealthy food products which are low in GHGEs, such as sugar, may be preferred by consumers. In order to promote foods with low GHGEs and, at the same time, mitigate the negative health consequences of choosing low GHGE foods, Adam Briggs et al. modelled the effect on UK non-communicable disease mortality and GHGEs of internalizing the social cost of carbon into the price of food alongside a 20% tax on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). Results of the study indicate that incorporating this cost into food prices has the potential to improve health, reduce GHGEs and raise revenue. Furthermore, the SSBs tax can alleviate negative health consequences. The study, which is the first of its kind, has laid the groundwork for future research which is needed on developing sophisticated price structures to optimize a healthy population diet that is low in GHGEs.</p>

<p>A number of studies have shown that deprived communities suffer substantively greater alcohol-related morbidity and mortality despite reporting average alcohol consumption similar to their richer counterparts. It is unclear why this is true and possible explanations behind the paradox include that deprived populations are exposed to other health challenges that interact with higher levels of alcohol consumption or there may be epidemiologically relevant differences in patterns of consumption and types of alcohol consumed. Mark Bellis et al. sought to assess the hypotheses behind this paradox by carrying out a national telephone survey with English adults. Questions examined factors including: current and historic drinking patterns, combined health challenges (smoking, diet, exercise and body mass), and under-reported consumption (enhanced questioning on atypical/special occasion drinking). The researchers found that, among more deprived drinkers, alcohol consumption is more likely to be combined with smoking and poor diet, suggesting a multiplicative effect. The research also identifies higher levels of current and past ‘binge drinking’ among some deprived drinkers, which is known to weaken the protective effects of low consumption on, for example, ischaemic heart disease. James Nicholls, a co-author of this work, explains more about the study’s findings in a blog <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/02/18/alcohol-harm-paradox-poor-increased-health-risk/">here.</a></p>

<p>There is an increasing amount of evidence connecting mental health and personality traits to coronary heart disease (CHD). Mikko Pänkäläinen et al. carried out an 11-year prospective cohort study and looked at levels of dispositional optimism and pessimism of the participants at baseline. They found that both men and women who died because of CHD were significantly more pessimistic at baseline than the others, whereas optimism did not seem to have any connection with mortality risk. The researchers conclude that, as pessimism levels can be measured easily and non-invasively, this might be a very useful tool together with the other known risk factors to determine the risk of CHD-induced mortality.</p>

Dozens of hypothalamic neuropeptides have been shown to be involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight homeostasis. The extreme heterogeneity of these chemical signals and the complex sub-architecture of the hypothalamus participate in regulating homeostatic adaptations.<br />
Information about the body’s energy store is gathered by the arcuate nucleus (Arc), a small hypothalamic nucleus, and then transmitted to second order neurons, including ones localized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and others in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), to evoke hunger sensation and feeding behavior. Since the seminal study of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Search&amp;doptcmdl=Citation&amp;defaultField=Title%20Word&amp;term=Anand%5Bauthor%5D%20AND%20Hypothalamic%20control%20of%20food%20intake%20in%20rats%20and%20cats">Anand and Brubeck (1951)</a>, the LHA has been identified as the “<em>feeding center of the brain</em>”. However, the exact contribution of each hypothalamic nucleus remains poorly understood and far from fully explored.<br />
QRFP, a recently identified hypothalamic neuropeptide, has emerged as an interesting chemical signal in the LHA and adjacent regions. What is the function of this novel peptide?<br />
In a recent <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164716">PLOS ONE article</a>, Okamoto and colleagues from the Kanazawa University in Japan, decided to explore the functions of this neuropeptide. Here is what they found.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QRFP, feeding and energy homeostasis</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To examine the physiological role of QRFP, the authors generated a transgenic mouse line (<em>Qrfp</em><sup>-/-</sup>) by replacing the entire prepro-QRFP sequence with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. Interestingly, under standard diet the body weight of <em>Qrfp</em><sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly lower than that of wildtype littermates. This phenotype was also maintained when the mice were exposed to high-fat diet, a protocol known to induce obesity and metabolic disorders. These experiments strongly suggest that QRFP may play a critical role in influencing feeding behavior and central energy homeostasis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two major neuronal populations that control food intake are the arcuate POMC and AgRP neurons. Taking advantage of the eGFP expression of QRFP-expressing LHA neurons, the authors observed that arcuate AgRP neurons were able to contact those cells, thus suggesting a synaptic link. Interestingly, “<em>the area of distribution of AgRP fibers in the hypothalamus overlapped with that of QRFP-positive neurons</em>”, say Kitaro Okamoto, the leading author of the study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QRFP: not only food but also mood</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, most substances that affect food intake show effects on mood and motivation simultaneously, and eating disorders are often accompanied by mood or behavioral disorders. To address whether QRFP may impact mood and emotional states, the authors conducted a battery of behavioral experiments to further elucidate this possibility. Using the elevated plus maze and the open field tests, two behavioral paradigms which rely on the aversion of rodents to open spaces, Okamoto and colleagues showed that genetic inactivation of the hypothalamic QRFP was able to induce anxiety and hypo-activity. “<em>Behavioral tests revealed that Qrfp null mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior</em>”, concluded Takeshi Sakurai<strong>, </strong>the senior author of the study. In agreement with this behavioral phenotype, QRFP receptors, notably GPR103A and GPR103B, are expressed in regions implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and mood. “<em>These observations</em>”, report the authors, “<em>suggest that QRFP exerts its activity through these regions, and this factor is likely to be involved in emotional aspects of feeding</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Science is not science without caveats</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It must be mentioned that QRFP peptides are not only expressed in the brain, but also in peripheral organs such as in adrenal cortex and adipocytes. “<em>Since our present mouse model is a conventional QRFP knockout, the peripheral actions of QRFP might also contribute to metabolic phenotype of these mice</em>”, cautiously add the authors. Indeed, future studies taking advantage of optogenetic/pharmacogenetic approaches might further reveal the central mechanisms by which QRFP promotes feeding and mood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there is need for further investigations, this study points to QRFP as a potential pharmacological target for metabolic as wells as emotional disorders, thus opening exciting hypotheses to be tested and verified in the near future.</p>

            <p>New research is challenging the idea that working memory helps us remembers things through sustained brain activity.</p>
<p>Instead, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison have found that our brains tuck less-important information away beyond the reach of the tools that typically monitor brain activity. The researchers then were able to bring that information back into active attention with magnets. </p>
<p>The research could eventually help people suffering from schizophrenia or depression, according to Dr. Brad Postle, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A lot of mental illness is associated with the inability to choose what to think about. What we’re taking are first steps toward looking at the mechanisms that give us control over what we think about.”</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Postle, most people feel they are able to concentrate on a lot more than their working memory can actually hold. It’s a bit like vision, in which it feels like we’re seeing everything in our field of view, but details slip away unless you re-focus on them regularly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The notion that you’re aware of everything all the time is a sort of illusion your consciousness creates. That is true for thinking, too. You have the impression that you’re thinking of a lot of things at once, holding them all in your mind. But lots of research shows us you’re probably only actually attending to — are conscious of in any given moment — just a very small number of things.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the study, the researchers conducted a series of experiments in which people were asked to remember two items representing different types of information — words, faces, and directions of motion — because they’d be tested on their memories.</p>
<p>When the researchers gave their subjects a cue as to the type of question coming — a face, for example, instead of a word — the electrical activity and blood flow in the brain associated with the word memory disappeared. But if a second cue came letting the person know they would now be asked about that word, the brain activity would jump back up to a level indicating it was the focus of attention.</p>
<blockquote><p>“People have always thought neurons would have to keep firing to hold something in memory. Most models of the brain assume that. But we’re watching people remember things almost perfectly without showing any of the activity that would come with a neuron firing. The fact that you’re able to bring it back at all in this example proves it’s not gone. It’s just that we can’t see evidence for its active retention in the brain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers were also able to bring the seemingly abandoned items back to mind without cueing their subjects. Using a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to apply a focused electromagnetic field to a precise part of the brain involved in storing the word, they could trigger the sort of brain activity representing focused attention.</p>
<p>Additionally, if they cued their subjects to focus on a face (causing brain activity associated with the word to drop off), a well-timed pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation would snap the stowed memory back into attention, and prompt the subjects to incorrectly think that they had been cued to focus on the word, the researchers report:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We think that memory is there, but not active. More than just showing us it’s there, the TMS can actually make that memory temporarily active again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The study suggests a state of memory apart from the spotlight attention of active working memory and the deep storage of more significant things in long-term memory, according to Postle:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What’s still unknown here is how the brain determines what falls away, and what enables you to retrieve things in the short-term if you need them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Studying how the brain apportions attention could eventually influence the way we understand and treat some mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, in which patients focus on hallucinations instead of reality, and depression, which seems related to spending an unhealthy amount of time dwelling on negative things, he noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are making some interesting progress with very basic research. But you can picture a point at which this work could help people control their attention, choose what they think about, and manage or overcome some very serious problems associated with a lack of control.”</p></blockquote>

            When you're doing two things at once - like listening to the radio while driving - your brain organizes itself into two, functionally independent networks, almost as if you temporarily have two brains. That's according to a fascinating new study from University of Wisconsin-Madison neuroscientists Shuntaro Sasai and colleagues. It's called Functional split brain in a driving/listening paradigm
