          <p><strong>What does PLOS&rsquo; vision for Open Science mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>JD: There is growing support for the idea that knowledge production and dissemination should be more inclusive. How we actually operationalize that ideal is the challenge that PLOS is tackling, and I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunity to both learn from and support those efforts.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>What specific expertise do you bring to PLOS Water?</strong></p>



<p> JD: I&rsquo;ve been teaching and carrying out research in the water and sanitation field for more than 20 years. Most of my group&rsquo;s work has been in countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Having the opportunity to examine issues across a variety of contexts has really shaped the way I think about research design and the interpretation of findings </p>

          <p>PH: My earliest training was in aquatic zoology; I&rsquo;ve developed a strong interest in the variety of inland aquatic ecosystems, including water chemistry and water resource management. My research is increasingly focused on social ecology, place-based, and policy dimensions of our interactions with water.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>What is the most exciting part of your job as an Editor-in-Chief?</strong><br><br>PH: Most of us are aware of the challenges we face in terms of planetary resources and inequality, and the inadequacies of our existing institutions to tackle them meaningfully.  Since journals are institutions that structure the delivery of knowledges, we have both responsibilities and opportunities in this regard. The most exciting part of my job as Co-Editor-in-Chief is to be equally attentive to each of these many ways of knowing. Sometimes that will involve challenging our societal and organisational structures.<br><br>JD: Working with my Co-EIC Pierre Horwitz to develop a vision for PLOS Water that catalyzes cross talk between the water services and water resources communities, and that supports historically under-represented researchers in publishing their work. I&rsquo;ve also loved meeting new colleagues and learning about their work&ndash;there is an amazing amount of scholarship in the water field!<br><br><strong>What will PLOS Water add to the field in the coming decade?</strong><br><br>PH: Water permeates, and is nearly universal in a disciplinary sense. The combined forces of industrialisation and population growth have meant a flourishing of types of water knowledge that belong, more often than not, to a set of languages and technologies. While they are essential coverage for the field of water, they have come at the expense of a diverse array of water knowledges that have been marginalised, and are more place-based, culturally defined, and ecologically literate. They include knowledges of Indigenous and local peoples, even formed over thousands of years and hundreds of generations, embedding understandings of water as the world has changed, and how societies have responded.<br><br>By addressing this imbalance, and providing a re-acquaintance for an international audience, while maintaining strong coverage of conventional and emerging fields, we may well be in a better position to contribute to a regenerative global agenda over the next ten years.<br><br><strong>What&rsquo;s a common misconception new authors have about the peer review or publication process?</strong><br><br>JD: I think some new authors may forget that reviewers, while very knowledgeable and typically more seasoned than they, are also colleagues in their scholarly community. Engaging them in constructive debate can benefit everyone.<br><br><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you at this time?<br></strong><br>JD: First, increased data availability and advances in data science are expanding opportunities for measuring and monitoring water resources, services, and access. Ideally this will enable better management and policy choices. I&rsquo;m also excited to see a broader conception of health being incorporated into the water services arena. Evaluating effects of service deficits on, for example, mental health and the quality of child caregiving helps paint a more complete picture of the costs and benefits of water sector investments.<br><br>Want to know more about the journal and how to submit your research?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-living-machines-xenobots-replicate-copies-frog-cells">Tiny living machines called xenobots can create copies of themselves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny “living machines” made of frog cells can replicate themselves, making copies that can then go on to do the same. This newly described form of renewal offers insights into how to design biological machines that are self-perpetuating.</p>



<p>“This is an incredibly exciting breakthrough,” for the field of biologically based robotics, says Kirstin Petersen, an electrical and computer engineer at Cornell University who studies groups of robots. Robots that can copy themselves are an important step toward systems that don’t need humans to operate, she says.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, researchers described the behaviors of the lab-made living robots, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">xenobots</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>). Plucked out of frogs’ growing bodies, small clumps of skin stem cells from frog embryos knitted themselves into small spheres and began to move. Cellular extensions called cilia served as motors that powered the xenobots as they cruised around their lab dishes.</p>



<p>That cruising can have a bigger purpose, the researchers now report in the Dec. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. As the xenobots bumble about, they can gather loose frog cells into spheres, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/49/e2112672118">which then coalesce into xenobots</a> themselves.</p>





<p>This type of movement-created reproduction, called kinematic self-replication by the researchers, appears to be new for living cells. Usually, reproducing organisms contribute some parental material to their offspring, says study coauthor Douglas Blackiston of Tufts University in Medford, Mass., and Harvard University. Sexual reproduction, for instance, requires parental sperm and egg cells to get started. Other types of reproduction involve cells splitting or budding off from a parent.</p>



<p>“Here, this is different,” Blackiston says. These xenobots are “finding loose parts, sort of like robotics parts in the environment, and cobbling them together.” Those collections then grow into “a second generation of xenobots that can move around like their parents,” Blackiston says.</p>

</div><figcaption>Living machines called xenobots are blobs of frog stem cells that knit themselves together. Scientists have now found that the bots can self-replicate. A C-shaped xenobot was most efficient at collecting loose stem cells in its opening, a behavior that leads to more of the mobile xenobots.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Left to their own devices, spheroid xenobots could generally create only one more generation before dying out, the researchers found. But with the help of an artificial intelligence program that predicted an optimal shape for the original xenobots, the replication could be pushed to four generations.</p>



<p>The AI program predicted that a C shape, much like an openmouthed Pac-Man, would be a more efficient progenitor. Sure enough, when improved xenobots were let loose in a dish, they began scooping up loose cells into their gaping “mouths,” forming more sphere-shaped bots. A mobile offspring took shape once about 50 cells had glommed together in a parent’s opening, Blackiston says. A full-bodied xenobot consists of about 4,000 to 6,000 frog cells.</p>



<p>Xenobots’ tiny size is an advantage, Petersen says. “The fact that they were able to do this at such a small scale just makes it even better, because you can start to imagine biomedical application areas,” she says. Minuscule xenobots might be able to sculpt tissues for implantation, for instance, or go inside bodies to deliver therapeutics to specific spots.</p>



<p>Beyond the possible jobs for the xenobots, the research advances an important science, one that has existential importance for humans, says study coauthor Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts. That is, “the science of trying to anticipate and control the consequences of complex systems,” he says.</p>



<p>“Originally, no one would have predicted any of this,” Levin says. “These things are routinely doing things that surprise us.” With xenobots, researchers can push the limits of the unexpected. “This is about a safe way to explore and advance the science of being less surprised by things,” Levin says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelic-drugs-treatment-mental-health-disorders-depression">Can psychedelics meet their potential for treating mental health disorders?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Kanu Caplash was lying on a futon in a medical center in Connecticut, wearing an eye mask and listening to music. But his mind was far away, tunneling down through layer upon layer of his experiences. As part of a study of MDMA, a psychedelic drug also known as molly or ecstasy, Caplash was on an inner journey to try to ease his symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>



<p>On this particular trip, Caplash, now 22, returned to the locked bathroom door of his childhood home. As a kid, he used to lock himself in to escape the yelling adults outside. But now, he was both outside the locked door, knocking, and inside, as his younger, frightened self.</p>



<p>He started talking to his younger self. “I open the door, and my big version picks up my younger version of myself, and literally carries me out,” he says. “I carried myself out of there and drove away.”</p>



<p>That self-rescue brought Caplash peace. “I got out of there. I’m alive. It’s all right. I’m OK.” For years, Caplash had experienced flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia from childhood trauma. He thought constantly about killing himself, he says. His experiences while on MDMA changed his perspective. “I still have the memory, but that anger and pain is not there anymore.”</p>



<p>Caplash’s transcendent experiences, spurred by three therapy sessions on MDMA, happened in 2018 as part of a research project on PTSD. Along with a handful of other studies, that research suggests that when coupled with psychotherapy, mind-altering drugs bring some people immediate, powerful and durable relief.</p>

<p>Those studies, and the intense media coverage they received, have helped launch psychedelic medicine into the public conversation in the United States, England and elsewhere. Academic groups devoted to studying psychedelics have sprung up at Johns Hopkins, Yale, New York University Langone Health, the University of California, San Francisco and other research institutions. Private investors have ponied up millions of dollars for research on psychedelic drugs. The state of Oregon has started the process of legalizing therapeutic psilocybin, the key chemical in hallucinogenic mushrooms; lawmakers in other states and cities are considering the same move.</p>



<p>New ways to help people with PTSD, depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders are desperately needed. An estimated 30 percent of people with depression, for instance, don’t get relief from current treatments. Psychedelics, some researchers and clinicians believe, may help.</p>





<p>“The promise is incredible,” says Monnica Williams, a psychologist at the University of Ottawa, who ran the clinical trial Caplash participated in at UConn Health in Farmington. “Psychedelics have the potential to really completely revolutionize mental health and change everything.”</p>



<p>But a cloud of questions hovers over the research. It’s not known how the therapy works or who it might work for. Even if these new treatments perform well in clinical trials, the drugs, and the mind-bending experiences they bring, won’t appeal to everyone. What’s more, the drugs may not be available, or they may cost too much.</p>



<p>Psychedelic drugs, including MDMA, psilocybin and the hallucinogen LSD, which is also being studied as a treatment for depression and other mental health disorders, are illegal under federal law, classified as Schedule 1 substances by the U.S. government — with high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Many people may be reluctant to take an illegal drug that lowers their defenses and makes them vulnerable, no matter how great the promise of healing.</p>



<p>Social and legal hurdles, barriers to access and scientific questions make it unlikely that psychedelics will replace current mental health treatments, many experts agree. More likely is that with enough research, psychedelic substances will become another tool for doctors and therapists.</p>



<p>Caplash remembers what MDMA did for him right after his sessions. “I wasn’t as angry as I was before. My muscles were a lot less tense. I could literally see clearer,” Caplash says. “As I went through the study, I was also becoming a different person.”</p>



<p>The benefits are still with him. Caplash no longer thinks of suicide. A biology major at the University of Connecticut, he has big dreams and advocates for more accessible mental health care for others. “I feel like I’m at peace, to an extent,” he says. “I know who I am and what I want to do.”</p>





<h4>A winding path</h4>



<p>Psychedelic drugs are not new. Scientists at the pharmaceutical company Merck made MDMA in 1912. Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann synthesized LSD in 1938, and Aldous Huxley popularized the drug in his 1953 book <em>The Doors of Perception</em>. When people talk about the psychedelic renaissance, they often begin with Hofmann and Huxley, says Sutton King, who advocates to include Indigenous voices in discussions about psychedelics and is an Afro-Indigenous member of the Menominee and Oneida Nations of Wisconsin.</p>



<p>But the story of psychedelics starts long before then. Indigenous communities around the world have used psilocybin and other consciousness-changing compounds for healing for thousands of years.</p>



<p>“The traditional Indigenous Nations &#8230; have had these connections to these medicines,” says King, who is cofounder and president of the Urban Indigenous Collective, a nonprofit advocacy group in New York City.</p>



<p>Belinda Eriacho, a wisdom carrier of Dine’ (Navajo) and A:shiwi (Zuni) descent, believes that psychedelic drugs, called sacred plant medicines by some Indigenous groups, are catalysts to help align mental, physical, spiritual and emotional health. “We were the knowledge keepers,” she says. “A lot of our understanding about these medicines is through practical experiences. They are not something you can read in a book.”</p>



<p>But around the middle of the 20th century, medical researchers, dissatisfied with existing mental health treatments, began trying to quantify these drugs’ effects on mental states. A flurry of research yielded promising hints, but many of those early attempts didn’t yield solid data. Some experiments were poorly designed; worse, some were deeply unethical, forcing high doses of psychedelics on people who were incarcerated or experiencing psychosis. Many of those study subjects were people of color.</p>



<p>In the 1960s, social and political sentiments began turning against these drugs — and the counterculture they represented — in both non-Indigenous and Indigenous communities. The U.S. government criminalized the use of psychedelics to keep them out of the public’s hands. The new restrictions kept the drugs out of researchers’ hands, too.</p>

<h3>Changing minds&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Psilocybin can change brain activity, but it’s not clear if these shifts relate to mental health. In a study in healthy people, red and orange show where psilocybin boosted brain connectivity compared with a placebo. Those regions are important for handling information coming in from the senses. Blue shows where connections were weaker in people who took psilocybin than in those on a placebo.</p>

<p>That social shift stigmatized the drugs and whatever promise they held, says neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda, who has studied PTSD for decades at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Current drug treatments for PTSD, such as antidepressants or sleep medications, don’t work well for some people, she says. These medicines may help with symptoms, but don’t get at the root of the problem. Psychedelics might do more, she’s come to realize.</p>



<p>Two years ago, when Yehuda began studying psychedelic drugs, she faced a lot of skepticism. But those dismissals have disappeared. “The general attitude in academic medicine right now is, ‘Gosh, let’s try it. Let’s see. Maybe it will be good. Wouldn’t that be nice?’ ”</p>



<p>In some ways, psychedelics can outperform approved psychiatric drugs such as Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. And so far, the data suggest psychedelics work quickly, appear to be safe and have lasting effects, says Atheir Abbas, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. “That is hard to come by. I think that is extremely exciting.”</p>



<p>In the last five years, a handful of high-quality, albeit small, studies have suggested tremendous benefits from the psychedelic psilocybin for depression, anxiety and PTSD. The studies differ in their details, but many follow a similar arc. Generally, the studies begin with talk therapy sessions, followed by several therapy sessions in which participants are under the influence of a psychedelic drug. More psychotherapy comes afterward. At certain points in the process, researchers measure the participants’ symptoms.</p>



<p>Psilocybin-assisted therapy <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630">quickly reduced signs of depression</a> among 24 participants with moderate or severe depression, scientists reported in 2020 in<em> JAMA Psychiatry</em>. Four weeks after two psilocybin sessions, 71 percent of the participants had maintained a drop of at least 50 percent in their scores on a depression rating scale called the GRID-HAMD.</p>

<h3>Depression drop&nbsp;</h3>



<p>People who received two psilocybin sessions with psychotherapy had fewer symptoms of depression one week after their second dose, at week 5, and at week 8 than people who had not yet received the treatment. Error bars show the variation among individual responses.</p>

<p>Earlier work showed psilocybin could help with depression and anxiety in patients facing life-threatening cancer; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881119897615">the benefits were still there about four years after the psilocybin treatment</a>, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>MDMA therapy seemed to have similar effects in an international study of 90 people with PTSD. Two-thirds of those who got MDMA <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3#MOESM2">no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis at the end of the trial</a>, compared with about one-third of participants who received placebos. Those results appeared May 10 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Collectively, the studies offer strong hints that psilocybin, MDMA and other psychedelic drugs can help in these research settings, says Scott Thompson, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. “All of them are giving the same sort of signal,” he says.</p>



<p>We’re in a moment when Western research is converging with the long history of Indigenous knowledge, King says. There is a place for both approaches, “two truths,” as King puts it, when it comes to helping people with psychedelic drugs.</p>



<p>King adds that the excitement coming from laboratories is accompanied by fear for some Indigenous people: fear of their ceremonies being appropriated, fear of worsening access to their medicines and fear of these substances being misunderstood. “It’s an exciting time, but it’s also a scary time for Indigenous peoples,” she says.</p>



<h4>The healing components</h4>



<p>One big question is how the various psychedelic drugs work. “If you look at all the knobs people are turning, it’s really not known what’s critical and what’s not,” Abbas says. The talk therapy that often goes with the drugs, the psychedelic trip or other drug effects could all be important.</p>



<p>Some people suspect that the psychotherapy is the healing component, not the drug itself. And plenty of data show that therapy works well for some people. Many of the key trials so far have been testing the drug in tandem with intense psychotherapy. Caplash, for instance, had multiple therapy sessions before, during and after his MDMA experiences. Similarly intense therapy sessions happened for people in the trial of psilocybin for depression. The drugs might make a person open to exploring some of the painful events of their past during therapy.</p>



<p>Others suspect that the psychedelic trip itself, the hallucinatory experience, is a crucial part of the treatment. That’s a hard question to study, but not impossible, Yehuda says. “We need the science to understand what transformation looks like, and how a drug facilitates it,” she says. “We’ve been afraid of studying the biology of altered states, or even consciousness, because it feels so wonky and so unscientific and so subjective and woo woo. But I think we should be up for this challenge.”</p>



<p>Other scientists are focusing on the actions of the drugs themselves, by looking inside the brain. Thompson, for instance, suspects that it’s possible to get the benefits and skip the trip by restricting cells’ responses to serotonin, a chemical messenger that’s thought to be involved in the hallucinations. His recent study in mice hints that this just might be possible.</p>



<p>In the mice, Thompson and colleagues blocked a sensor thought to spark psilocybin-related hallucinations. When this serotonin-detecting receptor, called 5-HT2A, was blocked, the mice appeared to stop tripping (their heads no longer twitched). Yet, psilocybin still had antidepressive effects on the mice, restoring a lost preference for sugar water. The result raises the idea that the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022489118">antidepressant effects associated with psychedelics can come without the hallucination</a>s, the researchers reported in the April 27 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>If a similar thing could happen in people, “you could retain the benefits but block the trip,” Thompson says. “The trip is the thing that makes you have to spend all day in the hospital with a facilitator there, and makes it expensive, and keeps psychedelics from being widely used,” Thompson says. “Being able to block the trip would lower the barriers in many ways.”</p>



<p>Eriacho, who has used psychedelics for her own healing, says the holistic experience is what matters. Psychedelic medicines allow a person to go within, to the pockets of the mind where traumas lurk, and begin to heal. “That is what it’s done for me,” she says. But the ceremony, the ritual and the wider context were all keys to her healing.</p>

<h4>Who will benefit?</h4>



<p>The trials completed so far have been small and included mostly white volunteers. Williams and colleagues tallied participants in psychedelic studies from 2008 to 2017. Of the 282 people who took part (and for whom race or ethnicity data were available), <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1824-6#Tab1">just 50 were not white</a>, the researchers wrote in 2018 in<em> BMC Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>People of color have been underrepresented in these studies for many reasons, says Williams, who designed her study at UConn Health to specifically look at the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy in people of color. Caplash, who is Indian-American, was the first and only person to go through the process at UConn. Soon after his participation, the trial was stopped at that site. Other enrolled volunteers there were unenrolled, says Williams, now at the University of Ottawa.</p>



<p>“This is a very marginalized and vulnerable group,” she says. “There were fears that if anything really bad happened [during the trial], it would reflect very badly on the university.” UConn Health spokesperson Lauren Woods says that is false. The clinical trial was stopped for a “variety of reasons,” she wrote in an e-mail to <em>Science News</em>, declining to provide specifics.</p>



<p>Without strong efforts to create inclusive studies that actively recruit a diverse group of people into the trials, train therapists of color and consider racial trauma, psychedelic drugs will not be accessible to everyone who might benefit from them, Williams says. “This needs to be an important part of what we do,” she says. “We can’t keep doing it the same way it was done in the past.”</p>



<p>Yehuda aims to design treatments for “the populations who need it the most,” she says. That includes combat veterans with PTSD. She and her colleagues are beginning to enroll 60 veterans in a clinical trial at the James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., where Yehuda directs the Mental Health Patient Care Center. “We are hoping to enroll a lot of ethnically diverse and racially diverse people, because we already serve them,” Yehuda says. “We’ve done a lot of the trust work already.”</p>



<p>As part of her studies, Yehuda plans to get at the question of who the drugs might work for, and why, in part by scrutinizing biological differences between people who get relief from the psychedelics and people who don’t. “We’re going to ask these somewhat tougher questions,” she says. “There is going to be a science about who [MDMA] is particularly good for.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the people making laws and policies are impatient for the science to yield answers. In 2020, Oregon voters approved Measure 109, which provides a sanctioned way to offer people psilocybin-assisted therapy. The state’s Psilocybin Advisory Board, which includes doctors, scientists and even a mushroom biologist, has two years to figure out how the state will regulate that effort.</p>



<p>Abbas is on that advisory board. Speaking personally and not on behalf of that board, he says designing a system for psilocybin-based therapy is immensely complex. “It’s not just who, but it’s how you identify those folks, it’s how you regulate the providers, how you regulate the psilocybin.”</p>



<p>Though studies so far have mainly focused on the performance of psychedelic drugs from a scientific perspective, other considerations are important, too. Perspectives from Indigenous peoples will be sought out, Abbas says.</p>



<p>“There needs to be this meeting of the minds, and the openness that the scientific and Western way of thinking is not always the right way,” Eriacho says. Clinical trials, for instance, often rely on narrowly defined clinical surveys to capture symptoms. “Those are Western concepts,” she says, and from her perspective, those metrics miss a lot. “You don’t have a very comprehensive way of looking at what an individual may be experiencing,” she says.</p>



<p>What Oregon’s psilocybin program will ultimately look like is still anyone’s guess. The same is true for use of other psychedelics. There is no single story to be found amid all of these diverse and intersecting perspectives — Indigenous traditions, Western medicalization, social movements, eager private investors.</p>



<p>In the place of one story, we have many, including that of Kanu Caplash, who feels healed by an experience enabled by a psychedelic drug. His transformation was deeply personal. Yet it gives us a glimpse of something possible and powerful.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda">Merck’s COVID-19 pill may soon be here. How well will it work?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hopes for an easy pill that could combat COVID-19 before people land in the hospital have dimmed a bit. New data about an antiviral pill made by Merck with its partner Ridgeback Pharmaceuticals show it’s not as stellar as first believed. And the drug has drawbacks that could outweigh its potential to fight the coronavirus and keep people out of the hospital.</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now weighing whether to grant emergency use authorization for the drug, called molnupiravir, after the agency’s advisory panel narrowly voted to recommend it on November 30. The drug was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-oral-antiviral-for-covid-19-lagevrio-molnupiravir-approved-by-mhra">authorized for use in the United Kingdom</a> on November 4. &nbsp;If the FDA follows suit, it could wind up being just a stopgap: Some advisers already have urged the agency to be ready to withdraw that authorization as soon as something better comes along.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">Finding an early treatment hasn’t been easy</a>, so many experts initially hailed the development of molnupiravir as a potential game changer for the pandemic: A pill that could be given to people early in the infection might help keep health care systems from being overwhelmed, and spare people at high risk from the most severe complications (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). </p>



<p>In a clinical trial, the drug showed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">early signs of preventing hospitalization and death</a> from COVID-19 in people at high risk of severe disease (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>). In fact, the results were so promising — a 48 percent reduction in the relative risk of hospitalization or death — that the trial was stopped so that the drug might potentially reach the public earlier.</p>





<p>But on November 26, Merck announced in a news release that when all the available data from the trial was in, the<a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgeback-biotherapeutics-provide-update-on-results-from-move-out-study-of-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-medicine-in-at-risk-adults-with-mild-to-moderate-covid-19/"> reduction in relative risk fell to 30 percent</a> against hospitalization and death compared with a placebo. The shift stemmed from an unexplained decrease in severe disease among people in the placebo group in the last part of the trial.</p>



<p>In data collected from May 7 through August 5, 53 of 377 people (or 14.1 percent) in the placebo group were hospitalized and eight died (2.1 percent). In the molnupiravir group, 28 of 385 people (7.3 percent) were hospitalized and none died.</p>



<p>But an FDA analysis of subsequent data showed that from August 6 through October 2, 15 of the 322 people (4.7 percent) in the placebo group were hospitalized and one died (less than 1 percent). Of the 324 people who got molnupiravir during that time period, 20 (6.2 percent) were hospitalized and one died (less than 1 percent), making molnupiravir appear to produce worse outcomes than placebo.</p>



<p>Overall, among the 709 people in the molnupiravir group, there were 48 hospitalizations and one death compared with 68 hospitalizations and nine deaths among the 699 people who got a placebo, dropping the effectiveness from the initial 48 percent to 30 percent.</p>



<h3>Split support</h3>



<p>Taking that lower-than-expected efficacy into account, the FDA’s antimicrobial drugs <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/november-30-2021-antimicrobial-drugs-advisory-committee-meeting-announcement-11302021-11302021#event-materials">advisory committee</a> came to a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/november-30-2021-antimicrobial-drugs-advisory-committee-meeting-announcement-11302021-11302021#event-materials">split 13–10 decision</a> about whether the antiviral drug should be granted emergency use authorization, with experts on each side of the vote often agreeing with points made by the opposing side. The debate and vote reflected a storm of uncertainty about the drug’s efficacy and who should use it — the list of people who would not be eligible is far longer than those most experts would give the drug to. The panel also queried whether the drug could lead to even more dangerous versions of the coronavirus, whether it can cause growth delays in children or mutations in human DNA, and other unanswered questions.</p>

<p>Virologist John Coffin of Tufts University in Boston said during the FDA meeting that he’s dreamed of a small molecule drug that could effectively treat viral infections. “I’m not sure [molnupiravir] is the one we’ve been waiting for, but it’s all we’ve got at the moment.” He voted in favor of the drug but was among those urging the FDA to reconsider if better options become available.</p>



<p>Something better might already be on the horizon if an antiviral pill made by Pfizer lives up to its early promise of an 89 percent decrease in hospitalization and death compared with placebo if taken within three days of symptom onset. That drug works differently than molnupiravir and may not have the same safety concerns.</p>



<p>Another early treatment, lab-made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">monoclonal antibodies, is already authorized</a> for use in nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients  (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). But that treatment has to be given intravenously, requiring a trip to an infusion center. Many people don’t have ready access to such a facility. Some new variants of the coronavirus can also evade some of these antibodies.</p>



<h3>Drug drawbacks</h3>



<p>Among the worries about authorizing molnupiravir is the possibility that the antiviral could spur evolution of more dangerous versions of the coronavirus. The antiviral pill works by making mutations in viral RNA so that viruses are rendered noninfectious and eventually stop replicating. Such mutations happen throughout the virus’s genetic instruction book, or genome.</p>



<p>Some of those mutations could land in the spike protein, which helps the coronavirus break into cells, or other proteins and make the virus more transmissible or more evasive to vaccines. That’s especially a fear if people don’t finish the full five-day course of the drug needed to render the virus inoperable, leading potentially to highly mutated new forms of the virus that could infect others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The potential for this drug to drive some very challenging variants into the public is of major, major concern,” said James Hildreth, an immunologist and president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville.</p>



<p>Merck representatives said that possibility is unlikely, because after five days of taking even a half dose of the drug, infectious viruses were no longer detectable among study participants tested. In one study, the company found seven patients who had changes in the coronavirus’s spike protein after taking molnupiravir, but there was no evidence that the viruses spread to other people or affected the patient’s health (none were hospitalized or died).</p>



<p>Molnupiravir might also create mutations in human DNA, researchers say. The drug is a nucleoside analog — an artificial RNA building block that can mimic the bases cytosine and uracil. Some enzymes in human cells might convert those RNA subunits to a DNA building block, which may lead to mutations in human DNA, especially in rapidly reproducing cells, such as blood cells. How likely that is is an open question.</p>



<p>Lab tests with bacteria and cells grown in lab dishes suggested that the drug might cause such DNA mutations under certain circumstances. But tests in animals suggested that the risk of such mutations actually happening in the body is low. To reduce the chance of such mutations happening, people would be able to take molnupiravir for no more than five days. That should be long enough to eliminate the virus but short enough not to cause lasting harm.</p>



<h3>Limited eligibility</h3>



<p>Animal studies have also indicated that molnupiravir might interfere with bone growth, so the drug probably would not be given to pregnant women or to children or adolescents. For three months, researchers gave rats doses of the drug nine to 15 times higher than people would receive. Those young rats had trouble converting cartilage at growth plates — tissue at the end of long bones that determines the bone’s future length and shape — into bone. But the problem wasn’t seen if rats were dosed for one month or if they got a dose similar to what people would get.</p>



<p>Such bone problems would not be an issue for adults, but more data are needed before giving the drug to kids or to pregnant women, experts say.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear whether the drug will help vaccinated people, or be effective against the delta variant. It’s efficacy also varied depending on a patient’s high-risk health condition. It was good at keeping people with obesity out of the hospital, but more people with diabetes ended up hospitalized while taking the drug than in the placebo group.</p>



<h3>Filling a need</h3>



<p>Still, there are no good remedies for people with mild to moderate COVID-19. Yet as of November 30, more than 82,000 people in the United States are being diagnosed with COVID-19 each day and more than 800 die. Those numbers are expected to increase as case counts surge in some parts of the country. The new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">omicron variant might add fuel to that fire</a> if it proves more contagious than the currently dominant delta variant (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>So even with all of molnupiravir’s drawbacks, federal regulators might decide a 30 percent reduction in hospitalizations and deaths is worth giving the drug temporary authorization.</p>



<p>The drug might be helpful for “the right patient population, the right virus at the right time,” said Lindsey Baden, an infectious diseases doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who chaired the FDA’s advisory committee. “To me that at least suggests there are populations where there may be benefit.”</p>



<p>But more studies need to be done to address concerns about the drug, he said. “It’s the absence of data that makes many of us uncomfortable.”</p>



<p>President Joe Biden said December 2 during remarks laying out a plan to combat the omicron variant that the government has secured a supply of the drugs and, if authorized, will distribute them similarly to vaccines.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-human-carbon-dioxide-emissions-sink-climate">The Southern Ocean is still swallowing large amounts of humans’ carbon dioxide emissions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Southern Ocean is still busily absorbing large amounts of the carbon dioxide emitted by humans’ fossil fuel burning, a study based on airborne observations of the gas suggests. The new results counter a 2018 report that had found that the ocean surrounding Antarctica might not be taking up as much of the emissions as previously thought, and in some regions may actually be adding CO₂ back to the atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not exactly a relief to say that the oceans, which are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-acidification-food-web-nitrogen-fixing">already becoming more acidic</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-oceans-storing-heat-record-breaking-amounts">storing record-breaking amounts of heat</a> due to global warming, might be able to bear a little more of the climate change burden (<em>SN: 4/28/17</em>; <em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). But “in many ways, [the conclusion] was reassuring,” says Matthew Long, an oceanographer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because the Southern Ocean alone has been thought to be responsible for nearly half of the global ocean uptake of humans’ CO₂ emissions each year. That means it plays an outsize role in modulating some of the immediate impacts of those emissions. However, the float-based estimates had suggested that, over the course of a year, the Southern Ocean was actually a net source of carbon dioxide rather than a sink, ultimately emitting about 0.3 billion metric tons of the gas back to the atmosphere each year.</p>



<p>In contrast, the new findings, published in the Dec. 3 <em>Science</em>, suggest that from 2009 through 2018, the Southern Ocean was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi4355">still a net sink, taking up a total of about 0.55 billion metric tons</a> of carbon dioxide each year.</p>





<p>The 2018 study had used newly deployed deep-diving ocean floats, now numbering almost 200, that are part of a project called <a href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/">Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling, or SOCCOM</a>. Calculations based on data collected from 2014 through 2017 by 35 of the floats suggested that parts of the ocean were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-antarctica-absorbs-less-carbon-expected">actually releasing a great deal of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere</a> during winter (<em>SN: 6/2/19</em>). That sparked concerns that the Southern Ocean’s role in buffering the impacts of climate change on Earth might not be so robust as once thought.</p>



<p>Long says he and other researchers were somewhat skeptical about that takeaway, however. The floats measure temperature, salinity and pH in the water down to about 2,000 meters, and scientists use those data to calculate the carbon dioxide concentration in the water. But those calculations rest on several assumptions about the ocean water properties, as actual data are still very scarce. That may be skewing the data a bit, leading to calculations of higher carbon dioxide emitted from the water than is actually occurring, Long suggests.</p>



<p>Another way to measure how much carbon dioxide is moving between air and sea is by taking airborne measurements. In the new study, the team amassed previously collected carbon dioxide data over large swaths of the Southern Ocean during three separate series of aircraft flights — one series lasting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/hippo-reveals-climate-surprises">from 2009 to 2011</a>, one in the winter of 2016 and a third in several periods from 2016 to 2018 (<em>SN: 9/8/11</em>). Then, the researchers used those data to create simulations of how much carbon dioxide could possibly be moving between ocean and atmosphere each year.</p>



<p>The float-based and aircraft-based studies estimate different overall amounts of carbon dioxide moving out of the ocean, but both identified a seasonal pattern of less carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean during winter. That indicates that both types of data are picking up a real trend, says Ken Johnson, an ocean chemist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif., who was not involved in the research. “We all go up and down together.”</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear whether the SOCCOM data were off. But to better understand what sorts of biases might affect the pH calculations, researchers must compare direct measurements of carbon dioxide in the water taken from ships with pH-based estimates at the same location. Such studies are under way right now off the coast of California, Johnson says.</p>



<p>The big takeaway, Johnson says, is that both datasets — as well as direct shipboard measurements in the Southern Ocean, which are few and far between — are going to be essential for understanding what role these waters play in the planet’s carbon cycle. While the airborne studies can help constrain the big picture of carbon dioxide emissions data from the Southern Ocean, the floats are much more widely distributed, and so are able to identify local and regional variability in carbon dioxide, which the atmospheric data can’t do.</p>



<p>“The Southern Ocean is the flywheel of the climate system,” the part of an engine’s machinery that keeps things chugging smoothly along, Johnson says. “If we don’t get our understanding of the Southern Ocean right, we don’t have much hope for understanding the rest of the world.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-exoplanet-made-molten-iron-star">This tiny, sizzling exoplanet could be made of molten iron</a></h4>

              
                <p>A newly discovered exoplanet is really making astronomers prove their mettle. Planet GJ 367b is smaller than Earth, denser than iron and hot enough to melt, researchers report in the Dec. 3 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“We think the surface of this exoplanet could be molten,” says astronomer Kristine Wei Fun Lam of the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center in Berlin.</p>



<p>Signals of the planet were first spotted in data from NASA’s TESS telescope in 2019. The small world swung around its host star every 7.7 hours.</p>



<p>Using data from TESS and the ground-based HARPS spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, Lam and her colleagues measured the planet’s radius and mass. GJ 367b clocked in at about 0.72 times Earth’s radius and 0.55 times its mass. That makes it the first ultrashort-period planet — a class of worlds with years shorter than one Earth day and with mysterious origins — known to be smaller and lighter than Earth.</p>





<p>Using those measurements, the team then calculated the planet’s density: about 8.1 grams per cubic centimeter, or slightly denser than iron. A computer analysis of the planet’s interior structure suggests that 86 percent of it could comprise an iron core, with only a sliver of rock left on top.</p>



<p>Mercury has a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-has-massive-solid-inner-core">similarly large core</a>, Lam notes (<em>SN: 4/22/19</em>). Scientists think that’s a result of a giant impact with another planet that stripped away most of its outer layers. GJ 367b could have formed after a similar collision. It could also have once been a gaseous planet whose <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-exoplanet-may-be-exposed-core-gas-giant">atmosphere was blasted off by radiation from its star</a> (<em>SN: 7/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>Whatever its origins, GJ 367b is so close to its star that it’s almost certainly covered in melted metallic lava now. “At 1400° Celsius, I don’t think it would be very nice to stand on it,” Lam says.</p>

                <p>With gratitude and sadness, we announce that arXiv’s executive director Dr. Eleonora Presani is stepping down, effective December 3, 2021. arXiv’s leadership team &#8212; Jim Entwood, Helen Wang, Alison Fromme, and Martin Lessmeister, along with Scientific Director Steinn Sigurdsson &#8212; will continue to direct arXiv’s operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;My experience at arXiv has been incredibly humbling,” said Dr. Presani. “Seeing the love that arXiv receives from the community, I am confident that, with the continued support of the Simons Foundation and our valuable members, arXiv will continue to grow sustainably and bring Open Science to the next level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Presani joined arXiv as the organization’s first executive director in its 30 year history. Just as New York City entered lockdown due to the pandemic, Dr. Presani brought energy and vision to the team, and, throughout her tenure, led major initiatives in technical improvements, funding stability, interoperability, and the author and moderator experience. Under her direction, arXiv responded quickly to the pandemic and brought on a new moderator to address the influx of COVID papers. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, the team updated the LaTeX compilation engine, and added user-friendly error reporting to ease the submission process for authors. Collaboration was encouraged with the launch of arXivLabs, which resulted in the integration of new community-developed features. Internally, the team developed a new system to encourage effective moderator collaboration, and also improved author communication with a new support platform. arXiv also introduced a new brand identity and logo, launched a new funding and member model that is on track to increase revenue, and garnered more than $600,000 USD in new donations.</p>
<p>With arXiv staff and advisory boards, Dr. Presani also laid the groundwork for the next year of work at arXiv, which focuses on technical stability, tools for effective moderation, financial sustainability, and interoperability. The arXiv leadership team has embraced this plan and is prepared to move forward with it throughout 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will sorely miss Dr. Presani&#8217;s energy and drive at arXiv, and at the same time honour her commitment to making arXiv bigger than any one of us by serving the expanding arXiv community ever better,&#8221; said Dr. Ralph Wijers, professor of high-energy astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam and incoming chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the arXiv Member Advisory Board, I would like to thank Dr. Presani for her many contributions to arXiv and for her support of the arXiv community. She has been the compass providing arXiv with direction and strategic focus, paving the way for a stronger and healthier organization, while ensuring arXiv continues to deliver on its commitment to the community. Thanks to her skills, energy and dedication, arXiv has a robust plan for moving forward as an organization and for addressing new and exciting challenges in support of worldwide scientific communication,” said Carol Hoover, Scholarly Communications and Licensing Librarian at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and Chair of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/12/02/women-are-no-more-emotionally-turbulent-than-men/">Women Are No More Emotionally Turbulent Than Men</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Women are commonly assumed to be more emotionally turbulent than men: moodier, more volatile, and more likely to experience rapid changes in affect across the course of the menstrual cycle. Aside from being the basis of many a sexist joke, this assumption has had an impact on research, with cisgender women excluded from research due to apparent fluctuations in mood.</p>



<p>Building on research exploring fluctuations in rodents, a team from the University of Michigan has looked more closely at such variability in humans. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00143-7">Their study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports </em>finds no difference in emotional variance between cisgender men and women, or between women who do and do not use oral contraception.</p>



<span id="more-44786"></span>



<p>Participants were cisgender men and women aged between 18 and 38. Some women were not on any form of oral contraception, while others were taking the pill. Every evening for the entirety of the 75-day study, participants rated how much they had experienced ten positive and ten negative emotions in the last day.</p>



<p>The team used this data to look at three key areas: how volatile each participant’s mood was, based on how much it varied from their average mood; their emotional inertia, or how much their mood on one day predicted mood the next day; and how cyclical their moods were, based on how frequently they experienced specific changes in mood.</p>



<p>The team found very little statistical evidence for differences between men and women on any of these measures (in fact, men showed slightly more variability in mood than women). Similarly, there was little evidence that women on oral contraception differed from women not using contraception.</p>



<p>This has significant consequences in research settings. As the team notes, cisgender women are being excluded from research because of a perception that their moods are unstable — but if this isn’t the case, as these results suggest, this could create opportunities for researchers looking at a great number of different topics.</p>



<p>More work needs to be done on the variability of moods for women on the pill. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/20/mood-swings-more-than-pms-contraceptive-pill-alice-roberts">Anecdotally</a>, the pill can cause serious mood swings, while some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219471/">research</a> has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14710055/">done</a> on the link between the pill, mental health, and mood.</p>



<p>The team is not suggesting, however, that oral contraceptives (or endogenous hormones) play absolutely no role in mood. Indeed, the study compares differences in variation in men and women rather than looking at the specific impact of hormones on mood, and the team notes that  a combination of factors including diet, sleep, exercise, social interactions and other contexts can combine to influence variability in and volatility of mood. While our hormones undoubtedly play a part in how we feel, they are simply part of a wider tapestry of factors that may or may not have anything to do with our gender.</p>

<p><strong>Apparent cure for rabies</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/medical-sciences-82"><em>Science News</em></a>, December 4, 1971</p>



<p>The painful and always fatal virus disease rabies may at last be licked — not with the traditional series of rabies vaccine shots that sometimes ward off the disease after a person has been bitten by a rabid animal, but by the timely use of relatively simple medical techniques.… As a result [a 6-year-old boy] is the world’s only known survivor of rabies.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Though the boy was vaccinated, the shots — which have improved since the 1970s — didn’t prevent disease. Medical techniques used to treat him, including inserting a tube to help him breathe, giving seizure medication and draining fluid buildup on the brain, proved that rabies patients can survive. Yet the disease is still almost always fatal once people show symptoms. In 2004, a 15-year-old girl became the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-million">first known unvaccinated rabies survivor</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/05, p.&nbsp;77</em>). Doctors treated her using the M­ilwaukee Protocol. This controversial method puts patients in a coma to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rabies-races-nerve-cells">protect the brain while the immune system mounts defenses</a>. But even with that treatment, most patients still die.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">What we know and don’t know about the omicron coronavirus variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>Another coronavirus variant has emerged, and with it comes a new wave of uncertainty and unanswered questions. Days after the news broke, we remain in an information vacuum, and in a prognostication whirlwind with even vaccine makers <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/omicron-unlikely-to-cause-severe-illness-in-vaccinated-people-biontech-founder-says-11638286176">contradicting</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/30/omicron-moderna-ceo-vaccines-covid/">each other</a>. Finding answers like whether vaccines can thwart new variants takes time.</p>



<p>To quickly recap, late last week, researchers in South Africa and Botswana raised the alarm that they had detected a coronavirus variant with myriad mutations, many of which are in the part of the virus that helps it enter and infect cells. The World Health Organization quickly gave this highly mutated variant its own Greek letter — omicron — officially signifying it as a <a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/">variant of concern</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Omicron’s very emergence is another reminder that although many of us might think we are done with COVID-19, it is not done with us,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a special session of the World Health Assembly on November 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omicron’s detection sparked a flurry of controversial travel bans to and from South Africa and surrounding countries, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/11/30/1059780197/african-leaders-condemn-travel-restrictions-as-omicron-variant-spreads-globally">angering African leaders</a>. Yet these quick decisions are based more on disquiet than data.</p>





<p>Here’s what we know, and what we don’t know.</p>





<h3>What we know</h3>



<p>The list of things we <em>do</em> know about omicron is short. We know South Africa has had a big spike in COVID-19 cases — going from an average of less than 300 cases per day in early November to more than 2,000 by the end of the month. Researchers are in the midst of testing what share of those infections might be due to omicron. We know the variant has turned up in other places like Israel, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Australia. On December 1, the first case in the United States <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html">popped up in California</a>, in a vaccinated person who had recently returned from South Africa.</p>



<p>Some places in the United Kingdom and Europe have reported cases of omicron that aren’t linked to travel to southern Africa, suggesting the variant may have been spreading person-to-person in the community for around a month, says Müge Çevik, an infectious diseases physician and virologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.</p>



<p>It’s a bit reminiscent of early 2020, when we first found out the coronavirus was spreading to countries outside China. Now that scientists know what they’re looking for, they’re finding it.</p>



<h3>What we don’t know</h3>



<p>What we <em>don’t</em> know about omicron is much, much greater. Most information, at this point, is speculation.</p>



<p>We don’t yet know if it is more transmissible than other variants or how well it might evade virus-attacking antibodies. We don’t know whether it might cause more severe disease or if symptoms might be milder. We don’t know where omicron emerged. (South Africa, one of the first places to detect it, has a robust surveillance program, making the country well-suited to spotting new variants. Not all countries do.) We don’t know how effective vaccines will be against it. We don’t know how likely reinfections might be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, ultimately, we don’t know how omicron might compete with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta variant</a> (<em>SN</em>: 7/30/21). It’s possible that omicron could eventually overthrow delta as the dominant variant globally. It’s also possible that omicron won’t. It’s hard to come to any definitive conclusions from what’s going on in South Africa because cases there were already low when omicron sparked a spike, meaning there wasn’t much delta around to compete with anyway. What’s more, whether a variant takes off in specific places depends on what’s going on in those spots.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>The fact that there were few cases in South Africa may have helped researchers there identify omicron much earlier than other places, Çevik says. It’s easier to identify and analyze clusters when cases are low than when there are lots of infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With so many unknowns, patience and prudence are key. We won’t know the answers about immune evasion, for example, for at least a couple of weeks. Other answers, like disease severity, could take months. In the meantime, one thing never changes: Even when new variants emerge, we still have public health tools at our disposal to control their spread. Masks, social distancing, ventilation, testing and contact tracing are all variant-proof. These measures continue to work no matter how the virus might evolve.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why scientists are concerned about omicron</h3>



<p>That said, there are reasons why scientists are worried about omicron. On a molecular level, it’s got some red flags. They come from the variant’s<a href="https://covariants.org/variants/21K.Omicron"> unique constellation of mutations</a>. Omicron has around 30 changes in the spike protein, which the virus uses to break into cells, including some mutations found in or similar to other worrisome variants such as the highly infectious alpha and the world-dominant delta. About 20 other viral tweaks are scattered in other proteins that do things like help the virus<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.029454v2"> replicate inside cells</a> or<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301869"> interfere with early immune responses</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous studies looking at some of the spike mutations in other variants are helping scientists make early guesses at the consequences some of these changes in omicron might have. For instance, omicron shares a mutation called P681H with the alpha variant that may help the virus<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.455140v1"> transmit better from person-to-person</a> when combined with two additional changes. Studies done in dishes of cells hint that a combination of two other mutations called Q498R and N501Y may help the virus better<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00954-4"> bind to the protein ACE2</a>, the virus’s doorway to enter host cells. There are also some missing amino acids in a region of the spike called the N-terminal domain. That part of the spike is a common target for immune proteins called neutralizing antibodies that stop the virus from breaking into cells, so mutations there can help the virus hide from the immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But these early guesses are just that: guesses. We don’t know whether these mutations might have the same effect when combined. Altogether, so many changes might damage some of the virus’s abilities compared with other variants. Or they might not. It’s too early to tell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s hard for me to imagine this virus taking over [because] it has so many mutations in critical areas of the spike protein,”&nbsp;says virologist Yiska Weisblum of Rockefeller University in New York City. Still, studies hint that many of omicron’s mutations may help it dodge parts of the immune response. “It could take over just because of that,” Weisblum says, because it might infect vaccinated people, too.</p>



<p>It’s also too soon to say how exactly the virus accumulated so many mutations. Previous case studies have shown that people with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread">weakened immune systems can be infected for months</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/20</em>). In such cases, the immune system wages war on the virus but can’t eliminate the infection, allowing the virus to evolve in new ways that evade some of the immune system’s weapons, including antibodies. It’s possible that’s what happened with omicron. It’s also possible the virus may have accumulated mutations while flying under the radar in a country that doesn’t have the capacity for lots of genetic surveillance. It wasn’t until it spread to South Africa, where the country’s surveillance program — established long before omicron emerged — picked it up, that researchers knew it existed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see such a highly mutated virus may seem surprising. “However, when you have many infected people, millions of people, then something that is not likely becomes reality,” Weisblum says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Months before omicron emerged, Weisblum, virologist Fabian Schmidt also of Rockefeller University and colleagues were curious how the immune system might do against a variant with lots of mutations. To figure it out, the researchers engineered an animal virus that doesn’t make people sick to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04005-0">sport a coronavirus spike with 20 mutations</a>. The team then tested whether antibodies could still stop the virus from infecting cells. They tested antibodies from people who had recovered from COVID-19, people who had been vaccinated and people who had recovered and been vaccinated. Neutralizing antibodies from people who’d recovered and been vaccinated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">could still attack that version of the virus</a> (<em>SN</em>: 8/19/21). Neutralizing antibodies from people who’d been vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA vaccine or previously infected only, however, didn’t recognize the virus very well.</p>



<p>Now, with omicron, it seems nature has gone and repeated the team’s experiment.&nbsp;Time will tell what nature’s results will look like. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the fact that neutralizing antibodies in Weisblum, Schmidt and colleagues’ experiment didn’t recognize the virus very well may seem bad, the good news is that the body has more than neutralizing antibodies at its disposal. Other types of antibodies will still bind to the virus, sending warnings to the immune system that the coronavirus has invaded. Immune cells called T cells can kill infected cells or kick parts of the immune system, including antibody-producing B cells, into high gear.</p>



<p>The vaccines still prepare the body for future fights with the coronavirus, Schmidt says, and should still give us some protection. Our bodies just might not be able to completely stop the virus from getting into cells in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The role of vaccines</h3>



<p>Could boosters help? Scientists don’t know. We don’t yet know whether or not the additional shots might help people develop neutralizing antibodies that can still recognize even highly mutated variants like omicron, Weisblum says. With every exposure, whether from vaccination or infection, our bodies refine their troves of antibodies to better attack the virus. If omicron spreads around the world, booster shots could become crucial. Already, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its recommendations on November 29 to say that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1129-booster-recommendations.html">all adults <em>should</em> get a booster dose</a> (previously, it suggested that those 18 to 49 <em>may</em> get one, but now the agency has upped the sense of urgency). Some vaccine developers, including Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech and Moderna, are preparing to formulate omicron-specific vaccines, just in case, but those won’t be available for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More important than boosters, though, is getting vaccines to people who haven’t received a single dose. That includes the majority of people across Africa, where countries have vaccination rates that are far lower than other parts of the world. Scientists have warned for months that inequities in vaccine distribution <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">could give the virus a helping hand</a> by leaving large groups of people susceptible to infection (<em>SN</em>: 2/26/21).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As I have said many times, the longer we allow the pandemic to drag on — by failing to address vaccine inequity, or to implement public health and social measures in a tailored and consistent way — the more opportunity we give this virus to mutate in ways we cannot predict or prevent,” the WHO’s Tedros said November 30 at a WHO member state information session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, though, it’s a waiting game. We’re waiting to learn more about omicron — whether it will rise to dominance like delta or fade into history like alpha and beta. All we can do is wear our masks and be patient.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dinosaur-ankylosaur-tail-weapon-aztec-war-club">This dinosaur had a weapon shaped like an Aztec war club on its tail</a></h4>

              
                <p>A newly discovered species of ankylosaur had a bizarre club on its tail unlike that of any known dinosaur.</p>



<p>With its flat surface and sharp blades along the sides, this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04147-1">unique structure at the back end of <em>Stegouros elengassen</em></a>, a species of ankylosaur that lived between 72 million and 75 million years ago, strongly resembles an Aztec war club called a macuahuitl, say paleontologist Sergio Soto-Acuña and colleagues. The tail’s shape may indicate an early evolutionary split in the ankylosaur lineage, the researchers report online December 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Soto-Acuña, of the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, and his team identified the new species based on a nearly complete skeleton discovered in the dry Patagonian region of Chile. With its slender limbs and unusually short tail, <em>S. elengassen</em> already looked markedly different from other ankylosaurs in many ways. But its cranium pegged the creature as a type of early ankylosaur, the team found.</p>

<p>Ankylosaurs were the heavily armored tanks of the dinosaur world, their bodies and heads shielded by rugged plates of bone. Different species also sported a variety of other anatomical weapons, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dinosaur-resurrects-demon-ghostbusters">shin-shattering clubbed tails</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-ankylosaur-found-utah-had-surprisingly-bumpy-head">spiky skulls</a> (<em>SN: 6/12/17</em>; <em>SN: 7/19/18</em>). But <em>S. elengassen</em>’s strange tail is unique among these weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few ankylosaur species have been dug up in the Southern Hemisphere. Those that are known, including <em>S. elengassen</em>, may be some of the most primitive species of the group — and may even represent a separate branch of the armored dinosaurs. That branch possibly split from other ankylosaurs, including the lineage that includes the genus <em>Ankylosaurus</em>, early in their evolutionary history, during the mid-Jurassic Period around 167 million years ago, the researchers suggest.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-footprints-mysterious-hominid-lucy-species">Ancient footprints suggest a mysterious hominid lived alongside Lucy’s kind</a></h4>

              
                <p>An individual from an enigmatic hominid species strode across a field of wet, volcanic ash in what is now East Africa around 3.66 million years ago, leaving behind a handful of footprints.</p>



<p>Those five ancient impressions, largely ignored since their partial excavation at Tanzania’s Laetoli site in 1976, show hallmarks of upright walking by a hominid, a new study finds. Researchers had previously considered them hard to classify, possibly produced by a young bear that took a few steps while standing.</p>



<p>Nearby Laetoli footprints unearthed in 1978 looked more clearly like those of hominids and have been attributed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-footprint-finds-suggest-range-body-sizes-lucy-species">Lucy&#8217;s species</a>, <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> (<em>SN: 12/16/16</em>). But the shape and positioning of the newly identified hominid footprints <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04187-7">differ enough from <em>A. afarensis</em> to qualify as marks of a separate <em>Australopithecus</em> species</a>, an international team reports December 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“Different [hominid] species walked across this East African landscape at about the same time, each moving in different ways,” says paleoanthropologist Ellison McNutt of Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine in Athens.</p>





<p>The species identity of the Laetoli printmaker is unknown.</p>

<p>Fossil jaws dating back more than 3 million years unearthed in East Africa may come from a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-suggest-another-hominid-species-lived-near-lucy">species dubbed<em> A. deyiremeda</em></a> that lived near Lucy’s crowd (<em>SN: 5/27/15</em>). But no foot fossils were found with the jaws to compare with the Laetoli finds. The 3.4-million-year-old foot fossils from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-ancestor-grasped-walking">an East African hominid that had grasping toes and no arch</a> and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-hominid-ardi-hand-bone-fossils-grip-chimp-human">unusual fossil feet of 4.4-million-year-old <em>Ardipithecus ramidus</em></a> aren’t a match either (<em>SN: 3/28/12; SN: 2/24/21</em>). So neither of those hominids could have made the five Laetoli prints, says McNutt, who started the new investigation as a Dartmouth College graduate student supervised by paleoanthropologist Jeremy DeSilva.</p>



<p>Because footprints of Lucy’s species differed in some ways from the impressions uncovered two years earlier, many researchers doubted that a hominid had made the five-step trackway, some suspecting a bear instead.</p>





<p>The latest analysis refutes that suggestion, says paleoanthropologist Bernard Wood of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who did not participate in the new study. “Not one, but two [hominids] left their mark at Laetoli 3.66 million years ago.”</p>



<p>McNutt, deSilva and their colleagues fully excavated and cleaned the five Laetoli footprints in June 2019. Then they measured, photographed and 3-D scanned the ancient tracks. Print sizes indicated that they had been made by a relatively short individual, possibly one that had not yet reached maturity.</p>



<p>McNutt’s group focused on two consecutive footprints that were particularly well-preserved. Foot shapes, proportions and stride characteristics of the Laetoli individual differed in various ways from those of <em>A. afarensis</em> individuals at the same site. The prints also didn’t match those from modern juvenile black bears and modern chimps walking upright, present-day East African Daasanach people who typically don’t wear shoes or preserved footprints of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-biggest-collection-ancient-human-footprints-found">East African hunter-gatherers</a> dating to between roughly 12,000 and 10,000 years ago (<em>SN: 5/14/20</em>).</p>

<p>The Laetoli individual possessed a wider, more chimplike foot than <em>A. afarensis</em> or humans, the researchers say. Its big toe stuck out slightly from the second toe, but not to the degree observed in chimps. Signs of a balanced, upright gait in the ancient tracks resulted from humanlike knees positioned underneath the hips, humanlike hips oriented to stabilize a two-legged stride or both.</p>



<p>On one step, the Laetoli individual’s left leg crossed in front of the right leg, leaving a left footprint directly in front of the previous impression. People may cross-step in this way when trying to regain balance. But McNutt’s team doubts that the newly analyzed Laetoli footprints represent smudged impressions made by an <em>A. afarensis</em> individual that cross-stepped, perhaps to stay upright. That’s in part because footprints of Daasanach people walking as usual and then cross-stepping look largely the same, McNutt’s team found. And bears and chimps assume a relatively wide stance due to knee and hip arrangements that prevent them from walking like the Laetoli individual and probably from cross-stepping, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Given that only two of the ancient footprints are complete enough to analyze thoroughly, the possibility that an ape other than a hominid made the Laetoli impressions can’t be ruled out, says William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at Lehman College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York City who wasn’t involved in the research. But evidence of cross-stepping points to a hominid track maker, he says. </p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>You might hate following instructions on how to do something, but there’s no avoiding them. Training on everything from how to drive a car to read an X-ray starts with explicit instructions — whether verbal or written, as the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-98238-006">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception</em> and Performance point out. In fact, Luke Rosedahl at UC, Santa Barbara and colleagues write, “This practice is so widely accepted that scholarship primarily focuses on how to provide instructions, not whether these instructions help or not.” Now the team reports that for learning how to do well at certain tasks, they do not help at all.</p>



<span id="more-44775"></span>



<p>The team explored something that we do all the time: mentally sorting items into categories. They looked at two types of category sorting tasks. With a &#8220;rule-based&#8221; type, your best strategy for doing well is to learn and follow an explicit logical rule or rules. Let’s say you’re presented with a set of shapes, which you need to sort into two categories, and the rule is: all the yellow triangles belong to Category A, and everything else to Category B. (Rule-based tasks can get more complicated, but the rules are usually straightforward to explain and absorb.)</p>



<p>Then there are &#8220;information-integration&#8221; tasks. To do well at these tasks, we have to learn to integrate bits of information that we find less straightforward to process together consciously, and rely more instead on &#8220;implicit learning&#8221;. This type of learning is important for learning a language, for example, and underpins expert &#8220;gut feelings&#8221;. The best strategy to do well at these tasks is often difficult to describe verbally — which made the team wonder whether instructions actually help.</p>



<p>To explore this, they recruited a total of 58 students at UCSB. Half were given a rule-based task and half an information-integration task. Within each of these two groups, half were first told the rule that they needed to follow to do well, and half were not. So half of each group had to learn the rule for themselves.</p>



<p>Each participant was shown a series of bars of plots on a graph, which varied in thickness and angle of alignment. Each time, the participant had to identify a graph as &#8220;type A&#8221; or &#8220;type B&#8221;. Those in the rule-based group had to follow this rule to do well: “Respond A if the bars are thick and the orientation is low; otherwise respond B”. Those in the information-integration group had to follow this rule: “Respond A if the bar width is greater than the orientation; otherwise respond B.” Though this rule can be expressed verbally, it’s harder for a person (though not a computer) to grasp. As the researchers point out, “For humans, judging whether bar width is greater or less than bar orientation feels like comparing apples and oranges.”</p>



<p>Every time a participant assigned an image to a category, they got feedback on whether they were right or wrong. Whenever they made an error, those who’d first been told their rule were also given extra feedback on how they should have followed that rule, to pick the right category.</p>



<p>When the team looked at how the participants performed, the result was clear: receiving instructions dramatically improved performance for the rule-based task. But it had no impact whatsoever on the performance of the information-integration group.</p>



<p>“We are routinely taught that instructions are beneficial even in highly complex motor tasks,” the researchers comment. “Our results question this conventional wisdom.”</p>



<p>So what are the real world implications of these results?</p>



<p>The team doesn’t recommend ditching instructions for information-integration tasks entirely. There are difficult classification tasks that do require implicit learning to build expertise. The team highlights radiologists screening mammograms for follow-up, for example. An expert radiologist may have implicitly learned difficult-to-explain patterns of calcifications that would lead them to recommend further investigation. However, initial use of a rule that anyone with more than five calcifications per cubic centimetre should have further evaluation could “bootstrap” that learning, the team writes.</p>



<p>Still, they think their work does have implications for this type of training, for example: “Our results suggest that the development of expertise might be facilitated if instruction focused exclusively on the explicit components of expert classification, and the implicit components were improved exclusively through practice,” they write.</p>



<p>Perhaps further study involving more complex, real-world tasks is required before any drastic changes in training are made. But the finding that instructions don’t always help us to do better at a task is an important one.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-98238-006">When instructions don&#8217;t help: Knowing the optimal strategy facilitates rule-based but not information-integration category learning.</a></p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/Untitled-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>To make a long story short: <em>In the future the available antimicrobial agents might not be effective in the treatment of many life-threatening bacterial infections in both humans and domestic animals.</em></p>
<p>The message is very simple but if you read it a few times and think about the possible consequences the message sends a shiver down your spine.</p>
<p>Microbiologists have long been warning about our challenges in 21st century as many scientists predicted the possibility of an emerging viral pandemic<sup>1</sup>. In the real world, we saw how unprepared we are against such eventualities. The same story is true for the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) problem as Alexander Fleming in his 1945 interview with <em>The New York Times</em> warned that misuse of antimicrobials leads to the selection of resistant bacteria <sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>It is likely that many scientific facts and predictions may not be implemented as obligatory rules in policymaking by countries and health authorities because they might be so busy with the smaller problems of daily life than finding proactive solutions.</p>
<p>The AMR is a multifaceted problem that needs a holistic view to be solved. We need to understand the one health perspective that considers human, animal, and environmental health as an integrated system. Despite the urgent need for developing such systems, the one health approach still looks like an interesting idea rather than a practical action-oriented approach in most situations or in most developing countries <sup>3, 4</sup>.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that AMR has been considered a global challenge for sustainable development goals (SDG) of many countries across the world as discussed in the UN General Assembly in April 2021 <sup>5</sup> Volkan Bozkir the president of the UN general assembly highlighted the global importance of this unnoticed problem “ <em>Antimicrobial Resistance is the invisible pandemic we ignore at our peril. Measures to tackle AMR must be central to future pandemic preparedness and COVID-19 recovery plans. The One Health approach will help us to better recognize the interconnections between people, animals, plants, and our shared environment so that we can make our world healthier for all </em>“.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In the 21st century, we, the global residents of planet earth are connected more than ever and a rising problem in a specific region could become an international crisis a few years later. On the other hand, there are several economic or geographical boundaries that prevent researchers from working together to solve large-scale global problems like AMR. How can we predict a better future when the problems are so intertwined and complex today?</p>
<p>Many scientists have already proved that they are ready to work together for a better future, despite difficulties and limited resources. It seems that we need more international research groups in order to find more practical solutions for multifaceted problems like AMR.</p>
<p>The BMC series proved to be an excellent community that puts together different ideas of international importance openly accessible worldwide. We are delighted to announce a new collection on AMR at <a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com"><em>BMC Veterinary Research</em></a>, entitled <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vamr"><em>Combatting Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vamr">Submission</a> to the collection is open until <strong>31 March 2022</strong>, and we are pleased to invite researchers to share their valuable ideas of global importance to be considered for this collection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orangutan-body-size-evolution">Ancient giant orangutans evolved smaller bodies surprisingly slowly</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant orangutans that once dwelled in mainland Southeast Asian forests belonged to a single species that gradually shrank in size over nearly 2 million years, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Today, orangutans are found only on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. But their ancient, super-size kin roamed forests in what’s now southern China and northern Vietnam. Fragmentary Asian fossils of uncertain age have long indicated that these massive, now-extinct orangutans shrank over time. And biological anthropologist Terry Harrison of New York University suspected — based on a small number of fossils from widely different time periods — that the apes <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618214000226">rapidly evolved from a larger-bodied species</a> to a different, smaller-bodied species roughly 400,000 years ago as the climate cooled.</p>



<p>But an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248421001421">analysis of 600 ancient orangutan teeth</a> unearthed in 10 caves in southern China supports a different evolutionary scenario, Harrison and colleagues report in the December <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>From around 2 million to 111,000 years ago, the shapes of the teeth remained largely the same, suggesting all were from a single orangutan species. But tooth sizes progressively declined. Using tooth measurements, Harrison, paleoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues estimate that the ancient orangutans’ average body mass started out around 96 kilograms, close to double that of orangutans today.</p>





<p>By around 111,000 years ago, the ancient apes’ average body mass was almost 80 kilograms, which still exceeded that of modern orangutans by nearly 25 kilograms.</p>



<p>Fossils of other ancient Asian animals, including rhinos and monkeys, also show declines in body size over the same period. Cooler, drier conditions that reduced available food starting around 400,000 years ago may have spurred a trend toward smaller bodies, Harrison says.</p>



<p>It’s not clear when orangutans on mainland Asia died out. But climate change and possibly the arrival of humans in the region more than 60,000 years ago contributed to their demise, Harrison speculates.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Christoph Metzner will talk about his recent work publihed in a paper &quot;Synchronization through Uncorrelated Noise in Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Gamma rhythms play a major role in many different processes in the
brain, such as attention, working memory and sensory processing. While
typically considered detrimental, counterintuitively noise can
sometimes have beneficial effects on communication and information
transfer. Recently, Meng and Riecke showed that synchronization of
interacting networks of inhibitory neurons in the gamma band increases
while synchronization within these networks decreases when neurons are
subject to uncorrelated noise. However, experimental and modeling
studies point towards an important role of the pyramidal-interneuronal
network gamma (PING) mechanism in the cortex. Therefore, we
investigated the effect of uncorrelated noise on the communication
between excitatory-inhibitory networks producing gamma oscillations
via a PING mechanism. Our results suggest that synaptic noise can have
a supporting role in facilitating inter-regional communication and
that noise-induced synchronization between networks is generated via a
different mechanism than when synchronization is mediated by strong
synaptic coupling. Noise-induced synchronization is achieved by
lowering synchronization within networks which allows the respective
other network to impose its own gamma rhythm resulting in
synchronization between networks.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>The advent of the internet shifted how we socialise. Chat rooms, forums, and eventually social media platforms opened up new ways to both communicate and express ourselves. Online anonymity, for example, allowed us to be whoever we pleased to anyone with a connection — for better or worse. Psychological research followed this shift, and decades later there are troves of papers on almost every aspect of online interaction you could hope to explore.</p>



<p>As technology continues to march onwards, it’s brought with it increasingly accessible options for socialising in virtual reality (VR). Though VR is by definition virtual, the experiences users have in it are very much real. Since VR’s accessibility is so recent, we currently don’t have good understanding of what users get out of socialising in these spaces, or even a solid grasp of potential risks associated with them. With rapidly increasing uptake, especially in a time of mass isolation, that’s a pretty big blind spot.</p>



<p>However, work by soon-to-be PhD graduate <a href="https://www.divinemaloney.com/">Divine Maloney</a> at Clemson University is beginning to fill this gap. His PhD research has focused primarily on understanding VR social spaces and designing safe, equitable, and fulfilling VR spaces for young users.</p>



<span id="more-44755"></span>



<p>In a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459990.3460703">recent paper</a>, presented at this year’s Interaction Design and Children conference, Maloney explored what attracts teenagers to socialising in VR. Conducting in-depth interviews with 20 teens from North America, Europe, and Africa, his research was able to zero in on some key themes motivating continued engagement with this technology.</p>



<p>For these teens, VR spaces served as both a social hub and a place they could creatively express themselves. The time spent engaging in various available VR activities — such as games, or designing new objects and spaces — varied widely between participants, but throughout their responses, participants consistently placed emphasis on the value of interacting with other players in an immersive environment. “You can go into a random room, a random place, say hey to someone and they will generally talk to you,” says Maloney. “If not, that’s okay, you move on and talk to the next person. It’s very normal, as opposed to [many] places in the offline world. When you go into [social VR spaces] the consensus is that you’re going there for a social experience.”</p>



<p>Particularly during isolation brought on by the pandemic, VR offered a more natural and familiar way for these younger users to interact with those outside of their home than your average zoom call. “When COVID-19 shut down schools, I didn’t have very many people to talk to or hang out with,” one participant shared. “I used social VR as a substitute for that. I would find people around my age and just simply talk to them.”</p>



<p>VR social spaces are more than just a new and improved Zoom call, though. They provide tools for creativity and self-expression that can’t be replicated in reality. For example, users can craft entire mini-game experiences, in-game objects, or even create new worlds. This is where socialising and self-expression in VR begins to diverge more heavily from social spaces we’re familiar with. One of Maloney’s papers from 2021 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432938">explored this in more depth</a>, focusing on the role of avatars.</p>



<p>In VR spaces such as <em>RecRoom</em>, fully customisable avatars are an important component of the social experience, and can act as the social lubricant that starts conversations. Embodying your favourite game series’ main character, for example, is likely to attract other fans. Even non-human avatars such as Kermit the Frog might indicate something as intangible as sense of humour, and attract other users to chat based on that alone. Players can change between presentations at will, either for fun, to convey their true selves, or even to conceal things about themselves.</p>



<p>Participants in Maloney’s studies described the many ways in which donning an entirely manufactured digital body can also act as a mask, helping users to circumnavigate adversity they face, yet find difficult to escape, in day-to-day life. In one of his studies, women and girls shared how the right avatar could allow them to socialise without typical levels of harassment they would otherwise encounter. As one participant reported, “Girls are more valued than guys because there are way more guys than girls in social VR or in the game world. So if I’m a male walking around, no one pays attention to me. But if I was like a girl, people would probably try to interact with me more.&#8221;</p>



<p>The story is similar for players of ethnic minorities, with participants able to use avatars to shield against racial abuse by muting their microphones and communicating non-verbally, while visually presenting an avatar that may not attract racial abuse. This can also go in the other direction, and allow users to embrace their ethnicity in spite of potential harassment; some users even take the opportunity to experiment with Whiteness, which one participant reported as a self-affirming experience: “I was always aware of me being minority at some level. I’ve always wondered, ’what would it be like to be a majority?’ So I have used white avatars in social VR. That did not end well. But surprisingly, that experience actually made me more confident and had a better understanding of who I was. I am Asian American and I don’t need to be white.”</p>



<p>Transgender and non-binary participants also commented on the way VR allowed them to more safely explore new bodies and gender expressions. One trans woman shared that in the real world “I tend to curb my personality and express a lot more in line with what I feel like is socially acceptable and normal. When I’m in social VR, I feel more comfortable just being how I feel at full blast.” More than being social lubricant alone, complete control over avatar presentation gives users that wish to try out a different gender performance a relatively safe space to do so, see how they feel, and gauge how others react to them in an environment that — unlike the real world — has zero risk of physical harm (although, these participants also pointed out that harassment is still very much a risk).</p>



<p>VR social spaces are still somewhat in that wild-west era most of us remember from the earlier days of the internet. As such, many parents have safety concerns about what their teens may be exposed to in these virtual worlds composed of both their peers and those from generations above them. These concerns aren’t without basis — there are many reported instances of adults making advances on younger users, and the nature of current moderating tools for VR spaces make harassment of all kinds difficult to police.</p>



<p>While it’s important to protect young users from online dangers, Maloney says that when speaking with participants about dealing with difficult interactions in VR, “every single one, one-hundred percent, said that social VR helps them be more socially adept and socially confident. And that’s great for a young person’s development.” While part of his work centres around making these spaces safer, paradoxically, it seems that in a space where physical harm is impossible, users can more safely practice their responses to both difficult people and harassment. This may present interesting research avenues for those primarily drawn to developmental topics.</p>



<p>Research about socialising in VR, like the technology itself, is still very young. While Maloney’s research highlights many of the intricacies, and indeed positive aspects, of these spaces, future research will also need to better assess the negative impacts of VR. For example, Maloney’s research found that (during the pandemic) teens in his sample were spending as much as 22 hours per week in VR during term time, and around 60 hours per week during the summer. Though <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">recent research</a> into traditional video games suggest little impact on wellbeing from long sessions of gaming, the fully immersive, fully embodied nature of VR may pose its own issues that are as of yet unidentified. Indeed, some participants mentioned concerns that long play times in VR might take time away from real-life interactions and skill building that can’t be replicated virtually. The complexity of this space demands much more high-quality qualitative research in order to properly understand the draw, the positives, and the negatives of socialising in VR.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marijuana-skunk-smell-cannabis-pot-plant-chemistry">Here’s the chemistry behind marijuana’s skunky scent</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have finally sniffed out the molecules behind marijuana’s skunky aroma.</p>



<p>The heady bouquet that wafts off of fresh weed is actually a cocktail of hundreds of fragrant compounds. The most prominent floral, citrusy and piney overtones come from a common class of molecules called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roses-scent-genetics-fragrance">terpenes</a>, says analytical chemist Iain Oswald of Abstrax Tech, a private company in Tustin, Calif., that develops terpenes for cannabis products (<em>SN: 4/30/18</em>). But the source of that funky ganja note has been hard to pin down.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis is the first to identify a group of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.1c04196">sulfur compounds in cannabis that account for the skunklike scent</a>, researchers report November 12 in <em>ACS Omega</em>.</p>



<p>Oswald and colleagues had a hunch that the culprit may contain sulfur, a stinky element found in hops and skunk spray. So the team started by rating the skunk factor of flowers harvested from more than a dozen varieties of <em>Cannabis sativa </em>on a scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the most pungent. Next, the team created a “chemical fingerprint” of the airborne components that contributed to each cultivar’s unique scent using gas chromatography, mass spectroscopy and a sulfur chemiluminescence detector. &nbsp;</p>





<p>As suspected, the researchers found small amounts of several fragrant sulfur compounds lurking in the olfactory profiles of the smelliest cultivars. The most dominant was a molecule called prenylthiol, or 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skunk-walks-bar">gives “skunked beer” its notorious flavor</a> (<em>SN: 11/27/05</em>).</p>



<p>The sulfur compounds have been found in nature, but never before in cannabis, says Amber Wise, an analytical chemist with Medicine Creek Analytics in Fife, Wash., who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Oswald was surprised to find that prenylthiol and many of the other sulfurous suspects in cannabis share structural similarities with molecules found in garlic. And like these alliaceous analogs, a little goes a long way.</p>



<p>These compounds “can be in very low concentrations on the flower, but still make a huge impact on the smell,” Oswald says. The sulfur molecules are most abundant in cannabis flowers when they reach maturity and during the curing process.</p>



<p>Smell psychologist Avery Gilbert of Headspace Sensory, a startup company in Fort Collins, Colo., that specializes in quantifying the many scents of cannabis, is excited to see the molecules added to marijuana’s chemical repertoire. “The spectrum of cannabis odor is just amazing,” he says. “I think it beats the pants off of wine.”</p>



<p>The discovery of prenylthiol in marijuana, Gilbert says, is the first step to masking its nuisance odor — or maximizing its perversely pleasant stink.</p>



<p>Prenylthiol has a “polarizing scent,” Oswald says. While many people think it reeks, some cannabis users will pay top dollar for skunky grass, which some consider an indicator of quality.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/notes-on-consciousness-ix-why-integrated-information-theory-fails/">Notes on consciousness. (IX) Why Integrated Information Theory fails</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory">Integrated Information Theory</a> (IIT) is a theory of consciousness that assigns a certain degree of consciousness (called Phi) to any system. Philosophically, it is a kind of property dualism: mental states are not reduced to states of matter, but assigned to arrangements of matter that have certain formal properties.</p>
<p>One of the most criticized aspects of the theory is that it embraces panpsychism: for example, it assigns consciousness to elementary systems such as a photodiode. However, the objection is easy to bypass: a theory does not have to produce intuitive claims. It is certainly not intuitive that the passing of time depends on how fast you move, yet it seems to be true.</p>
<p>But in the case of relativity, the counter-intuitive prediction can be tested empirically (and it has been). In the case of IIT, it cannot: there is no independent way to assess whether a photodiode is conscious. This is the fundamental epistemological issue with trying to explain a subjective phenomenon: there is no other way to directly establish the reality of the phenomenon than to experience it yourself. You will never have first-hand evidence that your stomach is another conscious entity in your body.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways to assess a theory, for example to exhibit incoherencies, contradictions or logical fallacies.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I want to point out that property dualism is much closer to materialism than to religious kinds of dualism. In IIT, mental states are really properties of matter, just not physical properties. This means that mental states depend only on the arrangement of matter: the physical system is not just a host for the mind, as in Cartesian dualism. In Buddhism, the mind can reincarnate in another body, and bring memories with it. This is impossible with property dualism, because mental states are an intrinsic property of the system.</p>
<p>It is precisely this point that is inconsistent with the formulation of IIT. The central concept that I will discuss is information. IIT builds on the classical notion of information as differentiation: if a state can take values A or B, then observing A is informative, because it could have been B. If we assign equal probabilities to the two alternatives, then observing the state brings exactly 1 bit of information. Information is the reduction of uncertainty. This is why a binary photodiode exposed to a visual scene can get no more than 1 bit of information, while you would get much more information from the same scene: it could have been so many different other scenes.</p>
<p>At first sight, this seems like a reasonable characterization of information, so that IIT considers it as a self-evident axiom. However, there is a big problem here, one that will lead to major inconsistencies. State A is informative because it excludes possibility B. But this assumes that the entity that gets informed is aware that B was a possibility. How could that be possible if it has never encountered B before, and has no cognitive resources to imagine that B could exist? The reduction in uncertainty is relative to prior knowledge, but what is the prior knowledge of a photodiode?</p>
<p>The confusion, of course, is that the reduction of uncertainty occurs for the observer who formalized the range of possibilities, but it is ascribed to the system itself. There is some magic operating here, where we ascribe information and uncertainty to a physical system, without ever defining what it means for a physical system to have knowledge.</p>
<p>Let us be more concrete. Suppose the photodiode starts its life covered by a box, but then the experimenter removes the box and puts it back from times to times. In terms of information, the state of the photodiode will hold some information about light, or if it consists of a sensor and a detector, about its previous state. According to IIT, this will make the photodiode minimally conscious (in the last version of IIT, the photodiode must have some recurrent connectivity, e.g. reciprocal connection between a sensor and a detector, but this makes no difference to the present discussion).</p>
<p>But consider the very beginning of the photodiode’s life. It has always been in the dark, never exposed to light. In terms of information, the state is still informative because it excludes the possibility of light, but what does that mean for the photodiode that has never seen the light?</p>
<p>Now consider another photodiode. It is physically exactly the same photodiode, but this time the box permanently covers it. Thus, there is only one possible state for that photodiode. According to IIT, this photodiode is not conscious. Yet, it is physically identical to the photodiode at the beginning of the previous scenario.</p>
<p>Thus, we have exhibited two situations where the same physical system in the exact same state is assigned two different states of consciousness. This contradicts the claim that consciousness is an intrinsic property of the system.</p>
<p>The problem arises from the fact that consciousness is defined not from what happens presently with the system, but from what <em>could</em> happen, and it is very unclear what “could” might mean. “Could” the box collapse and expose the photodiode to light? Would that make the photodiode conscious? From that event? Or from the start of the photodiode’s life? Or from the moment when that event “could” happen? What does it mean exactly that an event that does not happen “could” have happened? (if what?)</p>
<p>Let us now turn to brains. According to <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory">Tononi</a>, “IIT predicts that a particular brain area can contribute to experience even if it is inactive, but not if it is inactivated.” Specifically, he contrasts the case of a person seeing a gray picture with the case where a colored picture is presented but color-sensitive neurons are lesioned. In the first case, the person perceives the picture as gray. In the second case, there is no experience of color at all. The difference in experience occurs because in the first case, the color-sensitive neurons <em>could have</em> been in a different state, but not in the second case.</p>
<p>“Could have” is very problematic here, because it does not refer to the present state of the system, but to hypothetical states.</p>
<p>Suppose the color area of the brain is not lesioned but reversibly inactivated by cooling, for a random duration. In this case, the person should be color conscious, because at any time, the neurons <em>could have</em> been in a different state.</p>
<p>An important precision in these thought experiments: the subject does not know what the experimenter is doing. Thus, from the viewpoint of the subject, all that happens is the neurons are inactive, and the cause of this inactivity leaves no trace in the subject. Yet, according to IIT, mental states depend on that cause. If it is a gray picture: color-conscious. Lesioning: color-unconscious. Reversible cooling: conscious. Irreversible cooling with a refrigerating device permanently implanted in the brain: unconscious. The fridge breaks down: conscious. The fridge <em>might</em> break down, but actually doesn’t: conscious from the time of cooling.</p>
<p>In summary, IIT fails to consistently assign consciousness to a system, because the definition is based on hypotheticals, which by definition are not instantiated by the system. Deep down, the troubles arise from the circularity of the definition of information as reduction of uncertainty. Uncertainty refers to a prior state of knowledge, but the notion of knowledge for the subject is never defined. In practice, the knowledge underlying the reduction of uncertainty is the knowledge of the observer who formalizes scenarios and quantifies probabilities of events that the system itself has never lived.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungi-carbon-storage-soil-earth-warm-climate">Fungi may be crucial to storing carbon in soil as the Earth warms</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to storing carbon in the ground, fungi may be key.</p>



<p>Soils are a massive reservoir of carbon, holding about three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere. The secret behind this carbon storage are microbes, such as bacteria and some fungi, which transform dead and decaying matter into carbon-rich soil.</p>



<p>But not all carbon compounds made by soil microbes are equal. Some can last for decades or even centuries in the soil, while others are quickly consumed by microbes and converted into carbon dioxide that’s lost to the atmosphere. Now, a study shows that fungi-rich soils grown in laboratory experiments <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43705-021-00071-7">released less carbon dioxide when heated than other soils</a>.</p>



<p>The result suggests that fungi are essential for making soil that sequesters carbon in the earth, microecologist Luiz Domeignoz-Horta and colleagues report November 6 in <em>ISME Communications</em>.</p>





<p>Who is making soil matters, Domeignoz-Horta says.</p>



<p>The study comes as some scientists warn that climate change threatens to release more carbon out of the ground and into the atmosphere, further worsening global warming. Researchers have found that rising temperatures can lead to population booms in soil microbes, which quickly exhaust easily digestible carbon compounds. This forces the organisms to turn to older, more resilient carbon stores, converting carbon stored away long ago into carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>With the combined threat of rising temperatures and damage to soil microbe communities from intensive farming and disappearing forests, some computer models indicate that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/natural-ally-against-global-warming-not-strong-thought">40 percent less carbon will stick in the soil by 2100</a> than previous simulations have anticipated (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/22/16</em>).</p>





<p>To see if scientists can coax soils to store more carbon, researchers need to understand what makes soil microbes tick. But that is no simple task. “Some say soil is the most complex matrix on the planet,” says Kirsten Hofmockel, an ecologist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>To simplify matters, Domeignoz-Horta, of the University of Zurich, and colleagues grew their own dirt in the lab. The researchers separated fungi and bacteria from forest soil and grew five combinations of these communities in petri dishes, including some that were home only to bacteria or fungi. The researchers sustained the microbes on a diet of simple sugar and left them to churn out soil for four months. The team then heated the different soils to see how much carbon dioxide was produced.</p>



<p>Bacteria were the main drivers behind making soil, but fungi-rich soils produced less carbon dioxide when heated than soils made solely by bacteria, the researchers found. Why is still unclear. One possibility is that fungi could be producing enzymes — proteins that build or break up other molecules — that bacteria aren’t capable of making on their own, Domeignoz-Horta says. These fungi-derived compounds may provide bacteria with different building blocks with which to build soil, which may end up creating carbon compounds with a longer shelf life in soils.</p>



<p>What happens in lab-grown soil may not play out the same in the real world. But the new research is an important step in understanding how carbon is locked away long-term, Hofmockel says. This kind of information could one day help researchers develop techniques to ensure that more carbon stays in the ground for longer, which could help mitigate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“If we can get carbon in the ground for five years, that’s a step in the right direction,” Hofmockel says. “But if we can have stable carbon in the soil for centuries or even millennia, that’s a solution.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541672420">Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid</a><em><br>Thor Hanson<br>Basic Books, $28</em></p>



<p>As a conservation biologist, Thor Hanson has seen firsthand the effects of climate change on plants and animals in the wild: the green macaws of Central America migrating along with their food sources, the brown bears of Alaska fattening up on early-ripening berry crops, the conifers of New England seeking refuge from vanishing habitats. And as an engaging author who has celebrated the wonders of nature in books about feathers, seeds, forests and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-humans-and-big-macs-depend-bees">bees</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/18, p. 28</em>), he’s an ideal guide to a topic that might otherwise send readers down a well of despair.</p>



<p>Hanson does not despair in his latest book, <em>Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid</em>. Though he outlines the many ways that global warming is changing life on our planet, his tone is not one of hand-wringing. Instead, Hanson invites the reader into the stories of particular people, places and creatures of all sorts. He draws these tales from his own experiences and those of other scientists, combining reporting with narrative tales of species that serve as examples of broader trends in the natural world.</p>





<p>A trip to La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, for example, has Hanson reliving the experience of tropical ecologist and climatologist Leslie Holdridge, who founded the research station in the 1950s and described, among other things, how climate creates different habitats, or life zones, as elevation increases. As Hanson sweats his way up a tropical mountainside so he can witness a shift in life zones, he notes, “I had to earn every foot of elevation gain the hard way.” I could almost feel the heat that he describes as “a steaming towel draped over my head.” His vivid descriptions bring home the reason why so many species have now been documented moving upslope to cooler climes.</p>



<p>Hanson doesn’t waste much breath trying to convince doubters of the reality of climate change, instead showing by example after example how it is already playing out. The book moves quickly from the basic science of climate change to the challenges and opportunities that species face — from shifts in seasonal timing to ocean acidification — and the ways that species are responding.</p>



<p>As Hanson notes, the acronym MAD, for “move, adapt or die,” is often used to describe species’ options for responding. But that pithy phrase doesn’t capture the complexity of the situation. For instance, one of his titular characters, a lizard slammed by back-to-back Caribbean hurricanes in 2017, illustrates a different response. Instead of individual lizards adjusting, or adapting, to increasingly stormy conditions, the species evolved through natural selection. Biologists monitoring the lizards on two islands noticed that after the hurricanes, the lizard populations had longer front legs, shorter back legs and grippier toe pads on average than they had before. An experiment with a leaf blower showed that these traits help the lizards cling to branches better — survival of the fittest in action.</p>



<p>In the end, the outcomes for species will probably be as varied as their circumstances. Some organisms have already moved, adapted or died as a result of the warming, and many more will face challenges from changes that are yet to come. But Hanson hasn’t given up hope. When it comes to preventing the worst-case scenarios, he quotes ecologist Gordon Orians, who is in the seventh decade of a career witnessing environmental change. When asked what a concerned citizen should do to combat climate change, he responded succinctly: “Everything you can.” And as Hanson points out, this is exactly how plants and animals are responding to climate change: by doing everything they can. The challenge feels overwhelming, and as a single concerned citizen, much feels out of my hands. Yet Hanson’s words did inspire me to take a cue from the rest of the species on this warming world to do what I can.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates&#8230; if you’re looking for motivation or personal inspiration, it’s likely that you’ll see quotes from rich, prominent people. At the same time, there seems to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/20/new-wealth-tax-uk-arguments">growing</a> <a href="https://www.wealthandpolicy.com/wp/EP2_PublicAttitudes.pdf">discontent</a> with the levels of inequality in the world — a discontent seemingly at odds with the worship of wealthy people we see in the media and online.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2100430118">new study</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, explores this disconnect. It finds that even as we see the wealth of billionaires as a <em>group</em> as unfair, we remain tolerant of the achievements and wealth of individuals. And this also has an impact on the policies and positions people are willing to support.</p>



<span id="more-44745"></span>



<p>An initial study explored how much executives should make, with participants reading either about the recent increase in the salaries of CEOs from the largest companies in America, or about the increase of one specific CEO. Those who read about individual CEOs thought their salaries should be significantly higher than those who read about CEOs as a group. A second study replicated these findings in the context of sport, where high-financed individual players were seen as having less of an unfair advantage over low-financed players than high-financed <em>teams</em> over low-financed teams.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants read two passages, one about a conglomerate and one about an individual. In both pieces of writing, the conglomerate or individual were in a competition to win a government contract; because of their wealth, they were able to spend more than their rivals for the contract, which they eventually won. Again, participants felt that the competition between individuals was more fair, both in terms of outcome and in terms of the resource distribution between competitors.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants were told either the average wealth of the 25 wealthiest people in America or about the wealth accrued by one of the wealthiest individuals. No information was given about their identity or the way they became rich. Participants then wrote about why they thought the individual or group had become rich, the factors they felt were responsible, and how fair they thought it was. Finally, they rated their support for a wealth tax.</p>



<p>Participants who read about individuals had a stronger belief that wealth was down to personal characteristics, and also believed it had been obtained more fairly than those who read about the group. Those who read about the group were also marginally more in favour of a wealth tax, suggesting again that we feel more sympathetic towards rich individuals than groups.</p>



<p>The final study looked at the impact of the media. Half of the participants saw a cover from Forbes magazine highlighting seven of the wealthiest people in the world. The other half of participants saw a cover with just one of the seven billionaires.</p>



<p>After viewing the cover, participants were then asked to write about how they felt about the person or people depicted, how much they thought they deserved their wealth, how fair it was, and how much their success was due to talents and abilities versus an unequal and unfair economic system. Finally, participants rated how much they supported an inheritance tax to close the inequality gap.</p>



<p>Those in the individual condition wrote less angry responses about how they felt than those in the group condition, and were more likely to chalk success up to talent than any unfair advantage. Those who saw the group of billionaires were also more likely to back an inheritance tax than those who saw individuals.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first study to find a difference in attitudes between individuals and groups — other <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/11/were-more-likely-to-steal-from-large-groups-than-from-individuals/">research</a> published this year found that we’re also more likely to steal from large groups than we are from individuals, while <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/14/people-love-winning-streaks-by-individuals-more-than-those-by-teams/">another study</a> found that we prefer individual to team winning streaks. So why is this the case? The team suggests that we are better able to stereotype groups — so when confronted with a particular individual, the traits of theirs that don’t align with these stereotypes lead us to see them as less prototypical of the group and thus more sympathetic. And if we think negatively about “the 1%”, the individuals we bring to mind will be especially negative, making those less egregious individuals seem better in comparison.</p>



<p>&#8220;How we express and communicate information about inequality is important,” <a href="https://news.osu.edu/people-love-the-billionaire-but-hate-the-billionaires-club/">said</a> co-author Jesse Walker. “Talking about ‘the 1%’ is going to get a different reaction than personalizing it by talking about one person in that exclusive club.&#8221; Rethinking how we talk about inequality, showing the negative impact of individual as well as collective wealth, may help shift attitudes.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2100430118">People are more tolerant of inequality when it is expressed in terms of individuals rather than groups at the top</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coral-reef-microplastics-skeletons">Corals may store a surprising amount of microplastics in their skeletons</a></h4>

              
                <p>A surprising amount of plastic pollution in the ocean may wind up in a previously overlooked spot: the skeletons of living corals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up to about 20,000 metric tons of tiny fragments called microplastics may be stored in coral skeletons worldwide every year, says ecologist Jessica Reichert of Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany. That corresponds to nearly 3 percent of the microplastics estimated to be in the shallow, tropical waters where corals thrive.</p>



<p>Corals <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/corals-dine-microplastics">have been observed eating</a> or otherwise <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.0726">incorporating</a> microplastics into their bodies (<em>SNS: 3/18/15</em>). But scientists don’t know how much of the debris reefs take up globally. So Reichert and colleagues exposed corals in the lab to microplastics to find out where the particles are stored inside corals and estimate how much is tucked away.</p>



<p>Corals consumed some of the trash, or grew their skeletons over particles. After 18 months, most of the debris inside corals was in their skeletons rather than tissues, the researchers report October 28 in <em>Global Change Biology</em>. After counting the number of trapped particles, the researchers estimate that between <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15920">nearly 6 billion and 7 quadrillion microplastic particles may be permanently stored in corals</a> worldwide annually.</p>

Reichert</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s the first time that a living microplastic “sink,” or long-term storage site, has been quantified, Reichert says.</p>



<p>Scientists are learning how much microplastic is being introduced to the oceans. But researchers don&#8217;t know <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">where it all ends up</a> (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>). Other known microplastic sinks, such as sea ice and seafloor sediments, need better quantification, and other sinks may not yet be known.</p>



<p>Reefs are typically found near coasts where polluted waterways can drain to the sea, placing corals in potential microplastic hot spots.</p>



<p>“We don’t know what consequences this [storage] might have for the coral organisms, [or for] reef stability and integrity,” Reichert says. It “might pose an additional threat to coral reefs worldwide.” &nbsp;</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Tyson Bottenus once captained an 80-foot schooner called the <em>Aquidneck</em>. He sailed tourists off the coast of Newport, R.I., discussing the area’s history and sites. In January 2018, he had finished another season at the schooner’s helm and had recently gotten engaged to his partner of many years, Liza Burkin. To celebrate, the couple, avid cyclists who’ve ridden through New Zealand and Japan, set off for a bike tour of Costa Rica.</p>



<p>“We were on this very, very dusty road for a long time,” Bottenus remembers of a ride to Montezuma on the Nicoya Peninsula. “It was a dirty, sandy, hard-packed road.” While going downhill, Bottenus crashed, badly scraping his elbow. The next morning, a doctor spent about an hour picking out little rocks and cleaning dirt from the wound before she bandaged it up. The injury kept him from swimming but otherwise didn’t disrupt the trip.</p>



<p>About a month after returning to Rhode Island, Bottenus started having headaches. He couldn’t control his mouth properly — his speech was off, and he was drooling. Eventually his doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed a lesion in his brain. “My first thought was, I must have some sort of cancer,” he says. “I’m only 31…. I’m way too young for this.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t cancer. Nor was it any of the infections proposed as doctors searched for a diagnosis. Two brain biopsies didn’t provide enough tissue to identify the problem.</p>



<p>In August 2018, Bottenus became very ill and was hospitalized. He couldn’t walk. His mouth muscles weren’t working. And he could no longer tie the drawstring of his pants with a square knot, a common knot sailors use to fasten two ropes together. It’s a knot Bottenus has taught others and could previously do with his eyes closed. “I’m a captain of boats, supposedly,” he remembers thinking. “I am not the person I think I am.”</p>



<p>Finally, a third brain biopsy, taking a slightly larger amount of tissue, yielded a diagnosis: Bottenus had a fungus growing in his brain. It was a black mold called <em>Cladophialophora bantiana </em>that can breach the blood-brain barrier. The best medical guess is that Bottenus was exposed in Costa Rica — probably from the dusty air he inhaled, or maybe from the debris-laden wound on his elbow.</p>



<p>People are exposed to fungi all the time, and usually we get along just fine. Fungi are in the air, in the soil and in us, part of the community of microbes that live in our bodies. Fungi that inhabit plant roots form crucial partnerships with more than 90 percent of land plant species, helping the plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil in exchange for food. But <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007964">some fungi are also infectious pathogens</a> that can cause pneumonia, blindness and meningitis.</p>

<h3>Emerging threats</h3>



<p>An estimated <a href="https://gaffi.org/why/">2 million people globally die from fungal diseases</a> each year. And pathogenic fungi tend to harm those with the least means. Fungal keratitis, an infection of the cornea, strikes more than a million people annually, estimates suggest, and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30448-5/fulltext">blinds around 600,000</a>. Found in tropical and subtropical areas, the disease — usually treatable when diagnosed early — often impacts young, poor agricultural workers. Another example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7440622/">chronic pulmonary aspergillosis</a>, is a lung infection that commonly occurs in people already burdened with lung damage from tuberculosis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30303-1/fulltext">Fungal infections are also a threat to people with HIV</a>, a virus that weakens the immune system. When defenses are down, typically benign fungi can take advantage of the gaps in our immunological armor and cause an infection. In resource-rich areas, fungal infections have decreased with earlier HIV diagnosis and the availability of antiretroviral drugs. But in places where people can’t get early, consistent HIV care, fungal infections have stubbornly persisted as dangerous complications of HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p>Advances in modern medicine that have extended lives have also led to more fungal infections. Organ transplantation and treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases have created a large population of people who regularly take drugs that inhibit components of the immune system, leaving these patients susceptible to fungal invaders.</p>



<p>Some fungi have emerged as recent threats to human health. First <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19161556/">reported in Japan in 2009 as the cause of an ear infection</a>, a yeast called <em>Candida auris </em>unexpectedly caused outbreaks of invasive infections — those that reach the blood, spinal fluid or other typically sterile areas of the body — on three continents a few years later. Hospital patients are especially at risk from the yeast, which is resistant to certain antifungal drugs.</p>



<p>Scientists have proposed that the emergence of <em>C. auris</em> as a danger to people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-could-raise-risk-deadly-fungal-infections-humans">may be tied to our warming climate</a>, with the yeast gaining temperature tolerance in the environment. That could explain why <em>C. auris</em> can replicate inside human bodies, a niche that’s usually too hot for many fungi.</p>



<p>The warming climate may make other fungal pathogens more widespread. <em>Coccidioides</em>, a fungus that shape-shifts from a soil-dwelling, fluffy mold to aerosolized spores to round, parasitic cells at the site of infection, causes a disease called valley fever. Someone who breathes in the spores might not have symptoms at all or could become fatigued, short of breath and develop a fever, cough and night sweats. It’s among the fungal pathogens that can strike healthy immune systems. In the United States in 2019, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/statistics.html">18,407 cases</a> were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p><em>Coccidioides</em> is primarily found in southwestern states, but global warming could change that. “The entire western United States has been identified as potential habitat,” says medical mycologist Bridget Marie Barker of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The fungi thrive in hot, dry environments where there are brief, heavy rains. Climate change is expected to make western states hotter and alter precipitation patterns. Research reported in <em>GeoHealth</em> in 2019 predicts that by 2100, the areas impacted by <em>Coccidioides</em> could expand north in the western half of the country and annual <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GH000209">cases could increase by 50 percent</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>One fungus’ spread&nbsp;</h4>



<p>By the end of the century, global warming could expand the habitat of the fungus that causes valley fever. These maps show the predicted increase in the incidence of the disease, which today is found mainly in the southwestern United States. Symptoms include fever, fatigue and cough.</p>

<h3>Treatment pitfalls</h3>



<p>Despite the heavy burden of fungal diseases and the potential for that burden to grow, there are no approved vaccines against fungi, and the medicine cabinet of fungal remedies is not deep. There are only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996373/">a few types of antifungal drugs</a>. It’s difficult to develop antifungals in part because fungi are eukaryotes. Like us, and unlike bacteria, their cells have distinct, membrane-bound compartments, including a nucleus that holds their genetic material. That shared biology means that if a drug can kill fungi, it might harm us too.</p>



<p>The antifungals that do exist “are not spectacular,” says pediatric infectious disease physician and medical mycologist Damian Krysan of the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City. Even with treatment, invasive fungal infections are difficult to survive. For example, an invasive infection with the mold <em>Aspergillus</em> has a mortality rate ranging from 40 to 90 percent in patients with weakened immune systems, depending on where the infection is, among other factors. For a cancer patient with a great prognosis who develops an <em>Aspergillus</em> infection, Krysan says, “you can be cured of your cancer and die of your fungal infection.”</p>



<p>Even diagnosing a fungal infection is challenging. For one, there are fewer diagnostic tests specific to fungi than there are for viruses and bacteria. Another problem is that the symptoms of a fungal infection can resemble those caused by other pathogens. And fungi grow slowly, so it takes longer to confirm that a blood or tissue sample is infected with a fungus. A delayed diagnosis can mean delayed treatment, which complicates the chances of recovery.</p>



<p>Into this uncertain medical terrain landed Bottenus, a previously healthy young man who acquired an exceedingly rare fungal infection in his brain.</p>

<h3>Uncharted waters</h3>



<p>Bottenus has been treated with antifungal drugs and steroids. It’s been a “vicious cycle,” says Robbie Goldstein, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who has been part of Bottenus’ team of doctors. The steroids reduce the inflammation from the infection, which puts dangerous pressure on Bottenus’ brain. But the steroids also suppress his immune system, impairing his ability to clear the fungus. When doctors have tried to taper the steroids, the inflammation in Bottenus’ brain has gotten worse.</p>



<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic began, Bottenus became nervous that being immunocompromised put him at greater risk of getting sick from the coronavirus. So he stopped taking the steroids. The resulting inflammation triggered a stroke at the end of March 2020. In the several weeks he spent in the hospital, pandemic restrictions prevented Burkin from visiting.</p>



<p>Bottenus is still coping with the effects of the brain infection and the stroke. He has lost most of his peripheral vision. His speech is altered. Navigation is a struggle — he has a hard time finding his way around, even in his home. Bottenus kept telling himself that he’d wake up one day and be back to where he used to be. “But of course that’s a fantasy,” he says.</p>



<p>Yet other brain functions don’t seem to have been harmed. Bottenus began graduate school in the fall of 2020 and has done well in his classes. “He can’t really bike across our neighborhood by himself,” Burkin says, “but he can write a 20-page research paper.”</p>



<p>The whole experience has changed Bottenus’ personality, Burkin says. Her adventurous partner has become reliant on structure and routine. “I think that’s really normal for people who’ve gone through a life-threatening disease, where you have no control,” she says. Bottenus says, living “is as much adventure as I can get.”</p>



<p>In the published cases of <em>C. bantiana</em> infections, the death rate can be as high as 70 percent. Many times, the infection isn’t diagnosed until a patient’s autopsy, Goldstein says. For those who live with this infection, he says, the studies “don’t say what that life is like.” Bottenus and Burkin are crossing uncharted medical territory.</p>



<p>For now, Bottenus is a passenger on friends’ boats. When he bikes, he follows Burkin, or they ride a tandem. He makes sure to have his cell phone when he goes out, in case he gets lost. “He used to literally be able to do celestial navigation and lead us on bike tours across continents,” Burkin says. “I don’t know that it is permanent, these changes. I don’t think there’s any way to know.”</p>

<p>But “I can’t blame this fungus,” she says. “We were out on a bike ride and some dirt got into his body.”</p>



<p>Sometimes a doctor meets a patient after they’ve already been seriously harmed by an infection, Goldstein says. But he got to know Bottenus from the beginning, when the young sailor was searching for a diagnosis. Goldstein says this experience has made him really aware, when he’s talking to a patient, of how devastating an infection can be to the life they had before.</p>



<p>“Before there was an infection,” he says, “there was a person.”</p>

<h4>Worth the wait</h4>



<p><em>The James Webb Space Telescope, which has been in development for more than 30&nbsp;years, will soon launch and explore new cosmic questions that have cropped up since the telescope was first conceived, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">The origami satellite</a>” (</em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26<em>).</em></p>



<p>Once operational, the James Webb Space Telescope will survey planets orbiting small, cool stars called M&nbsp;dwarfs, <strong>Grossman</strong> reported. Reader <strong>Bert Latamore </strong>asked why the telescope will focus on those planets instead of ones orbiting stars similar to our sun.</p>





<p>Planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs are easier to discover and observe, <strong>Grossman</strong> says. Since M&nbsp;dwarfs are smaller and cooler than sunlike stars, planets in their habitable zones cross in front of, or transit, the stars more frequently. When a planet does transit such a star, more starlight can filter through the planet’s atmosphere (if it has one), allowing astronomers to measure the atmosphere’s composition, she says.</p>



<p>Surveying M dwarf systems is only a first step, <strong>Grossman </strong>says. “Ultimately, scientists would like to look at rocky planets orbiting stars similar to our sun. Using Webb to study M dwarfs’ planets will help scientists learn how to make important observations, and what to look for when we can study the really exciting worlds,” she says.</p>



<p><strong>Grossman</strong> reported that Webb’s home in space will be a gravitationally fixed point called L2 that is about 1.5&nbsp;million kilometers from Earth, beyond the reach of scientists if something were to go awry. Reader <strong>Bruce Joffe </strong>wondered how Webb will be able to orbit around this point since there is no massive celestial body nearby to keep the telescope in place.</p>



<p>Objects that orbit L2 are nearly — though not completely — stable, says astronomer <strong>Scott Friedman</strong> of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who is in charge of Webb’s postlaunch choreography. Webb and other satellites that orbit L2 need propulsion to maintain their positions. “For Webb, we will execute what we call station-keeping maneuvers every 21&nbsp;days,” <strong>Friedman </strong>says. The telescope’s thrusters will fire to correct its position and maintain its L2 orbit.</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Malcolm K. Cleaveland </strong>wondered why it would be impossible for scientists to service Webb if something were to go wrong, given our increasing space capabilities — including a proposed lunar base.</p>



<p>“L2 is about four times farther from Earth than the moon is, even at the moon’s farthest distance,” <strong>Grossman </strong>says. “Even if we have a lunar base someday, and I’m not convinced that we will during Webb’s limited operational lifetime, it would still be a small step toward L2.”</p>

<h4>Holy cow!</h4>



<p>Researchers trained cows to pee in a stall (shown below). Such “MooLoo training” on a large scale could help reduce pollution, <strong>Maria Temming </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-cattle-pee-potty-training-bathroom-pollution-ammonia">Cows use stalls when nature calls</a>” (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 24</em>). Twitter user <strong>@Natas4President </strong>was amused by the story, writing: “MooLoo trainer on your resume looks fabulous from the University of Mootivation.”</p>

<h4>Cosmic cravings</h4>



<p><em>Astronomers may have pieced together the first firm evidence of a theorized type of supernova, in which a star gulps down a compact object — such as a black hole or neutron star — and the object engulfs the star’s core, causing the star to explode,<strong> Adam Mann</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">Double cannibalism sparks explosion</a>” (</em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6<em>).</em></p>



<p>The purported black hole or neutron star in this binary s<sup>­</sup>ystem was the remnant of a star’s supernova death,<strong> Mann </strong>reported. Reader <strong>Richard Freeman</strong> wondered how the living star in the binary survived its companion’s explosive demise.</p>



<p>Though it might seem strange for anything to survive so close to a massive stellar explosion, it does happen, <strong>Mann</strong> says. “The majority of stars are born in double or even triple systems, and the evolution of each partner star affects its companions,” he says.</p>



<p>“But stars are also pretty tough entities, and it’s rather hard to blast them to smithereens from the outside,” <strong>Mann</strong> says. This is because a star is made of an extremely dense core, surrounded by loosely held plasma and hot gas. A supernova may temporarily deform a nearby companion star’s gaseous outer shell, but its core is not as easily shaken.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rethinking-psychedelics-and-mental-health">Rethinking psychedelics and mental health</a></h4>

              
                <p>The psychedelic drug LSD has had a long, flamboyant history, including its promotion by former Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary in the 1960s. He envisioned LSD as a way to “become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness” and embrace personal and cultural change.</p>



<p>Leary later lamented that his call to “turn on, tune in, drop out” was too often misinterpreted as “get stoned and abandon all constructive activity,” rather than as an aid to transformative change. If Leary were alive today, I’m sure he’d be fascinated by the groundswell of interest in testing psychedelics as a treatment for mental health problems such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>



<p>In this issue, neuroscience senior writer Laura Sanders explores the growing evidence that mind-altering drugs — including LSD, MDMA and psilocybin — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelic-drugs-treatment-mental-health-disorders-depression">can bring people relief when combined with psychotherapy in a research setting</a>. Recently, recreational use of psychedelic drugs has also increased, with some local governments decriminalizing their use.</p>



<p>But at this point, it’s unclear if the latest resurgence of scientific interest in psychedelics will bring with it the healing and growth that Leary envisioned, or end up as just more experiments that fail to live up to their promise. So many questions have yet to be answered, including how the chemicals work in our brains, who is most likely to be helped and whether treatments can be delivered safely and cost-effectively.</p>





<p>To help answer these questions, Sanders turns not just to scientists but also to members of Indigenous communities that have been using psychedelics in healing for centuries, typically in spiritual and ceremonial contexts. Her sources note that Indigenous communities have much more holistic approaches to the use of psychedelics than medical researchers do.</p>



<p>“These sacred plant medicines have been a huge part of their culture and lives for a very long time,” Sanders told me. “Their perspective is missing from a lot of these single studies, and the way people talk about these drugs [as] being ‘rediscovered.’ It’s one of those things that looks different, depending on where you’re standing.”</p>



<p>Psychedelics still carry considerable cultural baggage from the ’60s, when their role in the counterculture and political protests helped convince the U.S. government to classify them as illegal substances. That makes it difficult for researchers to run clinical trials and may dissuade potential patients.</p>



<p>To find out what it’s like to use psychedelics as medication, Sanders interviewed Kanu Caplash, 22, who participated in a clinical trial testing MDMA as a treatment for PTSD. “He spent several hours talking with me about his experience,” Sanders said. “He was so beautifully eloquent; I’m really grateful to him for being willing to talk with us about it.” The treatments helped, Caplash says. He no longer thinks of suicide, and feels more at peace with himself.</p>



<p>Who else might get relief from psychedelic therapies is still unclear, but what’s indisputable is that current treatments for mental illnesses fall short for many people who need help. Broadening the search for better ways may bring us unexpected insights.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, states have enacted a variety of restrictive abortion policies at a rapidly increasing rate. Since 2011, nearly 500 abortion restrictions have been enacted in states around the U. S, increasing the hostility of state environments towards abortion access. According to the Guttmacher Institute, over half of states are hostile to abortion rights, and 58% of women aged 15–44 reside in states considered hostile or very hostile to abortion services, meaning states had four or five (hostile), or six (very hostile) restrictive abortion policies in place. Using a state-level abortion restrictiveness index comprised of 18 restrictive abortion policies, the authors conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining whether race/ethnicity and education level moderated the relationship between the restrictiveness index and individual-level probabilities of preterm birth (PTB) and low birthweight (LBW). Findings demonstrate that Black individuals at all educational levels and those with fewer years of education disproportionately experienced adverse birth outcomes associated with restrictive abortion policies. Restrictive abortion policies may compound existing racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and intersecting racial/ethnic and socioeconomic perinatal and infant health inequities.</p>

<p>Dental caries in adolescents remains a significant public health problem with few oral health promotion interventions aimed at reducing dental caries in secondary school-aged students. Previous oral health and mobile health (mHealth) research has suggested the need for the development of a school-based behaviour change intervention incorporating a digital component. This study aimed to describe the development process of a behaviour change intervention to improve the oral health of students aged 11–16 years attending secondary schools in the UK. A six-step process was used to develop the complex intervention informed by behaviour change theory and involving students, young people, parents and teachers in the process. Here an intervention to improve the oral health of secondary school students through improved tooth brushing was developed based on behaviour change theory and work with young people, parents and school staff.</p>

<p>Excess consumption of alcohol and energy-dense foods are two significant preventable causes of a range of non-communicable diseases globally, including heart disease and many cancers. Interventions that involve changing cues in the immediate physical environments that influence consumption could contribute to reducing excess food and alcohol consumption altering the size of tableware, plates, glasses, packaging and bottles. There is considerable uncertainty, however, around the potential effects of different sizes and shapes of tableware on how much food and alcohol people self-serve. These studies aimed to estimate the impact of: 1. Plate size and shape on amount of food self-served; and 2. Wine glass and bottle size on amount of wine self-poured. The authors found that smaller tableware (i.e. plates and wine glasses) decreased the amount of food and wine self-served in an initial serving. Studies are therefore warranted that assess initial as well as subsequent servings, and consumption behaviour—including detailed meal microstructure behaviours.</p>

<p>Over 45 jurisdictions globally have implemented sweetened beverage taxes. Researchers and policymakers need to assess whether and how these taxes change beverage demand and supply, their intended and unanticipated health, economic and equity impacts. Lessons from such evaluations can maximise the policies’ success and impact on non-communicable disease prevention globally. There is ample evidence showing that consumption of sweetened beverages is strongly and positively associated with the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, as well as all-cause mortality. In this article, rather than provide a review of the findings of existing evaluations, the authors ask: what are the lessons we can learn from sweetened beverage tax evaluations?</p>

<p>Following periods of acute ill-health and injury, older people are frequently assessed and provided with rehabilitation services. Healthcare practitioners are required to make nuanced decisions about which patients are likely to benefit from and respond to rehabilitation. The clinical currency in which these decisions are transacted is through the term “rehabilitation potential”. The aim of this study was to explore information about rehabilitation potential in older people to inform the development of an evidence-based assessment tool. 13,484 papers were identified and 49 included in the review. Current approaches to rehabilitation potential provide a snapshot of an individual’s abilities and conditions which fail to capture the dynamic nature and fluctuations associated with frailty and rehabilitation. New approaches to measures abilities over time are required which allow for the prognostication of outcomes and potential benefits of rehabilitation interventions for older people living with frailty.</p>

<p><strong>Research into the use of deep brain stimulation to treat depression has produced mixed results. </strong>But there may promise in a more personalised approach to treatment. At <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/next-generation-deep-brain-stimulation-aims-tackle-depression">Kelly Servick reports</a> on studies using imaging and electrode recordings from individuals to figure out exactly which region to stimulate — and when — for the optimal response.</p>

<p><strong>According to a recent study, psychologists are pretty good at updating their beliefs about an apparently established scientific finding, after reading about a failed replication attempt. </strong>This was even true of scientists who had a personal interest in the outcome of the replication, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/are-scientists-less-prone-to-motivated-reasoning/">reports John Timmer</a> at <em>Ars Technica.</em> Of course, this might come as a surprise given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/22/introductory-psychology-books-accused-of-spreading-myths-and-left-leaning-bias/">continued persistence</a> of questionable findings in introductory psychology textbooks — and as Timmer writes, there are some big caveats to the results.</p>

<p><strong>As more and more children become eligible to receive COVID vaccines, how do we make sure that their parents don’t fall for anti-vax conspiracy theories?</strong> People are more likely to subscribe to such beliefs if they overestimate how common they are among other parents, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-dissuade-parents-from-believing-in-anti-vaxxer-conspiracy-theories-171781">explain Darel Cookson and colleagues</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/673711012/0/oupblogpsychology/">How research abstracts succeed and fail</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/how-research-abstracts-succeed-and-fail/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Frustrated-person-on-laptop-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>The abstract of a research article has a simple remit: to faithfully summarize the reported research. After the title, it’s the most read section of the article. It’s freely available on the publisher’s website and in online databases. Crucially, it makes the case to the reader for reading the article in full.&nbsp;</p><p>Alas, not all abstracts succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some take the notion of abstraction to extremes.&nbsp;This example is from a physics article:</p><blockquote><p>Unitarity and geometrical effects are discussed for photon-photon scattering.</p></blockquote><p>It has just ten words. Fortunately, most abstracts say rather more, though it’s possible to say too much. The next example, from a geology article, has over 370 words. It starts:</p><blockquote><p>Diagenesis of the Holocene-Pleistocene volcanogenic sediments of the Mexican Basin produced, in strata of gravel and sand, 1H<sub>2</sub>O- and 2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite, kaolinite, R3-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite, R1-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite, R3-kaolinite (0.75)-2H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite and R1-1H<sub>2</sub>O-smectite (0.75)-kaolinite. Smectite platelets&#8230;</p></blockquote><p>It continues in a similar vein for a further 350 words, accumulating more and more detail. The reason for the work is hinted at, but only becomes clear in the full article, at which&nbsp;point it’s too late.</p><p>Some abstracts introduce citations to previous research to provide background, contrary to the expectation that abstractions stand alone. In practice, citations can block the reader’s progress, as in this example from a remote-sensing&nbsp;article:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of this paper is to extend the stationary stochastic model defined in [1] to a time evolving sea state and platform motion.</p></blockquote><p>The reference pointed to by “[1]” isn’t attached to the abstract, and the source article is obviously elsewhere. Yet without it, the rest of the text is difficult to appreciate. Similar problems can occur with abbreviations explained only in the article.</p><p>Some abstracts confuse their remit by summarizing the paper rather than its content. The shift to meta-reporting can lead to uninformative boiler-plate text. This example is from a medical education article:</p><blockquote><p>Implications of these results are discussed.</p></blockquote><p>It’s uninformative because readers already know that most research articles contain a discussion section where, by definition, results and their implications are discussed.</p><p>Some abstracts expand their remit to include&nbsp;personal research plans. This example is from a clinical article:</p><blockquote><p>We plan to investigate why general practitioners are not complying with the pathway.</p></blockquote><p>It’s common to find research aspirations in internal reports and in research grant applications, where they have a specific function. But published in an abstract, they can present a reader working in the same area with a difficult <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2019/08/why-academics-announce-plans-for-research-that-might-never-happen/">choice</a>.</p><p>Some abstracts expand their remit even further with a self-evaluation of the research. This example is from a finance article:</p><blockquote><p>We believe this study will benefit academics, regulators, policymakers and investors.</p></blockquote><p>The problem is that the reader may not see these pronouncements as truly impartial, with the result that the authority of the article is weakened, not strengthened.</p><p>Abstracts can of course fail in many other ways, for example, omitting caveats,&nbsp;adding new information, exaggerating certainty, or providing no more than an advertisement, a piece of puffery.</p><h2>How to write a successful abstract</h2><p>In the light of all this, what should go into a successful abstract? Some&nbsp;clinical journals settle the matter by imposing a structured format. But most journal and conference proceedings don’t and may offer little or no detailed guidance to the author, who may be left confused about what’s needed.</p><p>One starting point is to think of the abstract not as a condensed version of the paper that preserves the original structure and proportions, but as a mini- or micro-paper in its own right, with certain basic elements:</p><ul><li>the context or scope of the work</li><li>the research question or other reason for the work, if relevant</li><li>the approach or methods</li><li>a key result or two</li><li>a conclusion, if appropriate, or other implications of the work.</li></ul><p>Naturally the weight given to each element depends on the research—whether it’s experimental, observational, or theoretical, and whether the expected audience is general or specialized. How much to write about each element is then a balance between including detail and retaining the reader’s interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Within those constraints, it’s important to identify any critical assumptions, non-standard methods, and limitations on the findings so that the scope and potential application of the research is clear. The reader shouldn’t discover on reading the article that the abstract was misleading.</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example of a well-written abstract from a neuroscience <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1126/science.280.5364.747">article</a>: </p><blockquote><p>An unresolved question in neuroscience and psychology is how the brain monitors performance to regulate behavior. It has been proposed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), on the medial surface of the frontal lobe, contributes to performance monitoring by detecting errors. In this study, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine ACC function. Results confirm that this region shows activity during erroneous responses. However, activity was also observed in the same region during correct responses under conditions of increased response competition. This suggests that the ACC detects conditions under which errors are likely to occur rather than errors themselves.</p><cite><em>From C. S. Carter et al., Science 1998, 280, 747-749.

According to Elsevier’s Scopus database, the article has been cited over 2,500 times.</p><p>Encapsulating a body of research so effectively usually takes repeated rewriting. The timing, though, can be a challenge, since the abstract is often prepared last, when the main sections of the paper have found a settled form. It then risks being rushed while material is assembled for submission for publication.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these pressures, the abstract needs as much attention as any other section of the paper. After all, if it doesn’t do its job, the reader may turn to other abstracts that do. And the published article may languish unretrieved and unseen, waiting in vain for the recognition it deserves.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/673711012/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/673711012/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f11%2fFrustrated-person-on-laptop-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/673711012/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/why-depth-interviewing-is-essential-to-understanding-individuals-and-institutions/">Why depth interviewing is essential to understanding individuals and institutions</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/10/how-oup-is-innovating-for-the-future-of-open-research/">How OUP is innovating for the future of open research</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/police-free-schools-the-new-frontier-in-ending-the-school-to-prison-pipeline/">Police-free schools: the new frontier in ending the school-to-prison pipeline</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

Most stories, even those paywalled, have a paragraph or so of content. To find these articles elsewhere, you could easily copy a phrase and then look for it in Google News. Or you could make a couple of bookmarklets and have a one-click, instant search for different case scenarios.

 

In this article we’re going for the latter option: two bookmarklets that will help you get to articles you can’t access otherwise. They won’t work 100% of the time, but I think you’ll be surprised at how short some of those paywalls are...."

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Sometimes, our emotions are one-dimensional. This morning, for example, when both my kids and my dog jumped into bed, I felt happy. During the Halloween party that my husband and I organised for our boys, though, happiness at their pleasure was definitely tinged with anxiety/stress at managing a houseful of rampaging kids. And here we get into murkier emotional territory. While so much research has been done on individual, &#8220;basic&#8221; emotions, more complex emotional experiences have been neglected. But recent studies have revealed some surprising and special roles for mixed emotions in our lives.</p>



<span id="more-44704"></span>



<p><strong>What<em> do</em> we feel?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073916639661">One of the most impressive explorations of our everyday feeling experiences</a> was published in 2017 in <em>Emotion Review</em>. The US participants wore a beeper that sounded at random moments. Whenever it went off, they jotted down what, if anything, had just been present in their inner experience. Christopher Heavey at the University of Nevada and colleagues found that most of the time, the participants weren’t <em>feeling</em> anything in particular. When they were, it was usually a single feeling — such as happiness or anxiety. But they did sometimes report experiencing multiple distinct feelings simultaneously, which could involve a negative plus a positive emotion. Sometimes, they also reported single, &#8220;blended&#8221;, feelings with both positive and negative facets — a &#8220;sad kind of happiness&#8221;, for example. Of course we already have a term for this: poignancy. But new studies are revealing other emotion combinations.</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;The curious case of threat-awe&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>This is the title of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-85863-001">new paper in </a><em><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-85863-001">Emotion</a> </em>from researchers at the University of New South Wales. &#8220;Curious&#8221;, because although <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/15/feeling-awe-can-sometimes-be-awful/">&#8220;threatening awe&#8221;</a> at the sight of an approaching thunderstorm, say, has been viewed as a negative, fearful sub-aspect of awe, this is not what the team found.</p>



<p>Awe and fear are well-defined, both in terms of how they feel and the kinds of thoughts and behaviours associated with them. Srinwanti Chaudhury and colleagues found that threat-awe has some fear-related aspects and some awe-related aspects, and an overall feeling/behaviours profile that differentiates it from either. So, for example, people experiencing threat-awe were, like people feeling fear, less willing to take risks than those feeling straight awe, but threat-awe felt significantly more pleasant than fear. When participants were simply asked to indicate on a matrix what threat-awe felt like, they reported both negative <em>and</em> positive feelings. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to empirically demonstrate that threat-awe should be regarded as a mixed emotion rather than a negative variant of awe,” the team concludes. They also speculate about the function of threat-awe. Perhaps, they write, it helps us to see &#8220;beauty in adversity&#8221;, which might build resilience in the face of stressful or even traumatic situations.</p>



<p><strong>Mixed emotions and meaning in life</strong></p>



<p>Hedonistic wellbeing — often called happiness — involves feeling plenty of positive emotions, such as joy and excitement. But <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-017-9849-y">work led by Raul Berrios at the University of Santiago in Chile</a> suggests that mixed positive/negative emotions contribute to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/14/weve-neglected-the-role-of-psychological-richness-when-considering-what-makes-a-good-life-study-argues/">psychological wellbeing.</a> However, they boost not happiness but eudaimonia — the important feeling that one’s life has meaning. The team ran two studies to explore this. One surveyed participants who recalled a recent challenge to their life goals or values. In the other, students watched a video about graduating from university, which focused on the poignancy of this event. Across both studies, participants who then reported feeling stronger mixed emotions also rated their lives as being more meaningful. This work suggests that mixed emotions don’t just help people to cope with stress but have broader impacts on wellbeing. And a 2021 study goes further…</p>



<p><strong>Mixed emotions make for smarter thinking</strong></p>



<p>Vincent Oh and Eddie Tong at the National University of Singapore <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-021-00045-x">ran four studies</a> on 1,419 people in Singapore and the US during March and April 2020, a peak period for Covid-19 infections and deaths. They report that more frequent mixed emotions — but not levels of positive or negative emotions — were linked to greater eudaimonic wellbeing and also more self-reported infection-prevention behaviours, such as using hand sanitiser frequently and avoiding sharing food. These findings sit well with some other recent studies suggesting that mixed emotions make it easier for us to integrate information from multiple perspectives, supporting more complex thought, and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Interestingly, relatively high levels of positive or negative emotions predicted &#8220;unsupported and atypical virus-prevention behaviours&#8221;, such as eating more honey, or even using detergent as a mouthwash. This is “consistent with findings that positive emotions may promote gullibility and negative emotions may promote maladaptive coping,” the team writes.</p>



<p>So the next time you feel conflicting emotions, don’t worry — the lesson from all this recent work seems to be: it’s good for you.</p>
