                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/dNE5r9exF-M/">ADNI: Understanding Alzheimer’s disease through collaboration and data sharing</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/10/ADNI_tauPET_Hansson_FAN_2017_cropped-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Of the many outstanding mysteries of neuroscience, the pathogenic origins of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain one of the most perplexing neurological puzzles. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are presently afflicted with the disease, which gradually ravages the aging brain, resulting in progressive loss of memory followed by other cognitive abilities. Due to this accelerating pressing public health concern, funding agencies have grasped the urgency of supporting research aimed at detecting and treating this debilitating neurodegenerative disease, and continue to increase their funding allocations for AD research. Yet, despite decades of investigation, our knowledge of the basic biological underpinnings of AD remains remarkably inconclusive.</p>
<p><strong>No lab should be an island</strong></p>
<p>Two significant obstacles to unraveling the mystery of AD are the complexity of this heterogeneous disease, and the challenge of unifying disparate findings from independent research groups using vastly different techniques and samples. For instance, how does the research community integrate reports on structural brain changes in AD from two labs each using different brain imaging techniques, and studying small groups of demographically and clinically distinct samples of patients? This problem­, of researchers working in isolated microcosms to solve enormously complex puzzles, is not unique to AD research. An evolution in how scientists conduct research–from working in protected research bubbles to collaboration and openly sharing data across lab boundaries–is rapidly gaining traction across disciplines. The solution to cracking the AD puzzle just might be found by a continued shift in this direction.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration and data-sharing in AD research</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</a> (ADNI) has been a shining example of how collaborative work among experts in a given field can generate progress leaps and bounds faster than individual groups plugging away independently. ADNI was established in 2004 with the intent to collect a large set of brain imaging (MRI and PET), cognitive, genetic, blood and cerebrospinal fluid data on individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (considered a precursor to AD), and healthy controls. Across the US and Canada, over 2,000 individuals at 63 locations have participated to date, with many returning for annual assessments. By adhering to a standardized protocol across research sites, study data can easily be integrated for large-scale analysis. Perhaps what has made the project so fruitful, besides producing a goldmine of multimodal data from well-characterized AD participants, is the open <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">availability of ADNI data</a> to any qualified researcher who requests access. With the brightest minds in the field granted free access to this rich dataset, the opportunities for critical and novel interrogation are boundless.</p>
<p><strong>The fruits of ADNI</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526018335143" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently published review</a> by Dallas Veitch and collaborators on the growing findings from ADNI highlights its prolific yield. Since its inception 14 years ago, <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/news-publications/publications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1739 papers</a> utilizing the ADNI dataset have been published to date. Because of the range of measures collected, this vast literature covers novel findings in how brain structure, neuropathology, cognition, and genetics contribute to AD development and progression. Here are just a few highlights of the emerging advances from ADNI that Veitch and colleagues discuss in their comprehensive review.</p>
<p><u>Disease time-course</u>. Data-driven disease models of the temporal order of pathological brain changes and their casual relationships suggest that multiple mechanisms are likely at play in AD. Although preliminary, these models suggest that vascular changes and the appearance of amyloid-ß (a pathological protein that accumulates in the AD brain) occur early. These changes are soon followed by altered brain metabolism, disrupted structural and functional connectivity, atrophy and cognitive decline.</p>
<p><u>Genetic risk</u>. Studies have confirmed that the APOE ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD, but many other genes have also been implicated. Candidate genes include those involved in oxidative stress, amyloid and tau formation, vascular health, and calcium signaling. APOE ε4 may elevate risk through cerebrovascular mechanisms, via both amyloid-dependent and -independent pathways.</p>
<p><u>AD subtypes</u>. What we commonly consider AD may in fact represent multiple subtypes of AD-like dementia. Distinct subgroups have been identified that vary in their patterns of neuropathology and brain atrophy, cognitive deficits, and vascular and metabolic changes. An emerging theme is that AD is a heterogeneous disease with many causal pathways and manifestations.</p>
<p><u>Amyloid-tau relationship</u>. Levels of neurofibrillary tau tangles–the other pathological protein implicated in AD–are greater in individuals with high levels of amyloid-ß, but only tau (and not amyloid-ß) correlates with cognitive function. Accumulating evidence suggests a synergistic relationship between amyloid-ß and tau, whereby tau spread accelerates once amyloid burden reaches a critical threshold, collectively triggering a cascade of metabolic and degenerative changes that ultimately impair cognitive function.</p>
<p><u>Vascular dysfunction</u>. Vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol or diabetes, may contribute to brain atrophy and cognitive decline through both amyloid-dependent and amyloid-independent pathways. Vascular dysfunction is thought to be one of the earliest precipitating factors to AD onset, suggesting that addressing vascular risk may be critical to preventing or slowing AD progression.</p>
<p><u>Sex differences</u>. Women are twice as likely to develop AD than men, which may be due in part to their increased longevity. But even after accounting for their longer lifespan, women appear to have greater vulnerability to amyloid-ß and tau, and demonstrate differences in genetic risk factors for AD.</p>
<p>Although the mystery of AD has yet to be solved, our understanding of the disease is rapidly progressing, thanks in large part to the integration of data and resources across the AD research community. Open, collaborative science is becoming increasingly valued for its ability to unify research efforts, and will no doubt be crucial to future progress in many areas of research.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Leopard-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Leopards can’t change their spots, but they have changed the spots where they live…</strong></h3>
<p>Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) are large, iconic predators that are currently distributed over large parts of Africa and Asia. The Asian populations are believed to be descended from African leopards, founded in an out-of-Africa dispersal event (much like human history).</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2013.05.009" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fossil remains</a>, we know that leopards were also present in Europe for most of the Pleistocene, but these European leopards went extinct some time during the last glacial period (~25,000 years ago). However, it has always been unclear how the extinct European leopards were related to leopards in Africa and Asia today.</p>
<blockquote><p>European leopards share a more recent ancestor with Asian leopards than with African leopards, which suggests that the European population was founded in the same out-of-Africa migration that founded the Asian leopards.</p></blockquote>
<p>We investigated ancient DNA samples derived from European “ice-age” leopards (some of which were up to 45,000 years old), as well as samples of Asian and African leopards from museum collections, to resolve questions regarding the relation between ancient and modern leopards and the biogeography of these iconic predators.</p>
<p>Biogeography involves the study of geographic distribution of lineages, and tries to infer the past processes that could have led to the observed patterns. For example, leopards lived in Europe until the end of the last glacial period, and the DNA from these extinct populations can tell us something about their origin, and how they are related to the leopards that live today.</p>
<p>The investigation of DNA from current populations may only reveal the genetic diversity that has survived in today’s leopards. Although challenging to work with, including DNA from ancient and historical samples can provide unique insights into the history and genetic diversity of a species. This is because it allows us to obtain information about lineages and populations that no longer exist today, like the European leopard.</p>
<p>Our analysis of ancient DNA sequences shows that European leopards share a more recent ancestor with Asian leopards than with African leopards, which suggests that the European population was founded in the same out-of-Africa migration that founded the Asian leopards.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Out-of-Africa: not the first and not the last</strong></h3>
<p>Our data provides further support for the hypothesized African origin of all living leopards. There are a number of other mammals for which an African origin has been proposed (e.g. hyenas, lions), including our very own ancestors.</p>
<p>We have used fossil-calibrated genetic methods to estimate the timing of the leopard out-of-Africa dispersal, and our results suggest it occurred between 710-483 thousand years ago. The genetic data for leopards also suggests that the out-of-Africa dispersal happened in a single event, rather than multiple, repeated events.</p>
<p>The timing of this event does not directly correlate with the dispersal of the earliest Hominids (<em>Homo erectus</em>, approx. 2 million years ago) or earliest anatomically modern humans (<em>H. sapiens, </em>approx. 100 thousand years ago), so it is likely that different processes drove the out-of-Africa dispersal events for each species.</p>
<h3><strong>Unexpected results from our Javan leopard</strong></h3>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10615" style="width: 274px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10615 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/Lab2_PhotoCredit_KarlaFritze-264x300.jpg" width="264" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Photograph taken by Karla Fritze, University of Potsdam, Germany</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>One of our leopard samples was reported to originate from Java, where leopards are assigned to a separate subspecies (the Javan leopard <em>Panthera pardus melas</em>). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12348" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Previous studies</a> found that DNA from Javan leopards was distinct from all mainland Asian leopards, suggesting that this population has been isolated in South East Asia for a long time. However, we found that the Javan leopard museum specimen is closely related to the Indochinese leopard, suggesting instead that there may have been a more recent genetic exchange between mainland and Javan leopards.</p>
<p>Although, of course, the results from a single sample should be treated with caution, they do urge for more detailed investigations of the Javan leopard and its relationship to the mainland populations.</p>
<h3><strong>Implications for modern leopards</strong></h3>
<p>We investigated mitochondrial DNA, which is only a small part of the genome and is only inherited through the female line. Thus, it only reveals a part of the evolutionary history of a species, and there can be multiple scenarios that  lead to similar genetic patterns, making them difficult to distinguish. The unexpected result for the Javan leopard is a good example of the challenges associated with the formulation of conservation strategies.</p>
<p>Currently, the conservation efforts for the Javan leopard are based on its taxonomic status as a distinct subspecies. Our results could potentially point to more recent gene flow between the mainland and Java than was previously believed, which could have implications for leopard population management.</p>
<p>However, the current taxonomy is based on many more factors than mitochondrial DNA alone. More data needs to be collected in order to fully characterize the relationship between the Javan and the mainland leopard and how to best ensure their continued survival.</p>

<p>Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran's journal club session on his article "<a class="reference external" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6045332?reload=true&amp;arnumber=6045332">Maximum Satisfiability Anatomy of the Fitness Landscape for a Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problem (Adam Prugel-Bennett; Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran, 2011)</a>".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The fitness landscape of MAX-3-SAT is investigated for random instances above the satisfiability phase transition. This paper includes a scaling analysis of the time to reach a local optimum, the number of local optima, the expected probability of reaching a local optimum as a function of its fitness, the expected fitness found by local search and the best fitness, the probability of reaching a global optimum, the size and relative positions of the global optima, the mean distance between the local and global optima, the expected fitness as a function of the Hamming distance from an optimum and their basins of attraction. These analyses show why the problem becomes hard for local search algorithms as the system size increases. The paper also shows how a recently proposed algorithm can exploit long-range correlations in the fitness landscape to improve on the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Focus and concentration, while normally considered beneficial attributes, can stymie creativity – especially the generation of novel ideas. This has led some to wonder whether people with “<a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/53804/how-to-use-distraction-to-your-advantage">leaky attention</a>“, and especially those with ADHD – who have what Holly White, writing recently in the <em>Journal of Creative Behaviour</em>, calls “chaotic minds” – might have a creative advantage when it comes to breaking free from prior examples. White, who is based at the University of Michigan, has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jocb.382">tested this possibility</a>, and though she acknowledges her new study is small, she believes her findings provide some of the first experimental evidence that “ADHD may be advantageous for certain types of creative thinking; specifically, divergent, unconstrained creative cognition.”</p>
<p><span id="more-35036"></span></p>
<p>White recruited 26 male and female undergrads diagnosed with ADHD and 26 male and female undergrads without ADHD, and asked them to complete two tests of creativity.</p>
<p>For the first, the student volunteers spent 20 minutes drawing and describing pictures of alien fruit, following the instruction to be as creative and unusual as they could, trying not to duplicate fruit that exists on earth (see some of their efforts above).</p>
<p>Two trained judges, who did not know the ADHD status of the artists, then carefully rated all the drawings. Drawings by the undergrads with ADHD were rated as more original and containing more atypical features – evidence, White said, of their greater “conceptual expansion”, a process “whereby traditional conceptual boundaries are extended”.</p>
<p>The second task was designed to test the students’ ability to break free from the influence of prior examples and involved them imagining they worked for an ad agency and coming up with original product names.</p>
<p>For this test, White first presented her volunteers with the names of six example products in three categories – pain relievers, nuclear elements and pasta. All six examples in each category had certain letters in common. For instance, the pain medication examples always ended in “ol” or “in”, such as Tylenol, Panadol, Aspirin and Bufferin. The nuclear elements always ended in -on or -ium, and the pastas always ended in -i or -a.</p>
<p>The students’ challenge was to spend 10 minutes coming up with new product names for each category, following the instruction not to use or copy any aspects of the examples. Raters – again blind to whose work they were scoring – then judged the students’ suggestions based on whether or not they had copied the endings of the examples, and whether they also managed to sound appropriate to the products they represented. The students with ADHD managed to break free more often from the spelling conventions in the examples, while also matching the control students on the ability to invent names that sounded appropriate.</p>
<p>It’s important not to minimise the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/symptoms/">problems</a> faced by people with ADHD and those who care for them. Also, the study sample was not only small, it also featured exclusively students with ADHD who were high-functioning and free of other problematic diagnoses. Remember too that the full creative process is about more than coming up with new ideas – it also requires dedication and focus to turn those ideas into reality.</p>
<p>However, White said that her findings show ADHD might come with certain creative advantages, and further research might “explore the potential contribution of the chaotic ADHD mind in the workplace.” She added: “By leveraging ADHD-related strengths and providing the necessary structure and support, individuals and organisations alike may be able to unlock the imaginative and innovative potential of the ADHD mind.”</p>

Following my reporting, the cancer researcher Carlos López-Otín abandoned his ERC-funded 36-member-strong "Degradome" lab at the University of Oviedo in Spain and moved in with his collaborator in Paris, France, Guido Kroemer. Yet Lopez-Otin's data integrity issues seem as poppycock compared to what Kroemer and his life partner Laurence Zitvogel dished out to the scientific community.

<p>Listening to a story is known to be cognitively demanding, in part because the listener has to pay close attention to, and remember, plot and character detail in order to understand what’s going on. Attention and memory are both diminished in people living with dementia. Might regularly reading aloud to such patients help, then, to train their attention and memory, and function as a treatment? A new <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pne0000141">study</a> of people with various kinds of dementia, published in <i>Psychology and Neuroscience</i>, suggests that it could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35028"></span></p>
<p>A total of 43 patients with Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia or general cognitive decline, who were living in a nursing home in Perugia, Italy, took part. All these patients had mild to moderate dementia, according to scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. At the start of the study, they were each assessed by a psychologist using a standard test of attention, language, visuospatial abilities and both immediate and delayed memory. They were then divided into two groups, matched for scores on this test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The training took place at a time when the residents would normally be in the common room watching TV. The control group watched TV, as normal. The other group went into another room for the listening activity. Over 40 sessions, run five days a week, Monday through Friday, this group listened to student volunteers from the University of Perugia reading material that became gradually more demanding over time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At first, the residents listened for 20 minutes a day to <i>Favole al telefono</i> by Gianni Rodari – a book of short, individual, humorous stories with a simple narrative structure. After a few weeks, the reading shifted up a gear, to 30 minutes a day of traditional fairy tales written by Italo Calvino. This material had a slightly more complex narrative structure and characters, and recurrent motifs. A few weeks after that, the patients started to listen for 40 minutes a day (later upped to 45 minutes a day) to <i>Un Trenzo per la Luna</i> by Cinzia Giuntoli, a novel set in Tuscany during World War 1. To follow this novel, they had to retain memories from earlier instalments. At the beginning and end of each session, the residents were asked to share – if they wanted to – their thoughts on the reading material, and any relevant personal memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At the end of the study period, both groups’ attention, language, visuospatial and immediate and delayed abilities were re-tested. For the listening group, there was an upward trend in their scores on all of these measures, while the control group showed no improvements (and even some decrements). Compared with the control group, those in the listening group now had statistically significant higher scores on immediate memory, attention and delayed memory (though not visuospatial memory).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A more detailed analysis revealed that people with vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease showed improvements in immediate and delayed memory, but only people with vascular dementia got better at tests of language and attention.</p>
<p>This was a small study. And the people in the listening group didn’t just listen to stories. Unlike members of the control group, who were watching TV, they also interacted with the student reader and with each other – and social interaction is cognitively demanding. How much this might have accounted for the attention and memory benefits is unknown because this wasn’t something the researchers looked at.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Still, the intervention –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>listening to a story, plus the social interaction and the recall of autobiographical memories – did have significant effects. Given that there’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, anything that can help with memory is surely to be welcomed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The data from this study confirm the effectiveness of the daily narrative training in delaying cognitive decline and maybe in improving the overall quality of life and self-perception of individuals who suffer from mild to moderate cognitive decline,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Perhaps, they go on, this kind of training should then be implemented as a non-drug treatment for people with dementia, and explored as a possible prevention tool in healthy older people, or for the millions around the world diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which can – but does not always – progress to dementia.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/pexels-photo-576831-140x110.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Antibiotics were once regarded as magical pills, saving millions. But unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is eroding their efficacy. One of the main drivers of this resistance is the very high use of antibiotics in primary care.</p>
<p>To understand part of the problem, consider this: have you ever taken an antibiotic for an acute respiratory infection such as a sore throat, acute cough or middle ear infection? You likely said yes: more than half of patients with an acute respiratory infection receive an antibiotic prescription.</p>
<p>Yet the main benefit of taking antibiotics for these conditions is small; the decrease in the duration of sore throat is about 16 hours compared to not taking antibiotics. You could be one of the people who will have problems from taking antibiotics, like vomiting, diarrhea, thrush or rash. Other downsides include cost, remembering to take them, and the risk of antibiotic resistance, which could threaten successful treatment of any really serious future infection (such as meningitis, community acquired pneumonia).</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the high rate of antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections. One can be the imperative for clinicians wanting to support their patients with acute respiratory infections and ‘do something’, perhaps in the belief that any benefit from antibiotics (however minimal) is better than none.</p>
<p>Another reason might be that clinicians, believing their patients want antibiotics, prescribed them to maintain a good therapeutic relationship. Some patients may even ask for antibiotics (often because they over-estimate their benefits, and do not realize they have harms).</p>
<h3><strong>Shared decision making</strong></h3>
<p>Part of improving the appropriateness of antibiotic use for infections like these is improving the communication between doctors and patients about the need for antibiotics and their benefits and harms. Better still, enabling clinicians and patients to jointly participate in making the decision to use antibiotics or not, after discussing the options, benefits and harms, and patients’ values and preferences.</p>
<p>This is a process known as <em>shared decision making</em>. We know this can help with reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, the question is: how much does it currently occur within consultations between doctors and patients with acute respiratory infections?</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-018-0854-y?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Family_Practice-Public_Health-Global&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_OCT2018_antibiotic_conversations">Our study</a> addressed this question, along with how antibiotic benefits and harms, including antibiotic resistance, are discussed during routine clinical consultations and what happens to the conversation when decision aids (tools designed to encourage shared decision making and include the benefits and harms of using or not using antibiotics) are used.</p>
<p>This research was part of a larger study in southeast Queensland, Australia – a randomized controlled trial of decision aids for the most common acute respiratory infections (sore throat, middle ear infection, acute cough) that antibiotics are prescribed for, to see if providing decision aids this reduces antibiotic prescribing.</p>
<h3><strong>How common is shared decision making?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>When clinicians who had been provided with a patient decision aid used it, the discussion about antibiotic benefits and harms, including talking about antibiotic resistance, was better.</p></blockquote>
<p>We audio-recorded 36 consultations with patients who had acute respiratory infection, and afterwards asked the patients about their involvement in the treatment decision and confidence in the decision. Ideally, we would have recorded all the consultations in the randomized trial – but doing so would have been prohibitively expensive and difficult.</p>
<p>We found that the extent to which shared decision making occurred in consultations was quite low. Even simple communication about antibiotic benefits and harms was not common: it was rare in consultations when decision aids were not used, and antibiotic resistance was never mentioned as a harm. However, when clinicians who had been provided with a patient decision aid used it, the discussion about antibiotic benefits and harms, including talking about antibiotic resistance, was better.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, patients thought that they were highly involved in the decision, even when they were not. Perhaps this comes from low expectations: patients who have never experienced shared decision making will have no idea what it is like.</p>
<p>Our current study suggests that using decision aids might improve the way primary care doctors communicate antibiotic benefits and harms in routine consultations for acute respiratory infection – and this is important so that patients can make an informed health decision. The next time you visit your primary care doctor with one of these infections, ask some questions such as: what will happen if you wait and watch? How much benefit is there from antibiotics? And how much harm is there?</p>

<p>In chronic pain, the pain system is locked in to a high-alert mode. One of my colleagues describes it as replacing your alarm system after a burglary, but with one so sensitive it goes off when a fly goes through the room. Mere touch may now be experienced as pain. The pain is real, it isn’t “just in the head”, but nor is there a hidden injury to fix or illness that can be cured. It’s a system that needs retuning, and that calls for participation from the body itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.22689">paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Clinical Psychology</i> one particularly promising way that psychologists can help with this is by encouraging <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/53949/the-dangers-of-being-too-hard-on-yourself">self-compassion</a>: a practice of recognising one’s own suffering, accepting this is part of a shared human experience, and not over-identifying with the suffering.</p>
<p><span id="more-35017"></span></p>
<p>Sérgio Carvalho from the University of Coimbra and his colleagues surveyed women living with chronic pain, to better understand which psychological states seem to coincide with, and potentially support, pain acceptance – an important outcome given that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26431422">past research</a> has demonstrated a causal link between greater pain acceptance and lower depression (pain acceptance is about recognising that the pain experience is part of your life and may continue to be so for the foreseeable future. It also means being willing to put up with that pain, and, crucially, to pursue valued goals and act in their pursuit, despite pain).</p>
<p>Two hundred and thirty-one Portuguese women with chronic pain (symptoms lasting more than three months) – most of them diagnosed with fibromyalgia – reported their acceptance of pain using a well established instrument that looks at both willingness to experience pain and how much valued actions are attempted in the face of pain. As expected, those women who said they completed more valued activities in the face of pain also reported fewer depressive symptoms (and also a lower pain intensity).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants also completed measures of their mindful awareness – how aware they are of present-moment daily activities – and self-compassion, measured by items such as “I try to see my failings as part of the human condition”. Both of these measures correlated negatively with depression, but only greater self-compassion was linked with engaging in more activities in the face of pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s plausible then that self-compassion lifts mood because it encourages people to accept their pain and act. Engaging in activity starts to strengthen the body, send hormones flowing that increase mood and themselves can reduce pain, and puts back sources of pleasure and satisfaction into one’s life.</p>
<p>This study suggests mindfulness (which was not linked with greater activity) may also be useful in decreasing depression, but by other means, possibly through creating distance from unhelpful thoughts that may arise around pain or the experience of disability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As cross-sectional research, we can’t draw clear causal conclusions from the new findings, but they do help us refine our understanding of which mechanisms are more likely to increase pain acceptance. The findings may also help pain management professionals focus their methods, providing people with the ground from which they can build and sustain a life defined not by pain, but by values and meaning.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/migraine-ADHD-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097237/">recent study</a> in <em>Science</em> by <em>The Brainstorm Consortium</em> assessed the genetic correlation between neurological and psychiatric traits. The results showed that there is a small but significant genetic correlation between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and migraine. However, the symptomatic correlation of these disorders has never actually been observed in an adult.</p>
<p>Most research on ADHD and migraine has focused on children and adolescents since ADHD has mainly been observed in these groups. It has been argued that symptoms of ADHD disappear with age. However, during the last few years, it has been established that adult ADHD is a real and prevalent phenotype, and that the much lower observance is caused by adults’ increased ability to adapt – both themselves and to their surroundings. With age, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617155/">adults with ADHD are likely to learn to deal with their symptoms</a>, and they are more likely to select jobs and environments where the disease will be accepted or can remain hidden. In other words, they have the power to shape their lives in a way that children and adolescents in the school system can not. ADHD has therefore been much more evident in children and for this reason, no studies with  a large cohort of adults with ADHD have been available.</p>
<blockquote><p>With these data, they were able to conclude that there was an association between the occurrence of ADHD and migraine in adults that were otherwise healthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to collect data, Dr. Hansen and colleagues conducted individual assessments of ADHD and migraine symptoms from 26,456 participants of the Danish Blood Donor Study. Prior to blood donation participants answered two questionnaires. The first was the Screening Questionnaire for Migraine to asses for the presence of migraine.  The 18 item ADHD Self-Report Scale v1.1 was filled out to assess for ADHD symptoms.  With these data, they were able to conclude that there was an association between the occurrence of ADHD and migraine in adults that were otherwise healthy. One interesting finding was that adults with higher ADHD symptomatology were more likely to experience migraine with visual disturbances (also known as aura) compared to migraine without visual disturbances.</p>
<p>By obtaining this very large and unique cohort, they discovered that there is indeed a strong correlation between ADHD and migraine even though it has not been observable in earlier studies of children cohorts. We also observed that this comorbidity was particularly pronounced in individuals between 45-55 years of age. These findings suggest that  ADHD or migraine symptoms change over the course of life. Another possibility might be that there is a difference between individuals who are diagnosed as children and individuals who are diagnosed as adults.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Hansen established an association between migraine and ADHD the findings have resulted in more questions. Future studies will aim to elucidate which genetic and environmental factors contribute to the migraine-ADHD comorbidity.</p>

Better late than never? Or too little too late? Those are two different ways to look at a recent retraction.

<p>Psychology as a scientific field enjoys a tremendous level of popularity throughout society, a fascination that could even be described as religious. This is likely the reason why it is one of the most popular undergraduate majors in European and American universities. At the same time, it is not uncommon to encounter the firm opinion that psychology in no way qualifies for consideration as a science. Such extremely critical opinions about psychology are often borrowed from authorities – after all, it was none other than the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman who, in a famous interview in 1974, compared the social sciences and psychology in particular to a cargo cult. Scepticism toward psychological science can also arise following encounters with the commonplace <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/29/10-of-the-most-widely-believed-myths-in-psychology/">simplifications and myths spread by pop-psychology</a>, or as a product of a failure to understand what science is and how it solves its dilemmas.</p>
<p>According to William O’Donohue and Brendan Willis of the University of Nevada, these issues are further compounded by undergraduate psychology textbooks. Writing recently in <em>Archives of Scientific Psychology</em>, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-40988-001">they argue</a> that “[a] lack of clarity and accuracy in [psych textbooks] in describing what science is and psychology’s relationship to science are at the heart of these issues.” The authors based their conclusions on a review of 30 US and UK undergraduate psychology textbooks, most updated in the last few years (general texts and others covering abnormal, social and cognitive psych), in which they looked for 18 key contemporary issues in philosophy of science.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35009"></span></p>
<p>Almost a quarter of the sampled textbooks explicitly and boastfully stated that there is no difference between psychology and other “hard” sciences such as chemistry and physics. Yet only one textbook discussed “methodological freedom” – the idea asserted by the philosopher-critic of science, Paul Feyerabend, that all scientific techniques are different. Only one textbook mentioned the issue of improper use of ad hoc hypotheses, a characteristic of pseudoscience. Similarly, there was only one reference to the ideas put forward by Feyerabend and Alan Gross that persuasion and rhetoric are a key part of science – i.e. that the scientific endeavour is not merely about “the dispassionate evaluation of evidence”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There were also just three mentions of such important issues as “evolutionary epistemology” (how knowledge accumulates), “social constructionism” (how social context shapes our scientific understanding), and “Kuhnian paradigms” (a discussion regarding Kuhn’s idea of paradigms, including that knowledge is only interpreted within a certain paradigm and how Kuhnian paradigm shifts occur), and the question of whether psychology is a pre-paradigmatic science or mature science. Only four textbooks contained any sort of discussion regarding whether or not the definition of science itself is a controversial topic. The roles of competing theories and evaluations in science were mentioned only six times.</p>
<p>“… [U]ndergraduate psychology students are not being provided a clear sense of what science is as well as its complexities,” the researchers concluded. “[The] data also generally suggest that students are being presented a simplistic notion of science as having a relatively straightforward and settled characterisation. Few texts mention that science is difficult to define, or that there are multiple proposed accounts of science. This is concerning, especially given the continual debate regarding psychology’s (and other social sciences) relationships to the natural sciences …” O’Donohue and Willis said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the plus side, there was a far more exhaustive treatment by textbook authors of some meta-science issues (the question of how science should be practised). Most frequently – in 16 textbooks – there was discussion of the crucial role of theory in forming and testing hypotheses. Among other topics that O’Donohue and Willis looked for, those mentioned most frequently included the tentativeness of scientific facts and whether science is deductive or inductive (seven books argued for it being deductive, three against). However, only eight of the sampled books identified pseudoscience as a concern and discussed how to differentiate pseudoscience from legitimate science.</p>
<p>The new findings confirm other unfavourable assessments of the value of psychology textbooks, such as their involvement in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/22/introductory-psychology-books-accused-of-spreading-myths-and-left-leaning-bias/">spreading pop-psychological myths and liberal-leaning bias</a>; <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/08/best-selling-introductory-psychology-books-give-a-misleading-view-of-intelligence/">giving a misleading view of intelligence</a>; ignoring modern criticism of such famous studies as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">Milgram’s experiments</a>, or the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>; and being <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/10/13/evolutionary-psychologists-expose-the-shoddy-treatment-of-their-discipline-by-textbooks/">misleading about evolutionary psychology</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A simplistic notion of science presented in undergrad textbooks is not only a problem for the image of our discipline in the eyes of the public. O’Donohue and Willis rightly point out that covering issues such as “logic, definition of knowledge, bias in science, how to evaluate theories and other topics that can apply to the informed citizen’s appraisal of important issues ranging from human contributions to climate change, to the legitimacy of research involving Big Pharma, to understanding whether evolution is ‘just a theory’,” are also relevant for the general goals of a liberal education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the content of textbooks in undergraduate psychology suggest that they serve not only to instruct, but also to essentially indoctrinate students into a particular way of thinking. A pity that this new study and others have so far not answered the question of how much content has been omitted by authors because they disagree with it, and how much because they are ignorant of it. Perhaps this is a significant research problem that should be explored in the future?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

A dubious predatory academic publisher called Open Access Publishing London (OAPL) seems to have died. Their website has gone down, taking some 1,500 scientific papers with it. What can we learn from this?



Long-time readers will remember my series of posts on OAPL back from when I first investigated it in 2013. As far as I can tell, it was a one-man operation. The man turned out to be a Dr. Waseem Jerjes. Jerjes is a dental surgeon with many legitimate research papers to his name, and he

<p>Librarians, are you talking about preprints? A <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq">preprint</a></u> is a complete scientific article posted on a public server before peer review.  Preprints speed dissemination and encourage early feedback.  But, this post isn’t about defining preprints and their value.  It’s October, I’m a scholarly communication librarian, so I’ve been panicking–<em>I mean thinking</em>–about what do for <u><a href="http://openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a></u>.  This year, I’m focusing my outreach efforts on preprints and I want to tell you why.</p>
<p>I am passionate about open science and realizing its benefits, but I am just as passionate about supporting student, faculty, and institutional success.  These goals, which are increasingly aligned, require a deep understanding of the scholarly communication and research landscape and right now preprints are a center of conversation in this space<sup><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/899">1</a></sup>.  Funders like the NIH and Helmsley Charitable Trust are encouraging researchers to share and cite preprints, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is even requiring it:</p>
<p><strong><em>“To encourage rapid dissemination of results, any publications related to this funded work must be submitted to a preprint server, such as bioRxiv, before the first submission to a journal.”</em><em><sup><a href="https://www.chanzuckerberg.com/science/rfa/collaborative-science">2</a></sup></em><em>  </em></strong></p>
<p>Journals are accepting manuscripts previously posted as preprints, inviting submissions from preprint servers, and linking to preprint versions of papers under consideration<sup><a href="http://asapbio.org/journal-policies">3</a></sup>.  The number of published preprints is rising<sup><a href="http://www.prepubmed.org/monthly_stats/">4</a></sup> and stakeholders are responding with support and concern<sup><a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/27098/">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Researchers have to navigate this context and make decisions about how to share their work:  librarians can contribute to their success and affect change by responding to this need. In my experience, most researchers encounter and experiment with innovations in scholarly communication via specific points of choice or pressure. Librarian led outreach related to preprints can lead to conversations that catalyze a deeper interest in scholarly communication issues and changes. Collectively and over time these small and personal experiments and the discussions that surround them (including critical ones) help shift the needle towards openness.</p>
<p>I also believe in a definition of and critical approach to open science (and librarianship) that acknowledges how history, inequality, and privilege influence our scholarly communication practices and priorities.  Author and NYU Scholarly Communication Librarian <a href="https://library.nyu.edu/people/april-hathcock/">April Hathcock</a> advocates for flipping the script on how we view open:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Rather than looking at it as a means of getting mainstream scholarship out to the margins, instead I want us to see it as a way of getting scholarship from marginalized communities into our mainstream discourse.”</em><em><sup><a href="https://aprilhathcock.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/opening-up-the-margins/">6</a></sup></em></strong></p>
<p>Preprints sit within a larger and evolving discussion about how scholarship is communicated and endorsed. I am excited about initiatives, like <u><a href="https://prereview.org/">PREreview</a></u>, that communities are developing around preprints to address issues of inclusion and representation in peer review.  From this perspective, preprints are a tool for democratizing “access to [and participation in] science on a global scale”<sup><a href="https://blog.datproject.org/2018/10/03/prereview-joins-cs-s-sponsored-project-program/">7</a></sup>.  As librarians, we can support these projects and invent new ones that leverage preprints to take up April’s challenge.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to raise the volume on the “power of the preprint” and address the reasons why <u><a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/columnists/learned-stop-worrying-love-preprints/">some researchers are reluctant to share them</a></u>?:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a deep dive on the preprints landscape.  <a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info">ASAPbio’s preprint info center</a> is a great starting place.</li>
<li>Connect with your institution’s preprint champions <em>and</em> ask them about their motivations.</li>
<li>Use your preprint and institutional knowledge to launch an engagement and demystification campaign.  Low bandwidth? Keep it simple by <u><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/10/live-streamed-preprint-journal-clubs/">promoting existing events</a></u> and <u><a href="http://asapbio.org/support-preprints">reusing the work of others</a></u>.</li>
<li>Start a discussion with organizations on your campus working to address inequities and increase diversity in science about this year’s <u><a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/theme-of-2018-international-open-access-week-to-be-designing-equi">Open Access Week theme </a></u>and the role preprints might play.</li>
<li>Model the shift to open!  Share your own scholarship on <u><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/lissa/">LISSA</a></u>, <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/">e-LIS</a> and other preprint servers.</li>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>According to the Mindset Theory, if you tell a child repeatedly that they’re smart, it makes them less willing to push themselves when they get stuck on an intellectual challenge, presumably because failure would threaten their self-image of being a “smart kid”. For this reason, effort-based praise – rewarding kids for “working hard” rather than “being smart” – is widely recommended (though it’s <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/24/growth-mindset-theory-doesnt-translate-directly-from-kids-to-adults-telling-an-adult-they-are-a-hard-worker-can-backfire/">not the same for adults</a>). But does a similar effect occur in the social sphere? What if you ask a child – as so many parents and surely teachers do – to “be a helper” as if it’s a category that you either belong to or you don’t?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Earlier research has found that young kids are more likely to try to help others when they are asked to “be helpers” instead of “to help”. But as Emily Foster-Hanson and her fellow researchers at New York University note, “Setbacks and difficulties are common features of children’s experience throughout development and into adulthood,” so it’s important to examine the effects of category labelling – like “being smart” or “being a helper” – when things go wrong for the child. And in their <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13147">new paper</a>, published in <i>Child Development</i>, they find that setbacks are more detrimental to a child labelled “a helper” than a child asked “to help”.</p>
<p><span id="more-34998"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited a total of 139 four- and five-year olds who were visiting the Children’s Museum of Manhattan and tested each of them alone in a private room in the museum. At the start, half of them were primed with a short introduction to think of themselves as “a helper” (for example, “when someone needs to pick things up, you could be a helper”) and the others to think of themselves as someone who could “help” (“when someone needs to pick things up, you could help”).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers gave the children various theoretical helping scenarios to act out with puppets, one of which represented them, either “helping” or “being a helper”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(the wording was varied in the experimenter’s script according to the child’s experimental group). Afterwards the children were quizzed about their attitudes towards helping and the results suggested that, after role-playing encountering a setback when helping (such as accidentally knocking over a cup of crayons when tidying them up), “helpers” had more negative attitudes toward helping than those who’d “helped”.</p>
<p>For a second study, on a fresh group of children, the researchers investigated the effect of real setbacks. These kids were set up to fail. In one scenario, for example, an experimenter prompted the child to help (or be a helper) by putting away a box that was on the table. If the child didn’t immediately go to do it, they got a succession of prompts, until they did. But the box had a loose bottom, and it was full of ping pong balls, which fell onto the floor when the child picked it up. In another example, a child was prompted to put away a toy truck, which had in fact been disassembled and then had the parts put back together so that it looked intact, but as soon as it was picked up, it fell apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that after experiencing these setbacks, the “helper” kids were less likely to voluntarily go and help in two other fairly demanding helping situations (such as going into another part of the room to put away bricks into bags) than the kids in the “helping” group. “This pattern is broadly consistent with the idea that children who had been told to ‘be helpers’ but then made mistakes were overall less motivated to help than the children who had been told ‘to help’,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The helper kids were, however, <i>more</i> likely to go on to voluntarily help with an easy task that involved bending down to pick up dropped crayons that they could then use. This was a low-effort task with a high degree of success. Perhaps they were taking advantage of a quick, virtually guaranteed way to restore a little of their dented “helper” image.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also found that children asked to be helpers – and who subsequently chose not to help on either of the more effortful tasks – afterwards gave lower self-evaluations of their helping abilities than children in the “helping” group who had also declined to help with those tasks. This suggests that the helper group were now thinking in a black-and-white way about helper status and helping abilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“These data indicate that categorical language can have detrimental consequences for children’s behaviour, even in non-academic domains and even when the categorical input is not evaluative in content,” the researchers write. (In these studies, no one talked about being a “good helper” and there was no evaluation of this behaviour.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Do these scenarios accurately mirror real life? After the setbacks, the experimenter always responded in a neutral fashion, saying without emotion, “Oh well, I guess I can put those away later”, for instance. A parent or a teacher might respond differently, telling the child not to worry, and pointing out that it was a really tricky task. Might these kinds of encouraging, comforting responses ameliorate or even eradicate the effects of a setback on future helping? Only further research will tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Still, this work does, as the researchers write, “provide an important caveat to previous messages to parents and teachers about how to use language to encourage pro-sociality in early childhood.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>We humans tend to forget we’re wildlife, which is possibly why our planet is heading for climate change catastrophe. We’ve lost connection with Planet Earth and she’s fighting back.</p>
<p>I have come to believe one symptom of our loss of connection the is loss of mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Lifestyle change isn’t simply about preventing or treating disease but is about reconnecting with Planet Earth and to eat, drink, move, sleep and connect with others the way Mother Nature intended.</p>

<hr />
<p>When someone is diagnosed with a mental health disorder such as depression or anxiety, <a href="https://theconversation.com/youve-been-diagnosed-with-depression-now-what-44976">first line treatments</a> usually include psychological therapies and medication. What’s not always discussed are the changeable lifestyle factors that influence our mental health.</p>
<p>Even those who don’t have a mental health condition may still be looking for ways to further improve their mood, reduce stress, and manage their day-to-day mental health.</p>
<p>It can be empowering to make positive life changes. While time restrictions and financial limitations may affect some people’s ability to make such changes, we all have the ability to make small meaningful changes.</p>
<p><em><strong><br />
</strong></em>Here are five lifestyle changes to get you started:</p>
<h2>1. Improve your diet and start moving</h2>
<p>Wholefoods such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, wholegrains, lean red meat and seafood, provide nutrients that are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0237-8">important for optimal brain function</a>. These foods contain magnesium, folate, zinc and essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>Foods rich in polyphenols, such as berries, tea, dark chocolate, wine and certain herbs, also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334236">play an important role in brain function</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of exercise, many types of fitness activities are potentially beneficial – from <a href="https://blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/default-source/factsheets/exercise_depression.pdf">swimming, to jogging, to lifting weights, or playing sports</a>. Even just getting the body moving by taking a brisk walk or doing active housework is a positive step.</p>
<p>Activities which also involve social interaction and exposure to nature can potentially <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22616429">increase mental well-being even further</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21694556">General exercise guidelines</a> recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days during the week (about 150 minutes total over the week). But even short bouts of activity <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23795769">can provide an immediate elevation of mood</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Reduce your vices</h2>
<p>Managing problem-drinking or substance misuse is an obvious health recommendation. People with alcohol and drug problems have a greater likelihood than average of having a mental illness, and have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26277044">far poorer health outcomes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23988010">Some research has shown</a> that a little alcohol consumption (in particular wine) may have beneficial effects on preventing depression. Other recent data, however, has revealed that light alcohol consumption <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2353">does not provide any beneficial effects on brain function</a>.</p>
<p>Stopping smoking is also an important step, as nicotine-addicted people are constantly at the mercy of a withdrawal-craving cycle, which profoundly affects mood. It may take time to address the initial symptoms of stopping nicotine, but the brain chemistry will adapt in time.</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923980/">associated with better mood and reduced anxiety</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Prioritise rest and sleep</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25454674">Sleep hygiene techniques</a> aim to improve sleep quality and help treat insomnia. They including adjusting caffeine use, limiting exposure to the bed (regulating your sleep time and having a limited time to sleep), and making sure you get up at a similar time in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people are genetically wired towards being more of a morning or evening person, so we need to ideally have some flexibility in this regard (especially with work schedules).</p>
<p>It’s also important not to force sleep – if you can’t get to sleep within around 20 minutes, it may be best to get up and focus the mind on an activity (with minimal light and stimulation) until you feel tired.</p>
<p>The other mainstay of better sleep is to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Chronotherapeutics+and+psychiatry%3A+setting+the+clock+to+relieve+the+symptoms">reduce exposure to light</a> – especially blue light from laptops and smartphones – prior to sleep. This will increase the secretion of melatonin, which helps you get to sleep.</p>
<p>Getting enough time for relaxation and leisure activities is <a href="https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/29550608">important for regulating stress</a>. Hobbies can also enhance mental health, particularly if they involve physical activity.</p>
<h2>4. Get a dose of nature</h2>
<p>When the sun is shining, many of us seem to feel happier. Adequate exposure to sunshine <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480364">helps levels of the mood-maintaining chemical</a> serotonin. It also boosts vitamin D levels, which also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26680471">has an effect on mental health</a>, and helps at the appropriate time to regulate our sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>The benefits of sun exposure need to be balanced with the risk of skin cancer, so take into account the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-protect-your-skin-while-getting-enough-vitamin-d-34143">recommendations for sun exposure</a> based on the time of day/year and your skin colour.</p>
<p>You might also consider limiting your exposure to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25242804">environmental toxins</a>, chemicals and pollutants, including “noise” pollution, and <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318230.php">cutting down</a> on your mobile phone, computer and TV use if they’re excessive.</p>
<p>An antidote to this can be simply spending time in nature. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093955">Studies show</a> time in the wilderness can improve self-esteem and mood. In some parts of Asia, spending time in a forest (known as forest bathing) is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28788101">considered a mental health prescription</a>.</p>
<p>A natural extension of spending time in flora is also the positive effect that animals have on us. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27541053">Research suggests</a> having a pet has many positive effects, and animal-assisted therapy (with horses, cats, dogs, and even dolphins) may also boost feelings of well-being.</p>
<h2>5. Reach out when you need help</h2>
<p>Positive lifestyle changes aren’t a replacement for medication or psychological therapy but, rather, as something people can undertake themselves on top of their treatment.</p>
<p>While many lifestyle changes can be positive, some changes (such as avoiding junk foods, alcohol, or giving up smoking) may be challenging if being used as a psychological crutch. They might need to be handled delicately, and with professional support.</p>
<p>Strict advice promoting abstinence, or a demanding diet or exercise regime, may cause added suffering, potentially provoking guilt if you can’t meet these expectations. So go easy on yourself.</p>
<p>That said, take a moment to reflect how you feel mentally after a nutritious wholefood meal, a good night’s sleep (free of alcohol), or a walk in nature with a friend. `</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9737">The Fidgeting Brain</a></h4>

A new review paper in The Neuroscientist highlights the problem of body movements for neuroscience, from blinks to fidgeting.



Authors Patrick J Drew and colleagues of Penn State discuss how many types of movements are associated with widespread brain activation, which can contaminate brain activity recordings. This is true, they say, of both humans and experimental animals such as rodents, e.g. with their 'whisking' movements of the whiskers.

A particular concern is that many movements

According to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/life-sciences/digital-transformation-biopharma.html?id=us:2el:3pr:4di4797:5awa:6di:MMDDYY:&amp;pkid=1005656">recent Deloitte survey,</a> only 20% of biopharma companies are maturing digitally. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One path toward digital transformation involves the use of online R&amp;D marketplaces such as Science Exchange, to improve R&amp;D productivity and organizational efficiency.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lillie, who has experience using Science Exchange at both a large R&amp;D organization and his current smaller company, compared the benefits of applying ecommerce to outsourcing in each case. Science Exchange “delivers two answers to two questions,” said Lillie. “At a large biopharma, Science Exchange turns a 6-month process [of contracting with a provider] into immediate access. At a smaller company, you don’t always </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to expertise within your budget.” Science Exchange enabled that access.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lillie observed that the common problem facing all organizations has been provider identification. It was in the context of a project requiring a labeled antibody that Science Exchange connected OvaScience to LI-COR’s team, and “they did a great job,” said Lillie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lillie’s observations underline that the path to increased R&amp;D productivity is based on increasing connections within the scientific community. At October TechFest, attendees connected not only to create a stronger local network, but also to discuss best practices for using digital solutions for outsourcing and to exchange tips for leveraging innovative technologies.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you’re invited to the next Science Exchange social! </span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just enter your email address at the bottom of our </span><a href="http://www.scienceexchange.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home page.</span></a></p></div>

<p>It’s a question that’s reverberated through the ages – are we humans, though imperfect, essentially kind, sensible, good-natured creatures? Or deep down are we wired to be bad, blinkered, idle, vain, vengeful and selfish? There are no easy answers and there’s clearly a lot of variation between individuals, but this feature post aims to shine some evidence-based light on the matter. Here in the first part of a two-part feature – and deliberately side-stepping the obviously relevant but controversial and already much-discussed <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=milgram">Milgram</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=zimbardo">Zimbardo</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/?s=asch">Asch</a> studies – we digest 10 dispiriting findings that reveal the darker and less impressive aspects of human nature:</p>
<p><span id="more-34925"></span></p>
<p><strong>We view minorities and the vulnerable as less than human</strong><br />
Through history humans have demonstrated a sickening willingness to inflict cruelty on one another. Part of the explanation may be that we have an unfortunate tendency to see certain groups – especially outsiders and vulnerable people perceived as low status – as being less than fully human. One striking example of this “blatant dehumanisation” came from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/11/10/seeing-others-as-less-than-human/">a small brain-scan study</a> that found students exhibited less neural activity associated with thinking about people when they looked at pictures of the homeless or of drug addicts, as compared with higher-status individuals. Many more studies have since demonstrated subtle forms of dehumanisation (in which we attribute fewer mental states to outsiders and minorities) and there have been further demonstrations of blatant dehumanisation – for instance, people who are opposed to Arab immigration or in favour of tougher counter-terrorism policy against Muslim extremists tended to rate Arabs and Muslims as literally <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/07/24/psychologists-reveal-our-blatant-dehumanisation-of-minority-groups/">less evolved</a> than average. Among other examples, there’s also evidence that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08227-001">young people dehumanise older people</a>; and that men and women alike <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0958-9">dehumanise drunk women</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.12539">the inclination to dehumanise starts early</a> – children as young as five view out-group faces (those belonging to people who live in a different city or who are of a different gender than the child) as less human than in-group faces.</p>
<p><strong>We already experience schadenfreude at the age of four</strong><br />
That last finding is particularly dispiriting since we often look to young children to give us hope for humankind – they are seen as the sweet and innocent ones who have yet to be corrupted by the grievances of adulthood. And yet many other studies show that very small kids are capable of some less-than-appealing adult-like emotions. For instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/06/03/kids-experience-schadenfreude-by-age-four-maybe-earlier/">a study from 2013</a> found that even four-year-olds seem to experience modest amounts of Schadenfreude – pleasure at another person’s distress, especially if they perceived the person deserved it (because they’d engaged in a bad deed). A more <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0264-5">recent study</a> found that by age six children will pay to watch an antisocial puppet being hit, rather than spending the money on stickers. Oh, and maybe you should forget the idea of children offering you unconditional kindness – by age three, they are already keeping track of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/12/by-age-3-kids-know-when-you-owe-them-one/">whether you are indebted to them</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We believe in Karma – assuming that the downtrodden of the world must deserve their fate</strong><br />
On a related note, so strong is our inherent need to believe in a just world, we seem to have an inbuilt tendency to perceive the vulnerable and suffering as to some extent deserving their fate (an unfortunate flip-side to the Karmic idea, propagated by most religions, that the cosmos rewards those who do good – a belief that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/11/children-as-young-as-four-believe-in-karma-good-things-happen-to-those-who-do-good/">emerges in children aged just four</a>). The unfortunate consequences of our just-world beliefs were first demonstrated in now <a href="http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf">classic research</a> by Melvin Lerner and Carolyn Simmons. In a version of the Milgram set-up, in which a female learner was punished with electric shocks for wrong answers, women participants subsequently rated her as less likeable and admirable when they heard that they would be seeing her suffer again, and especially if they felt powerless to minimise this suffering. Presumably derogating the woman made them feel less bad about her dismal fate. Since then, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_12">research</a> has shown our willingness to blame the poor, rape victims, AIDS patients and others for their fate, so as to preserve our belief in a just world. By extension, the same or similar processes are likely responsible for <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/09/30/they-deny-it-but-the-middle-classes-have-a-subconscious-positive-bias-toward-the-rich/">our subconscious rose-tinted view of rich people</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We are blinkered and dogmatic</strong><br />
It’s not just that we are malicious and unforgiving, we humans are worryingly close-minded too. If people were rational and open-minded, then the straightforward way to correct someone’s false beliefs would be to present them with some relevant facts. However <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-05421-001">a modern classic published in 1967</a> showed the futility of this approach – participants who believed strongly for or against the death penalty completely ignored facts that undermined their position, actually doubling-down on their initial view. This seems to occur in part because we see opposing facts as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/23/why-is-it-so-hard-to-persuade-people-with-facts/">undermining our sense of identity</a>. It doesn’t help that many of us are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/05/most-of-us-are-overconfident-about-how-much-we-understand-things-this-simple-intervention-can-help/">overconfident about how much we understand things</a>, and that when we believe our opinions are superior to others, this <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/31/people-who-think-their-opinions-are-superior-to-others-are-most-prone-to-overestimating-their-relevant-knowledge-and-ignoring-chances-to-learn-more/">deters us from seeking out further relevant knowledge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We would rather electrocute ourselves than spend time in our own thoughts</strong><br />
Maybe if we spent a little more time in contemplation we would not be so blinkered. Sadly, for many of us, it seems the prospect of spending time in our own thoughts is so anathema we’d actually rather electrocute ourselves. This was demonstrated dramatically in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/03/is-it-the-darkness-within-some-people-would-rather-shock-themselves-with-electricity-than-spend-time-with-their-own-thoughts/">a 2014 study</a> in which 67 per cent of male participants and 25 per cent of female participants opted to give themselves unpleasant electric shocks rather than spend 15 minutes in peaceful contemplation. Although others <a href="http://datacolada.org/25">questioned</a> the interpretation of the results, at least <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178116301524">one other study</a> has shown people’s preference for electrocuting themselves over monotony, and another found <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-35570-001">cross-cultural evidence</a> for people’s greater enjoyment of doing some activity alone rather than merely thinking (also replicated <a href="https://osf.io/qwked/">here</a>). The gist of these findings would seem to back up the verdict of the French philosopher Blaise Pascal who stated that “All of man’s troubles come from his inability to sit quietly in a room by himself”.</p>
<p><strong>We are vain and overconfident</strong><br />
Our irrationality and dogmatism might not be so bad were they married with some humility and self-insight, but actually most of us walk about with inflated views of our abilities and qualities, such as our driving skills, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/24/first-survey-of-its-kind-for-50-years-finds-most-americans-still-think-they-have-above-average-intelligence/">intelligence</a> and attractiveness – a phenomenon that’s been dubbed the Lake Wobegon Effect after the fictional town where “all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average”. Ironically, the least skilled among us are the most prone to over-confidence (the so-called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10626367%20">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>). This vain self-enhancement seems to be most extreme and irrational in the case of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">our morality</a>, such as in how principled and fair we think we are. In fact, even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/02/10/jailed-criminals-think-they-are-kinder-more-trustworthy-and-honest-than-the-average-member-of-the-public/">jailed criminals think they are kinder, more trustworthy and honest than the average member of the public</a>. Our vanity manifests in other ways too: for instance, researchers believe that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-09227-005">our preference for donating to charities that share our initials</a> is a form of “implicit egotism”.</p>
<p><strong>We are moral hypocrites</strong><br />
Not only do we tend to overestimate our own virtuousness, we are also inclined to moral hypocrisy. Findings in this area suggest it may pay to be wary of those who are the quickest and loudest in condemning the moral failings of others – the chances are the moral preacher is as guilty themselves, but of course they happen to take a far lighter view of their own transgressions. In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108000553">one study</a> to show this––suitably titled “The duality of virtue: Deconstructing the moral hypocrite”––researchers found that people rated the exact same selfish behaviour (giving oneself the quicker and easier of two experimental tasks on offer) as far less fair when perpetuated by others, than by themselves. Similarly, there is a long-studied phenomenon known as actor-observer asymmetry, which in part describes <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217711918">our tendency</a> to attribute other people’s bad deeds, such as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01973533.2017.1350578">our partner’s infidelities</a>, to their characters, while attributing the same deeds performed by ourselves as due to situational influences. These self-serving double-standards could even explain the common feeling that incivility is on the increase – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/06/08/your-sense-that-rudeness-is-on-the-increase-is-probably-just-another-self-serving-bias/">recent research</a> showed how we view the same acts of rudeness far more harshly when they are committed by strangers than by our friends or ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>We are all potential trolls</strong><br />
Unfortunately, as anyone who has found themselves in a spat on Twitter will attest, social media may be magnifying some of the worst aspects of human nature, no doubt in part due to the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295">online disinhibition effect</a>, and the fact that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395662">anonymity</a> (easy to achieve online) is known to increase our inclinations for immorality. While research has suggested that people who are prone to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/26/a-laboratory-study-of-everyday-sadism/">everyday sadism</a> (which is a worryingly high proportion of us) are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12393">especially inclined</a> to online trolling, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791909/">a study published last year</a> revealed how being in a bad mood, and being exposed to trolling by others, together double the likelihood of a person engaging in trolling – in fact, these situational factors were a stronger predictor of a person’s trolling behaviour than their individual traits, leading the researchers at Stanford and Cornell to conclude “that ordinary users will also troll when mood and discussion context prompt such behavior”. Of course this implies that initial trolling by a few can cause a snowball of increasing negativity, which is exactly what the researchers found when they studied reader discussion on CNN.com, with the “proportion of flagged posts and proportion of users with flagged posts … rising over time”.</p>
<p><strong>We favour ineffective leaders with psychopathic traits</strong><br />
One way for us to mitigate against our human failings would be if we were inclined to choose leaders with rare virtuousness and skill. Sadly, we seem to have the opposite knack. Consider for a moment President Donald Trump. In seeking to explain his voter appeal, Dan McAdams, a professor of personality psychology, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/09/can-evolutionary-psychology-and-personality-theory-explain-trumps-popular-appeal/">recently concluded</a> that Trump’s overt aggression and insults have a “primal appeal”, and that his “incendiary tweets” are like the “charging displays” of an alpha male chimp, “designed to intimidate”. Trump’s supporters will disagree, but if McAdams’ assessment is true it would fit into a wider pattern – the finding that psychopathic traits are more common than average among leaders. Take <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14999013.2014.951103?journalCode=ufmh20">a survey</a> of financial leaders in New York that found they scored highly on psychopathic traits but lower than average in emotional intelligence. In fairness, there have been some null and contradictory findings on this topic too, but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327039686_Shall_We_Serve_the_Dark_Lords_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_Psychopathy_and_Leadership">a meta-analysis</a> (an overview of prior evidence) published this summer concluded there is indeed a modest but significant link between trait psychopathy and leadership emergence, and that this has practical implications – especially since psychopathy also correlates with poorer leadership performance.</p>
<p><strong>We are sexually attracted to people with dark personality traits </strong><br />
To worsen the situation, not only do we elect people with psychopathic traits to become our leaders, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167213483580">evidence</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/29/how-do-people-with-dark-triad-personality-traits-fare-at-speed-dating/">suggests</a> that men and women are sexually attracted, at least in the short-term, to people displaying the so-called “dark triad” of traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – thus risking further propagating these traits. One <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913012245">study</a> found women’s physical attraction to a man was increased when he was described as having dark traits (as self-interested, manipulative and insensitive) compared with being described in the same way (in terms of his interests and so on), but with reference to the dark traits removed. One theory is that the dark traits successfully communicate “mate quality” in terms of confidence and the willingness to take risks. Does this matter for the future of our species? Perhaps it does – <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513816300010">another paper</a>, from 2016, found that those women who were more strongly attracted to narcissistic men’s faces tended to have more children.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Are we doomed?</strong> One comforting caveat – most of the dating research relevant to that last item was based on European American samples and may not generalise to other cultures (in fact <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518790103">a study out this year</a> found that among Asian Americans, it was those men and women with more pro-social traits who were more successful at speed dating). But then again, there is a lot more depressing research that I could not fit into this article, such as the studies showing we’re <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/03/28/envy-is-a-stronger-motivator-than-admiration/">more motivated by envy than admiration</a>, the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/25/how-do-lying-skill-and-frequency-change-through-life-from-childhood-to-old-age/">shocking prevalence of lying</a> (a habit we start at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/02/21/lying-is-common-at-age-two-becomes-the-norm-by-three/">age two</a>), and the manipulativeness of babies – <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/15/systematic-evidence-of-fake-crying-by-a-baby/">they fake cry you know</a>!</p>
<p>Don’t get too down – these findings say nothing of the success some of our heroes, heroines and saints have had in overcoming their baser instincts. In fact, it is arguably by acknowledging and understanding our shortcomings that we can more successfully overcome them and so cultivate the better angels of our nature. On which note, remember to hang tight for the sequel to this post that will detail 10 findings showcasing the brighter, more uplifting aspects of humankind.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/multimedia-140x110.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As a result of smartphones, tablets, and other devices being entrenched in our lives, our attention is in high demand as we switch between multiple devices, a behavior known as <em>media multitasking</em>. Indeed, we may find ourselves mindlessly scrolling through our Twitter feed on our phone and then suddenly checking our email on our tablet. Because this behavior is new for our species, the impact of media multitasking on how we perceive and interact with the world and those around us is not well known.</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that frequent media multitasking is linked to altered cognitive processing, whereby irrelevant stimuli exert a disproportionately strong “pull” and negatively impact performance on various cognitive tasks. This led us to wonder whether regular media multitaskers might also incorporate irrelevant stimuli when thinking about other people, specifically when making impressions and judgments about another person whom they never had met before.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10583 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/breakfast-brunch-cell-phone-693269-300x200.jpg" width="300" />We hypothesized that in general, participants would use relevant information during impression formation, but that those who reported more frequent media multitasking would also, unwittingly, use irrelevant and extraneous stimuli in the environment that would affect their impressions of the other person.</p>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we randomly assigned participants to watch one of two versions of a video in which a previously unknown person – allegedly a peer but actually a confederate – talked informally about their day while sitting in their (presumed) dorm room.</p>
<p>In one version of the video, the room was clean and organized, with various items neatly arranged and the floor clear of clutter. In another version of the video the room was generally messy and in disarray, with clothes and other personal effects strewn about the bed and floor. These neat/messy cues in the video served as potentially relevant information when forming an impression of the person (e.g., the person is tidy, or messy/disorganized).</p>
<p>Next, we randomly assigned participants to complete the experiment in a testing room that was <em>actually</em> neat or messy. We reasoned that the neat/messy cues in the testing room would be incidental and irrelevant, thus having no bearing on participants’ impressions of the person they saw in the video. In addition to experimentally manipulating both relevant and irrelevant cues, we measured participants’ tendencies to engage in media multitasking behaviors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10582" style="width: 553px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10582" height="293" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/media-multitasker-300x162.png" width="543" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The two video conditions and the two testing room conditions that participants experienced</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Replicating previous work by <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-823379.pdf">Samuel Gosling and others</a>, we found that participants did incorporate relevant cues from the video when forming their impressions of the unknown person; those participants assigned to view the messy version of the video gave lower ratings of the person’s conscientiousness compared to participants who viewed the clean version of the video.</p>
<blockquote><p>…media multitasking may in fact be associated with altered person perception in unexpected and unintended ways, with frequent media multitaskers unknowingly taking in otherwise irrelevant information from their environment when they perceive other people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, consistent with our hypothesis, we observed a significant interaction between the testing room condition (featuring irrelevant cues) and media multitasking, such that frequent media multitaskers assigned to complete the experiment in the messy testing room gave <em>lower</em> conscientiousness ratings, relative to ratings given in the neat testing room. There was no such pattern observed for participants who reported average or infrequent levels of media multitasking.</p>
<p>From these results, we concluded that media multitasking may in fact be associated with altered person perception in unexpected and unintended ways, with frequent media multitaskers unknowingly taking in otherwise irrelevant information from their environment when they perceive other people. If this is true, then perhaps this process is also at play in other domains, such as encountering environmental cues that elicit eating behaviors or various emotions.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats that are worth mentioning that we hope will inform future research. First, the generalizability of these findings is only limited to the college-aged population. It is not clear whether these effects would also be observed in other age groups. Additionally, we did not manipulate participants’ media multitasking behaviors directly, so a strong causal link between media multitasking and person perception cannot be made. However, future work may be able to identify preceding factors that put people at higher or lower risk of becoming frequent media multitaskers in the first place.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Disney film <em>Aladdin</em>, our hero’s love rival, the evil Jafar, discovers Aladdin’s secret identity and steals his magic lamp. Jafar’s wish to become the world’s most powerful sorcerer is soon granted and he then uses his powers to banish Aladdin to the ends of the Earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What follows next is a lingering, close-up of Jafar’s body. He leans forward, fists clenched, with an almost constipated look on his face. He then explodes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrbKkCp43Ek">in uncontrollable cackles</a> that echo across the landscape. For many millennials growing up in the 1990s, it is an archetypical evil laugh.</p>
<p>Such overt displays of delight at others’ misfortune are found universally in kids’ films, and many adult thriller and horror films too. Just think of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnfDXznMf0E">rapturous guffaws of the alien in the first Predator</a> film as it is about to self-detonate, taking Arnold Schwarzenegger with it. Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMxHBfPQgtE">Jack Nicholson’s chilling snicker in The Shining</a>. Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5lXmds468Q">Wario’s manic crowing</a> whenever Mario was defeated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jpcu.12728">recent essay</a> by Jens Kjeldgaard-Christiansen in the <i>Journal of Popular Culture</i> asks what the psychology behind this might be. Kjeldgaard-Christiansen is well placed to provide an answer having previously used evolutionary psychology to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/12/02/can-evolutionary-psychology-explain-why-we-love-to-hate-evil-villains/">explain</a> the behaviours of heroes and villains in fiction more generally.</p>
<p><span id="more-34900"></span></p>
<p>In that work, he argued that one of the core traits a villain should show is a low “welfare trade-off” ratio: they are free-riders who cheat and steal, taking from their community while contributing nothing. Such behaviour is undesirable for societies today, but it would have been even more of a disaster in prehistory when the group’s very survival depended on everyone pulling their weight. As a result, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen argues we are wired to be particularly disgusted by cheating free-riders – to the point that we may even feel justified in removing them from the group, or even killing them.</p>
<p>However, there are degrees of villainy and the most dangerous and despised people are those who are not only free riders and cheats, but psychopathic sadists, who perform callous acts for sheer pleasure. Sure enough, previous <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277282">studies</a> have shown that it is people matching this description whom we consider to be truly evil (since there is no other way to excuse or explain their immorality) and therefore deserving of the harshest punishments. Crucially, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen argues that a wicked laugh offers one of the clearest signs that a villain harbours such evil, gaining “open and candid enjoyment” from others’ suffering – moreover, fiction writers know this intuitively, time and again using the malevolent cackle to identify their darkest characters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Part of the power of the evil laugh comes from its salience, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen says: it is both highly visual and vocal (as the close up of Jafar beautifully demonstrates) and the staccato rhythm can be particularly piercing. What’s more, laughs are hard to fake: a genuine, involuntary laugh relies on the rapid oscillation of the “intrinsic laryngeal muscles”, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109051381400035X">movements that appear to be difficult to produce by our own volition without sounding artificial</a>. As a result, it’s generally a reliable social signal of someone’s reaction to an event, meaning that we fully trust what we are hearing. Unlike dialog – even the kind found in a children’s film – a sadistic or malevolent laugh leaves little room for ambiguity, so there can be little doubt about the villain’s true motives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Such laughs are also particularly chilling because they run counter to the usual pro-social function of laughter – the way it arises spontaneously during friendly chats, for example, serving to cement social bonds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are practical reasons too for the ubiquity of the evil laugh in children’s animations and early video games, Kjeldgaard-Christiansen explains. The crude graphics of the first Super Mario or Kung Fu games for Nintendo, say, meant it was very hard to evoke an emotional response in the player – but equipping the villain with an evil laugh helped to create some kind of moral conflict between good and evil that motivated the player to don their cape and beat the bad guys. “This is the only communicative gesture afforded to these vaguely anthropomorphic, pixelated opponents, and it does the job,” he notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are limits to the utility of the evil laugh in story-telling, though. Kjeldgaard-Christiansen admits that its crude power would be destructive in more complex story-telling, since the display of pleasure at others’ expense would prevent viewers from looking for more subtle motivations or the role of context and circumstance in a character’s behaviour. But for stories dealing with black and white morality, such as those aimed at younger viewers who have not yet developed a nuanced understanding of the world, its potential to thrill is second to none.</p>
<p>Kjeldgaard-Christiansen’s article is certainly one of the most entertaining papers I have read in a long time [get open access <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jpcu.12728?author_access_token=-Q9Xpc2ySNfbe7EcTn4-Nota6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC65QVwe4VU8zu_SAT2vofYF2N2AKSf5i3dD0x8maYjswLfFq_8d5GVijCpBh2MulhWLBavm0wTmezrPrjVadLHLc">here</a>], and his psychological theories continue to be thought provoking. It would be fun to see more experimental research on this subject – comparing the acoustic properties of laughs, for instance, to find out which sounds the most evil. But in my mind, it will always be Jafar’s.</p>

If successful, however, Plan S could have a dramatic impact on both publishers and researchers. For instance, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">reported</a></span> <i>Nature</i>, as written the 10 principles could see European researchers barred from publishing in 85% of journals, including influential titles such as <i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The ‘S’ in Plan S can stand for ‘science, speed, solution, shock’, Smits <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">told</a></span> <i>Nature</i>. Shock would certainly seem to be an appropriate word, and shock was surely what publishers felt when Plan S was announced. After all, they have successfully managed to delay and subvert open access for some 25 years now. They perhaps assumed they could continue doing so. But if successful, Plan S could bring this dilly-dallying to a dramatic end. Alternatively, Plan S could fail to achieve its objectives. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>That publishers do not like Plan S is, of course, no surprise. That was doubtless what the architects of the initiative anticipated. What they perhaps did not anticipate was that they would face pushback from researchers. Yet just a week after the announcement nine researchers published a critical article entitled, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><i><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2018/09/11/response-to-plan-s-from-academic-researchers-unethical-too-risky/">A Response to Plan-S from Academic Researchers: Unethical, Too Risky!</a></i></span> This appears to have shocked the Plan S architects as thoroughly as their plan must have shocked publishers. Smits immediately summoned two of the authors to Brussels, and Schiltz took to Twitter to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://twitter.com/marcschiltz1/status/1041806272042098689">suggest</a></span> that the article was “slanderous”. [See <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/10/it-is-for-publishers-to-provide-plan-s.html?showComment=1539208540398#c285038190704286201">comment below</a> for more on this].</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Since then there has been a torrent of commentary and critique of Plan S, and the initiative is proving uncomfortably divisive. While publishers (and at least some researchers) are appalled by Plan S, open access advocates, as could be expected, have welcomed the initiative.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Disappointed</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The problem right now, however, is that there is too little information on how Plan S would work in practice. This means it is nigh impossible for informed commentary to take place, and we are seeing frequent calls for clarification. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>On 12<sup>th</sup> September, therefore, I invited Smits to do an interview with me, in the hope that he could provide that clarification. I suggested we do this either by telephone or email. Smits agreed and said he would prefer to do it by email. So, I emailed him a list of questions and waited for his replies. These arrived on Monday this week.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I have to confess to being disappointed on reading them. From my perspective, they do not provide the clarification I was hoping they would. I accept that my questions are long and somewhat sceptical (some might say tendentious) but, as I saw it, they offered Smits a chance to dispel some of the confusion around Plan S and to demonstrate that my scepticism is misplaced. I didn’t feel he did either.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>When I shared my disappointment with Smits he expressed surprise and replied, “I looked once more to the replies I sent to your questions and remain of the opinion that they address the issues you put forward.” He added that he is getting over 300 emails a day and tries to reply to each one – signalling that time is in short supply for him.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>I am, of course, entirely sympathetic to the challenge Smits faces with Plan S, and the huge demand it must be making on his time. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of confusion out there, and on reading his replies I could not help but feel he had missed an opportunity to clarify matters. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This seemed the more striking given his assurance to me that, “my door is open to anyone who wants to drop by to discuss Open Access and Plan S”. He added that he prefers a ‘face to face’ approach to using email. Perhaps it might have helped, I thought, if he had taken up my offer of a telephone interview – or even a face to face on Skype.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Meat in the sandwich</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>But maybe I was missing the point. What we learn from what Smits says below perhaps is something that had not occurred to me, and perhaps has not occurred to the many commentators on social media calling for clarification. In two of his answers, Smits indicates that the ball is now in the publishers’ court. As he puts it the first time he says it, “We expect publishers to come forward with offerings which comply with the principles outlined in Plan S”. Later he says, “It is for publishers to provide Plan S-compliant routes to publication in their journals so that researchers can choose where to publish when accepting funding from those who sign Plan S.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>This would seem to imply that Smits and the members of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/">cOAlition S</a></span> (the group of funders who have signed up to Plan S) are not currently especially concerned about the details of how the 10 principles will be implemented, just that they will be implemented. In other words, cOAlition S is saying to publishers: “These are the conditions that we plan to insist on when funding research in Europe from 2020. So long as you can meet these conditions the details of how you do so are not of great interest to us right now. It is for you publishers to tell us how <i>you</i> plan to implement the principles.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Presumably, it is only after publishers have done this that cOAlition S expects to publish the implementation plan that Smits talks about below. And while he says he is happy to discuss Plan S with “all interested groups”, Smits insists that cOAlition S will “stand by the principles set out in Plan S”. We might wonder what benefit there is in discussions if cOAlition S is immoveable on the 10 principles. And in the meantime, of course, researchers can expect to face a great deal of uncertainty.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>That said, at first blush, this might seem like a good approach. In fact, I have myself on a number of occasions argued that publishers should not be treated as stakeholders, but as service providers. As such, the research community should be telling them what services it would like them to provide, and then inviting them to quote for providing them. Only if the conditions and the price are acceptable should the research community then proceed to contract any particular publisher to provide the service tendered for. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The problem with the way in which Plan S seems intent on doing this, however, is two-fold. First, regardless of the talk of (unspecified) APC caps, it is not clear how these can be effectively applied – particularly if the rest of the world does not follow Europe’s example. As a result, the research community may find it has to shell out even more money for publishers’ services, regardless of any caps. And what happens if publishers decide not to engage with Plan S in any meaningful way? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Second (and more importantly), it could be argued that European funders are not part of the research community. They are its paymasters. And in the neoliberal environment in which universities now have to operate, researchers’ interests are not fully aligned with those of research funders. This means that in its battle with publishers, cOAlition S may end up punishing European researchers as, or more, brutally than it punishes the real target – publishers. Researchers will be the meat in the sandwich of Plan S, collateral damage in a war that the vast majority of them never signed up to, or wanted to see take place. There are also very real concerns that Plan S will wreak havoc on learned societies. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It is for these reasons, I believe, that in opposing Plan S researchers often do so in terms of a threat to academic freedom.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>That OA advocates tend to ridicule and deride those who fret over academic freedom suggests to me that they have become so focused on the <i>ends</i> of OA that they are blind to the damage that the <i>means </i>might inflict on their peers, and on many societies.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Highly unlikely</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Finally, I want to answer one of the questions that Smits puts back to me below. He asks, “Why do you keep on saying that Plan S is about Gold Open Access? Do read the 10 principles again and you will notice that the plan does not use Gold or Green terminology. The plan welcomes self-archiving and repositories.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>My answer is this: It doesn’t matter whether the terms Green or Gold are used. Principle 1 of Plan S states, “Authors [must] retain copyright of their publication with no restrictions. All publications must be published under an open license, preferably the Creative Commons Attribution Licence CC BY.” And cOAlition S insists that this applies to both gold and green OA, and in all cases OA must be immediate.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>It seems highly unlikely to me that for-profit legacy publishers will offer green OA on those terms. Instead, they will focus on gold OA and seek to extract as much money as possible from the research community, caps or no caps, even as many non-profit learned societies face an existential financial threat.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Importantly, as Peter Suber has <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/iGEFpdYY9dr">pointed out</a></span>, there is no acknowledgement in Plan S that repositories can provide OA.

(At the time you were Director-General for Research and Innovation at the EU). This called for “immediate” open access to all scientific papers by 2020. But by the end of 2017 it was clear that this goal was not going to be achieved unless more drastic action was taken, not least because the Amsterdam Call offered no specific strategy for achieving OA by 2020. Earlier this year, therefore, you were appointed Special Adviser on Open Access and Innovation and charged with making sure it happened. Plan S is your solution and it consists of 10 principles, the key one being that “After 1 January 2020 scientific publications on the results from research funded by public grants provided by national and European research councils and funding bodies, must be published in compliant Open Access Journals or on compliant Open Access Platforms.” In fact, Plan S is a list of principles, not a detailed action plan. That is, it is not a mandate but what OA advocate Peter Suber <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/iGEFpdYY9dr">describes as</a></span> “a plan for a mandate”.

This is the same mistake made by the Finch Group in 2012, which was inexcusable even at the time, and should never be repeated by informed, high-level policy-makers.” I assume, however, that the reality is that green OA inevitably conflicts with the principles of Plan S, which calls, amongst other things, for papers to be made OA “immediately” and with a CC BY licence attached. I cannot envisage many legacy publishers agreeing to this. So I guess the point is that if green OA cannot conform to the principles of Plan S then it cannot be viewed as providing open access, and that is presumably why Plan S does not view it as such.

The DFG, for instance, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/announcements_proposals/info_wissenschaft_18_56/index.html">says</a></span> that “it surmises that open access mandates can lead to increased article processing charges (APC), an effect that the DFG strives to minimise.” I understand Plan S envisages APCs being capped, but what in your view is a reasonable APC? And how would a cap work in practice?

Another concern raised by Suber is that this does not include a commitment to creating and supporting open infrastructure. I.e., he says, “platforms running on open-source software, under open standards, with open APIs for interoperability, preferably owned or hosted by non-profit organizations.” As such, Suber says, Plan S, will not prevent open infrastructure being appropriated by legacy publishers in the way that SSRN and bepress were acquired. As you will know, a number of funders (Wellcome, Gates etc.) have created their own publishing platforms but outsourced fulfilment to the for-profit company F1000. The F1000 platform, I believe, is a proprietary, and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-oa-interviews-ashley-farley-of.html">details of what it charges funders are secret</a></span>, which does not seem to fit with the ethos of open science. The EU also plans to create its own publishing platform. I wonder, therefore, if the reference to platforms and OA infrastructures in Plan S is essentially a reference to the planned EU Open Research Publishing Platform?

Unless they do, for instance, Europe will find it is having to pay for gold OA plus continue to pay subscriptions in order to access the research produced in countries that do not sign up.
