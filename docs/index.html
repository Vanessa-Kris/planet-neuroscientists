              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/room-temperature-superconductor-retraction-physics">Despite a retraction, a room-temperature superconductor claim isn’t dead yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>It may be too soon to mourn the demise of a room-temperature superconductivity claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On September 26, the journal <em>Nature</em> retracted a paper describing a material that seemed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-first-room-temperature-superconductor-discovery">to turn into a superconductor at a cozy 15° Celsius</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/20)</em>. The notice rattled many people in the field. But a new experiment performed just days after the retraction supports the world-record temperature claim, say an eyewitness and others familiar with the experiment.</p>



<p>Superconductors carry electricity with no resistance, which means they’re useful for efficiently transmitting energy. They could save enormous amounts of energy that’s wasted in conventional metal wires. Currently they are used to create powerful magnetic fields for medical imaging and particle physics experiments, as well as serving as components in high-performance circuity and even levitating high-speed trains. But to work, superconducting materials generally must be cooled far below 0° C, and many to temperatures close to absolute zero, or -273° C.</p>





<p>When researchers announced in 2020 that a sample made of hydrogen, sulfur and a bit of carbon <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2801-z">became a superconductor at record-shattering temperatures</a>, dreams of room-temperature superconducting seemed to be on the verge of coming true. One hitch was that the material had to be under enormous pressures, about 2.6 million times atmospheric pressures — roughly the pressure found in parts of Earth’s core. Still, the discovery hailed a potential scientific and technological revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the two years since, controversy has swirled around the report. The maelstrom is centered on the way the researchers prepared and processed data that showed changes in a magnetic property known as susceptibility. Ultimately, editors at <em>Nature </em>took the unusual step of retracting the paper despite the researchers’ objections.&nbsp;“We have now established that some key data processing steps … used a non-standard, user-defined procedure,” write the editors at <em>Nature</em> in the retraction. “The details of the procedure were not specified in the paper and the validity of the background subtraction has subsequently been called into question.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new experiment isn’t a duplicate of the one reported in the retracted paper, but the researchers replicated a portion of their research that raised red flags in the scientific community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ranga Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester who headed the research on the now-retracted paper, led the new measurements at Argonne National Laboratory’s Advanced Photon Source in Lemont, Ill. “We have been working on this experiment for almost six months, building and reconfirming the correct methodology,” Dias says. “I would say the data we obtained at Argonne is more compelling, not just comparable,” to the data in the retracted <em>Nature</em> paper.</p>



<p>“The experiment took place over two days, September 27 and 28,” says physicist Nilesh Salke of the University of Illinois Chicago, who was not affiliated with the original research. Salke’s role at Argonne involved probing a sample of the material in question with X-rays while it was exhibiting magnetic susceptibility associated with high-temperature superconductivity. “We saw the first susceptibility signal on September 27, consistent with the claims reported in the retracted <em>Nature </em>paper.”</p>



<p>This latest twist is unlikely to put an end to the controversy that came with the initial claim, at least in the mind of physicist Jorge Hirsch of the University of California, San Diego. Hirsch has been one of the most vocal critics of the room-temperature superconductivity claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t know it would be retracted, but was hoping it would be retracted,” says Hirsch, who was not affiliated with either the original or new experiment. He says he asked the authors for the raw data from the earlier study one month after it was published, but he was refused. “The authors said, ‘No we cannot give you the data because our lawyers said that it would affect our patent rights.’”</p>



<p>With intervention from <em>Nature</em>, Hirsch eventually got the numbers. What he saw disturbed him. Hirsch is skeptical that high-temperature superconductivity is possible in these sorts of hydrogen-based materials in general, but says he is objecting based on the way the data were handled.</p>



<p>“There were real problems between the raw data and the published data,” Hirsch says. He believes that <em>Nature</em>’s retraction doesn’t go far enough. “It’s not that the data were not properly processed.” Along with physicist Dirk van der Marel of the University of Geneva, Hirsch <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217979223750012">delves into problems with the data</a> in a paper published September 15 in the <em>International Journal of Modern Physics B</em>. “Our analysis proves mathematically that the raw data were not measured in the laboratory. They were fabricated.”</p>



<p>Dias and colleagues deny any impropriety in their data or analysis and are moving forward with experiments like the one at Argonne. But that work awaits peer review. For now, <em>Nature</em>’s retraction bolsters existing doubts around room-temperature superconductivity.</p>



<p>“In the end, all of this has to be validated by different groups getting the answer,” Hirsch says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-lake-color-blue-green-brown">Climate change could turn some blue lakes to green or brown</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some picturesque blue lakes may not be so blue in the future, thanks to climate change.</p>



<p>In the first global tally of lake color, researchers estimate that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL098925">roughly one-third of Earth’s lakes are blue</a>. But, should average summer air temperatures rise by a few degrees, some of those crystal waters could turn a murky green or brown, the team reports in the Sept. 28 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>The changing hues could alter how people use those waters and offer clues about the stability of lake ecosystems. Lake color depends in part on what’s in the water, but factors such as water depth and surrounding land use also matter. Compared with blue lakes, green or brown lakes have more algae, sediment and organic matter, says Xiao Yang, a hydrologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</p>





<p>Yang and colleagues used satellite photos from 2013 to 2020 to analyze the color of more than 85,000 lakes around the world. Because storms and seasons can temporarily affect a lake’s color, the researchers focused on the most frequent color observed for each lake over the seven-year period. The researchers also created <a href="https://eeproject.users.earthengine.app/view/cool#band=lake%20level;lat=41.53115887186855;lon=-103.06380427821199;zoom=4;">an interactive online map</a> that can be used to explore the colors of these lakes.</p>



<p>The approach is “super cool,” says Dina Leech, an aquatic ecologist at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., who was not involved with the study. These satellite data are “just so powerful.”</p>



<p>The scientists then looked at local climates during that time to see how they may be linked to lake color around the world. For many small or remote water bodies, records of temperature and precipitation don’t exist. Instead, the researchers also relied on climate “hindcasts” calculated for every spot on the globe, which are pieced together from relatively sparse records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lakes in places with average summer air temperatures that were below 19° Celsius were more likely to be blue than lakes with warmer summers, the researchers found. But up to 14 percent of the blue lakes they studied are near that threshold. If average summer temperatures increase another 3 degrees Celsius — an amount that scientists think <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">is plausible by the end of the century</a> — those 3,800 lakes could turn green or brown (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). That’s because warmer water helps algae bloom more, which changes the properties of the water, giving it a green-brown tint, Yang says.</p>



<p>Extrapolating beyond this sample of lakes is a bit tricky. “We don&#8217;t even know how many lakes there are in the world,” says study coauthor Catherine O’Reilly, an aquatic ecologist at Illinois State University in Normal. Many lakes are too small to reliably detect via satellite, but by some estimates, tens of thousands of larger lakes could lose their blue hue.</p>



<p>If some lakes do become less blue, people will probably lose some of the resources they have come to value, O’Reilly says. Lakes are often used for drinking water, food or recreation. If the water is more clogged with algae, it could be unappealing for play or more costly to clean for drinking.</p>



<p>But the color changes wouldn’t necessarily mean that the lakes are any less healthy. “[Humans] don&#8217;t value lots of algae in a lake, but if you&#8217;re a certain type of fish species, you might be like ‘this is great,’” O’Reilly says.</p>



<p>Lake color can hint at the stability of a lake’s ecosystem, with shifting shades indicating changing conditions for the critters living in the water. One benefit of the new study is that it gives scientists a baseline for assessing how climate change is affecting Earth’s freshwater resources. Continued monitoring of lakes could help scientists detect future changes.</p>



<p>“[The study] sets a marker that we can compare future results to,” says Mike Pace, an aquatic ecologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who was not involved with the study. “That’s, to me, the great power of this study.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-svante-paabo-human-evolution-neandertal-genetics">Genetics of human evolution wins 2022 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Establishing a new field of science to answer the question of what makes humans unique from our extinct relatives has earned Svante Pääbo the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Humanity has always been intrigued by its origins. Where did we come from and how are we related to those who came before us? What makes us different from hominins that went extinct?” said Anna Wedell, a member of the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm that announced the prize on October 3.</p>





<p>Before Pääbo’s work, archaeologists and paleontologists studied bones and artifacts to learn about human evolution. But the surface study of those relics couldn’t answer some fundamental questions about the genetic changes that led humans to thrive while other ancient hominids went extinct.&nbsp; Pääbo, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, worked out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-gene-yield-new-methods-retrieve-neandertals-dna">a way to extract and analyze DNA from ancient bones</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/06</em>). That led to uncovering small genetic differences between humans and extinct human relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting DNA from ancient bones was once considered impossible, says Leslie Vosshall, a neuroscientist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, who is the vice president and chief scientific officer at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&nbsp; DNA breaks down over time, so many scientists thought that there would be none remaining in fossils tens of thousands of years old. Not to mention that DNA from bacteria and other microbes and from living people contaminate the ancient genetic material. Yet Pääbo managed to stitch together tiny fragments of Neandertal DNA into readable sequences. He started with DNA from mitochondria, the energy-generating organelles inside cells. Then, he assembled a complete genetic instruction book, or genome, for a Neandertal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years Vosshall watched as Pääbo presented snippets of DNA from old bones at scientific meetings. “Nobody believed him. Everyone thought it was contamination or broken stuff” from living people. “Just the mere fact that he did it was so improbable. That he was able to get the complete genome sequence of a Neandertal was viewed, even up until he did it, as an absolutely impossible feat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On a technical basis, the prize is also richly deserved,” she says.</p>



<p>Noted Nils-Göran Larsson, vice chairman of the Nobel committee: “This is a very fundamental, big discovery&#8230; Over the years to come, [this] will give huge insights into human physiology.”</p>



<p>Pääbo’s work established the field of paleogenomics. “He always pushed the frontiers of evolutionary anthropology,” says Ludovic Orlando, a molecular archaeologist at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France.</p>



<p>Pääbo said that when he got the news of his win, he thought at first it was an “elaborate prank” by the people in his research group, but soon realized it was the real deal. &#8220;The thing that is amazing to me is that we now have some ability to go back in time and actually follow genetic history and genetic changes over time,&#8221; he said in a news conference several hours after the prize was announced.</p>



<p>Pääbo and colleagues have made surprising discoveries about human evolution from studying ancient DNA. For instance, they learned that humans and our extinct cousins, Neandertals, had children together. That<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-genome-yields-evidence-interbreeding-humans"> discovery came as a shock</a> to even people who had been looking for signs of interbreeding (<em>SN: 5/6/10</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-dna-european-asian-ancestry">Evidence of that mixing</a> can still be found in many humans today (<em>SN: 10/10/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pääbo’s study of a finger bone revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-unveils-enigmatic-denisovans">a previously undiscovered extinct human relative called Denisovans</a> (<em>SN: 8/30/12</em>). Like Neandertals, Denisovans interbred with humans.</p>



<p>DNA passed down from those extinct ancestors has influenced human health and physiology for better or worse. For instance, genetic variants inherited from Denisovans helped humans<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tibetans-live-high-life-thanks-extinct-human-relatives"> adapt to high altitude</a> in Tibet (<em>SN: 7/2/14</em>). But some Neandertal DNA has been linked to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-dna-may-raise-risk-some-modern-human-diseases">higher risk of developing some diseases</a>, including severe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-neandertal-genes-risk-severe-infection">COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/16; SN: 10/2/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>His work has also delved into tiny genetic changes that may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-tweaks-built-humans-bigger-brains">influenced the evolution of the human brain</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/15</em>). Other researchers have also applied techniques Pääbo developed to study <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">evolution and domestication of animals</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>), and to learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/human-evolution-origins-fossils-paleoanthropology">how ancient humans moved around the world</a>.</p>



<p>“He’s a singular scientist,” Vosshall says.</p>



<p>He’s not the only one in his family to win a Nobel Prize, though. Pääbo’s father, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobel-prize-medicine-prostaglandin-discoveries">Sune Bergström, shared the medicine Nobel Prize </a>in 1982 (<em>SN: 10/16/82</em>).</p>



<p>Pääbo will take home prize money of 10 million Swedish kronor, roughly $895,000 as of October 3.</p>

The French neurologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Cotard" target="_blank">Jules Cotard</a> first described the syndrome that bears his name (1882, <a href="https://www-histoiredelafolie-fr.translate.goog/psychiatrie-neurologie/du-delire-de-negation-par-jules-cotard-1882?_x_tr_sch=http&amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank">English translation</a>):</p><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"></span></span></p><blockquote>I hazard the name of <i>delirium of negations</i> to designate the state of the patients ... in whom the negative disposition is carried to the highest degree. [They are] asked their name – they have no name; their age – they are ageless; where were they born – they were not born; ... if they have a headache, stomach ache, pain in some part of their body – they have no head, no stomach, some even have no body... For some the negation is universal, nothing exists anymore, they themselves are nothing.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cotard presented the case of Miss X, a 43 year old woman with severe “melancholic anxiety” who tried to end her own life (1880, <a href="https://www-histoiredelafolie-fr.translate.goog/psychiatrie-neurologie/du-delire-hypochondriaque-dans-une-forme-grave-de-la-melancolie-anxieuse-delire-de-negation-par-jules-cotard-1880?_x_tr_sch=http&amp;_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc" target="_blank">English translation</a>):</p><p></p><blockquote>...She affirms that she has neither brain nor nerves, nor chest, nor stomach, nor intestines; all that remains is the <i>skin and bones of the body, disorganized</i> (these are [her] own expressions). This delirium of negation extends even to the metaphysical ideas which were formerly the object of [her] firmest beliefs; She doesn't have a soul, God doesn't exist, neither does the devil. Miss X… being no more than a disorganized body, does not need to eat to live, she cannot die a natural death, she will exist eternally unless she is burned, fire being the only end...</blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>Cotard delusion has been observed in a wide variety of psychiatric and neurological conditions, including psychotic depression, schizophrenia, encephalitis, subdural hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, migraine, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and epilepsy (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mila.12441">Gerrans, 2022</a>). From a neurobiological perspective, it's nearly impossible to construct a unified theory of the dysfunctional brain systems that underlie the delusion. Hence, some studies have focused on patients who manifest Cotard delusion after stroke, brain injury, or <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.12658" target="_blank" title="condition caused by autoantibodies that target NMDA receptors in the brain">anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis</a> for clues on potential brain regions that may be implicated in these cases.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two new papers describe the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization" target="_blank">depersonalization</a> <span><span>—</span></span> an estrangement from one's body or self <span><span>—</span></span> in Cotard delusion (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546805.2022.2119839" target="_blank">Davies &amp; Coltheart, 2022</a>; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mila.12441" target="_blank">Gerrans, 2022</a>).</p><p><i><br /></i></p><p style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-family: verdana;">Absence disembodies — so does Death<br />Hiding individuals from the Earth<br />Superposition helps, as well as love —<br />Tenderness decreases as we prove —</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">– <a href="https://allpoetry.com/Absence-disembodies--so-does-Death" target="_blank">Emily Dickinson </a></span><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phantoms-Brain-Probing-Mysteries-Human/dp/0688152473" target="_blank">prominent account</a> of Cotard holds that people suffering from the <i>delirium of negation</i> are completely devoid of emotional responses. The nihilistic delusion is an attempt to make sense of this anomalous experience. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546805.2022.2119839" target="_blank">Davies and Coltheart (2022)</a> are critical of this view because there's no evidence that emotional reactivity is abolished in Cotard delusion. They also cite 12 case reports of patients who show a variety of affective states that collectively encompass anxiety, fear, guilt, distress, paranoia, aggression, agitation, anguish, despair, euphoria, grandiosity, irritability, sadness, and worry.<br /><br />An alternate account places the anomalous experiences of depersonalization and derealization, rather than lack of emotion, as the central “surprising events” that trigger nihilistic delusions (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mila.12110" target="_blank">Billon, 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546805.2022.2119839" target="_blank">Davies &amp; Coltheart, 2022</a>). These patients describe phenomena such as “I feel myself detached from my own body” and “feelings of unreality and difficulties in deciding whether events ... were real or just imagined”. The injured brain areas in these patients included insular cortex and right temporal-parietal regions.<br /><br /></p><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">A Death blow is a Life blow to Some<br />Who till they died, did not alive become —<br />Who had they lived, had died but when<br />They died, Vitality begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">– <a href="https://allpoetry.com/A-Death-blow-is-a-Life-blow-to-Some" target="_blank">Emily Dickinson</a></span></p><br /><p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546805.2022.2119839" target="_blank">Gerrans (2022)</a> proposes that depersonalization and Cotard delusion result from <i>different</i> ruptures in the sense of self. He provides an extensive and accessible review of the <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(13)00211-8" target="_blank">interoceptive active inference model</a> and predictive coding of bodily states in the anterior insula cortex. Depersonalization may arise from imprecise interoceptive predictions, but reality testing remains intact. On the other hand, Cotard delusion represents a complete rupture from reality.</p><blockquote>Within this framework, depersonalisation experience involves a selective failure to annex a class of experience to a largely intact hierarchical self-model. The Cotard delusion is a result of the destruction or degradation of that model. It is consistent with this view that there can be overlap between symptoms of depersonalisation disorder and Cotard syndrome, especially while the delusion develops because of nature of self-modelling. However the delusion reports the experience of human life without an intact regulatory self-model whereas in depersonalisation the self-model is largely intact.</blockquote><p><br /></p><p>A key component of the “depersonalization first, Cotard second” view should account for <i>why</i> the former is relatively common, while the latter is quite rare.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p><p></p><p><b>References</b></p><div class="gs_citr" tabindex="0"><div class="gs_citr" tabindex="0">Billon, A.

<p><strong>Before Pangaea — What? </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/pangaea-what"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 30, 1972</p>



<p>The continents as we know them resulted when the proto­continent Pangaea broke apart and its fragments made the long slow journey to their present positions. The process took about 200&nbsp;m­illion years. But the Earth’s crust is an estimated 4.5 billion years old.… [Scientists are exploring] the perplexing p­roblem of what went on during the billions of years before Pangaea went to pieces.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The continents have an on-again, off-again relationship that has existed since well before Pangaea, fossil and rock evidence shows. Most scientists agree that the earliest known supercontinent, called Nuna, formed around 1.5&nbsp;billion years ago. It broke apart and reunited as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/howdy-neighbor">supercontinent Rodinia</a> about 1 billion years ago. A third supercontinent called<a href="https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/SP503-2020-96"> Pannotia may have formed roughly 600 million years ago</a> near the South Pole, but its <a href="https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/SP503-2020-182">existence is debated</a>. Today, scientists are predicting how continents will merge in the future. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">supercontinent dubbed Amasia could form</a> 250&nbsp;million years from now as the continents drift toward the North Pole (<em>SN: 1/21/17, p. 18</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blood-vessels-dolphin-whale-brains-dives-retia-mirabilia">‘Wonderful nets’ of blood vessels protect dolphin and whale brains during dives</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you look at parts of the circulatory system of whales and dolphins, you might think that you are looking at a Jackson Pollock painting, not blood vessels. These cetaceans have especially dense, complex networks of blood vessels mainly associated with the brain and spine, but scientists didn’t know why. A new analysis suggests that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn3315">the networks protect cetaceans’ brains</a> from the pulses of blood pressure that the animals endure while diving deep in the ocean, researchers report in the Sept. 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Whales and dolphins “have gone through these really amazing vascular adaptations to support their brain,” says Ashley Blawas, a marine scientist at the Duke University Marine Lab in Beaufort, N.C., who was not involved with the research.</p>





<p>Called retia mirabilia, which means “wonderful nets,” the blood vessel networks are present in some other animals besides cetaceans, including giraffes and horses. But the networks aren’t found in other aquatic vertebrates that move differently from whales, such as seals. So scientists had suspected that the cetaceans’ retia mirabilia play a role in controlling blood pressure surges.</p>



<p>When whales and dolphins dive, they move their tail up and down in an undulating manner, which creates surges in blood pressure. Land animals that experience similar surges, like galloping horses, are able to release some of this pressure by exhaling. But some cetaceans hold their breath to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cuviers-beaked-whale-longest-record-dive">dive for long periods of time</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). Without a way to relieve that pressure, those blasts could tear blood vessels and harm other organs, including the brain.</p>



<p>In the new study, biomechanics researcher Margo Lillie of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and colleagues used data on the morphology of 11 cetacean species to create a computational model that can simulate the animals’ retia mirabilia. It revealed that the arteries and veins in this tangle of blood vessels are really close and may even sometimes be joined. As a result, the retia mirabilia could equalize the differences in blood pressure generated by diving, perhaps by redistributing the blood pulses from arteries to veins and vice versa. This way, the networks get rid of, or at least weaken, huge blood pressure surges that might otherwise reach and devastate the brain.</p>

<p>The networks “equalize the [blood flow] in a way that you never lose that blood that&#8217;s in the vein and it doesn&#8217;t collapse down on itself, and you don&#8217;t have that shooting arterial blood going really fast into the brain,” says marine biologist Tiffany Keenan of the University of North Carolina Wilmington who was not involved in the study. “It&#8217;s really neat to know what we&#8217;ve always wondered, but no one had been able to show.”</p>



<p>Still, studying cetaceans is tricky due to their protected status and limited access to samples, which are usually from animals that have been stranded, researchers say. For this reason, one limitation of the new study is that the researchers had to input data from different species to make their model.</p>



<p>“They take a little bit from here and a little bit from there, mixing a dolphin with a beluga whale with a beaked whale — it is sort of like a quilt,” says Andreas Fahlman, a marine scientist at the Oceanogràfic Foundation in Valencia, Spain, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>As a result, the model may be missing important aspects that might be specific to other species, which have unique anatomies and even move differently, with some staying closer to the surface or others diving deeper. Taking a closer look at the circulatory system of whales and dolphins, perhaps using nonintrusive techniques such sensors that can measure blood flow and pressure, may help confirm that the computational model reflects real-life dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-flip-lasso-ant-biology-australia">This spider literally flips for its food</a></h4>

              
                <p>For one tiny Australian spider, somersaulting is the secret to taking on ants twice its size.</p>



<p>Ants — armed with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-metal-infused-sharp-jaws-biology">powerful jaws</a> and sometimes chemical weapons — are so dangerous to spiders that fewer than 1 percent of arachnids attempt to hunt the insects (<em>SN: 9/8/21</em>). High-speed footage now reveals that the Australian ant-slayer spider (<em>Euryopis umbilicata</em>) can tackle this risky prey by leaping over and lassoing its victims with silk.</p>



<p>The hunting maneuver <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2205942119">hasn’t been found in any other spider species</a>, researchers report September 19 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>“This acrobatic behavior is just fascinating. I’ve personally never seen this kind of hunting,” says Paula Cushing, an evolutionary biologist and curator of invertebrate zoology at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Alfonso Aceves-Aparicio, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Plank Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, stumbled across the somersaulting spiders while walking home one night. A graduate student at Macquarie University in Sydney at the time, Aceves-Aparicio was intrigued when he noticed dark dots darting across the pale bark of a eucalyptus tree.</p>



<p>The dots were tiny spiders moving among ants. Suddenly, one of the spiders jumped. “I thought it was trying to escape an ant,” Aceves-Aparicio recalls. “But then I saw the ant floating and I thought, woah, there’s something going on here.”</p>



<p>Aceves-Aparicio borrowed a high-speed camera to see what the spiders were doing in greater detail. By slowing the action down, he and his colleagues could see that the spiders were in fact hunting ants in a completely unknown way.</p>



<p>Most ant-hunting spiders use webs or sneak up on their prey from behind to minimize risk. But despite being smaller than their prey, Aceves-Aparicio’s spiders were facing banded sugar ants (<em>Camponotus consobrinus</em>)<em> </em>head on. Each spider positioned itself so that it could watch ants as they moved up the tree. As one approached, the spider flipped above its prey. Once in the air, the spider latched a thread of silk onto the ant.</p>

</div><figcaption>Ant-slayer spiders capture their prey by jumping over ants and tagging them with a thread of silk (shown here in real time, then slow motion) — a leap that lasts all of a few milliseconds. The spiders then dart around ants to trap them in more silk and sweep them off their feet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This single tethering action — performed in the space of milliseconds — determined whether the hunt would succeed. If the tether stuck, the spider then darted around the ant, deftly encircling them with more silk and yanking them off their feet to be dragged off and consumed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What stands out to Aceves-Aparicio and his colleagues was the technique&#8217;s effectiveness. Predators like lions and wolves tend to miss around 50 percent of their intended targets. The success rate of the 60 spider hunts that the researchers filmed was a staggering 85 percent.</p>



<p>To Aceves-Aparicio, the discovery shows that extraordinary behaviors can hide in plain sight. “The message here is to have a little curiosity and to pay attention,” he says. “There are things going on everywhere. We just have to be there to find them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gas-flare-leak-methane-burning-climate">Gas flares are leaking five times as much methane than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>In many oil and gas producing regions, flames light the sky. The flares burn off 98 percent of the escaping natural gas, oil and gas companies claim. But observations of three U.S. oil and gas fields show efficiency is <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq0385">only around 91 percent</a>, scientists report in the Sept. 30 <em>Science</em>. Making up the difference would be the equivalent of taking nearly 3 million cars off the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The natural gas escaping is primarily methane. This greenhouse gas lingers for only nine to 10 years in the atmosphere, but its warming potential is 80 times that of carbon dioxide. So oil and gas companies light flares — burning the methane to produce less-potent carbon dioxide and water. The industry and the U.S. government assumed those flares worked at 98 percent efficiency. But previous studies said <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">that might be too optimistic</a>, says Genevieve Plant, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>





<p>Plant and her colleagues sent planes to sample air over more than 300 flares in the Bakken Basin in North Dakota and the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas, which account for more than 80 percent of the flaring in the country. The samples showed five times as much methane unburned than previously estimated.</p>



<p>The drop from 98 to 91 percent efficiency might seem small, but the effects are large, says Dan Cusworth, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not involved in the study. “Any percentage that is in the methane phase instead of CO<sub>2</sub> phase is substantially more problematic.”</p>



<p>Half of the difference is due to flares that aren’t burning. “We expected that flares might show a range of efficiencies, but we did not expect to see so many unlit flares,” Plant says. Between 3 and 5 percent of flares weren’t working at all. If those fires were lit, and 98 percent efficiency achieved, the result could remove the equivalent of about 13 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere. Light ‘em up.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crying-baby-sleep-science">How to get a crying baby to sleep, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s a frustration many parents know all too well: You’ve finally lulled your crying baby to sleep, so you put them down in their crib … and the wailing begins again. Science may have a trick for you.</p>



<p>Carrying a crying infant for about five minutes, then sitting for at least another five to eight minutes can calm and lull the baby to sleep long enough to allow a parent <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01363-X#%20">to put the child down without waking them</a>, researchers report September 13 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>Some of those same researchers previously showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infants-whether-mice-or-human-love-be-carried">carrying a crying baby soothes the child and calms a racing heart rate</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/13</em>). For the new study, the team looked at what it takes to get that crying baby to nod off and stay asleep.</p>



<p>The researchers put heart rate monitors on 21 crying babies, ranging in age from newborns to 7 months old. The team also took videos of the infants, monitoring their moods as their mothers carried them around a room, sat holding them and laid them in a crib. That allowed the team to observe how the babies responded to different environments, whether they were crying, fussy, alert or drowsy, heartbeat by heartbeat.</p>



<p>“We tested the physiology behind these things that tend to be kind of common knowledge, though it’s not really well understood why they work,” says Gianluca Esposito, a developmental psychologist at the University of Trento in Italy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The babies’ heart rates slowed and they stopped crying when their mothers picked them up and carried them around for five minutes. Some infants even fell asleep. But the researchers also noticed that the babies tended to respond to the movement of the parent, whether they were in deep sleep or not. For instance, a baby’s heart rate quickened if a parent turned quickly while walking or tried to put the baby down.</p>



<p>Sitting seems to smooth that transition from walking to bed, the team observed. Babies cradled in mom’s lap for at least five minutes tended to settle into a slower heart rate and stayed asleep once they were put in their crib. In contrast, the heart rates of six babies whose moms sat with them for less than five minutes accelerated once they were laid down and they woke up soon after.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of research about the relationship between infants and mothers, “but I had not seen work showing that infants were responding to mothers’ behaviors while infants were sleeping,” says Sarah Berger, a developmental psychologist at the College of Staten Island in New York who was not a part of the study.</p>



<p>Both Berger and Esposito caution this method isn’t a magic wand for all babies. It doesn’t rule out sleepless nights, but still, it’s something that parents can try, Esposito says. And while this study was done with mothers, anyone that an infant is comfortable with can do it. “Especially for very, very young kids … as long as these caregivers are familiar with the kid, it’s going to work,” he says.</p>

<p>If you saw Carlos Argüelles-Delgado’s childhood bedroom — the whiteboard for working out problems, the math textbooks they asked for as birthday gifts — you’d likely not be surprised that this kid would grow up to push the boundaries of modern physics.</p>



<p>For years, physicists have known that the most successful theory to describe what the universe is made of, called the standard model, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-particle-physics-standard-model-discovery-anniversary">is broken</a>. By prying at one of the biggest cracks in the framework — neutrinos — Argüelles aims to discover what’s next for the field.</p>





<p>Neutrinos are mysterious even for subatomic particles. They’re hard to study because they barely interact with matter, and what scientists do know about them is baffling — like the fact that neutrinos have mass when the standard model predicts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-identity-shift-snares-physics-nobel">they shouldn’t</a>. “That’s why I like neutrinos,” Argüelles says. “They misbehave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many scientists think this confusing behavior is a sign that neutrinos are affected by undiscovered particles. In that case, demystifying neutrinos could open a new window on the universe. The question is: Who are these hidden partners, and how can scientists find them?</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>To search for answers, Argüelles often relies on data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica. IceCube’s thousands of buried detectors spot neutrinos from the faint flashes of light they leave after interacting with ice<em>.</em></p>



<p>For their Ph.D., Argüelles combed through these signals to look for “sterile” neutrinos. If this breed of neutrinos exists, they would interact with matter even less than normal neutrinos do. Sterile neutrinos could explain several troubling problems with the standard model, like why neutrinos have mass and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">why antimatter is rarer than matter</a>.&nbsp;Sterile neutrinos are also a candidate for <a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.93.035007">dark matter</a>, the unidentified substance that outweighs normal matter in the universe.</p>



<p>The search made for a huge project, but Argüelles finished it in about half of the time typical for U.S. Ph.D.s in the physical sciences. And though they found no signs of the would-be particle, Argüelles ruled out some ideas about what it could be like.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="388" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-arguelles_inline.jpg" alt="photo of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory near the South Pole" class="wp-image-3117705" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-arguelles_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-arguelles_inline-671x383.jpg 671w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-arguelles_inline-326x186.jpg 326w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117705">The IceCube Neutrino Observatory near the South Pole looks for the faint flashes of light emitted when neutrinos interact with ice.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117705">Felipe Pedreros, IceCube/NSF</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“It was an amazing performance,” says neutrino physicist Francis Halzen, who advised Argüelles’ Ph.D. work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and is IceCube’s head scientist. “It was a piece of art.”</p>



<p>Argüelles also looks for other possible hidden particles, like WIMPs, a hypothetical particle that could be a form of dark matter. And Argüelles isn’t afraid to pursue research farther from their specialty. Though no expert in quantum computers, for example, Argüelles was <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033176">the first to use a quantum computer to simulate</a> how neutrinos can change from one type to another. That could one day help scientists better understand neutrino-rich events like supernova explosions.</p>



<p>“I just hate when people tell me I cannot do something,”&nbsp;Argüelles says.</p>



<p>Halzen describes Argüelles as fearless, the kind of scientist who is never afraid to ask questions. “I don’t think they have any regard for their reputation, ever,” he says.</p>

<h4>Backstory</h4>



<p>Argüelles’ attitude toward research is, in part, forged by past struggles to overcome hardship and discrimination.</p>



<p>“There are worse things in life than not being able to solve a problem,” they say.</p>



<p>Growing up in Peru meant building a life on shifting ground. The economy was unstable, and at times Argüelles’ family struggled to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Though Argüelles’ parents were supportive and saw knowledge as a safe investment, they at first rejected Argüelles’ desire to study physics. Argüelles, wiping a tear from their eye, recalls their father saying, “You’re just going to die of hunger.” Soon Argüelles’ parents did embrace the career choice.</p>



<p>Argüelles says Peru, when they were growing up, was also an “extremely negative environment” for LGBTQ+ people. “I’m a gay man,” they say, “and it was very, very, very difficult.”</p>



<p>Same-sex marriages are not recognized in Peru. Hate crimes and discrimination based on sexual orientation were only prohibited in 2017, by a presidential decree that the country’s Congress tried but failed to overturn.</p>



<p>When Argüelles left Peru in 2012 to pursue their Ph.D., they found that studying physics in the United States wasn’t without obstacles. Almost nobody high up in the field looked like them. They struggled under the weight of expectations and felt that voicing their anxieties would get them branded as weak. But with help from mentors, Argüelles persevered.</p>



<p>Now, as an assistant professor at Harvard, Argüelles sees their students — particularly women and Hispanics — facing the same challenges. Argüelles is passionate about supporting them.</p>



<p>“It’s about not giving up, right?” Argüelles says. “I still go through some of these things myself. But I’ll survive it.”</p>

<p>It’s no revelation that sea levels are rising. Rising temperatures brought on by human-caused climate change are melting ice sheets and expanding ocean water. What’s happening inside Earth will also shape future shorelines. Jacky Austermann is trying to understand those inner dynamics.</p>



<p>A geophysicist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Austermann didn’t always know she would end up studying climate. Her fascination with math from a young age coupled with her love of nature and the outdoors — she grew up hiking in the Alps — led her to study physics as an undergraduate, and later geophysics.</p>





<p>As Austermann dug deeper into Earth’s geosystems, she learned just how much the movement of hot rock in the mantle influences life on the surface. “I got really interested in this entire interplay of the solid earth and the oceans and the climate,” she says.</p>



<h4>Big goal</h4>



<p>Much of Austermann’s work focuses on how that interplay influences changes in sea level. The global average sea level has risen more than 20 centimeters since 1880, and the yearly rise is increasing. But shifts in local sea level can vary, with those levels rising or falling along different shorelines, Austermann says, and the solid earth plays a role.</p>



<p>“We think about sea level change generally as ‘ice is melting, so sea level is rising.’ But there’s a lot more nuance to it,” she says. “A lot of sea level change is driven by land motion.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>Understanding that nuance could lead to more accurate climate models for predicting sea level rise in the future. Such work should help inform practical solutions for communities in at-risk coastal areas.</p>



<p>So Austermann is building computer models that reconstruct sea level changes over the last few million years. Her models incorporate data on how the creeping churning of the mantle and other geologic phenomena have altered land and sea elevation, particularly during interglacial periods when Earth’s temperatures were a few degrees higher than they are today.</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Previous studies had suggested that this churning, known as mantle convection, sculpted Earth’s surface millions of years ago. “It pushes the surface up where hot material wells up,” Austermann says. “And it also drags [the surface] down where cold material sinks back into the mantle.”</p>



<p>In 2015, Austermann and colleagues were the first to show that mantle-induced topographic changes <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/43/10/927/131756/The-impact-of-dynamic-topography-change-on?redirectedFrom=fulltext">influenced the melting of Antarctic ice</a> over the last 3 million years. Near the ice sheet’s edges, ice retreated more quickly in areas where the land surface was lower due to convection.</p>



<p>What’s more, mantle convection is affecting land surfaces even on relatively short time scales. Since the last interglacial period, around 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, mantle convection has <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700457">warped ancient shorelines</a> by as much as several meters, her team reported in <em>Science Advances</em> in 2017. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/227/3/1938/6328486?login=true">growing and melting of ice sheets can deform the solid earth too</a>, Austermann says. As land sinks under the weight of accumulating ice, local sea levels rise. And as land uplifts where the ice melts, water falls. This effect, as well as how the ice sheet tugs on the water around it, is shifting local sea levels around the globe today, she says, making it very relevant to coastal areas planning their defenses in the current climate crisis.</p>



<p>Understanding these geologic processes can help improve models of past sea level rise. Austermann’s team is gathering more data from the field, scouring the coasts of Caribbean islands for clues to what areas were once near or below sea level. Such clues include fossilized corals and water ripples etched in stone, as well as tiny chutes in rocks that indicate air bubbles once rose through sand on ancient beaches. The work is “really fun,” Austermann says. “It’s essentially like a scavenger hunt.”</p>



<p>Her efforts put the solid earth at the forefront of the study of sea level changes, says Douglas Wiens, a seismologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Before, “a lot of those factors were kind of ignored.” What’s most remarkable is her ability “to span what we normally consider to be several different disciplines and bring them together to solve the sea level problem,” he says.</p>



<h4>Building community</h4>



<p>Austermann says the most enjoyable part of her job is working with her students and postdocs. More than writing the next big paper, she wants to cultivate a happy, healthy and motivated research group. “It’s really rewarding to see them grow academically, scientifically, come up with their own ideas … and also help each other out.”</p>



<p>Roger Creel, a Ph.D. student in Austermann’s group and the first to join her lab, treasures Austermann’s mentorship. She offers realistic, clear and fluid expectations, gives prompt and thoughtful feedback and meets for regular check-ins, he says. “Sometimes I think of it like water-skiing, and Jacky’s the boat.”</p>



<p>For Oana Dumitru, a postdoc in the group, one aspect of that valued mentorship came in the form of a gentle push to write and submit a grant proposal on her own. “I thought I was not ready for it, but she was like, you’ve got to try,” Dumitru says. </p>



<p>Austermann prioritizes her group’s well-being, which fosters collaboration, Creel and Dumitru say. That sense of inclusion, support and community “is the groundwork for having an environment where great ideas can blossom,” Austermann says.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2022"><img loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg" alt="Icon that reads &quot;The SN 10 Scientists to Watch&quot; and &quot;See the full list of scientists&quot;" class="wp-image-3117446" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Though humans’ nearly hairless bodies stick out like a cowlick among other primates, our nakedness isn’t unique in the world of mammals. Dolphins and whales are naked, says biological anthropologist Tina Lasisi of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. There are naked mole-rats. “Elephants, depending on how you look at them, are kind of naked,” she says. “But we’re the only weirdos that are naked except for our head.”</p>



<p>Our species traded off much of our body hair for more sweat glands, an evolutionary adaptation that helps us regulate body heat more efficiently. But what about another uniquely human feature? We’re the only animals known to express tightly curled hair, like that seen in many people of African descent. Lasisi wants to know why and how it came to be.</p>





<h4>Backstory</h4>



<p>For decades, traits that have been associated with racial categories, such as skin pigmentation and hair texture, have gone understudied or ignored among anthropologists, Lasisi says. Much of the study of human biological variation was deserted after the post–World War II backlash against eugenics, a racist field birthed from the idea that humankind could be improved if those deemed to have desirable traits were selectively allowed to reproduce. Since then, research on human variation has largely focused instead on traits that are not overtly racialized, such as lactose intolerance and adaptations to high altitudes.</p>



<p>But studying all forms of human variation is crucial to understanding our species’s evolution, Lasisi says. Studying variation in a way that normalizes rather than dampens or paints differences in a bad light is key not only to righting anthropology’s harmful legacy, but also ethical, socially responsible and sound science, she says.</p>





<p>Lasisi discovered biological anthropology as an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge. As a Black person who spent many of her formative years among white people in the Netherlands, she was always aware of skin color. She vividly remembers learning that human skin pigmentation evolved as an adaptation to ultraviolet radiation — research pioneered by anthropologist Nina Jablonski of Penn State, who would later become Lasisi’s primary adviser. “It’s like a lightbulb went off in my head,” Lasisi says, and it made her wonder, “What else out there can be explained by evolution?”</p>



<p>Her interest in the origins of curly hair grew in part as an effort to understand her own locks. “Research is me-search,” Lasisi says. But when she first began, there wasn’t much science to comb through, and methodologies for measuring hair texture were either unreliable or inefficient.</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>As part of her Ph.D. research, Lasisi worked with a team of anthropologists, thermal engineers and physiologists to study how curly hair might have given our bipedal ancestors a leg up in the hot and dry African savanna.</p>



<p>The team placed a variety of wigs made of human hair onto heat-sensing models and measured heat transfer in different environments. In dry settings, curly hair, especially tightly curled hair, protected the scalp from solar radiation while releasing more heat from the head than straight hair. Lasisi speculates that the larger amount of air space within curly hair is what does the trick.</p>



<p>To underpin her efforts and support future hair research, Lasisi <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90409-x">developed an improved and standardized way of measuring hair curvature and cross-sectional shape.</a> The technique involves segmenting, washing and taking pictures of hair strands and then running the images through an open-source computer program that she created.</p>



<p>Measuring these characteristics on a continuous spectrum (much like we do height, for instance), she argues, is a better way of studying hair texture than the long-standing practice of classifying hair into discrete categories, such as straight, wavy or curly. Such discrete categories are not standardized among experts and can become subjective, she says. They also obscure the immense variation that exists, even on a single person’s head, and especially among curly hair.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Cloudy categories</h3>



<p>Hair with similar curvatures can be perceived as straight, wavy or curly, as seen in this figure that compares the self-reported hair texture of 140 people of European and African ancestry with the actual curvature of their hair samples.</p>

<p>Lasisi is doing highly technical work that hasn’t been part of the conversation, says Robin Nelson, a biological anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. “Before Tina, very few people were working on hair texture in the same way.”</p>



<p>Lasisi will bring this experience to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor as an assistant professor in 2023, where she’ll continue her studies on human variation.</p>



<h4>Reaching out</h4>



<p>Lasisi wants everyone to be included in conversations about what makes humans human. She has appeared on the podcast <em><a href="https://jonathanvanness.com/podcast/hair-variation-whats-her-story-with-dr-tina-lasisi/">Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness</a></em> (of <em>Queer Eye</em> fame). She also hosts a PBS digital show on human evolutionary biology called <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1FNZ_ZcL_tJyV8li-lQj0ZA">Why Am I Like This?</a></em>, which she helps conceptualize and write.</p>



<p>What’s more, Lasisi has cultivated a community of curious science seekers on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Through short-form videos marked by her signature wit and humor, such as her “Melanin March” series or “Darwin’s greatest hits against white supremacy,” Lasisi educates thousands of followers on human variation, how to talk about race and ethnicity from an anthropological perspective, and much more. She even gives prospective anthropologists career tips and behind-the-scenes glimpses of life in academia. Two-way discussions let her learn from her audience, which she calls her “little focus groups.”</p>

</div><figcaption>In a series of videos on TikTok, Tina Lasisi introduces viewers to melanin, its different types and what it’s got to do with squid ink, mushrooms and watermelons.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lasisi hopes her research and outreach will inspire and provide a helpful framework for more nuanced discussions about race, ethnicity, ancestry and human diversity — and that her visibility as a Black anthropologist will encourage other people of color to ask questions that are important to them. “I want to put enough information out there in the world, and [have] enough people out there in the world who have a grasp of that information,” she says, “so that we can see human variation for the beautiful, magnificent, complex thing that it is.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2022">Big questions inspire the scientists on this year’s SN 10 list</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inspiration doesn’t play by any set rules. It can come from anywhere and strike when it’s least expected. A first hint of a big idea can hang on in the recesses of the mind and push people ahead in roundabout ways.</p>



<p>Our SN 10: Scientists to Watch list is a brief study in inspiration. For the seventh year, <em>Science News</em> is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featuring 10 early- and mid-career scientists</a> driven by their curiosity and sense of wonder, and moved to solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Each is making a mark on their chosen field. Inspired by the beauty he saw in a video of a developing embryo during a middle school science class, Marcos Simões-Costa seeks to understand how cells differentiate during development. It was starry skies in Scotland that pushed planetary scientist Robin Wordsworth to study if and how life might survive elsewhere in the cosmos. And for Jacky Austermann, a love of math and the outdoors led her to physics, then the inner Earth — and ultimately climate change.</p>





<p>Each year we seek SN 10 nominations from Nobel laureates, members of the National Academy of Sciences and past SN 10 scientists. This year’s names came from those notable folks, and then some. For the first time, we opened up nominations to other scientists and the wider public, expanding the breadth of our list. It’s led to another impressive crew – many of them also set on inspiring others.</p>



<p>Biological anthropologist Tina Lasisi, who studies the evolution of human variation, hosts a PBS Digital Studios show and is a popular voice on TikTok. She wants to inspire people of color to ask questions important to them. “Research is me-search,” she says. Neutrino physicist Carlos&nbsp;Argüelles-Delgado is passionate about supporting physics students who don’t have role models who look like them. “It’s about not giving up, right?” Argüelles says. Environmental engineer Smruthi Karthikeyan pulled elementary school students into her coronavirus tracking efforts by letting them name the wastewater-collecting robots.</p>



<p>There are a lot of sparks for new ideas in these scientist stories. We hope they will inspire you, too. <em>— Elizabeth Quill</em></p>

<p>Environmental engineer Smruthi Karthikeyan had spent just a couple of days working in her new lab at the University of California, San Diego when the state instituted its first coronavirus lockdown in March 2020.</p>



<p>She’d been brought on as a postdoc by biologist Rob Knight to develop new techniques for studying how microbes in complex ecosystems shape human health and vice versa. The COVID-19 pandemic quickly put a new spin on that mission.<br><br>Soon, the lab pivoted to support the coronavirus response. Infections were outpacing testing capacity in San Diego County, Karthikeyan says. Meanwhile, the university wanted to keep the campus open for its 10,000 students still living on campus and 25,000 workers. There had to be a way to monitor infections without requiring thousands of people to get tested all the time, Karthikeyan and colleagues thought.</p>





<p>Public health researchers had previously tested wastewater for pathogens as a way to spy on the movements of infectious agents in communities. Viruses, bacteria and parasites can show up in stool before people exhibit symptoms, giving clues to a coming outbreak. But no one had implemented such a system to track a respiratory virus before, and never at a scale of tens of thousands of people.<br><br>Karthikeyan was up for the challenge.</p>



<h4>Bold idea</h4>



<p>The wastewater monitoring system that Karthikeyan and colleagues developed and implemented at UC San Diego, reported July 7 in <em>Nature</em>, processes upward of 200 samples per day. Previous methods could process a maximum of eight samples, she says. What’s more, the system has identified <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05049-6">newly spreading coronavirus variants up to two weeks earlier</a> than clinical testing and accurately forecasted the mix of variants infecting students and staff.</p>



<p>That has given school officials more time to take action to keep infection rates low. During the study period from November 2020 to September 2021, the proportion of clinical tests that were positive was less than one percent, Karthikeyan says, dramatically lower than rates in the surrounding area and many other college campuses at the time.</p>

<p>Among the key players in the team’s monitoring system are 131 robots that collect wastewater samples throughout each day from 360 university buildings. Back at the lab, the samples are screened for viral RNA and results are fed into a publicly available <a href="https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/index.html">online dashboard</a> created as part of the project.<br><br>Karthikeyan’s team isn’t the only one <a href="https://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082">using human waste to get a jump on COVID-19</a>. But the scale of the monitoring “is a bit unprecedented,” says Ameet Pinto, an environmental engineer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. During the study period, Karthikeyan and colleagues processed a total of nearly 20,000 samples. “That’s amazing,” he says.</p>



<p>A positive result triggers a campus-wide notification via smartphone app. For dorms, anyone who lives in the building is mandated to get tested for COVID-19, while anyone who may have recently been in the building is strongly encouraged to get tested.</p>



<p>To increase access to tests, the team swapped candy in vending machines for at-home test kits and installed test drop boxes in the buildings. Karthikeyan’s team processes the tests and sends results within a day.</p>



<p>Anyone testing positive for the coronavirus is moved to a designated isolation dorm or instructed to isolate at home if they live off campus. If the coronavirus shows up in the next day’s wastewater test, the building’s remaining occupants will receive a notification to test again.</p>



<p>To figure out which variants are causing infections at the university, Karthikeyan’s team built a freely available computational tool called Freyja. It uses a library of genetic markers to identify the relative abundances of well-known and emerging variants in the wastewater. Freyja detected the emerging delta variant on campus 14 days before clinical tests did, Karthikeyan and colleagues report.</p>



<h4>Growing the effort</h4>



<p>Based on success at the university, San Diego County officials asked the researchers to test a modified version of the <a href="https://searchcovid.info/dashboards/wastewater-surveillance/">system at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant</a>, which serves more than 2.2 million residents, and at 17 public schools. Elementary school students got to name the robots, dubbing the machines Sir-Poops-a-Lot, Harry Botter and the Rancid Water, and other silly monikers, Karthikeyan said with a chuckle.</p>



<p>On the county level, the system detected the emergence of the omicron variant 11 days before clinical testing, the team reports in the same study in <em>Nature</em>. A detailed analysis of the public school data hasn’t yet been published.</p>



<p>Karthikeyan and colleagues’ methods have been adapted by researchers at the state, national and international levels. For instance, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/wastewater-surveillance/wastewater-surveillance.html">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/whole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program/wastewater-surveillance-sars-cov-2-variants">Food and Drug Administration use Freyja</a> to track variants in wastewater across the country.</p>



<p>The system is now being used to monitor monkeypox, and the team is working on how it can detect other pathogens that may be spreading unnoticed. That work has the potential to have a huge impact on wastewater epidemiology, Pinto says.</p>



<p>Karthikeyan will launch her own lab at Caltech in 2023, where she plans to adapt these tools for monitoring groundwater. Communities of microbes that live there can serve as sentinels, flagging disturbances from pollution, climate change and more, she says. “My whole thing is to look at a much larger system from a very tiny lens.”</p>

<p>Visitors to the village of Drumnadrochit, on the western shore of Scotland’s murky Loch Ness, come to see the nearby ruins of Urquhart Castle or to chance a glimpse of the elusive Loch Ness Monster. But growing up in Drumnadrochit, planetary scientist Robin Wordsworth says it was the unobscured view of the cosmos that seized his attention. “There are incredibly clear skies up there,” he says.</p>



<p>Today, Wordsworth lives on the other side of the Atlantic. He’s a researcher and professor at Harvard University. But his gaze is still set on the solar system and beyond. From studying how rocky planets may occasionally become encased in glaciers to exploring the sizes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-rain-drop-size-limit-alien-planets">alien raindrops</a> or the details of how humans might one day settle Mars, Wordsworth’s scientific explorations vary widely. His research group tends to “do a lot of different things at once,” he says. “If I was to summarize it in a sentence, it would be to understand what drives habitability on planets through time.”</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Wordsworth defines a planet’s habitability as its ability to support life. The idea that life could survive elsewhere in the cosmos has always fascinated Wordsworth, a science fiction fan. Apart from Earth, astronomers have discovered roughly 20 potentially habitable worlds in the universe. With data collected by ground-based observatories, satellites and rovers, he uses supercomputers to construct simulations of planets and the evolution of their climates. Climate is a big focus because it determines whether a planet’s surface can harbor liquid water — a necessity for all known forms of life.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="393" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline.jpg" alt="image of orange, white, green and brown clouds swirling in Jupiter's atmosphere" class="wp-image-3117436" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline-663x383.jpg 663w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline-322x186.jpg 322w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117436">The swirling clouds of Jupiter, captured by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, could release semisolid ammonia slushballs of precipitation.

<p>Wordsworth’s most notable research reconstructs the climate of early Mars. Martian river valleys and other geologic clues suggest that abundant liquid water once flowed across the Red Planet, and the early Martian climate has thus become a hot topic for scientists seeking signs of alien life. But for decades, the best researchers could do was build one-dimensional models that struggled to replicate key atmospheric components, such as clouds.</p>



<p>In 2013 while at the Laboratory of Dynamic Meteorology in Paris, Wordsworth and colleagues presented a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103512004265">3-D model of the early Martian climate</a>, with clouds and an atmosphere containing large amounts of carbon dioxide. Those are key components for studying how the early Martian atmosphere may have reflected and trapped heat, says astrobiologist James Kasting of Penn State.</p>



<p>Wordsworth was the one who figured out how to incorporate clouds into the model, thanks to his strong programming skills, handle over mathematics and determination, Kasting says. “He’s been publishing the best climate calculations for early Mars. There’s really nobody else who is in his lane.”</p>





<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>Wordsworth’s otherworldly reconstructions may help us better understand whether life might have emerged on Mars or elsewhere. Another strand of his research could help humans one day settle the Red Planet.</p>



<p>Today, most of Mars’ surface is too cold to sustain liquid water, and the planet’s thin atmosphere offers little protection from the sun’s intense ultraviolet radiation. These conditions make it inhospitable to would-be Martian settlers. But in a 2019 study, Wordsworth and colleagues proposed that sheets of insulating silica aerogel deployed over ice-covered areas might make survival possible.</p>



<p>In lab tests, layers of aerogel just centimeters thick <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0813-0">filtered out 60 percent of UVA and UVB radiation</a> and almost all of the more dangerous UVC rays, while permitting enough light through for photosynthesis. What’s more, the shields warmed the air underneath by more than 50 degrees Celsius, which could make liquid water and growing crops possible. Looking ahead, Wordsworth plans to investigate how settlers on Mars might use bioplastics or other renewable materials to become self-sustaining.</p>



<p>And far beyond the Red Planet, the exoplanets await. “The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">James Webb Space Telescope</a> has just begun to collect new exoplanet data,” Wordsworth says. Observations of their atmospheres will help researchers test ideas about how these distant planets and their climates evolve, he says. “It’s just an incredibly exciting time.”</p>

<p>In January 2020, Caltech biochemist Pamela Bjorkman asked for volunteers to help work out the structures of immune proteins that attack a newly discovered coronavirus. The pathogen had emerged in China and was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-about-new-virus-causing-pneumonia-outbreak-china">causing severe pneumonia-like symptoms</a> in the people it infected. Knowing the molecular arrangements of these antibodies would be an important step toward developing drugs to fight the virus.</p>



<p>Christopher Barnes, a postdoc working in Bjorkman’s lab on the structure of HIV and the antibodies that target it, jumped at the chance to solve a new puzzle. “I was like, ‘Oh, I&#8217;ll do it!’” Barnes says. At the time he wasn’t aware how urgent the research would become.</p>





<p>Now, we are all too familiar with SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 and has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">killed more than 6 million people</a> globally. Studies of the structure of the virus and the antibodies that target it have helped scientists quickly develop vaccines and treatments that have <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext">saved tens of millions of lives</a>. But the virus continues to adapt, making changes to the spike protein that it uses to break into cells. That has left researchers scrambling for new drugs and updated vaccines.</p>



<p>Using high-resolution imaging techniques, Barnes is probing coronavirus spike proteins and the antibodies that attack them. His goal: Find a persistent weak spot and exploit it to create a vaccine that works against all coronaviruses. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Barnes’ team used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structures of eight antibodies that stop the original version of SARS-CoV-2. The technique catches cells, viruses and proteins going about their business by flash freezing them. In this case, the team isolated coronavirus particles entwined with immune system proteins from people with COVID-19.</p>



<p>The antibodies had attached to four spots on the spike protein’s receptor binding domain, or RBD, the team reported in <em>Nature</em> in 2020. This fingerlike region anchors the virus to the cell it will infect. When antibodies bind to the RBD, the virus can no longer connect to the cell. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Barnes’ team also created an antibody classification system based on the RBD location where the immune system proteins tend to latch on. “That’s been really helpful for understanding the types of antibody responses that are elicited by natural infection,” says structural biologist Jason McLellan, who wasn’t involved in the work, and for identifying prime candidates for drug development.</p>



<p>“A major strength of Chris is that he does not limit himself or his research to one technique,” says McLellan, of the University of Texas at Austin. “He quickly adapts and incorporates new technologies to answer important questions in the field.”</p>



<p>Since launching his own lab at Stanford, Barnes and colleagues have determined the structures of six <a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(22)00174-1#secsectitle0010">antibodies</a> that attack the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">delta</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">omicron</a> variants. Those variants are skilled at evading antibodies, including lab-made ones given to patients to treat COVID-19.<br><br>The newly identified antibodies, described in the June 14 <em>Immunity</em>, target the spike protein’s N-terminal domain. The structures of the sites where the proteins attach are the same in delta and omicron, hinting that the sites might remain unchanged even in future variants, the team says. Eventually, scientists may be able to mass-produce antibodies that target these sites for use in new therapies.</p>



<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>Barnes has now turned his attention to antibodies that can fend off all coronaviruses — from ones that cause the common cold to ones found in livestock and other animals that have the potential to spill over into people.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Barnes and immunologist Davide Robbiani of the University of Lugano in Switzerland identified classes of antibodies that target variants from all four coronavirus families, blocking the viruses’ ability to fuse with cells.</p>



<p>What’s more, the structure of one of the binding sites on the spike protein is the same across the coronavirus family tree, Barnes says. “This is something you wouldn’t want to mutate as you diversify your viral family because this is a critical component of how you enter the cell.”</p>



<p>Two independent teams have identified similarly broad action in the same antibody classes. Taken together, the findings suggest that a universal coronavirus vaccine is possible, Barnes says.</p>



<p>“We’ve all kind of discovered this at the same time,” he says. The teams are now thinking, “Wow, this exists. So let’s try to make a real, true pan-coronavirus vaccine.”</p>

<p>When Emily Jacobs embarked on a career studying the brain in the early 2000s, a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, was having a moment. “Just like we have super powerful telescopes that can let us quantify the farthest reaches of the known universe, here we have this tool that could allow us to see the entire human brain and as a pulsing, living organ,” says Jacobs, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br><br>By measuring changes in blood flow that serve as a proxy for brain activity, neuroscientists were getting new views of how different situations spur conversations between brain regions, and how the intensity of the conversations changes over time. “I was riding that wave of excitement,” Jacobs says. </p>



<p>But she soon realized there were big questions that weren’t being asked — questions important to half the world’s population. Do the natural hormonal changes that come with menstruation, pregnancy and menopause affect communication across the brain? What about hormonal contraceptives, such as the birth control pill, which are <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2020/Jan/un_2019_contraceptiveusebymethod_databooklet.pdf">used by hundreds of millions</a> of people globally? And what does it all mean for brain health and behavior?</p>

<h4>Big goal</h4>



<p>The rise and fall of hormones is a big reason women have historically been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/nih-policy-best-way-sex-equality-studies">excluded from biomedical research</a>, even though hormones in men fluctuate too. The resulting gap in knowledge of female biology has led to inadequate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/postpartum-depression-scientific-research-mothers">mental</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/flibanserin-approval-complicated-drug-takes-spotlight">physical</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-medication-new-drugs-research-clinical-trials">reproductive</a> health care. “Science, and especially neuroscience, has not served the sexes equally,” Jacobs says.</p>





<p>With a range of tools — fMRI, other types of MRI and brain imaging, blood testing, neuropsychological testing, virtual reality and more — Jacobs’ lab is trying to fill in gaps in our basic understanding of how hormones act in the human brain. And she is studying the hormones as a lens for bigger questions about brain changes. </p>



<p>“What’s really special about Emily’s work is that she does it at so many different levels. It’s so multifaceted,” says cognitive neuroscientist Caterina Gratton of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “She has multiple different types of brain measures, from the molecular all the way up to brain systems.”</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>In a series of studies dubbed 28 and Me — for the 28 days of a typical menstrual cycle — Jacobs and colleagues closely monitored the brain of one woman for the duration of her natural menstrual cycle. Every 24 hours over 30 days, this 20-something woman’s brain was scanned, blood hormone levels checked and mood assessed.</p>



<p>As the woman’s estrogen levels peaked during ovulation, regions throughout the brain synced up. And regions in an important hub called the default mode network became tight conversationalists. What’s more, one part of this network rearranged itself to create a new and transient communication clique. After ovulation, when estrogen levels dropped and progesterone levels spiked, gray matter temporarily expanded in a brain structure tied to learning and memory.</p>



<p>When the same woman was examined a year later while on the pill, which quells progesterone, the changes weren’t observed. </p>



<p>The findings, described in 2021 in <em>Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences</em>, provide strong evidence that the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235215462100019X?via%3Dihub">ebb and flow of sex hormones</a> drives changes in the brain on a day-to-day basis, Jacobs and colleagues say. They also saw links between hormone fluctuations and brain changes <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(22)01008-3/fulltext">in a male participant</a>.</p>





<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>The observations led cognitive neuroscientist Caitlin Taylor, a postdoc in Jacobs’ lab, to wonder how the brain responds to chronic hormone suppression from oral contraceptive use. The team is launching <a href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/node/121">a large-scale study</a> to attempt to find out.</p>



<p>Initially, Jacobs hesitated to green-light the research. She worried it could be twisted to erode access to contraception. Eventually, she relented, because women “deserve to have science that can serve us,” she says.</p>



<p>Another effort, which Jacobs and Taylor are building, will make data for such large-scale studies widely available. Called the <a href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/research/oral-hormonal-contraceptives-and-brain">University of California Women’s Brain Initiative</a>, it aims to funnel records from the university system’s eight brain-imaging research centers into an open-access database. When a woman gets her brain scanned at one of the centers, her de-identified brain-imaging data, medical data and information about hormonal contraceptive use will be entered into the database. Once all eight centers are on board, there could be about 10,000 participants annually — way more than a single lab could recruit.</p>



<p>The expected mountain of data should be a boon to researchers asking big and small questions about brain health, Jacobs says. And she hopes it will improve women’s health care.</p>

<p>Growing up in Brazil, Marcos Simões-Costa often visited his grandparents’ farm in the Amazon. That immersion in nature — squawking toucans and all — sparked his fascination with science and evolution. But a video of a developing embryo, shown in his middle school science class, cemented his desire to become a developmental biologist.</p>



<p>“It’s such a beautiful process,” he says. “I was always into drawing and art, and it was very visual — the shapes of the embryo changing, the fact that you start with one cell and the complexity is increasing. I just got lost in that video.”</p>





<p>Today, Simões-Costa, of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, is honoring his younger self by demystifying how the embryo develops. He studies the embryos and stem cells of birds and mice to learn how networks of genes and the elements that control them influence the identity of cells. The work could lead to new treatments for various diseases, including cancer.</p>



<p>“The embryo is our best teacher,” he says.</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Simões-Costa focuses on the embryo’s neural crest cells, a population of stem cells that form in the developing central nervous system. The cells migrate to other parts of the embryo and give rise to many different cell types, from the bone cells of the face to muscle cells to brain and nerve cells.</p>



<p>Scientists have wondered for years why, despite being so similar, neural crest cells in the cranial region of the embryo can form bone and cartilage, while those in the trunk region can’t form either. While a postdoc at Caltech, Simões-Costa studied the cascade of molecules that govern how genes are expressed in each cell type. With his adviser, developmental biologist Marianne Bronner, he identified transcription factors — proteins that can turn genes on and off — that were present only in cranial cells. Transplanting the genes for those proteins into trunk cells endowed the cells with the ability to create cartilage and bone.</p>



<p>Now in his own lab, he continues to piece together just how this vast regulatory network influences the specialization of cells. His team reconstructed how neural crest cells’ full set of genetic instructions, or the genome, folds into a compact, 3-D shape. The researchers identified short DNA sequences, called enhancers, that are located in faraway regions of the genome, but end up close to key genes when the genome folds. These enhancers work with transcription factors and other regulatory elements to control gene activity.</p>



<p>Simões-Costa is also using neural crest cells to elucidate a strange behavior shared by cancer cells and some embryonic cells. These cells produce energy anaerobically, without oxygen, even when oxygen is present. Called the Warburg effect, this metabolic process has been studied extensively in cancer cells, but its function remained unclear.</p>

<p>Through experiments manipulating the metabolism of neural crest cells, Simões-Costa’s team found that the Warburg effect is necessary for the cells to move around during early development. The mechanism, which should stay turned off in nonembryonic cells, somehow “gets reactivated in adult cells in the context of cancer, leading those cells to become more migratory and more invasive,” Simões-Costa says.</p>



<p>“He’s one of the few people who’s really looked at [this process in neural crest cells] at a molecular level and done a deep dive into the mechanisms underlying it,” says Bronner.</p>



<p>Cleverly combining classical embryological methods with the latest genomic technologies to address fundamental questions in developmental biology is what makes Simões-Costa special, says Kelly Liu, a developmental biologist at Cornell University. He wants to understand not only what individual genes do, but how they work at a systems level, she says.</p>



<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>How does the genetic blueprint tell cells where they are in the embryo, and what they should be doing? How do cancer cells hijack the Warburg effect, and could understanding of that process lead to new treatments? These are some of the questions Simões-Costa wants to tackle next.</p>



<p>“It’s been 20 years since the Human Genome Project came to a conclusion,” he says, referring to the massive effort to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">read the human genetic instruction book</a>. “But there’s still so much mystery in the genetic code.”</p>



<p>Those mysteries, plus a deep passion for lab work, fuel Simões-Costa’s research. “Being at the bench is when I’m the happiest,” he says. He likens the delicate craft of performing precise surgeries on tissues and cells to meditation. “It does not get old.”</p>

<p>A long-sought “holy grail” in cryptography is poised to change the way we protect sensitive information.</p>



<p>Today’s standard encryption schemes take an all-or-nothing approach. Once scrambled, your data become inaccessible to anyone without the secret key.</p>



<p>This has allowed for secure e-mail communication, the proliferation of online transactions and digital signatures. It allows tax and medical records with sensitive personal information to be passed more safely across the internet. But if you give someone the secret key to access any of the data, all of the data become vulnerable.</p>





<p>What if instead you could assign specific people access to do very specific things with your data? Someone could get the information they need (the info you want them to have) without unlocking all of the original data. Bank details, credit card numbers, account passwords – all would remain hidden. That wholly different approach could also allow Netflix to make show recommendations without seeing your full viewing history, for example. Google could sort your e-mails without knowing what’s in them. And medical researchers could analyze data to identify risk factors for a disease without accessing any individual’s health information.</p>



<p>This and other cryptographic wonders now appear possible through a master tool called indistinguishability obfuscation.</p>



<p>“It’s a new tool – a very powerful tool,” says cryptographer Huijia (Rachel) Lin of the University of Washington in Seattle who <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1003">showed with colleagues in 2020 how to construct the tool.</a> “Once you have this superstrong power, then a lot of the other tasks are either special cases of it, or you can easily use this to realize [those tasks].”</p>



<p>Vinod Vaikuntanathan, a computer scientist at MIT who has worked with Lin on previous research, compares indistinguishability obfuscation, or iO, to a grand theory in physics that would unite gravity and quantum mechanics. “iO gives you a way to do a grand unification of cryptography in the sense that you can explain much of what cryptography does in a very simple way.”</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation is a form of program obfuscation, an approach that seeks to hide the inner workings of a computer program, not just the message or data itself. Though proposed in 1976 <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf">in a paper that set the foundation for modern cryptography</a>, program obfuscation proved difficult to achieve. For many years, people thought it might not be possible.</p>



<p>And in 2001, researchers showed that complete program obfuscation — called black-box obfuscation, in which input and output data are known but nothing else about a program can be discovered — is impossible. Yet indistinguishability obfuscation, proposed at the same time and shown to be incredibly powerful, doesn’t demand that <em>everything</em> about a program remain hidden. It instead deals with two programs that perform the same function. If the inner workings of those two programs can be hidden enough that the two can’t be distinguished from each other, indistinguishability obfuscation has been achieved. By hiding the secret key within the program itself, iO enables the delegation of specific data and data tasks to specific people.</p>



<p>Still, proposal after proposal for making iO work proved breakable. Researchers couldn’t figure out how to keep it safe from an adversary’s attacks. Lin says the approaches being used didn’t appeal to her. Researchers were leaning on what appeared to be “good enough” ways of getting at the problem that weren’t backed by rigorous mathematical proofs.</p>



<p>Lin instead wanted to break the problem down so she could understand each component and how they worked together. She wanted to approach the problem like a clock, with gears and nuts and bolts, instead of tangled like “a bowl of spaghetti.”</p>



<p>Through this strategy, Lin, along with Amit Sahai of UCLA and Aayush Jain, a Ph.D. student at UCLA at the time, demonstrated that iO is achievable. It would be secure based on standard assumptions in the field, the team proved, renewing hope in the tool.</p>



<p>“Of course, [Huijia] is brilliant,” Vaikuntanathan says, adding that her persistence is what really sets her apart. “It takes some guts to continue with an approach when essentially all the rest of the world thinks that it is not going to work.”</p>



<h4>Backstory</h4>



<p>Lin says she didn’t grow up with computers or fall in love with computer programming at an early age. As a student, she was interested in physics and strived to be good at everything. She started with computer science in college; a class in cryptography as a Ph.D. student at Cornell University “was really mind-opening,” she says. Her introduction to what are known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">zero-knowledge proofs</a> stands out in her memory.</p>



<p>A zero-knowledge proof says that a person can convince someone else that they know a secret without revealing the secret or any details about it. Say, for example, you knew that a number was the product of two prime numbers. Can you convince someone that fact is true without revealing what the primes are? How to prove that such a task is possible fascinated Lin. &nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Computer scientist Amit Sahai of UCLA explains the cryptography concept of zero-knowledge proof at five different levels.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cryptography includes a lot of these seeming paradoxes that prove to be possible. Indistinguishability obfuscation is yet another example – and Lin works on others, including secure multiparty computation, which allows a computer task to run across multiple people’s data without any person having to reveal their data to anyone in the group, or to a third party.</p>



<p>“I’m very attracted to these magical concepts,” Lin says. “The fun of it is to make this concept come to realization.”</p>



<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation is still far from real-world implementation. But Vaikuntanathan says it’s not unusual for first constructions of what will become important approaches to be impractical at first. “Wait for a decade,” he says.</p>

<p>Josep Cornella doesn’t deal in absolutes. While chemists typically draw rigid lines between organic and inorganic chemistry, Cornella, a researcher at Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, believes in just the opposite.</p>



<p>“You have to be open to cross boundaries,” he says, “and learn from it.” The fringes are “where the rich new things are.”</p>



<p>Cornella is an organic chemist by industry standards; he synthesizes molecules that contain carbon. But he’s put together a team from a wide range of backgrounds: inorganic chemists, physical organic chemists, computational chemists. Together, the team brainstorms novel approaches to designing new catalysts, so that chemical reactions essential to pharmaceuticals and agriculture can be made more efficient and friendly for the environment. Along the way, Cornella has unlocked mysteries that stumped chemists for years.</p>





<p>“He has told us about catalysts … that we didn’t have before, and which were just pipe dreams,” says Hosea Nelson, a chemist at Caltech who has not worked with Cornella.&nbsp;</p>





<h4>Bold idea</h4>



<p>When Cornella heard a speaker at a 2014 conference say that bismuth was nontoxic, he was sure it was a mistake. Bismuth is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/despite-lack-free-electrons-bismuth-superconducts">a heavy metal that sits between toxic lead and polonium on the periodic table</a>. But it is indeed relatively nontoxic — it’s even used in the over-the-counter nausea medicine Pepto-Bismol.</p>



<p>Still, bismuth remains poorly understood. That’s one reason it attracted him. “It was a rather forgotten element of the periodic table,” Cornella says. But, “it’s there for a reason.”</p>



<p>Cornella started wondering if an element like bismuth could be trained for use as a catalyst. For the last century, scientists have been using transition metals, like palladium and iron, as the main catalysts in industrial synthesis. “Could we actually train [bismuth] to do what these guys do so well?” he asked. It was a conceptual question that “was completely naïve, or maybe stupid.”</p>



<p>Far from stupid: His team successfully used bismuth as a catalyst to make a carbon-fluorine bond. And bismuth didn’t just mimic a transition metal’s role — it worked better. Only a small amount of bismuth was required, much less than the amount of transition metal needed to complete the same task.</p>



<p>“A lot of people, including myself and other [researchers] around the world, have spent a lot of time thinking about how to make bismuth reactions catalytic,” Nelson says. “He’s the guy who cracked that nut.”</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>While the bismuth research is “weird” and “exciting,” Cornella says, it remains a proof of concept. Bismuth, though cheap, is not as abundant as he had hoped, so it’s not a very sustainable option for industry.</p>



<p>But other Cornella team findings are already being used in the real world. In 2019, the group figured out how to make an alternative to Ni(COD)<sub>2</sub>, a finicky catalyst commonly used by chemists in the lab. If it’s not kept at freezing temperatures and protected from oxygen by a layer of inert gases, the nickel complex falls apart.</p>



<p>The alternative complex, developed by Lukas Nattmann, a Ph.D. student in Cornella’s lab at the time, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-019-0392-6">stays stable in oxygen at room temperature</a>. It’s a game changer: It saves energy and materials, and it’s universal. “You can basically take all those reactions that were developed for 60 years of Ni(COD)<sub>2</sub> and basically replace all of them with our catalyst, and it works just fine,” Cornella says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“A lot of people … have spent a lot of time thinking about how to make bismuth reactions catalytic. He&#8217;s the guy who cracked that nut.”</p><cite>Hosea Nelson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Cornella’s lab is also developing new reagents, substances that transform one material into another. The researchers are looking to transform atoms in functional groups — specific groupings of atoms that behave in specific ways regardless of the molecules they are found in — into other atoms in a single step. Doing these reactions in one step could cut preparation time from two weeks to a day, which would be very useful in the pharmaceutical industry</p>



<h4>Taking risks</h4>



<p>It’s the success that gets attention, but failure is “our daily basis,” Cornella says. “It’s a lot of failure.” As a student, when he couldn’t get a reaction to work, he’d set up a simple reaction called a TBS protection —&nbsp;the kind of reaction that’s impossible to get wrong —&nbsp;to remind himself that he wasn’t “completely useless.”</p>



<p>Today he runs a lab that champions taking risks. He encourages students to learn from one another about areas they know nothing about. For instance, a pure organic chemist could come into Cornella’s lab and leave with a good understanding of organometallic chemistry after spending long days working alongside a colleague who is an expert in that area.</p>



<p>To Cornella, this sharing of knowledge is crucial. “If you tackle a problem from just one unique perspective,” he says, “maybe you’re missing some stuff.”</p>



<p>While Cornella might not like absolutes, Phil Baran, who advised Cornella during his postdoctoral work at Scripps Research in San Diego, sees Cornella as fitting into one of two distinct categories:&nbsp;“There are chemists who do chemistry in order to eat, like it’s a job. And there are chemists who eat in order to do chemistry,” Baran says. Cornella fits into the latter group. “It’s his oxygen.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-pill-mucus-gut-deliver-medicine">This robotic pill clears mucus from the gut to deliver meds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mucus-wicking robotic pill may offer a new way to deliver meds.</p>



<p>The multivitamin-sized device houses a motor and a cargo hold for drugs, including ones that are typically given via injections or intravenously, such as insulin and some antibiotics. If people could take such drugs orally, they could potentially avoid daily shots or a hospital stay, which would be “a huge game changer,” says MIT biomedical engineer Shriya Srinivasan.</p>



<p>But drugs that enter the body via the mouth face a tough journey. They encounter churning stomach acid, raging digestive enzymes and sticky slicks of mucus in the gut. Intestinal mucus “sort of acts like Jell-O,” Srinivasan says. The goo can trap drug particles, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.</p>





<p>The new device, dubbed RoboCap, whisks away this problem. The pill uses surface grooves, studs and torpedo-inspired fins to scrub away intestinal mucus like a miniature brush whirling inside a bottle. In experiments in pigs, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abp9066">RoboCap tunneled through mucus lining the walls of the small intestine</a>, depositing insulin or the IV antibiotic vancomycin along the way, Srinivasan and colleagues report September 28 in <em>Science Robotics.</em> After churning for about 35 minutes, the pill continued its trip through the gut and eventually out of the body.</p>



<p>RoboCap is the latest pill-like gadget made to be swallowed.&nbsp; In 2019, some of the same researchers who developed RoboCap debuted a different device­ — one that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pills-needles-injection-medication">injects drugs by pricking the inside of the stomach</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/19</em>). That pea-sized injector was not designed to work in the small intestine, where some drugs are most easily absorbed. The RoboCap may also be able to deliver larger drug payloads, Srinivasan says.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-young-adults-personality-development">The pandemic may be stunting young adults’ personality development</a></h4>

              
                <p>The psychological development of young adults may have taken a hit, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>In typical times, people tend to become more conscientious and agreeable and less neurotic with age, a process known as psychological maturation. But in the United States, the pandemic seems to have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274542">reversed that personality trajectory</a>, especially among adults under 30, researchers report September 28 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. If those patterns persist, that could spell long-term trouble for this cohort, the researchers say.</p>





<p>“You get better as you go through life at being responsible, at coping with emotions and getting along with others,” says personality psychologist Rodica Damian of the University of Houston, who was not involved with this study. “The fact that in these young adults you see the opposite pattern does show stunted development.”</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Personalities shape how people think, feel and behave. Researchers often assess a person’s personality profile along five core traits: neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">openness to experience</a> (<em>SN: 9/1/21</em>). Over time, these traits change slightly in individuals; neuroticism tends to decrease, for example, while agreeableness typically improves.</p>



<p>The pandemic, though, may be upending those typical trend lines. Even after factoring out expected changes, researchers in the new study observed about a decade’s worth of personality change, averaged across all study participants, in just three years — but going in the opposite of the expected direction. Young adults showed the greatest change in certain traits. Middle-aged adults — 30 to 64 years old — showed more change across all traits. The personalities of older adults, meanwhile, stayed largely unchanged.</p>



<p>Such age differences make intuitive sense to personality psychologist Wiebke Bleidorn of the University of Zurich. “The density of experiences in adolescence and young adulthood is so much higher” than in later life, says Bleidorn, who was not involved with the study. “If you miss out on your senior year of high school, you can’t get that back.”</p>





<p>To look at personality change in the United States before and during the pandemic, personality psychologist Angelina Sutin and colleagues analyzed data from the <a href="https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php">Understanding America Study</a>.</p>



<p>This survey looks at how attitudes and behaviors in the country change in response to major events, such as the 2020 presidential election and the ongoing pandemic. Among those surveyed, roughly 7,000 people — ranging in age from 18 to 109 — took a personality inventory at least once in the six years prior to the pandemic and once during the pandemic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on those responses, neuroticism overall in the United States dropped slightly in 2020, during the first year of the pandemic. That finding mirrors what the researchers found with a different dataset two years ago, when they reported that neuroticism <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237056">declined in adults during the first six weeks of the pandemic</a>. But the new findings include data from 2021 and 2022, which show that the dip was fleeting.</p>



<p>That initial dip was probably due to the sense of solidarity that emerged in the health crisis’s earlier months, along with people attributing their worries to the crisis rather than their own internal state, says Sutin, of Florida State University in Tallahassee. “In the second year, all that support fell apart.”</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Average neuroticism scores have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. But the picture is nuanced, the researchers found. The 2020 dip was driven almost entirely by middle-aged participants and older adults. For those two groups, neuroticism scores continued to fall over the following years, albeit more slowly than before the pandemic. Neuroticism scores among young adults in 2021 and beyond, however, surpassed pre-pandemic levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, conscientiousness and agreeableness scores also declined among middle-aged adults in 2021 and early 2022, but the drop wasn’t nearly as steep as the one observed among young adults.</p>



<p>The findings are troubling, Sutin says. “We know these traits predict all sorts of long-term outcomes.”</p>



<p>For instance, high neuroticism links to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness. And low conscientiousness is linked to poor educational, work, health and relationship outcomes.</p>



<p>Still, whether these personality changes persist remains to be seen. It could be that young adults “missed the train” during a critical development period, Damian says. Maybe they would have gotten a college degree or pursued a more lucrative career without the pandemic. Or maybe these people can still reach their designated stop, just behind schedule.</p>



<p>“There are critical developmental periods and then there is plasticity,” Damian says. “We don’t know how it’s going to play out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-fossils-china-jaws-vertebrates">Ancient fish fossils highlight the strangeness of our vertebrate ancestors</a></h4>

              
                <p>My, what small teeth they had.</p>



<p>A newfound treasure trove of ancient fish fossils unearthed in southern China is opening a window into the earliest history of jawed vertebrates — a group that encompasses 99 percent of all living vertebrates on Earth, including humans. The fossil site, dated from 439 million to 436 million years ago, includes a revealing variety of never-before-seen small, toothy, bony fish species.</p>



<p>The diversity of the fossils at this one site not only <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05136-8">fills a glaring gap</a> in the fossil record, but also highlights the strangeness that such a gap exists, researchers report in the Sept. 29 <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>&#8220;These discoveries confirm what we’ve been arguing for&#8221; for years, based on smaller bits of fossils, says Michael Coates, a paleobiologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses had previously pointed to this time period, known as the early Silurian Period, as an era of rapid diversification of jawed vertebrates. But the toothy fishes seemed to have left few traces in the fossil record. Instead, as far as the fossil record was concerned, jawless fishes appeared to rule the waves at the time. And what jawed fishes have been preserved were rarely bony; most have been chondrichthyans, ancient cartilaginous ancestors of modern sharks and rays.</p>



<p>The Chongqing Lagerstätte — paleontologists’ word for a rich assemblage of diverse species all preserved together at one site — “fundamentally changes that picture,” write paleontologist You-an Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues in the study. The site is teeming with toothy, bony fishes, particularly armored placoderms, but bears just one chondrichthyan.</p>

<p>The first creatures to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-vertebrates-earth-arose-shallow-coastal-waters">develop a backbone</a> were fish, and they did it around 480 million years ago (<em>SN: 10/25/18</em>). Genetic analyses have suggested that by about 450 million years ago, those fish also developed jaws, the better to chomp each other with. But the earliest complete fossils of such jawed fish appear relatively late in the fossil record, about 425 million years ago. By the Devonian Period, which spanned from 419 million to 359 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devonian-swimming-revolution-oceans-may-have-never-happened">jawed fishes were a global phenomenon</a>, earning that era the nickname “Age of Fishes” (<em>SN: 7/17/18</em>).  </p>



<p>The discovery also hints that the ancestor of both types of jawed fishes, bony and<br>cartilaginous, could have arisen earlier than thought, Coates says. It’s possible that the last common ancestor of modern jawed vertebrates appeared <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-barrage-ancient-marine-life-boom-not-linked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event</a>, which began around 471 million years ago (<em>SN: 1/24/17</em>). To date, scientists have found only three varieties of fish body fossils dating to that time period, all jawless, finless and &#8220;vaguely resembling a super-sized armor-plated tadpole,&#8221; Coates<br>adds.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at a few of the newly discovered fishy denizens of the Chongqing Lagerstätte.</p>



<h4>Little but fierce</h4>



<p>About 20 separate specimens of a little fish that the researchers have called <em>Xiushanosteus mirabilis</em> were found at the Chongqing site. Those finds make the animal the most abundant type of fish in that fossil assemblage.</p>



<p><em>X. mirabilis</em> was only about 30 millimeters long, about the length of a paper clip, but it bears a strong resemblance to larger armored placoderms to come in the future: It had a broad, bony head shield and a body covered in small, diamond-shaped scales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2.jpg" alt="illustration of Xiushanosteus mirabilis" class="wp-image-3117816" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117816">The head-to-tail preservation of fossils of <em>Xiushanosteus mirabilis</em> (shown in an artist’s rendition) has allowed researchers to reconstruct the fish’s anatomy in detail.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117816">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The surprising abundance of this type of fish at a site from the early Silurian Period might just be due to lucky fossilization conditions — the small, delicate bones of <em>X. mirabilis</em> and the other jawed fishes found at Chongqing would be harder to preserve than the larger jawless specimens of the time, or the more robust toothy bony fishes of the later Devonian Period. But another possibility is that this site is an outlier in its time that just happened to be popular with the placoderms.</p>



<h4>A heavily armored, diminutive shark</h4>



<p>Two types of jawed fish arose around 450 million years ago — and both make an appearance at the Chongqing site. The new site is remarkable for its diversity of osteichthyans, bony jawed fishes like <em>X. mirabilis</em>. But cartilaginous <em>Shenacanthus vermiformis</em> also spent some time in this environment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3.jpg" alt="reconstruction of Shenacanthus vermiformis" class="wp-image-3117817" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117817"><em>Shenacanthus vermiformis </em>(shown in this reconstruction) was a tiny, but armored cartilaginous fish found alongside its bony neighbors at the new Chinese fossil site.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117817">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>S. vermiformis </em>is represented by only a single specimen at Chongqing, but like <em>X. mirabilis</em>, it is excellently preserved from head to tail. It was diminutive too, just 22 millimeters long. Though it had a similar body plan to other chondrichthyans, it did differ in one key way: Like <em>X. mirabilis</em>, <em>S. vermiformis</em> was heavily armored, with extensive plates on its underside and back.</p>



<h4>A time of transition</h4>



<p>The Chinese site isn’t just shedding light on ancient jawed fish — it offers a window into the evolutionary transition of body features from jawless to jawed species. One newly discovered jawless creature, dubbed <em>Tujiaaspis vividus</em>, turns out to be closely related to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04897-6">a group of jawed fishes called galeaspids</a>, researchers report in a separate paper in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4.jpg" alt="reconstruction of Tujiaaspis vividus" class="wp-image-3117815" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4.jpg 1440w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-1380x776.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117815">The excellent preservation of the jawless fish&nbsp;<em>Tujiaaspis vividus </em>(shown in this reconstruction)<em>&nbsp;</em>is offering new insights into the evolution of fins in its later jawed cousins.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117815">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The well-preserved fossils of <em>T. vividus</em> open up new opportunities to learn how its jawed relatives acquired their arrangements of fins, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02973-5">a transition for which there has been little previous evidence</a>, writes Matt Friedman, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a commentary in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. That’s because galeaspids have distinctive head shields, but scientists haven’t previously been able to peer beneath these fossilized shields to study the hidden anatomy.</p>



<p>Thanks to these close relatives, the researchers pieced together how paired fins in the jawless fish evolved in stages to become separate pectoral and pelvic fins in their jawed cousins. Such fins are the precursors of arms and legs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-tetrapods-may-have-emerged-salty-estuaries">in later tetrapods</a> (<em>SN: 5/30/18</em>).</p>
