                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/f82GlklEH5E/">Dopamine control of prolactin secretion: hierarchy is the key! (by Cleyde Helena)</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>In women, a major role of prolactin is to initiate and sustain pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland is important for pregnancy maintenance and prolactin levels are correlated with miscarriage occurrence. When prolactin levels fail to increase properly, there is a higher risk of miscarriage<sup>1</sup>. But prolactin levels are also important during the female reproductive cycle – as increased prolactin secretion can cause infertility by inhibiting the release of hormones that trigger ovulation. So prolactin levels cannot be too high to allow ovulation and pregnancy to occur, but also have to increase at a proper rate during early pregnancy to ensure pregnancy success. But how the body carefully regulates prolactin in real time has been a mystery – until now.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation of prolactin secretion</strong></p>
<p>The body controls its hormonal release by means of positive and negative feedback. In a general way, hormones secreted in the hypothalamus (area of the brain that controls the body’s homeostasis) stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete several hormones. These hormones enter the blood stream and act in peripheral target glands, stimulating further hormonal release (positive feedback). Subsequently, those hormones secreted by the target glands reach back to where the process started, suppressing hormonal secretion in both hypothalamus and pituitary (negative feedback). Like your home thermostat, sensing when your house is getting too warm, and turning on the air conditioner. Once the optimal temperature is reached, the air conditioner is turned back off.</p>
<p>But prolactin is different. It lacks a target peripheral gland, and therefore is not regulated through the standard negative feedback mechanisms that resemble your thermostat. Unlike other pituitary hormones that are stimulated by the hypothalamus, prolactin secretion is controlled by inhibitory dopaminergic inputs, produced in the tuberoinfundibular region of the hypothalamus (TIDA). We know that dopamine inhibits prolactin (and prolactin in turn, stimulates dopamine), but we do not know the temporal relationship among these players. The activity of dopaminergic neurons is very fast, firing in bursts of spikes happening at 20 seconds intervals<sup>2</sup>. Prolactin response, in turn, occurs in a much slower way. So how does all this rapid activity of dopaminergic neurons translate into dopamine release at the median eminence and subsequent (slower) prolactin secretion?</p>
<p>In a recent study published in PNAS, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/9/2379.abstract">Romano and colleagues</a> used an innovative new approach to investigate real time interaction between dopamine and prolactin. The researchers were able to measure dopaminergic release from TIDA neurons, correlating it to prolactin levels in freely moving mice, in real time, for several days! They implanted several miniaturized carbon fibers directly into the median eminence of female mice. This area is the part of the hypothalamus where the hormones are released, being the connection between brain and pituitary gland.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19315" style="width: 480px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-19315" height="307" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1-300x192.jpg" width="480" /></a>This figure show how TIDA neurons release dopamine at the level of the median eminence.</figure>
<p><strong>There is a hierarchical relationship between different dopaminergic neurons </strong></p>
<p>By analyzing dopaminergic secretion over several days, the authors found that dopamine release was more frequent during the night, and that periods of intense dopaminergic activity were always followed by periods of silence. This makes sense within the feedback nature of the neuroendocrinology system, where hormones are released in pulses, to prevent down-regulation of target receptors. Elevated constant hormonal levels results in a decrease in the quantity of the hormone receptor, resulting in decreased sensitivity (down-regulation).</p>
<p>Analyzing dopaminergic currents on the basis of their shape, the authors realized that the dopaminergic neurons are stereotypically organized in distinct groups, with different and specific firing rates. These stereotypical features of the dopaminergic neurons were consistent between different animals and different days of recording.  When dual-carbon fiber recordings were performed in two distinct dopaminergic neurons 500 μm from each other, the authors discovered that dopaminergic firing events were coordinated within minutes during most of the recordings. Therefore, the activity from all those different TIDA groups is somehow coordinated over a range of minutes before dopaminergic release in the median eminence.</p>
<p><strong>Novel integrated view of how dopamine controls prolactin secretion </strong></p>
<p>Although all TIDA neurons release dopamine in the median eminence, there are different subsets of TIDA neurons, with similar firing patterns among the members of the same group, but not coordinated with other groups (those different TIDA groups are shown in the figure as green, orange, and magenta). Each one of those groups of TIDA neurons follows a stereotyped sequence of events. Meaning that locally, there is an organization of frequencies and the firing events occur as sequences (Short-term interaction). Those local dopaminergic patterns are fine-tuned within pre-established time windows, being totally integrated in the median eminence, before actual dopaminergic release (Long-term interaction).</p>
<p>This type of hierarchical organization of rhythmic activity has been previously seen in several other brain regions, and evolutionarily preserved among several species<sup>3</sup>. This repetitive rhythmic neural activity generates neural oscillations, which can vary in magnitude and/or frequency. In brain regions with hierarchical organization, several different neuronal oscillators form a linear progression, with slower oscillations regulating the amplitude (size) of the faster ones. This serves as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks to the fast, and local cortical, integrating functional systems across multiple spatial and time scales.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a study has been capable to show that the median eminence is capable of integrating hierarchical neuronal oscillating networks, in a specific spatio-temporal pattern. This study opens a whole new path to investigate how hormonal rhythms can occur on multiple time-scales, ranging from minutes and days to seasons, helping to explain slow endocrine events such as reproduction, growth, metabolism, and stress.</p>

A new article posted on preprint site bioRxiv has generated a lot of interest among neuroscientists on Twitter. The article reports the existence of 'functional connectivity' between surgically disconnected distant brain regions using fMRI, something that in theory shouldn't be possible.

This is big news, if true, because it suggests that fMRI functional connectivity isn't entirely a reflection of actual signalling between brain areas. Rather, something else must be able to produce connectivi

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/21/new-developments-in-treating-parkinsons-disease/">New Developments in Treating Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 10 million people worldwide. The disease primarily results from selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta part of the brain. Its key clinical features include motor symptoms of rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. However, recent findings have confirmed that the disease is also characterized by its non-motor symptoms that appear before the onset of motor symptoms, strongly suggesting that Parkinson’s disease is not motor-specific. </p>
<p>The pre-motor phase is mainly characterized by olfactory abnormality, rapid eye movement behavior, and constipation. In addition, the patient may also experience somnolence, apathy, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Although the disease is not curable, currently available treatments alleviate symptoms, improve the quality of life and prolong survival. This article aims to review some of the recent developments that can make a difference to the patient’s quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Levodopa: the long-time gold standard for PD</strong></p>
<p>To date, levodopa (a dopamine precursor) has been considered as the most effective drug for controlling both motor and non-motor symptoms. Hence, it is regarded as the long-time gold standard for treating PD. However, as the disease progresses (4–5 years after the onset), the ability of the drug to smooth out symptoms declines, and the patients start to experience motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, i.e., excessive involuntary abnormal movements. The motor fluctuations shift between ON-time, a state when the drug is effective and symptoms are controlled, and OFF-time, a period during which control of symptoms is lost. To overcome this limitation, levodopa is usually combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to diminish rapid metabolism of levodopa in the periphery and thereby increase its availability for uptake into the brain. Recent research has further improved this add-on therapy to levodopa (i.e., levodopa/carbidopa) to provide sustained-release of levodopa and thereby improve motor fluctuations in PD patients.</p>
<p><strong>New adjunct therapy to levodopa</strong></p>
<p>Recently, a novel extended-release formulation of levodopa/carbidopa has been introduced in the US market with the name IPX066. This newly designed formulation features both the immediate and extended release properties of carbidopa/levodopa, thus it allows for both immediate and longer duration clinical benefits. IPX066 pills can be taken orally and are recommended for all PD patients.</p>
<p>In two clinical trials, the efficacy of IPX066 was tested in both early and advanced PD patients. In these patients, the administration of IPX066 significantly reduced the OFF-time and increased the ON-time without causing dyskinesia.  No serious drug-related adverse effects were reported, although some patients experienced nausea, headache, dizziness, and insomnia.</p>
<p>Concurrently, another novel improved formulation of levodopa is XP21279. This drug is not available on the market as it is still in the earlier phases of clinical development. The XP21279 is a levodopa prodrug that is readily absorbed in the small intestine where it is metabolized into levodopa. The levodopa then enters the plasma and transfers into the brain. The efficacy of XP21279 was tested in a clinical trial conducted on 14 PD patients with motor fluctuations. Out of 10 patients who completed the study, 6 patients showed a 30% reduction in OFF-time, whereas ON-time was not affected.</p>
<p>Opicapone (trade name ONgentys®) is another novel drug that is used as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/carbidopa for mitigating motor complications in patients with PD. The drug was approved by the European Commission in July 2016. This is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that acts by blocking an enzyme that metabolizes levodopa, enhancing its efficacy and thereby significantly improving motor fluctuations. Unlike other COMT inhibitors such as tolcapone and entacaopne, opicapone is not associated with liver toxicity, as confirmed by experimental studies in animals.</p>
<p>The use of opicapone as adjunctive therapy to levodopa was investigated in two clinical trials: i) 14- to 15-week, double-blind, multinational trial; and ii) 1-year, open-label extension study in the same patients. The results were promising. Administration of opicapone (50 mg/day) caused a significant improvement in motor fluctuations in patients during the double blind trials. The opicapone-mediated improvements in motor fluctuations were maintained in the 1-year extension study. There were few reports of dyskinesia and decreased drug effects along with other common adverse effects, such as constipation, insomnia, and dry mouth, showed no drug relationship.</p>
<p>Safinamide, a highly selective MAO-B inhibitor, has been newly introduced as an add-on therapy to levodopa in mid-to-late-stage PD. The efficacy of safinamide as an adjunct to levodopa was tested in clinical trials of 6 months, 8 months, and 2 years, on middle to advanced-stage PD patients with motor fluctuations. The intake of safinamide (50–100 mg daily) in these patients had drastically increased ON-time without increased dyskinesia. The beneficial effect of increased ON-time was maintained in both 18 month and 2 year extension studies. In addition, the use of safinamide in these patients improved daily living, depression, clinical status, and quality of life.</p>
<p>In addition to levodopa, safinamide is also used as an add-on therapy to dopaminergic agonists in early-stage PD. Administration of safinamide at a dose of 100–200 mg/day was found as an effective PD therapy in combination with dopaminergic agonists.</p>
<p>Although we still have no cure for Parkinson’s disease, recent developments have helped to improve symptomatic therapy, allowing patients to experience a better quality of life.</p>

<img alt="© jarun011 / Fotolia" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia-Hemophilia-positive-jarun011-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Bleeding disorders often arise when there is a problem with the clotting process. Hemostasis is the process by which the body arrests bleeding via the damaged blood vessels and it involves three major steps: vasoconstriction, formation of a temporary blockage (platelet plug), and blood coagulation. When injury causes a blood vessel to bleed, vascular constriction limits the flow of blood to the injured area. The vessel wall injury, via a series of reactions, triggers the attachment and activation of platelets which aggregates at the site of injury. Platelets adhere to collagen which becomes exposed in the endothelial cell lining of blood vessels at the site of injury creating the platelet plug. Initial platelet adhesion is to von Willebrand factor, a major component in the blood coagulation process. Coagulation factor VIII circulates in the blood stream in an inactive form when bound to von Willebrand factor.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8866" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="© science photo / Fotolia" class="size-medium wp-image-8866" height="240" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia_69426835_Subscription_Yearly_XXL.jpg-smaller-300x240.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© science photo / Fotolia</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>When injury to a blood vessel occurs, factor VIII becomes activated and separates from von Willebrand factor and interacts with factor IX, another coagulation factor. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F8">blood clot</a>. Activation of a sequence of blood clotting factors generates thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin mesh is then produced around the hemostatic plug in turn strengthening the clot.</p>
<p>von Willebrand disease is the most common type of bleeding disorder and is <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/vwd/#what_is_von_willebrand_disease">usually less severe</a> in comparison to other bleeding disorders. It occurs due to decrease in or malfunctioning von Willebrand factor activity which ultimately affects the hemostasis process and slows the formation of blood clots resulting in prolonged bleeding episodes. It is estimated that around 1% of the world’s population is affected by von Willebrand disease.</p>
<p>Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder where the blood is unable to clot properly. It can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding after injury or surgery. Those who suffer from hemophilia can bleed longer than usual, although <a href="https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=646">not faster</a>. There are two main types of hemophilia which are hemophilia A and hemophilia B with the former being the most common of the two. Although it is the most common type of hemophilia, it is a rare condition and it affects about <a href="http://haemophilia.org.uk/bleeding-disorders/haemophilia-a/">one in every 10,000 males</a> whilst hemophilia B affects <a href="http://haemophilia.org.uk/bleeding-disorders/haemophilia-b/">one in every 50,000 males</a>. The condition arises when a mutation or change occurs in one of the genes that provide instructions for making the clotting factor proteins needed to form a blood clot thus resulting in reduced production or deficiency of the respective clotting factor. The F8 gene and F9 gene, both situated on the X-chromosome, provides the instructions for producing coagulation factors VIII and IX respectively. A mutation in the F8 gene causes hemophilia A whilst a mutation in the F9 gene results in hemophilia B. Suffers therefore have low levels of either clotting factor VIII or IX and the severity is determined by the level of the factor in the blood.</p>

<p>Due to the sex-linkage of the disorder, the <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia">prominence</a> amongst male is greater than in females. Although the disorder mainly affects males, females can be carriers of the affected gene and experience symptoms. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder. However, it has been found that in about a <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia">third</a> of new diagnoses there is no previous family history. This could be due to <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/hemophilia/types-of-hemophilia.php">new or spontaneous genetic mutations</a>. It is estimated that worldwide, around 400,000 people are living with hemophilia with 20,000 of these cases present in the <a href="http://www.hemophiliafed.org/bleeding-disorders/hemophilia/">United States</a> and around 6,000 in the <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia">United Kingdom</a>. Main symptoms can include a prolonged bleeding from cuts, a tendency to bruise easily especially in early childhood, and bleeding into joints and muscles causing pain, swelling, and stiffness which can result in joint deformity and limitation of movement if left untreated. Women can experience prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and the <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms">excessive blood loss</a> can lead to anemia resulting in weakness and fatigue. In general, during the process of ovulation, women can develop simple/ functional ovarian cysts which are small and not usually problematic. However, it has been found that carriers of hemophilia are more likely to experience significant bleeding during ovulation and have a greater risk of bleeding into these simple cysts which then become <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms">hemorrhagic ovarian cysts</a> that can cause considerable pain and may require urgent medical intervention. Women with hemophilia are also more likely to have postpartum bleeding following <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms">childbirth</a>.</p>
<p>It has been reported that of the 400,000 people living with hemophilia worldwide, only around <a href="https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=642">25%</a> receive adequate treatment. The recommended treatment plan for hemophilia depends on the severity of the condition. The main treatment for hemophilia is <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia/treatment">replacement therapy</a> whereby the missing clotting factor is slowly dripped or injected into a vein. A CDC- sponsored <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa067659#t=article">randomised clinical trial</a> found that regular treatment to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII) was effective in preventing joint damage and decreased the frequency of joint and other hemorrhages in young boys with severe hemophilia. The children who were treated on a regular basis also had less evidence of joint damage by 6 years of age than did those who were treated after a bleed had commenced.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8865" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="© curlymary / Fotolia" class="size-medium wp-image-8865" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia-Medic-with-tube-of-blood-takes-a-blood-test.-World-hemophilia-day-curlymary-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© curlymary / Fotolia</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>However, factor replacement therapy has its limitations as it has been found that approximately <a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-014-0019-8">25–30%</a> of people with severe hemophilia A and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934290/">1–5%</a> of people with severe hemophilia B develop an antibody (inhibitor) to the treatment which causes major complications.</p>
<p>There are a number of new therapies under development which include gene therapy where researchers are investigating means by which the faulty genes that cause bleeding disorders such as hemophilia can be corrected. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemophilia/research.html">Research</a> is also being conducted to design and implement interventions that will help combat complications. Although there is no cure for hemophilia, with the right treatment, care, and lifestyle changes, those who suffer from hemophilia can lead fulfilled lives.</p>

<img alt="Word Cloud(1)" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Word-Cloud1-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Rheumatology is a branch of medicine that is mainly concerned with disorders of joints, soft tissues, autoimmune diseases, vasculitis, and heritable connective tissue disorders – collectively known as rheumatic diseases. As these disorders generally involve inflammation/the immune system, rheumatology is generally seen as increasingly moving in the direction of autoimmunity.</p>
<p>The most common, and therefore well studied, rheumatic diseases are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, which cause pain and inflammation of joints and affect approximately 8.5 million people in the UK alone. However, these two conditions are just a couple of examples of rheumatic diseases as this umbrella term incorporates over 200 disorders. As illustrated in the figure above, these include conditions such as giant cell arteritis, fibromyalgia, Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, gout and lupus, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Given the nature of these conditions, they are often referred to as systematic and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In addition to the burden of the rheumatic diseases themselves, it is now becoming clear that there are an increasing number of co-morbidities associated with rheumatic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignancies and infections.</p>
<p>It is upon this background that <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> is being launched to provide the rheumatology community with an open access avenue to disseminate research findings into these diseases with the ultimate aim of improving patient care. As a member of the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC</em> series</a>, the ethos of <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will be <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/12/05/vital-importance-inclusive/">open and inclusive</a>, and the Journal will not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. Like other journals in the <em>BMC </em>series, submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed to assess scientific validity. Furthermore, as an open access peer-reviewed journal, published articles will be freely available to all readers whatever their location.</p>
<p>The remit of <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a> will be to consider research on all aspects of the prevention, treatment and management of rheumatic diseases, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but the Journal will place a special emphasis on systemic and inflammatory conditions and connective tissue diseases, along with related co-morbidities.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a> will complement and expand the open access journal portfolio within the area of rheumatology at BioMed Central and will be a sister journal to <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> within the <em>BMC</em> series. Although there is some overlap in scope, <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> and <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em> will sit very comfortably alongside each other: <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em> will have a focus on studies with a definite musculoskeletal component (i.e. bone, cartilage, tendon etc.), whereas <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will cover all areas of rheumatology, including systemic conditions and related co-morbidities, which are topics that will fall outside the scope of <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em>.</p>
<p>To encompass the spectrum of rheumatology research, <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will be supported by an international <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board">Editorial Board</a>, with oversight from three expert Section Editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Clinical rheumatology’ edited by Susan Goodman (Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, USA)</li>
<li>‘Epidemiology and public health’ section edited by Edward Roddy (Keele University, UK)</li>
<li>‘Pre-clincial and translational science’ edited by Alessia Alunno (University of Perugia, Italy)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Section Editors will be pleased to consider papers on all aspects of rheumatology across a variety of article types, including <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-article">Research articles</a> and <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/case-report">Case reports</a>, as well <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/study-protocol">Study protocols</a> for proposed or ongoing prospective clinical research.</p>
<p>Why not submit your next paper to the journal? <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will have its launch issue in November 2017, so submit now and be part of the journal’s launch.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about the journal, please do contact me, the journal’s Editor, by email (<a href="mailto:james.mockridge@biomedcentral.com">james.mockridge@biomedcentral.com</a>).

<p>What do you take from this hypothetical headline: “Reading the Research Digest blog is associated with higher intelligence”? How about this one: “Reading this blog might increase your intelligence”? According to science writing guides like <a href="http://HealthNewsReview.org">HealthNewsReview.org</a>, taking the first correlational finding from a peer-reviewed article and reporting it for the public using the second wording, implying causation, is a sin of exaggeration, making a relationship appear more causal than the evidence suggests.</p>
<p>Yet this happens a lot. A 2014 <i>British Medical Journal</i> <i>(BMJ)</i> <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7015">article</a> showed these exaggerations to be rife in media coverage of correlational studies, with 81 per cent of news articles committing the sin. Dismayingly, one third of press releases were also guilty. These normally involve editorial input from professionals and often the scientists themselves, who should really know better. Reading about this, we might conclude that science communicators of all stripes need to get more familiar with the best practice of describing causality.</p>
<p>However, the authors of that <i>BMJ</i> analysis started to ponder whether readers interpret these headlines literally, or whether they draw their own conclusions. Now their research group has tested this for <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-52933-001/">a paper</a> in <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, and their findings suggest that while science writers need to pick up their game, science-writing guides also have some catching up to do.</p>
<p><span id="more-22882"></span></p>
<p>Rachel Adams and her colleagues at Cardiff University presented 71 online participants, average age 27, with real and modified headlines drawn from news stories about science, politics and sport. Take the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) Being breast fed makes children behave better</li>
<li>(B) Being breast fed is linked to better behaviour in children</li>
<li>(C) Being breast fed is associated with better behaviour in children</li>
</ul>
<p>Style guides consider causal claims on a ladder, with a simple causal statement (A) at the top, ambiguous causal statements like (B) somewhere below, and (C) being on the bottom rung, as it makes a correlational rather than a causal claim. But when the participants reviewed a series of these kind of statements, rating in each case how much the initial term was causing the final one, a different picture emerged. While they gave the first type of headline high scores for causality at 75 or more out of 100, they scored headlines in the style of B and C similarly, at around the 50/100 mark, suggesting that they saw them both as suggesting a moderate amount of causality. This was true across all topics, and unaffected by the participants’ level of science education.</p>
<p>In further experiments the researchers examined the effect of modifying a causal claim with a modal verbs – may, can, might and could – e.g. <i>Being breast fed may make children behave better</i>. Modal verbs introduce some uncertainty, and the style guides recommend them when research demonstrates causality but the claim may not be watertight, such as when based on small or unusual samples. Participants’ interpretations suggested that they saw “can make” as a pretty strong statement, weaker than a pure causal statement but above all the others, such  as “might make” – much as style guides suggest. But whereas the style guides claim that “may make” is a stronger causal statement than equivalent headlines using “might” and “could”, participants saw these three modifiers as interchangeable and understood them to severely weaken the causal claim, rating them at, or even below, the causality of a purely correlational statement.</p>
<p>Adams’ team concluded that readers do not have a highly sophisticated hierarchy of causality, but three broad categories: direct cause, can cause, and large bucket of moderate cause statements, including weaker modals, ambiguous statements, and even correlation itself. This evidence suggests we should be a bit more forgiving of press offices: re-analysing the <i>BMJ</i> data from 2014 found that only one fifth of articles involved an exaggeration as defined in terms of how readers were likely to have interpreted them. Style guides may want to reconsider their recommendations.</p>
<p>One final point: the research group also looked at the uptake of science coverage – how much a piece was read and shared – and found no evidence that exaggeration was of any benefit in increasing coverage. That’s heartening for science writers who prefer to focus on telling the truth in an engaging way rather than resorting to hype.</p>

<img alt="An American alligator attacks an invasive Burmese python in Florida. Can the humble microbe help us predict which species will become successful invaders?" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Gator_and_Python-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Current global changes impact all biota. There are those species that can utilize the changes and those that will have a hard time coping with the human induced changes. Invaders are among the winners and pose a serious threat to native species. Mitigation of the problems associated with invaders has sparked interest in predicting which type of invader species and genotypes could become invaders. However, invasion is always an interplay of the invader’s and resident community’s characteristics. Therefore one should remember that in the changing world anthropogenic change affects not only the invader but also community composition. Moreover, different areas are known to harbour different kinds of species assemblages. It is, thus, worthwhile to ask which kinds of communities could be more vulnerable to invasions.</p>
<p>Let’s make it clear that this idea is by no means new. Many researchers since Charles Darwin and Charles S. Elton have done research on this subject: correlating species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and relatedness between the community and the invader. Despite decades of work on invasions and coexistence mechanisms the evidence seems to be mixed, regardless of the study taxa and methodology. One thing, however, is rather clearly evident: more systems where key aspects of invasion theories can be manipulated are in demand, as from naturally occurring invasions it is hard to explicitly show the determinants of invasions.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0126-z">In our recent publication in <em>BMC Ecology</em> </a>we present a microbial system for the study of invasion theories, and use it to show that diversity in phylogenetic similarity between the invader and the community members (i.e. the closeness of their evolutionary relationships) affects invasion success. Those communities with diversity in phylogenetic distances to invaders resist invasions better than communities that are less diverse in their phylogenetic relationships to an invader.</p>
<p>This is actually a rather novel finding, as effects of diversity on invasions have been studied mostly at ecological level (species diversity), and not at the evolutionary level of phylogenetic diversity. Since invasion was explained by a metric that describes relatedness between the invader and the community our result casts a doubt on easy recognition of potential invaders, or vulnerable communities. Invader and community act together in the invasion process.</p>
<p>Blaah – microbes – you might think, close the link, and forget that lots of ecological and evolutionary theory has been created and tested with microbes. But, microbes invade as well, and knowing about microbial invasions of different habitats – lakes, pools, foods, teeth, wounds, and lungs – has direct implications for our day-to-day life.</p>

Other species used in the experiment can be seen as white colonies without a halo.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Emmi Räsänen</div></figure>
<p>In our experiments we used the opportunistic environmentally growing pathogen <em>Serratia marcescens</em> as an invader. This species infects literally everything. For healthy humans, it is rather harmless, but it hosts range span from corals and plants to insects. Several species of insects, when infected, die within few days.</p>
<p>The coolest thing in our system is that we can identify it from other bacteria with very simple agar plating. In addition to red pigment, <em>S. marcescens</em> creates a halo around its colonies in DNAse agar plates, whereas other bacteria in our system are seen as white colonies without a halo. The other bacteria are traditional “lab rats” in microbiology like <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas species</em>.</p>
<p>This system can be used to test several key hypotheses concerning invasions; not only by manipulating species in the community but also their evolutionary background. Easily culturable bacteria can be put through experimental evolution with ease. Such new adapted genotypes can be used to create different invasion scenarios. For example mimicking anthropogenic change – and this is the direction where we are going to head next.</p>

<p>At least one in four readers of this post will die of cancer. This is a simple statistic that leads rationally thinking people to treat the possibility as very likely. And this is what many do: they try to adopt a lifestyle that minimises the risk to some degree. But how do we know what minimises and what increases this risk? Of course, by listening to experts, the best of whom are scientists who research these things. However, whenever there is disquiet brought about by uncertainty, self-titled experts come out of the woodwork. Discussion of factors increasing the risk of cancer is today not only the domain of medical doctors and psycho-oncologists, but is also engaged in by some alternative medicine proponents, pseudopsychologists, and fringe psychotherapists, whose opinions are disseminated by journalists, some more thorough than others (<a href="https://books.google.pl/books/about/50_Great_Myths_of_Popular_Psychology.html?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;redir_esc=y">see myth #26 in <em>50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology</em> for more background</a>).</p>
<p>Among these opinions is the common claim that negative thinking, pessimism, and stress create the conditions for the cells in our body to run amok, and for cancer to develop. Similar declarations accompany therapeutic propositions for changing our way of thinking into a more positive one that will protect us from cancer, or even cure us of the disease. Should you, therefore, begin to fear the possibility of cancer if you are not prone to optimism, or – even worse – have bouts of depression?</p>
<p><span id="more-22827"></span></p>
<p>In <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.4084/abstract">a paper</a> published recently in <em>Psycho-Oncology</em>, four Korean scholars have attempted to provide answers to this question by way of meta-analysis. The first difficulty they encountered was the heterogeneity of the assessment of depression in the published literature. To clarify the mixed findings, they limited data to articles that used a reliable method of defining depression based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and/or the International Classification of Disease (ICD). Only nine studies fulfilled their criteria.</p>
<p>What are the results? Although some low-quality studies found that patients with depressive disorder were at increased risk for cancer, overall the meta-analysis did not demonstrate that patients with clinically diagnosed depressive disorder had an increased risk of developing cancer relative to the general population.</p>
<p>So should readers with depressive tendencies breathe a sigh of relief? In the researchers’ cautious opinion, it is possible that some epidemiological biases affecting the diagnosis of depressive disorder or cancer could have affected their findings, thus concealing a depression-cancer link. Another limitation of their study was the narrow research database: most existing findings were obtained from Western societies and cannot be generalized to other cultures. Additionally, cancer detection depends on screening programmes and the application of new technologies, which vary across countries. Antidepressant medication is also a potential confounder for the relationship between depression and cancer. Furthermore, in the researchers’ opinion too much difference between studies causes a potential problem when interpreting the combined results. Finally, they think that possible publication bias may have affected their review, with negative results (a lack of an association between depression and cancer) less likely to see the light of day.</p>
<p>Scientists write articles which are most often read by other scientists. The careful wording of conclusions is, in this context, essential. However, when cautious words of authors aware of the limitations facing their work are confronted with <a href="https://books.google.pl/books/about/Smile_Or_Die.html?id=YLb1148-VWcC&amp;redir_esc=y">the arrogant declarations of healers and falsehoods spread via the Internet and other media</a>, there is reason to fear that the former will be drowned out. The meta-analysis of the Korean scholars delivers data that are in agreement with a robust body of research. Many studies have shown that such factors as positive vs. negative attitudes, mood, emotions and stress have nothing to do with cancer (for example, see <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198568773.001.0001/acprof-9780198568773-chapter-28">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17955501">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824713">here</a>). Moreover, <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7516/548">some</a> of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561987">these studies</a> demonstrated that the relationship could even be the reverse of what is expected: depressed people and those who experienced more stress were less likely to get cancer than those who were positive and did not suffer from stress.</p>
<p>The conviction that positive thinking and emotions prevent the development of cancer, or can even cure it, is consistent with our need for control. We prefer to live with the conviction that we have control over something rather than it being out of our hands. Unfortunately, as a matter of fact, we are powerless to influence the overwhelming majority of cancer-inducing factors, and there are still others which simply remain unknown.</p>

<img alt="The Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, one of the many locations the researchers work took them too." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/IMG_4772_rainbowsmall-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Variation in environmental conditions across habitats has led to variation in life histories between species. To successfully reproduce and survive, an animal’s physiology, morphology and behaviour needs to be tuned to the environmental conditions of their habitat.</p>
<p>For example, environmental variation along a latitudinal gradient has led to consistent differences in vertebrate life histories. In most vertebrates tropical species lead a slower pace of life than temperate vertebrates. This is especially well studied in birds where it has been shown that tropical birds usually lay smaller clutches of eggs, but live longer than temperate species.</p>
<p>In temperate birds, the beginnings of each breeding season are challenging times for males. Upon arrival to their breeding grounds, they have to establish and defend a territory against other males. Once they have found a female that is willing to mate with them, she also has to be guarded against other males; especially during her fertile times just before egg-laying.</p>
<p>Territorial defence behaviour and mate-guarding is facilitated by the sex steroid hormone testosterone in many vertebrates. Accordingly, blood samples from breeding males often reveal elevated testosterone levels at the beginning of the breeding season.</p>
<p>In contrast, tropical birds are often resident and form life-long pair bonds with their mates. Is the breeding season for tropical males less challenging? Studies on testosterone levels of tropical birds have provided mixed results: while most tropical birds that have been tested so far have lower testosterone levels than usually measured in temperate ones, a number of tropical birds have now been found to have as high testosterone levels as their temperate counterparts. Do tropical species with high testosterone levels also have high levels of aggressive behaviour and song at the beginning of the breeding season?</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8849" style="width: 1290px;"><img alt="Male European stonechat" class="size-full wp-image-8849" height="854" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Stonechat_Saxicola_rubicola_male_Beaulieu_Hampshire.jpg" width="1280" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Male European stonechat</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Charles J Sharp</div></figure>
<p>Due to their extensive breeding range from Siberia to Southern Africa, common stonechats (<em>Saxicola spp</em>) are an excellent study system to determine whether testosterone, aggressive behaviour and song vary similarly during the breeding season at tropical and temperate latitudes. Tropical stonechats lay smaller clutches of eggs, have a longer lifespan and lower metabolic rates than their temperate conspecifics. They are residents and pair with their mates for life. Intriguingly, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X06001875">a previous study</a> found testosterone levels in Kenyan stonechats were as high as in German stonechats at the beginning of the breeding season.</p>
<p>Does this hold true for other tropical stonechat populations? Are tropical male stonechats as aggressive and sing as much as temperate males? To find this out we sampled multiple populations in tropical East Africa and temperate West and Central Europe.</p>
<p>Our quest took us to Masai villages, to the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, the steep hills of the Usambara and Pare mountains, to the grasslands of Kinangop, the gentle hills of the Ngong Hills and Ol Kalou and the slopes of Mount Meru and Mount Kenya in Tanzania and Kenya. In Europe it took us to grasslands and fields full of poppy below the impressive range of the Sierra Nevada and the medieval town of Ávila where we caught stonechats in the mountain ranges nearby. We went to the rugged, wild coast of the South of Ireland and to pastures in Germany.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8847" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="Birds had blood samples taken to allow later analysis of their testosterone levels." class="wp-image-8847 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Bird-handling-200x300.jpeg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Birds had blood samples taken to allow later analysis of testosterone levels.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>To answer our questions we caught male stonechats with baited traps and took small blood samples from their wing veins. Later testosterone concentrations were quantified in the endocrinology laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Germany. We tested their aggressive response by placing a stuffed male stonechat into the centre of their territories and playing back stonechat song. We analysed their song performance by recording males early in the morning when they sing most.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8846" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="By using this stuffed bird, combined with recorded songs, the researchers provoked aggressive responses from territorial males." class="wp-image-8846 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fake-bird-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">By using this stuffed bird, combined with recorded songs, the researchers provoked aggressive responses from territorial males.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Kim Mortega &amp; Beate Apfelbeck</div></figure>
<p>We found that tropical and temperate stonechats indeed have very similar testosterone levels during the breeding season. We also found no differences in aggressive behaviour. Both tropical and temperate male stonechats had the highest testosterone levels when they were caught and tested during nest-building – the period of highest female fertility. In contrast, temperate stonechats were singing much more than tropical ones at the beginning of the breeding season.</p>
<p>Thus, despite their very different life histories, their variation in migratory behaviour and stability of pair bonds, life seems to be equally challenging for tropical and temperate stonechats at the beginning of the breeding season. In one important point the tropical and temperate environments of stonechats do not differ: both allow only for a short breeding season. In consequence stonechats probably breed relatively synchronously at all latitudes, which may increase the risk of being cheated during the fertile period of females. Males may therefore profit from high testosterone levels during nest-building to aggressively guard their mates from other rival males.</p>
<p>In contrast, high song rates may be especially important for temperate males to attract a mate at the beginning of the breeding season and less so for tropical males that stay with their females year-round.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study suggests that short breeding seasons may be a major selective force for high peak testosterone levels during breeding regardless of latitude and pace of life, but that particular behaviors, in our case song, can be uncoupled from peak testosterone levels.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Reddit,</strong></p>
<p>My name is Shashwath Meda and I am a Senior Clinical Research Associate at Olin Neuropsychiatry, Hartford Hospital/Institute of Living. I am also joined by Dr. Godfrey Pearlson who is the Director of Olin Neuropsychiatry and a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University. A primary component of our research here at the center focuses on studying the effects of substance use on brain cognition and function.</p>
<p>We recently published a study titled <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172213&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=ama&amp;utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0417">Longitudinal influence of alcohol and marijuana use on academic performance in college students</a> in <em><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone">PLOS ONE</a></em>. In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana on academic GPA in 1142 freshman college students who were followed up longitudinally over a two-year time period. During this period, each month we collected data on their alcohol and marijuana use patterns while in college through a secure self-report website. In analyzing these data, we identified three substance-use groups, <strong>a)</strong> a group that used either no or very low amounts of both alcohol and marijuana, <strong>b)</strong> students that used no/low marijuana but medium-high amounts of alcohol and <strong>c)</strong> students that consumed medium-high quantities of both substances. Interestingly, we found almost no one that consumed no-low alcohol but high amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p>Our findings show that despite students having the same pre-baseline academic achievement as measured using the SAT scores, at the end of incoming semester those who heavily used either alcohol or alcohol+MJ had a significantly lower GPA compared to those who abstained or had very little of it. We also noticed that students who consumed fairly large quantities of alcohol alone (very little MJ) did not have a consistent decrease in GPA across the two-year period (we only noticed a significant decrease in GPA for the incoming semester). Finally, <strong>our follow up analysis suggested that those who moderated drug use over the period of the study could recover and perform better academically</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Shashwatch, thanks for doing this AMA it’s a great topic.</p>
<p>So the elephant in the room for any of these sorts of longitudinal studies is 3rd variables. For instance, it’s quite easy to make an argument that there could be personality or emotional or experiential differences that make someone more likely to consume alcohol and marijuana but also likely to decline in achievement. Do you think this is indeed a causal relationship whereby the combination of alcohol and weed is affecting cognitive ability?</p>

<p>Author SM: Hello – Thanks for the question. What you say is absolutely possible, however as we explicitly indicate in our paper, the analysis that we did just wasn’t geared towards examining any causality. We tried to somewhat alleviate effects of intermediate variables by controlling for baseline measured personality and emotional traits. However to properly investigate what you allude to requires a causal modelling analysis such as SEM etc. We plan on doing this in the near future at least on the baseline variables to see what the data shows us. Again this is just the tip of the iceberg, much more to come in the future years!</p>

<p><strong>How did you first become interested in the neurobiology of behaviour?</strong></p>
<p>I was inclined to study science in general and biology in particular already in my high-school years. After spending much of my youth outdoors observing all kinds of animals in the wild I started reading scientific books by all kinds of scientists. In the late eighties, nonlinear dynamics were very popular (at the time known as “chaos theory”), I learned about relativity, was fascinated by Quantum Mechanics, and read books by Konrad Lorenz on animal behavior, by Rupert Riedl on evolution and many other biologists. My compulsory one-year project was on the homing behavior in salmons.</p>
<p>So I was fascinated by big questions and thus broadly interested in the sciences, but the only area of biology I was sure I would never get into was neuroscience: I had read a book about the split-brain patients of Michael Gazzaniga’s, as well as Popper &amp; Eccles’ book “the self and its brain”. I was captivated by the question of how our mind works, of whether we had free will and how we can know anything with any kind of certainty, but what I read in these books seemed so incomprehensibly complicated that I was sure it was way too complex for me.</p>
<p>During my first undergraduate semesters I became particularly interested in developmental biology: how could a largely uniform zygote bring about a highly differentiated adult individual? However, just about the time when I started to realize that I found the actual work in this field mind-numbingly boring (seemingly endless pipetting of clear liquids into other clear liquids and then waiting for hours for a machine to complete its job), I attended the <em>Drosophila</em> neurogenetics lecture by Martin Heisenberg (youngest son of Werner of uncertainty principle fame) and was hooked! I learned that in this field, not only could I study the questions Gazzaniga, Eccles, Popper, etc. had been writing about, but that <em>Drosophila</em> may constitute an experimental system which at least would only make me feel dumb, incompetent and insufficient some of the time and not all the time. During this time, I also worked on a few projects in population and behavioral ecology. These areas also involved a lot of time spent with animals and sometimes their behavior, but the ecological and evolutionary aspects again seemed highly interesting but much more complex and intractable than I thought my limited intellectual capacity allowed me to master.</p>
<p>I completed all Dr. Heisenberg’s department had to offer in terms of lectures and courses and I was even more thrilled by the work than initially. Eventually, Dr. Heisenberg became my thesis advisor and continues to be my mentor to this day. He became the first of three critical mentors who went above and beyond any ‘supervisor’ duties, supporting me at every step of the way. Without them I wouldn’t have stood a chance of survival in science. The research topic of the neurobiology of spontaneous behavior and how feedback modulates this spontaneity in operant learning situations fascinates me to this day.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges and developments can we expect to see for this field in the next few years?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a scientist and not a prophet, so I find it difficult to make predictions, in particular about the future.</p>
<p>In general I think we are in the middle of a genuine paradigm shift in the neurosciences that probably started sometime in the early nineties. Until then, large sections of neuroscience operated under the impression that neurons, circuits and indeed entire nervous systems operated like the machines we engineer: passively receiving some input and generating output. The early work of the ethologists in the mid-late 20th century as well as later neurophysiological evidence from mollusks and other accessible animals contradicted this concept, but had little effect on the larger community, despite the Nobel Prize for Lorenz and the other ethologists. My thesis advisor, Martin Heisenberg, also contributed many contradicting experiments and provided cogent and evidence-based arguments without much effect. It probably was the converging flood of evidence from a variety of disparate fields around the turn of the century, not the least the discovery of resting-state network in the human brain, that started shifting peoples’ attitudes. In addition to the work in humans, ethological work showed that the kind of reproducible behavior neuroscientists love to study in the lab carry the risk of being exploited in the wild, raising issues about how generalizable any knowledge from this kind of behaviors is to other behaviors. Many new preparations were developed where experimentally isolated nervous systems (‘brain in a vat’) generated organized, ethologically relevant spontaneous activity in the absence of any sensory organs. Evolutionary work seemed to suggest that the ancestral functional organization of nervous systems was to generate activity first and have sensory input modulate that activity later. Perhaps most amusingly, basic neuroscience research that had started in the 1980s suddenly became medically relevant and hence subject to much more attention. That work had accumulated evidence over about two decades that even spinal reflexes (e.g., knee-jerk reflex) are far from the input-output systems most textbooks portray them as.</p>
<p>All of this evidence, together with ever more refined imaging capabilities of nervous system activity across the field, has led to a much more refined, almost reversed conceptual framework in neuroscience: now, nervous systems are increasingly conceptualized as constantly active, incessantly varying  this neural activity, with sensory stimuli exerting a modulating effect, the magnitude of which depends on the network state at which the stimulus arrives. As is so often the case in science, the most exciting new findings will probably come from experiments derived from this new perspective, experiments one could not have thought of from the old perspective.</p>
<p><strong>You joined <em>PLOS ONE</em>‘s editorial board when the journal was launched 10 years ago. What attracted you to <em>PLOS ONE</em> in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>At the time, access seemed like such a huge issue. I hadn’t realized, yet, what other, larger issues loomed behind those paywalls. <em>PLOS</em> in general and <em>PLOS ONE</em> in particular was a hip, new initiative. Supporting it helped me hit several birds with the same stone, two of which are: a) it enabled me to help push progress on publishing reform, both in terms of access and in terms of challenging journal rank. b) the work as an academic editor elevated my formal standing in the community and allowed me both to gather invaluable experience in the process of editing (crucial to the publication process) and to connect with colleagues in related fields I would otherwise not have been able to interact with.</p>
<p><strong>The journal has grown beyond expectations. Why do</strong><strong> you think a journal like <em>PLOS ONE</em> – a multidisciplinary and</strong><strong> rigor-focused journal- is relevant to scientists in general and within</strong><strong> your field in particular?</strong></p>
<p>While there are now several of such journals, they help to continue demonstrating to authors and readers that the concept of thematically arranged journals is antiquated. In the digital age, we have much better ways of channeling relevant information to readers than pre-selected information silos that build walls, not bridges between the different research objects. “Megajournals” are not overloading us with irrelevant information, as we only see what is relevant – although much of the process remains to be optimized and more current technology needs to be leveraged in this regard. Only few of these journals, e.g. F1000 Research, are still pushing any boundaries. For most, this once innovative form of publishing seems to now have become a cash cow from which profits need to be milked, rather than sandboxes to be widened and expanded to eventually provide an actual library where all scholarly content can be found: narrative, data and code.</p>
<p><strong>The publishing landscape has changed a lot in these 10 years. What do you think has been a positive change and where is there more work to do?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, from my perspective, it has hardly changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing is still dominated by the main publishers which keep increasing their profit margins, sucking the public teat dry,</li>
<li>Most of our work is still behind paywalls</li>
<li>You won’t get a job unless you publish in high ranking journals.</li>
<li>Higher ranking journals still publish less reliable science, contributing to potential replication issues</li>
<li>The increase in number of journals is still exponential</li>
<li>Libraries are still told by their faculty that subscriptions are important</li>
<li>The digital functionality of our literature is still laughable</li>
<li>There are no institutional solutions to sustainably archive and make accessible our narratives other than text, or our code or our data</li>
</ul>
<p>The only difference in the last few years really lies in the fraction of available articles, but that still remains a small minority, less than 30% total.</p>
<p>So the work we need to do is the same as it was at the time the subversive proposal was written, 23 years ago: getting rid of paywalls. This goal won’t be reached until all institutions have stopped renewing their subscriptions. As I don’t know of a single institution without subscriptions, that task remains just as big now as it was 23 years ago. Noticeable progress has only been on the margins and potentially in people’s heads.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the future of publishing? Are there any initiatives that you find particularly exciting or promising?</strong></p>
<p>Again, I’m not a prophet. If I had my way, I’d like to see institutions start dropping their subscriptions en masse and investing the money in a modern infrastructure, the sort of I have sketched out <a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/2015/04/what-should-a-modern-scientific-infrastructure-look-like">here</a>.</p>
<p>I currently only see a few marginal initiatives or small groups of individuals starting to coalesce around this idea. Most larger or more well-known initiatives are still trying to care palliatively at for the symptoms, rather than attempting to cure the disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/19/connection-between-brain-depression-and-effectiveness-of-chemotherapy/">Connection Between Brain, Depression and Effectiveness of Chemotherapy</a></h4>

<p>Chemotherapy is a type of therapy that uses various, rather aggressive, medicines to eliminate cancer cells from the body or slow down the growth of tumors. Cancer cells are different from normal cells as they reproduce a lot faster. Chemotherapy specifically targets the fast dividing cells and thus affects cancer cells the most. However, chemotherapy is a systemic therapy and therefore can be harmful for all other cells in the body. It has the largest negative effect on normal tissues that are quickly generated (e.g., blood cells, hair follicles, and sperm cells). Despite the disadvantages, chemotherapy remains one of the most important approaches to cancer treatments.</p>
<p>People with the same type of cancer can react very differently to the same chemotherapy regiments. In some patients, chemotherapeutic drugs demonstrate much stronger effect on cancer cells, while in the others the tumor continues to grow unaffected.</p>
<p>The list of factors that influence the effectiveness and outcomes of chemotherapy is in the hundreds at least. Tumors of the same type are never exactly the same, as they might be caused by different mutations and influenced through different regulatory mechanisms and pathways. The individual sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents can also differ widely depending on the patient’s sensitivity to drugs, and their ability to metabolize them and remove the metabolites.  Chemotherapeutic agents rarely kill all cancer cells but they can weaken the disease and thus allow the natural immune response to cleanse the body of cancer cells. However, immune system strength can vary greatly and depends on the patient’s age, general health status and presence of other chronic diseases and comorbidities. Therefore, predicting the outcome of chemotherapy is never an exact science, and practitioners only compare treatments in terms of their statistical chances of success.</p>
<p>Novel studies have added a new dimension to the complexity of chemotherapy: it turns out that its success is also linked to the psychological state of patient’s brain.</p>
<p>A few months ago at the end of 2016, researchers from Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China, lead by Yufeng Wu, published results that claim that depression plays an important role in the effectiveness of chemotherapy. The study was conducted on 186 patients with small cell lung cancer who underwent chemotherapeutic treatment. The mental health status of patients and their depression level were evaluated before the beginning of treatment. Patients with more severe depression had a lot more side effects associated with chemotherapy and spent more time in hospital. It was noted that patients at later stages of cancer had more severe symptoms of depression. Also, the body mass index (BMI) played an important role in depression development in cancer patients. Patients with lower BMI experienced more severe depression.</p>
<p>Researchers found that the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was strongly linked with depression level. In patients with more severe depression, the level of a brain-derived neurotrophic factor was much lower than in patients with less severe depression. The results demonstrate that depression influences cancer prognosis by lowering the level of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor.</p>
<p>BDNF reduces tissue sensitivity to chemotherapy medicines. This, in turn, reduces the effect of drugs on cancer cells. Thus, the level of BDNF indirectly influences how many tumor cells are killed by chemotherapy.</p>
<p>BDNF is a protein that can be found in human brain and peripheral nervous tissue. BDNF is known to increase the survival of neurons and peripheral neurons in the brain and induce the differentiation of new neurons. It also helps neurons to create new connections. BDNF plays one of the most important roles in the formation of long-term memory, and therefore plays an important role in the development of some diseases and chronic conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression and epilepsy.</p>
<p>BDNF is reduced after extended periods of severe stress associated with high cortisone levels. Lower levels of BDNF cause atrophy of parts of the brain. In case of depression, degenerative processes in the hippocampus were reported. The long-term use of depression medication does protect the hippocampus from atrophy and thus helps in the management of depression.</p>
<p>The reported link between depression, BDNF level, and the effectiveness of chemotherapy certainly gives scientists some food for thought and may direct further research to investigate this phenomenon. It would be interesting to see if the BDNF level in cancer patients can be elevated by using antidepressants, and if this intervention can influence the outcomes of chemotherapeutic treatments. Potentially, treatment of depression may give cancer patients a better chance in fighting the disease.</p>
<p>Being optimistic about health was always considered helpful in fighting various illnesses. It appears that researchers have finally uncovered the actual molecular mechanism behind the will power.  The findings point out to the importance of paying attention to the mental state of patients, as depression may seriously reduce their chances of defeating cancer.</p>

<img alt="Putting The Puzzle Together - Ken Teegardin, Flickr" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Putting-The-Puzzle-Together-Ken-Teegardin-Flickr-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>From March 30 to March 31 2017 more than 100 researches participated in a conference being held for the second time in Rome. Historically Rome is a perfect place for such a conference as it was common for Romans to discuss official issues in a forum. <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=marco.sarchiapone@me.com">Marco Sarchiapone</a> (University of Molise, Italy and an Associate Editor for <em>BMC Psychiatry)</em> was the main organizer and invited experts in suicide research from all over the world. Amongst others, important researchers including <a href="http://ki.se/en/people/danwas">Danuta Wassermann</a> (Sweden), <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gil_Zalsman">Gil Zalsman</a> (Israel), <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zoltan_Rihmer/publications">Zoltan Rihmer</a> (Hungary), <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/about-apa/meet-our-organization/board-of-trustees/maria-oquendo">Maria Oquendo</a> (USA) and <a href="http://profiles.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/jjmann">John J. Mann</a> (USA) presented and discussed new findings and their importance for patients suffering from suicidality. This conference was supported by the European Psychiatric Association and its Section “<a href="https://suicidologysection.org/">Suicidology and Suicide Prevention</a>”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="From research to clinic" class="size-medium wp-image-8855 alignright" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/From-research-to-clinic-300x199.jpg" width="300" />The special atmosphere allowed a fruitful discussion of current research projects but also, and even more importantly, the clinical impact. As suicidality is one of the most complex phenomena in psychiatry a multilevel approach is needed for a better understanding and treatment. Biological perspectives, health care perspectives as well as public health issues were in the focus of the presentations. Young clinicians and researchers debated clinical cases in which one point became very clear: despite the guidelines and knowledge we currently have, the availability of local care and treatment options varies remarkably and sometimes makes it difficult for patients to receive the best care. Therefore suicide researchers and health care providers need to constantly raise awareness with political decision makers as this is crucial for supporting research activities and suicide prevention programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This meeting was an exciting opportunity to meet senior suicide researches and discuss their work. Young researchers and trainees got the possibility to present results of their research within poster sessions. The next Roman Forum on Suicide will take place in 2018!</p>

<p>“One 60-minute run can add 7 hours to your life” claimed <em>The Times</em> last week. The story was based on a <a href="http://www.onlinepcd.com/article/S0033-0620(17)30048-8/fulltext">new review</a> in <em>Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases</em> that concluded that runners live, on average, three years longer than non-runners and that running will do more for your longevity than any other form of exercise. But there’s more to running than its health-enhancing effects. Research published in recent years has shown that donning your trainers and pounding the hills or pavements changes your brain and mind in some intriguing ways, from increasing connectivity between key functional hubs, to helping you regulate your emotions. The precise effects sometimes vary according to whether you engage in intense sprints or long-distance running. Here, to coincide with a new feature article in <em>The Psychologist – </em>“<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/may-2017/minds-run-free">Minds run free</a>” – we provide a handy digest of the ways that running changes your mind and brain.</p>
<p><span id="more-22573"></span></p>
<p><strong>Running changes your brain wiring</strong><br />
David Raichlen and his colleagues <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5147411/">scanned the brains of young, competitive distance runners and controls</a> while they rested in a scanner with their eyes open for six minutes. As reported in <em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</em>, the runners showed greater connectivity between the so-called frontal parietal network and other neural regions involved in working memory and self-control, which the researchers interpreted as likely due to the cognitive demands of running and the runners’ increased aerobic fitness. The runners also showed greater “anti-correlation” between their default mode network (the DMN, which sparks into life when we’re resting) and a series of regions involved in motor control and sensation – the researchers said this could indicate that when on the move, the runners are likely to be very cognitively engaged, with their DMN suppressed.</p>
<p><strong>Intense sprints seem to boost your executive function</strong><br />
For a study published last year in <em>Preventive Medicine Reports</em>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4929070/">researchers asked young volunteers (average age 12) to complete several 10-second sprints for ten minutes</a> and then take some cognitive tests. The participants acted as their own controls and on another day (either before or after the sprint day) they completed the same mental tests after 10 minutes of rest. The participants’ performance on the Stroop Test – a long-established measure of mental control or what psychologists call “executive function” – seemed to be enhanced immediately after the sprints and 45 minutes afterwards, as compared with after resting. There were no effects of the sprints on visual-spatial memory performance or basic mental speed (as judged by the Digit Symbol Substitution test). Based on their finding of an apparent benefit of sprints on executive function, Simon Cooper and his colleagues said there was a case for including more opportunities for intense exercise in the school day.</p>
<p><strong>Seven weeks of interval running training can boost your cognitive flexibility</strong><br />
For three times per week for seven weeks, a small group of young dinghy sailors spent 45 minutes per session, rising to 90 minutes at the end of the programme, engaged in interval training: running fast for between 200 to 1000m, interspersed with periods of rest. The researchers tested their volunteers’ cognitive function before the training period and afterwards, and compared the outcomes with a control group of young dinghy sailors who just continued their active lifestyle as usual. <a href="http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2016/08000/Interval_Running_Training_Improves_Cognitive.4.aspx">Writing in <em>The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em>, Tomas Venckunas and his colleagues reported that the running group didn’t just get fitter and better at running, but also showed superior gains in their cognitive flexibility</a>: that is, they were better at adapting to rapid switches in task instructions in a keypress task on a computer.</p>
<p><strong>Ridiculously extreme long-distance running shrinks your brain (but it grows back)</strong><br />
In 2009, 67 endurance athletes ran nearly 3,000 miles over 64 days, without a single day’s rest, to complete the TransEurope-FootRace ultramarathon. For a paper in <em>BMC Medicine</em>, a team of researchers led by Wolfgang Freund <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3566943/">scanned the brains of a sample of these runners before the race, during and eight months afterwards</a>. During the race, the runners’ brains shrunk, in terms of grey matter volume, by about six per cent, an amount that the researchers described as “substantial” considering that normal aging is associated with volume loss of around 0.2 per cent per year. However, at the final scan, the runners’ brains had recovered to their pre-race volume. In <a href="https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2052-1847-6-4">a follow-up study</a> in <em>BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation</em>, the same research team pinpointed the running-related grey matter loss to four key areas, including parts of: temporoparietal cortex, occipitotemporal cortex, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. Although highly speculative, they noted the overlap of these areas with the Default Mode Network and suggested the observed cell loss in these regions may reflect the combination of the metabolic demands of running combined with a prolonged lack of use of the DMN, the brain’s resting-state network.</p>
<p><strong>The “runners’ high” may be linked to changes in brain chemicals</strong><br />
Completing a run can leave you feeling euphoric and several studies suggest this could be down to changes to the brain’s chemical messengers. For instance, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhn013">a 2008 study in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em></a> used PET neuroimaging to show that a two-hour run led to enhanced opioid binding across several areas of the brain, as compared with before the run, and that this was associated with subjective feelings of euphoria. This supports the idea that running triggers the increased released of endorphins in the brain – a kind of natural high. <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/8/1331">A more recent paper in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em></a> pointed to the importance of other neurotransmitters: the researchers found that an intense treadmill run, but not a walk, was associated with increased circulation of endocannabinoids – endogenous brain chemicals that bind to the same receptors in the brain as cannabis.</p>
<p><strong>Running may quieten your mind</strong><br />
Anecdotally, many runners also say that going for a jog has a calming effect, helping their brains dial back on usual levels of worry and rumination. A study published last year in <em>Experimental Brain Research</em> appeared to provide some partial scientific support for this idea. Petra Wollseiffen and her colleagues <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-016-4587-7?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the surface electrical activity of the brains of 11 ultramarathoners several times during a six hour run</a>. Running was associated with reductions in activity in the frontal cortex of the brain, and for the first hour, runners also reported feeling more relaxed and an increased sense of “flow”. However, the levels of decreased brain activity and subjective feelings of flow didn’t correlate so it would be an oversimplification to say that this research shows that running helps you to relax by switching off your brain.</p>
<p><strong>Running increases the growth of new neurons (at least in mice)</strong><br />
It was the received wisdom through most of the last century that adults can’t grow new neurons – a process called neurogenesis. It’s now known that this isn’t true: in fact, new neurons continue to grow through life in specific areas of the brain. Interest has turned to the function of these news neurons and ways to encourage their growth. To date, much of the research is on rats and mice, in whom a recurring finding is that running seems to encourage neurogenesis. Take <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v2/n3/full/nn0399_266.html">a seminal paper published in <em>Nature</em> in 1999</a>. Fred Gage and his team reported that mice who had the opportunity to choose to run in a spinning wheel exhibited twice the amount of neurogenesis in a part of the hippocampus (a brain region involved in memory and learning), as compared with mice who had no choice but to swim or others who had to complete a water maze. <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/which-type-of-exercise-is-best-for-the-brain/?_r=0">More recent animal research</a> suggests that it is particularly long-distance running, as opposed to interval-style training (short bursts of running) that may increase neurogenesis, perhaps through release of what’s known as “brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)”, a chemical that encourages cell growth.</p>
<p><strong>A short jog may help you regulate your emotions</strong><br />
For a 2015 study in <em>Cognition and Emotion</em>, Emily Bernstein and Richard McNally <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2016.1168284">asked volunteers to jog or stretch for 30 minutes and then they showed them a sad clip from the film <em>The Champ</em></a>. Participants who said they usually struggled to handle negative emotion were more intensely affected by the sad clip, just as you’d expect, but crucially this was less so if they had completed the jog (but not the stretching). The researchers said: “… a bout of moderate aerobic exercise appears to have helped those participants potentially more vulnerable to problematic affective dysregulation to be less susceptible to the impact or lingering effects of the stressor”.</p>
<p><strong>Intense sprints may boost your ability to learn</strong><br />
Bernward Winter and his colleagues tested participants’ ability to learn new made-up words for objects after either two intense sprints of three-minutes length, after 40 minutes of gentle running, or after resting. Participants were able to learn 20 per cent faster after the sprints compared with the other conditions, and they showed superior memory retention when tested again a week later. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742706001596">Writing in the <em>Neurobiology of Learning and Memory</em></a>, the researchers said the blood measures they took suggested that the participants’ enhanced learning performance after sprints may have been associated with increased levels of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and BDNF. “This [finding] is pertinent to the organization of learning-supportive environments, e.g., in schools (intense exercise during the breaks),” the researchers said.</p>
<p><strong>Running a marathon seems to wipe your memory of the pain</strong><br />
Let’s not romanticise long-distance running. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_antimarathon/2016/05/running_a_marathon_is_a_dangerous_expensive_stupid_meaningless_task_don.html">As Daniel Engber observed at <em>Slate</em> last year</a>,  “a vast, disturbing literature has now accumulated on the ill effects of running marathons”, particularly all the pain, including chaffing, blisters and cramps. One way that repeat marathon runners seem to cope is that the satisfaction of completing a run gradually wipes their memories for the pain they went through. Researchers demonstrated this <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/16/marathon-runners-forget-how-painful-it-was/">for a study published in <em>Memory</em></a>: they asked marathon runners to report their pain and emotions directly after completing a marathon and then caught up with them again six months later, to ask them to recall their earlier post-marathon pain. The runners tended to have forgotten just how much pain they’d been in, and this was especially true if they’d been on an emotional high at the end of the marathon.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/04/19/rediscovering-african-wolf/">Rediscovering the African wolf</a></h4>

<img alt="African wolf photographed at Lake Abiata in Southern Ethiopia" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Lake_abiata-wolf-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Discovery of the African wolf</strong></p>
<p>In 1820, two German scientists travelled to Egypt and East Africa on a scientific expedition. Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich (a comparative physiologist) and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (a comparative anatomist, famous also for his work on paleontological micro-organisms) made observations and collected both botanical and animal specimens.</p>
<p>Sadly, Hembrich did not survive the trip. Ehrenberg returned alone, and published papers on their findings in several volumes. In the volume on mammals of boreal Africa and western Asia (now available electronically at <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/</a>) he described a canid (i.e. a member of the dog family) species as an Egyptian wolf, <em>Canis lupaster</em>, referring to its wolf like appearance.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8835" style="width: 270px;"><img alt="German scientist Christian Ehrenberg described the African wolf in 1832" class="size-medium wp-image-8835" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/EhrenbergChristianGottfried_585-260x300.jpg" width="260" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">German scientist Christian Ehrenberg described the African wolf in 1832</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>During the 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, zoologists continued to recognize this medium-sized canid in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some scholars thought there were two species: the larger eastern form, the wolf <em>lupaster</em>, and a smaller western form. Some also suggested the western form could be the same as the golden jackal found in Asia.</p>
<p>When Glover Morrill Allen, the American zoologist and curator for the Museum of Comparative Zoology, published a checklist of African Mammals in 1939, he omitted the wolf entirely and synonymized both forms with the Eurasian golden jackal (<em>Canis aureus</em>). This synonymy became commonly accepted. Interestingly, some physiological (e.g. Tembrock) and paleontological (e.g. <a href="http://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4983.2011.01039.x/full">Geraads 2011</a>) works continued recognizing the African species as a separate one. This African species was most often called <em>Canis anthus</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8836" style="width: 910px;"><img alt="African wolf from the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia" class="size-full wp-image-8836" height="600" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/ROBE-GORO-wolf.jpg" width="900" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">African wolf from the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Håkan Pohlstrand</div></figure>
<p><strong>Scats and skulls led to the rediscovery of the African wolf</strong></p>
<p>Members of our group studied canids in Ethiopia when DNA from a scat sample collected from the Guassa highlands showed similarities to the Eurasian gray wolf. Originally this scat was thought to come from a rodent-specializing rare canid, the Ethiopian wolf (<em>Canis simensis</em>). Confused but intrigued, the team decided to follow a “golden jackal” and succeeded in taking a video record of its activities including defecation. The DNA from that scat was analysed and surprisingly it was a match for the mystery wolf DNA from the original scat sample. For the first time, direct proof was obtained showing that the “golden jackal” of the Ethiopian highlands is actually a close relative of the Gray wolf.</p>
<p>The former African golden jackal was renamed the African wolf (<em>Canis lupus lupaster</em>) in the <a href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016385">paper published</a> based on these results (Rueness <em>et al.</em> 2011). Following this, <a href="http://www.journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042740">Philippe Gaubert and co-authors</a>, using the same mtDNA sequences, documented that the range of the African wolf extends to Algeria, Mali and Senegal. In 2015, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215007873">Koepfli <em>et al</em>. provided results </a>on the autosomal genes confirming the conclusion. No golden jackal genotypes were found in Africa. These authors also constructed a phylogeny demonstrating one million years of separate evolution for the African wolf.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmczool.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40850-017-0015-0">In our new paper</a>, we then carried out a taxonomic investigation on the African wolf. The decision of taxonomic assignment is made by comparison to the type specimen – each species has a type available for comparison when taxonomists are in doubt. However the type specimen for <em>Canis anthus</em> was problematic. Frederic Cuvier, who described the species <em>Canis anthus,</em> ascribed two type specimens, both of which are lost. There is also the possibility that these two represented different species. <em>Canis anthus</em> is clearly a nomen dubium (doubtful name).</p>
<p>The African wolf is rather the <em>Canis lupaster</em> of Hembrich and Ehrenberg: the type specimen was collected during their expedition and is housed in Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. It is a female with both the skull and skin preserved. The Museum has also over 100 African wolf skulls from different parts of the continent, and similar numbers of the Eurasian golden jackal. In addition to this material, we were able to study the canid skulls housed in all the major Fennoscandian museums, as well as those in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia.</p>
<p>We conducted a skull and skin taxonomy assessment of the species, and did a comparison to other canid species. Our conclusions confirmed that what is called the golden jackal in Africa is not the same species as the golden jackal in Eurasia. This was in agreement with our molecular analyses, which found no evidence for presence of the golden jackal on the African continent.</p>
<p>Our study showed a story that is familiar for canid specialists. The African wolf has a very conservative morphology, but there is significant variation in cranial and dental morphology within the species; this explains the previous confusion. Careful analyses were needed to assign the specimens to the species and understand the evolutionarily significant phenotypic plasticity within.</p>
<p><strong>Museum collections and an integrative approach for taxonomy</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8837" style="width: 2602px;"><img alt="Some of the African wolf skulls housed in the Naturkundemuseum, Berlin" class="size-full wp-image-8837" height="1936" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/museum_skulls.jpg" width="2592" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Some of the African wolf skulls housed in the Naturkundemuseum, Berlin</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>An integrative approach, utilizing both molecular and morphological methods (in this case, skin and skull taxonomy), is necessary for proper taxonomic work. And proper taxonomic work is needed to understand species and their relationships. This kind of solid taxonomic work is also the basis for conservation efforts. Natural history museum collections must be utilized, as they often provide the best material for this work. Altogether, our work has provided a reclassification of the African wolf clarifying two centuries of wonder and confusion regarding the species.</p>
<p>Abundance and distribution of the African wolf is not currently known (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). Like its larger cousin in the Northern hemisphere, African wolves are flexible in their habitat use. They range from wooded areas to arid desert, and are found in high altitudes in the Ethiopian mountains, up to 3,800 kilometers. They seem able to accommodate close proximity to humans. However, they still suffer from habitat destruction, and the risk of extinction remains a threat. The fact that the African wolf is a representative species of a unique wolf radiation to Africa calls for an urgent conservation assessment and future studies of the species.</p>
<p>What have we learnt from this – over and beyond providing a proper description of the species Rueness <em>et al.</em> (2011) discovered? The title of our paper points to that: ‘Rediscovering a forgotten canid species’. Scientists taking full advantage of modern technology-driven biological developments within biology (such as sequencing technologies), and scientists taking a more classical approach to biology, become much stronger when working together – as we have done in this <em>BMC Zoology</em> contribution.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/QCj10ktnwp0/nature22076">SLAMF7 is critical for phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells via Mac-1 integrin</a></h4>

<p>
 Cancer cells elude anti-tumour immunity through multiple mechanisms, including upregulated expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Phagocytosis by macrophages plays a critical role in cancer control. Therapeutic blockade of signal regulatory protein (SIRP)-α, an inhibitory receptor on macrophages, or of its ligand CD47 expressed on tumour cells, improves tumour cell elimination in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that blockade of the SIRPα–CD47 checkpoint could be useful in treating human cancer. However, the pro-phagocytic receptor(s) responsible for tumour cell phagocytosis is(are) largely unknown. Here we find that macrophages are much more efficient at phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells, compared with non-haematopoietic tumour cells, in response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade. Using a mouse lacking the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of homotypic haematopoietic cell-specific receptors, we determined that phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells during SIRPα–CD47 blockade was strictly dependent on SLAM family receptors in vitro and in vivo. In both mouse and human cells, this function required a single SLAM family member, SLAMF7 (also known as CRACC, CS1, CD319), expressed on macrophages and tumour cell targets. In contrast to most SLAM receptor functions, SLAMF7-mediated phagocytosis was independent of signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) adaptors. Instead, it depended on the ability of SLAMF7 to interact with integrin Mac-1 (refs 18, 19, 20) and utilize signals involving immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. These findings elucidate the mechanism by which macrophages engulf and destroy haematopoietic tumour cells. They also reveal a novel SAP adaptor-independent function for a SLAM receptor. Lastly, they suggest that patients with tumours expressing SLAMF7 are more likely to respond to SIRPα–CD47 blockade therapy.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/BoaNlPmYbHA/nature22074">The genetic basis of parental care evolution in monogamous mice</a></h4>

<p>
 Parental care is essential for the survival of mammals, yet the mechanisms underlying its evolution remain largely unknown. Here we show that two sister species of mice, Peromyscus polionotus and Peromyscus maniculatus, have large and heritable differences in parental behaviour. Using quantitative genetics, we identify 12 genomic regions that affect parental care, 8 of which have sex-specific effects, suggesting that parental care can evolve independently in males and females. Furthermore, some regions affect parental care broadly, whereas others affect specific behaviours, such as nest building. Of the genes linked to differences in nest-building behaviour, vasopressin is differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of the two species, with increased levels associated with less nest building. Using pharmacology in Peromyscus and chemogenetics in Mus, we show that vasopressin inhibits nest building but not other parental behaviours. Together, our results indicate that variation in an ancient neuropeptide contributes to interspecific differences in parental care.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/-sBrPVY73bY/nature22067">Human umbilical cord plasma proteins revitalize hippocampal function in aged mice</a></h4>

<p>
 Ageing drives changes in neuronal and cognitive function, the decline of which is a major feature of many neurological disorders. The hippocampus, a brain region subserving roles of spatial and episodic memory and learning, is sensitive to the detrimental effects of ageing at morphological and molecular levels. With advancing age, synapses in various hippocampal subfields exhibit impaired long-term potentiation, an electrophysiological correlate of learning and memory. At the molecular level, immediate early genes are among the synaptic plasticity genes that are both induced by long-term potentiation and downregulated in the aged brain. In addition to revitalizing other aged tissues, exposure to factors in young blood counteracts age-related changes in these central nervous system parameters, although the identities of specific cognition-promoting factors or whether such activity exists in human plasma remains unknown. We hypothesized that plasma of an early developmental stage, namely umbilical cord plasma, provides a reservoir of such plasticity-promoting proteins. Here we show that human cord plasma treatment revitalizes the hippocampus and improves cognitive function in aged mice. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), a blood-borne factor enriched in human cord plasma, young mouse plasma, and young mouse hippocampi, appears in the brain after systemic administration and increases synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognition in aged mice. Depletion experiments in aged mice revealed TIMP2 to be necessary for the cognitive benefits conferred by cord plasma. We find that systemic pools of TIMP2 are necessary for spatial memory in young mice, while treatment of brain slices with TIMP2 antibody prevents long-term potentiation, arguing for previously unknown roles for TIMP2 in normal hippocampal function. Our findings reveal that human cord plasma contains plasticity-enhancing proteins of high translational value for targeting ageing- or disease-associated hippocampal dysfunction.

<p>
 Human members of the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) family of transporters take up excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain and amino acids in peripheral organs. Dysregulation of the function of SLC1 transporters is associated with neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Here we present crystal structures of a thermostabilized human SLC1 transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), with and without allosteric and competitive inhibitors bound. The structures reveal architectural features of the human transporters, such as intra- and extracellular domains that have potential roles in transport function, regulation by lipids and post-translational modifications. The coordination of the allosteric inhibitor in the structures and the change in the transporter dynamics measured by hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveal a mechanism of inhibition, in which the transporter is locked in the outward-facing states of the transport cycle. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and pharmacology of human SLC1 transporters.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/I_eP2xSHDI0/nature22063">Cohesin is positioned in mammalian genomes by transcription, CTCF and Wapl</a></h4>

<p>
 Mammalian genomes are spatially organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin into chromatin loops and topologically associated domains, which have important roles in gene regulation and recombination. By binding to specific sequences, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range chromosomal cis-interactions. Cohesin is also present at these sites, but has been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere and to extrude chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites, according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is located. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3′-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these ‘cohesin islands’. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin, that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated translocation or by Wapl-mediated release.

<p>
 The recent arrival of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in Europe was followed by rapid expansion of its geographical distribution and host range, confirming the unprecedented threat that this chytrid fungus poses to western Palaearctic amphibians. Mitigating this hazard requires a thorough understanding of the pathogen’s disease ecology that is driving the extinction process. Here, we monitored infection, disease and host population dynamics in a Belgian fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) population for two years immediately after the first signs of infection. We show that arrival of this chytrid is associated with rapid population collapse without any sign of recovery, largely due to lack of increased resistance in the surviving salamanders and a demographic shift that prevents compensation for mortality. The pathogen adopts a dual transmission strategy, with environmentally resistant non-motile spores in addition to the motile spores identified in its sister species B. dendrobatidis. The fungus retains its virulence not only in water and soil, but also in anurans and less susceptible urodelan species that function as infection reservoirs. The combined characteristics of the disease ecology suggest that further expansion of this fungus will behave as a ‘perfect storm’ that is able to rapidly extirpate highly susceptible salamander populations across Europe.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/LQcAG9VRGCc/nature22056">Modulating the therapeutic response of tumours to dietary serine and glycine starvation</a></h4>

<p>
 The non-essential amino acids serine and glycine are used in multiple anabolic processes that support cancer cell growth and proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1). While some cancer cells upregulate de novo serine synthesis, many others rely on exogenous serine for optimal growth. Restriction of dietary serine and glycine can reduce tumour growth in xenograft and allograft models. Here we show that this observation translates into more clinically relevant autochthonous tumours in genetically engineered mouse models of intestinal cancer (driven by Apc inactivation) or lymphoma (driven by Myc activation). The increased survival following dietary restriction of serine and glycine in these models was further improved by antagonizing the anti-oxidant response. Disruption of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (using biguanides) led to a complex response that could improve or impede the anti-tumour effect of serine and glycine starvation. Notably, Kras-driven mouse models of pancreatic and intestinal cancers were less responsive to depletion of serine and glycine, reflecting an ability of activated Kras to increase the expression of enzymes that are part of the serine synthesis pathway and thus promote de novo serine synthesis.

<p>
 Chromatin remodellers are helicase-like, ATP-dependent enzymes that alter chromatin structure and nucleosome positions to allow regulatory proteins access to DNA. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of chromatin remodeller Switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI2/SNF2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to the nucleosome. The structure shows that the two core domains of Snf2 are realigned upon nucleosome binding, suggesting activation of the enzyme. The core domains contact each other through two induced Brace helices, which are crucial for coupling ATP hydrolysis to chromatin remodelling. Snf2 binds to the phosphate backbones of one DNA gyre of the nucleosome mainly through its helicase motifs within the major domain cleft, suggesting a conserved mechanism of substrate engagement across different remodellers. Snf2 contacts the second DNA gyre via a positively charged surface, providing a mechanism to anchor the remodeller at a fixed position of the nucleosome. Snf2 locally deforms nucleosomal DNA at the site of binding, priming the substrate for the remodelling reaction. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into chromatin remodelling.

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/04/Open-Science-prize-blog-image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892" rel="author" target="_blank">0000-0001-7318-5892</a></div><blockquote><p><strong>“Scientists can do much more with their own data if things are shared publicly and shared publicly quickly in order to have potential for real world impact.” -Trevor Bedford, lead of the Open Science Prize winning team.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Science Prize, a new initiative from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and the Wellcome Trust, encourages and supports open science approaches that generate benefit to society, advance research and spur innovation. An integral component of the selection process is demonstrated use and generation of <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2017/03/03/hooray-for-open-data-day/" target="_blank">open data</a></strong>, so PLOS is proud that this year’s winner of the <strong><a href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/" target="_blank">Open Science Prize</a></strong> is PLOS author and evolutionary, computational biologist <strong><a href="http://plos.io/TBedford" target="_blank">Trevor Bedford</a></strong> of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. <strong><a href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/res/p/finalists/" target="_blank">Finalists for the prize</a></strong> are also PLOS authors, including Michael Bamshed’s team, featured in a blog post for <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/02/optimism-on-rare-disease-day-with-research-possibilities-are-limitless/" target="_blank">Rare Disease Day</a>;</strong> <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146581" target="_blank">Aurel Lazar’s</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://plos.io/ASChiang" target="_blank">Ann-Shyn Chiang’s</a></strong> team, for the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001821" target="_blank">Ben Goldacre’s</a></strong> team, for OpenTrialsFDA.</p>
<p>These scientists and their teams are making sure that open content – from publications, datasets, code and other research outputs – are discovered, accessed and reused. Bedford and his team won the prize for development of nextstrain.org, a <strong><a href="http://www.nextstrain.org/" target="_blank">website</a></strong> that integrates shared, open sequence data from global research teams into a model for real-time tracking of virus evolution. This provides the larger community a powerful <strong><a href="http://www.nextstrain.org/zika?dmax=2016-10-12&amp;dmin=2013-09-14&amp;l=radial&amp;m=div&amp;r=country" target="_blank">graphic tool</a></strong> to facilitate pathogen surveillance and epidemiological investigations.</p>
<h3><strong>Open Data Tool Accelerates Policy and Research</strong></h3>
<p>In an interview discussing the value of open science approaches, Bedford spoke about open data, attribution, licensing and his experience in using preprints to support a publication strategy that releases data quickly while providing peer-reviewed citations for himself, his international collaborators and his postdocs and students.</p>
<p>One of the three final criteria in judging for the award is the level of demand and utility demonstrated by the proposed service or tool. This criterion worked in favor for nextstrain.org, as the team works with viral sequence data, made publicly available, to infer transmission patterns and evolutionary dynamics. Over the course of the last 15 years, according to Bedford, methods have gotten to a good place. Most recently, “fast genomic turnaround times means more actionable information is possible. This has created a powerful situation during outbreaks, where context is needed for robust conclusions, so investigators are willing to share data,” says Bedford. “We need to put datasets together for comprehensive inferences about what is going on,” he continues.</p>
<h4>In creating the nextstrain.org website, Bedford wanted to do something useful that wouldn’t be construed as scooping other people’s data for a publication. He sees the website as a good way to provide value to the community and work with other labs’ data, yet not be perceived as wanting to make a claim of ownership in the same way as a <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/" target="_blank">preprint or published paper</a></strong> would. Those involved in the project are committed to use and reuse of properly attributed pre- and post-publication data that is out there and referenceable.</h4>
<p>What gives Bedford’s collaborators their intellectual property claim? “I admit this is a wild west at the moment for sequence data,” he says. Many researchers deposit sequences in GenBank before publication “but fear that it is not clear this is prepublication data,” he adds (GenBank doesn’t have these type of settings). Scientists also post data to lab websites or <strong><a href="https://github.com/nextstrain" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong> with caveats that the data is prepublication; his website uses all these sources. Sequences posted with GitHub are immediately incorporated with sources notified of data use.</p>
<p>When asked if everyone is a believer in open data and if there were instances when he encountered resistance or hesitancy to <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005278" target="_blank">share data</a></strong>, Bedford replied they use whatever people <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134826" target="_blank"><strong>want to share</strong></a>. He has noticed a positive trend in the sharing ethos, however. During the time of the Ebola outbreak there was a significant lag that by the time of Zika was less so. The <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/02/10/zika-emergency-puts-open-data-policies-to-the-test/" target="_blank">publisher agreement</a></strong>, signed by PLOS and others, to make data rapidly and openly available helped in this area, he believes. “The requirement for sequence data to be deposited in GenBank or otherwise made publicly available at the time of manuscript submission, not publication, contributes to research reproducibility,” says Bedford. PLOS, through its own <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/data-availability" target="_blank">sequence deposition policies</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/04/protocols-io-tools-for-reproducibility/" target="_blank">partnerships for enhanced methods reporting</a></strong>, continually works to strengthen these issues.</p>
<p>For some, the Open Access, Open Science community needs to do a better job of showcasing the value of this more transparent and open way of doing science, from bench to publication and beyond. Thus far there has been positive engagement with the World Health Organization for influenza vaccine strain selection via the related tool, <strong><a href="http://nextflu.org/h3n2/3y/" target="_blank">nextflu.org</a></strong> (eventually slated to migrate to the nextstrain website).  Bedford envisions three audiences that would make practical use of his team’s open data tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those performing viral sequencing or using sequence data, as a useful platform to compare and share data</li>
<li>Those involved in outbreak responses, as a tool to understand data, transmission patterns and strain evolution</li>
<li>Researchers or others interested in characterization of mutants and the ability to look at historical mutations</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Publishing and License Choice</strong></h3>
<p>Bedford has an integrated publication strategy for his lab and work that best uses the various venues available. He publishes in a mix of Open Access and paywalled journals, creates webtools, deposits datasets and posts preprints. One strategy is to publish a statistical model or methods article, develop the model into a website or webtool and link to the website in published articles (rather than embedding JavaScript for the tool directly into the article).</p>
<h4>He likes the pattern of building an ecosystem around a work: post a preprint with links to published/released genomes, <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/27/105171.article-info" target="_blank">update the preprint</a></strong> with new data or analysis and then submit that paper for publication to a peer-reviewed journal. This allows his team to capture the whole chain of research and progress, establishing <strong><a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/03/113100.1" target="_blank">provenance of credit</a></strong> along the way. Concerns of datasets posted on GitHub or GenBank getting scooped are similar to the scooping concerns surrounding the preprint server conversation. Helping people understand they’re putting an intellectual claim on their data (or paper) with posting has ameliorated, but not eliminated, those concerns.</h4>
<p>Those using source code to develop tools for Open Science have several choices in licensing. For smaller projects, Bedford prefers the MIT license (also used for <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/02/a-year-of-open-for-discovery/" target="_blank">code developed at PLOS</a></strong> that is released as Open Source) which provides free and unlimited use and reuse rights, provided attribution is made clear. Other projects of his, including nextstrain.org, are released to the public under a GNU General Public License (GPL). This license provides that anyone using the source code to generate a derived product must, in turn, make that product open source. In other words, if a commercial entity adopts his open source code, that company must provide their code open source as well. The license status is essentially inherited and passed down to the next generation of product together with the code. One benefit of choosing the less restrictive MIT license, similar to CC BY for published articles, is maximum reuse without restriction.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all finalists of the Open Science Prize, sharing their work and data for the benefit of basic science, translational research and global public health.</p>

In the 2006 paper, researchers led by Federico Infascelli, an animal nutrition researcher at the University of Naples, tested the blood of rabbits fed genetically modified soybeans. Starting in November […]</p>

I enjoyed this fun forum organized by David Poeppel and Mike Gazzaniga. The format included three pairs of speakers on the topics of memory, language, and action/motor who “consider[ed] some major challenges and cutting-edge advances, from molecular mechanisms to decoding approaches to network computations.”<br /><br />Co-host Marcus Raichle recalled his inspiration for the symposium: a similar Big Ideas session at the Society for Neuroscience meeting. But human neuroscience was absent from all SFN Big Ideas, so Dr. Raichle contacted Dr. Gazzaniga, who “made it happen” (along with Dr. Poeppel). The popular event was standing room only, and many couldn't even get into the Bayview Room (which was too small a venue). More context:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“Recent discussions in the neurosciences have been relentlessly reductionist. The guiding principle of this symposium is that there is no privileged level of analysis that can yield special explanatory insight into the mind/brain on its own, so ideas and techniques across levels will be necessary.”</blockquote><br />The two hour symposium was a welcome addition to hundreds of posters and talks on highly specific empirical findings. Sometimes we must take a step back and look at the big picture. But since I'm The Neurocritic, I'll start out with some modest suggestions for next time.<br /><br /><ul><li>There was no time for questions or discussion.</li><li>There were too many talks.</li><li>It would be nice for all speakers to try to bridge different levels of analysis.</li><li>This is a small point, but ironically the first two speakers (Gallistel, Ryan) did not talk about human neuroscience.</li></ul><br />So my idea is to have four speakers on one topic (memory, let's say) with two at the level of Gallistel and Ryan<sup><b><span style="color: purple;">1</span></b></sup>, and two who approach human neuroscience using different techniques. Talks are strictly limited to 20 minutes. Then there is a 20 minute panel discussion where everyone tries to consider the implications of the other levels for their own work. Then (ideally) there is time for 20 minutes of questions from the audience. However, since I'm not an expert in organizing such events, allotting 20 minutes for the audience could be excessive. So the timing could be restructured to 25 min for talks, 10-15 min panel, 5-10 min audience. Or combine the round table with audience participation.<br /><br />Last year, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160611055236/http://www.cogneurosociety.org/mycns/?page=symposium_sessions#7" target="_blank">Symposium Session 7</a> on Human Intracranial Electrophysiology (which included the <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2016/04/dont-lose-your-head-over-tdcs.html" target="_blank" title="Studies of transcranial electrical stimulation in human cadaver heads showed a 90% loss of current when delivered through the skin">incendiary tDCS challenge</a> by György Buzsáki) had a round table discussion as Talk 5, which I thought was very successful.<br /><br />Video of the Big Ideas symposium is now available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFDiU2PVB8DQ1Qf7cGNvRV2HSMOWUBMf" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but in case you don't want to watch the entire two hours, I'll present a brief summary below.<br /><br /><br /><b>Big Box Neuroscience</b><br /><br />Here's an idiosyncratic distillation of some major points from the symposium.<br /><br /><ul><li>The brain is an information processing device in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" target="_blank" title="'information' is thought of as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error">Shannon information theory</a>.</li><li>The brain does <b><i>not</i></b> use Shannon information.</li><li>Memories (”engrams”) are not stored at synapses.</li><li>We learn entirely through spike trains.</li><li>The engram is inter-spike interval.</li><li>The engram is an emergent property.</li><li>Emergent properties are for losers.</li><li>Language is genetically predetermined.</li><li>There is something called mirror neural ensembles.</li><li>Recursion is big.</li><li>Architectures are important.</li><li>Build a bridge from networks to models of behavior.</li><li>Use generative models to construct theories.</li><li>Machine learning will save us.</li><li>Go back to behavioral neuroscience.</li></ul><br />Maybe I'll explain what this all means in the next post.

<p>Doctors who want to avoid accusations of hypocrisy should keep themselves in reasonable shape if they intend to advise their patients to do the same. Indeed, some medical organisations explicitly encourage their physicians not only to stay fit, but to make sure that their patients know it, thereby role-modelling the recommended behaviours. However, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-08697-001/">new research</a> published in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> shows that doctors who promote their own fitness may actually scare away overweight patients who are most in need of help.</p>
<p><span id="more-22554"></span></p>
<p>Researchers Lauren Howe and Benoît Monin lifted real-life MD profiles from the website of an American medical group, and sorted them into two types. Fitness-focused profiles explicitly stated that the doctor prioritised staying healthy and active, or cited two or more active hobbies like hiking and biking; meanwhile the other profiles didn’t emphasise fitness.</p>
<p>Howe and Monin recruited 143 people who had some concerns about their weight and a BMI over 25, the cutoff for being considered overweight. The participants viewed and then rated five fitness-focused doctor profiles and five comparison profiles. The participants expressed a greater suspicion that fitness-focused doctors would be judgmental towards patients with unhealthy habits, and they said they would be less willing to choose such a doctor as their own physician.</p>
<p>While it’s no good alienating prospective patients, nor would faking unhealthy habits be a good solution, so Howe and Monin looked at some other options. First, they looked at adding a caveat to the fitness-focused profiles, for example “I try to maintain a regular exercise routine” was followed by “(though it’s hard to find the time and energy)”. But although overweight participants found these profiles somewhat less judgmental, it didn’t change their reluctance to select them as a health provider. But a second tweak was more successful: extending the fit doctors’ profiles with a non-judgmental phrase like “everyone has their own definition of a healthy life and what it means to be healthy for them” made them the most preferred option.</p>
<p>Generally, are doctors feeling a pressure to promote themselves as healthy? Howe and Monin note that the profiles on the medical website they surveyed did show a tendency to talk up fitness: nearly a third of profiles of were fitness-focused, and only 2 out of nearly 100 mentioned any struggles with keeping healthy. In truth, the average doctor is more unhealthy than the US general population in a number of areas – exercise, weight and daily consumption of fruit and vegetables, with smoking being a notable exception. But you wouldn’t assume this based on how they present themselves, which may be why, in a survey ran by Howe and Monin, respondents assumed that doctors are healthier on every front. Perhaps physicians should prescribe themselves a healthy dose of honesty.</p>

In a thought-provoking new paper called What are neural correlates neural correlates of?, NYU sociologist Gabriel Abend argues that neuroscientists need to pay more attention to philosophy, social science, and the humanities.





Abend's main argument is that if we are to study the neural correlates or neural basis of a certain phenomenon, we must first define that phenomenon and know how to identify instances of it.

Sometimes, this identification is straightforward: in a study of brai

<p>The exact mechanisms underlying the devastation that is Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are not entirely understood, but researchers do know that inflammation in the brain is related to the onset of the disease. Now, through a basic eye exam, clinicians may be able to spot AD warning signs, including inflammation, long before symptoms appear</p>
<p>Normally, the brain depends on tau protein to receive nutrients and get rid of waste. When a toxic form of the tau protein clumps together, it forms tangles that are noxious to the brain. These toxic tau proteins may be at least partly responsible for the inflammation that is characteristic of AD, and inflammation may start before the tau tangles form. Now, researchers at the University of Texas speculate that this inflammation may be detectable by examining the retina during routine eye exams. This type of screening would be non-invasive and inexpensive and may eventually allow for early intervention to mitigate brain cell death and cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Authors of the current study, published in <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em>, examined brain analyses and retinal samples from human patients with AD, as well as a mouse model of AD. The findings suggest that toxic tau proteins induce inflammation that spreads throughout the brain, initiating the vicious cycle of cell death and more inflammation. Screening of the retina as part of a normal health check-up can detect inflamed tissue earlier in the disease process than other methods of AD screening.</p>
<p>AD has long been known to impact the visual system, and pathophysiological connections have been made between AD and visual disorders, such as certain types of cataract and glaucoma. The eye offers easy access to cerebral functioning, and ocular biomarkers for AD may potentially improve disease diagnosis and management.</p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia and its prevalence is growing as the world’s population ages. Patients with AD exhibit profound, progressive declines in cognition, memory, and social functioning. To date, there are no cures and available treatments are only marginally effective at managing some of the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>The new findings are far from offering cures or preventions for AD, but the authors hope that, eventually, early detection of inflammation will lead to therapeutic options for reducing inflammation and minimizing neurodegenerative brain damage.</p>

<img alt="cracked-ground-1844838_1280" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/cracked-ground-1844838_1280-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="http://www.earthday.org/">Earth day</a> is celebrated every year on April 22<sup>nd</sup> with a number of events held worldwide to support the protection of the environment. This year, the campaign focuses on <a href="http://www.earthday.org/earthday/global-environmental-climate-literacy-campaign/">Environmental and Climate Literacy</a>, with the aim of building a global understanding on climate change and the threat it poses to the planet.</p>
<p>One important aspect of climate change is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought">drought</a>. As the temperature of the earth continues to rise, some areas will see more rainfall, but others will see considerably less, causing drought conditions.  It has been estimated that, by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the areas in the world affected by drought will have doubled compared to today.</p>
<p>Plants are constantly being exposed to many kinds of environmental challenges, one of the main ones of course being drought. A lack of water can seriously affect a plants growth and development, a particularly important consideration for food crops as it is likely to have a detrimental effect on crop quality and eventual yield.</p>
<p>It is therefore vital to investigate how plants respond to drought conditions and look at ways to improve a plants tolerance to a shortage of water.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Plant Biology</em></a> receives an increasing number of articles that describe studies investigating plant tolerance in plants, and particularly plants that are important food crops. In order to celebrate Earth Day, I thought I would highlight two of my favorites.</p>
<p><strong>How wild peaches cope with drought</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8797" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="Cultivated peaches are vulnerable to the effects of drought." class="size-medium wp-image-8797" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/peaches-1586955_1920-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Cultivated peaches are vulnerable to the effects of drought.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Pixabay</div></figure>
<p><em>Amygdalus Mira (Koehne) Yü et Lu</em> is a type of wild peach.  It is considered an ideal<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germplasm"> germplasm</a> (essentially, a supply of living plant tissue from which new plants can be grown)  for improving cultivated peach plants. Due to a lack of genetic variation, cultivated peach plants are vulnerable to environmental stresses, including drought. Cao <em>et al</em> recently <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-1000-z">published the results</a> of a study looking into how wild peach respond to a shortage of water.  Wild peach plants were split into one of two groups; one group was then exposed to drought-like conditions for 16 days while the other group were watered well. Perhaps not surprisingly, the researchers observed that root length and water content were reduced for those plants that had been exposed to in drought-like conditions. They also found that relative conductivity, proline, malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels had increased, as had the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes. Furthermore, only proline levels returned to normal after the plants were re-watered after the 16 day period.  There were also changes in the expression of 95 different proteins in the drought-exposed wild peach plants when compared with well-watered plants, including those involved in cytoskeleton dynamics, carbohydrate, nitrogen and energy metabolism, transcription and translation, transport, stress and defence.  The researchers concluded that the interaction between enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, increased proline, malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels, increase in relative conductivity, and changes in the  levels of proteins expressed all help to make wild peach plants resistant to the effects of drought.</p>
<p><strong>How tomatoes cope with drought</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8798" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Chloroplasts may help tomatoes withstand the effects of drought" class="size-medium wp-image-8798" height="197" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/03/tomatoes-1280859_1280-300x197.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Chloroplasts may help tomatoes withstand the effects of drought.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Pixabay</div></figure>
<p>Tomatoes have another trick up their sleeve when it comes to surviving drought.  A <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-017-0971-0">recent article</a> by Tamburino and colleagues looked at how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast">chloroplasts</a> present in tomatoes may have an important role in protecting these plants during times of water shortage, by investigating how three-week-old tomato (cv Crovarese) seedlings respond to a lack of water followed by its reintroduction (the “rewatering cycle”). Similar to the response of wild peach plants, the researchers found that a lack of water restricted the growth of the tomato plants and led to increased levels of proline, abscisic acid (ABA) and late embryogenesis abundant gene transcript. Again, very much like the wild peach plant, the expression of a number of proteins in the chloroplast protein repertoire were also affected by drought-like conditions. Once the rewatering cycle began, there was evidence of a general recovery of tomato plant function, but the chloroplast protein repertoire remained affected.  Changes in gene expression of some candidate genes and a rise in abscisic acid levels suggest that a specific chloroplast-to-nucleus (retrograde) signaling pathway becomes activated, leading ultimately to a stress response that help the tomato plant cope with drought conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Can research hold the answer to the problem of food shortages caused by drought?</strong></p>
<p>So, what conclusions, tentative or otherwise, can be made so far? Reports that climate change will result in an increase in world hunger over the next few decades highlights the importance of developing crops that can provide high yields even in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The research by Cao <em>et al</em> suggests that reintroducing some of the genetic variation present in wild peach plants to cultivated peach plants, may well also reintroduce some drought-resistant mechanisms to the crop, increasing the tolerance to drought and increasing the amount of fruit produced. And Tamburino <em>et al</em> conclude that ad hoc designed plant mutants could be used to further investigate the retrograde signalling pathway thought to be responsible for drought tolerance in Crovarese tomatoes.</p>
<p>Research into how to make food crops more drought resistant is undoubtedly a very active area of research and it is hoped that it will provide solutions to what could become a serious worldwide concern.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/pXbbTitbZZk/nature22057">Visualizing multistep elevator-like transitions of a nucleoside transporter</a></h4>

<p>
 Membrane transporters move substrates across the membrane by alternating access of their binding sites between the opposite sides of the membrane. An emerging model of this process is the elevator mechanism, in which a substrate-binding transport domain moves a large distance across the membrane. This mechanism has been characterized by a transition between two states, but the conformational path that leads to the transition is not yet known, largely because the available structural information has been limited to the two end states. Here we present crystal structures of the inward-facing, intermediate, and outward-facing states of a concentrative nucleoside transporter from Neisseria wadsworthii. Notably, we determined the structures of multiple intermediate conformations, in which the transport domain is captured halfway through its elevator motion. Our structures present a trajectory of the conformational transition in the elevator model, revealing multiple intermediate steps and state-dependent conformational changes within the transport domain that are associated with the elevator-like motion.
