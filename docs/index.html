                When Marianne Alunno-Bruscia, the research integrity officer at France’s national oceanographic science institute, uncovered nearly a dozen papers with fraudulent authorship, she thought she’d stumbled on something bizarre.&#160; She didn’t know how right she was.&#160; As we reported in early February, the problems arose during an audit the research activities of the L&#8217;Institut Français de &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/03/22/will-the-real-tim-chen-please-stand-up-a-trip-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-deceit/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Will the real Tim Chen please stand up?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-nasa-confirmed-5000-milestone-galaxy">NASA’s exoplanet count surges past 5,000</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s official: The number of planets known beyond our solar system has just passed 5,000.</p>



<p>The exoplanet census surpassed this milestone with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02087">a recent batch of 60 confirmed exoplanets</a>. These additional worlds were found in data from NASA’s now-defunct K2 mission, the “second life” of the prolific Kepler space telescope, and confirmed with new observations, researchers report March 4 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>As of March 21, these finds put NASA’s <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1702/cosmic-milestone-nasa-confirms-5000-exoplanets/">official tally of exoplanets at 5,005</a>.</p>





<p>It’s been 30 years since scientists discovered the first planets orbiting another star — an unlikely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radio-pulses-hint-unseen-planets">pair of small worlds huddled around a pulsar</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/92</em>). Today, exoplanets are so common that astronomers expect most stars <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-common-stars-milky-way">host at least one</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/12</em>), says astronomer Aurora Kesseli of Caltech.</p>





<p>“One of the most exciting things that I think has happened in the last 30 years is that we’ve really started to be able to fill out the diversity of exoplanets,” Kesseli says</p>



<p>Some look like Jupiter, some look — perhaps — like Earth and some look like nothing familiar. The 5,005 confirmed exoplanets include nearly 1,500 giant gassy planets, roughly 200 that are small and rocky and almost 1,600 “super-Earths,” which are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-exoplanet-big-earth-or-small-neptune">larger than our solar system’s rocky planets and smaller than Neptune</a> (<em>SN: 8/11/15</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Planet diversity </h3>



<p>The 5,005 confirmed exoplanets can be categorized and divided into several distinct types, of which planets the size of Neptune are the most common. Super-Earths, not seen in our solar system, are a close second with Jupiter-like giant gassy planets coming in third. Small rocky worlds, some of which may resemble our own, come in fourth.</p>

<p>Astronomers can’t say much about those worlds beyond diameters, masses and densities. But several projects, like the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, are working on that, Kesseli says (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). “Not only are we going to find tons and tons more exoplanets, but we&#8217;re also going to start to be able to actually characterize the planets,” she says.</p>



<p>And the search is far from over. NASA’s newest exoplanet hunter, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-exoplanet-made-molten-iron-star">the TESS mission</a>, has confirmed more than 200 planets, with thousands more yet to verify, Kesseli says (<em>SN: 12/2/21</em>). Ongoing searches from ground-based telescopes keep adding to the count as well.</p>



<p>“There’s tons of exoplanets out there,” Kesseli says, “and even more waiting to be discovered.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-history-high-profile-failures">How gene therapy overcame high-profile failures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gene therapy pioneer Richard Jude Samulski remembers when he avoided the words “gene therapy.” In the mid-2000s, he told people he worked on “biological nanoparticles,” even attempting to trademark the term. “We felt that was the disguise we were going to have to wear to go forward,” recalls Samulski, a professor of pharmacology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>



<p>The death of a teenager in a gene therapy clinical trial in 1999 and cases of leukemia in a trial soon after almost extinguished the field, which seeks to treat diseases at their roots by replacing or counteracting a malfunctioning gene. There were federal investigations, funding cuts and a lot of negative media attention. Yet a handful of researchers never stopped working, sometimes out of doggedness and sometimes because they couldn’t say no to desperate parents. “Everybody adapted to do what it took to keep going,” Samulski says.</p>

<p>The gene therapy story has a happy ending. Today, the <a href="https://alliancerm.org/">Alliance for Regenerative Medicine</a> lists nine available gene therapies worldwide that have been approved by internationally recognized regulatory agencies, as well as more than 200 in advanced clinical trials. The field attracts billions of dollars in funding each year. But its tumultuous past reminds us that the course of medical innovation rarely runs smooth.</p>



<p>It all began more than half a century ago, with the discovery of molecular knives and a virus lurking in monkey cells.</p>



<h4>Vectors and setbacks</h4>



<p>In the 1960s, researchers identified proteins in bacteria that work like chemical knives to cut DNA into fragments. These “restriction enzymes” raised the amazing possibility that scientists could take DNA apart and put it back together. Then, in the 1970s, a virus called SV40, isolated from monkeys’ kidney cells, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gene-transplant-mammalian-cells">proved to be able to deliver genetic material into target cells</a>.</p>



<p>Together, the discoveries suggested that it was possible to use a viral vector like a molecular FedEx truck to deliver new DNA into cells to counteract or replace malfunctioning DNA. Unfortunately, SV40 proved to be too unreliable and risky for medical applications. It tended to insert chunks of DNA in places that could cause cells to become cancerous. So began the multi-decade hunt for new, better vectors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two initial gene therapy trials conducted in the United States in 1989 and 1990 used modified retroviruses, a type of virus able to change its RNA-encoded genes into DNA once inside a cell. Both treatments — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/human-gene-therapy-wins-crucial-victory">one for melanoma</a>, another for an inherited <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-human-gene-therapy-test-begun">autoimmune disease</a> called severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID — had no ill effects, but only limited success. Despite this, dozens more clinical trials were conducted throughout the 1990s with retroviruses and other vectors, including adenovirus, a cause of the common cold. After selecting a virus based on how well it could transfer genes into cells, scientists would remove any viral genes that might cause disease and then tack on the “healthy” genes slated for delivery.</p>



<p>Over the next 10 years, almost 4,000 patients were treated in 500 trials, but with virtually no success.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Samulski had been searching for other vector options. In a virology book, he spotted adeno-associated virus, or AAV, listed as a virus that doesn’t cause disease in humans. “It was a eureka moment,” he recalls. “Wow, why aren’t we using something like this as a delivery system?”</p>



<p>By 1994, Samulski and his first graduate student, Xiao Xiao, showed that in addition to being less likely to cause disease, AAV vectors had a key, desirable feature for gene therapy: When AAVs delivered a gene into a cell, that gene was expressed for the lifetime of the animal.</p>



<p>At first, however, no one believed them. How could their viral vector persist, while others lasted only weeks before being destroyed by the immune system? “We were getting so much pushback,” says Samulski. When the work was finally <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8892935/">published in 1996</a>, many labs began calling and asking for the vectors.</p>



<p>Initial results using the vectors got everyone excited. At the University of Pennsylvania, Katherine High and colleagues developed an AAV-based gene therapy for hemophilia, an inherited bleeding disorder that had long been an attractive target for gene therapy because it is caused by a single malfunctioning gene. The therapy worked in a mouse model, then <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gene-injections-stem-clotting-disorder">in a dog model</a>. It was time to test it in people.</p>



<p>Then, in 1999, Jesse Gelsinger died.</p>



<p>Gelsinger was a teenager enrolled in a phase 1 safety trial at the University of Pennsylvania for a gene therapy to treat an inherited metabolic disorder. His disorder was under control with diet and medication, yet he opted to participate to help others with the condition. Gelsinger died from an inflammatory response to the adenovirus vector. News that an experimental treatment had killed an otherwise healthy volunteer made national headlines and initiated a Food and Drug Administration investigation into that trial and others.</p>

<p>Then, from 2002 to 2004, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delivering-goods">five of the 20 children</a> in a SCID <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubble-babies-thrive-gene-therapy">gene therapy trial</a> in Europe developed leukemia. The viral vector had integrated in their genomes next to a cancer-causing gene. One died.</p>



<p>“The whole field entered a five-to-10-year dark age,” says Guangping Gao, director of gene therapy at the UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, Mass. Gao was studying AAV vectors at UPenn at the time but was not involved in the clinical trial. “It went from a place of hype to no hope at all.”</p>



<p>With so many high-profile failures, some labs closed, others pivoted away. Samulski, High and Gao were among the few who carried on. “We never stopped our research,” says Gao. “I’m a very bullheaded person, so stubborn. So if I decide something, it’s hard for me to give up.”</p>



<p>In Europe, a team testing a different SCID gene therapy was allowed to enroll just one patient at a time. “It took us eight years to do the first 14 patients because of that,” says Maria Grazia Roncarolo, who led the trial while at San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan. She is now a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>And there was one pivotal group that did not abandon the field: the parents of sick children. With no other treatment options, parents appeared in researchers’ offices, often with their kids in tow, asking, “Can you save my child?”</p>



<h4>From a trickle to a roar</h4>



<p>Parents funded foundations, and those foundations funded scientists. “They kept labs alive that were either going to close or go where money was being made,” says Samulski.</p>



<p>By 2010, Gao, gene therapy researcher James Wilson and colleagues had identified <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12192090/">new AAV vectors</a>, scientists knew more about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC509299/">how</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1083413">where</a> viral vectors work in cells, and labs recorded success in animal models. “At some point, you couldn’t keep saying, ‘It’s not going to work,’” says Samulski, who in 2001 cofounded AskBio, a North Carolina–based gene therapy company.</p>



<p>Based on that promising preclinical work, human trials restarted. Many employed AAV vectors, although other vectors were also used. In 2009, Roncarolo’s team published their successful effort for <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0805817">treating SCID</a> using a retroviral vector without causing leukemia. “This trial proved that it could be safe, but more importantly proved it could cure the patients,” she says.</p>



<p>Dozens of biotech companies joined the field, and large pharmaceutical companies funded clinical trials. In 2013, High and colleagues founded Spark Therapeutics in Philadelphia, and led a team with Jean Bennett and Albert Maguire at Penn Medicine that obtained the first FDA approval of an AAV gene therapy, Luxturna, in December 2017. Also in 2017, the FDA approved <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-t-cell-gene-therapy-top-science-stories-2017-yir">two gene therapies</a> that use a patient’s genetically altered immune cells, called CAR-T cells, to fight rare types of cancer. A year earlier, Roncarolo’s SCID therapy, Strimvelis, was approved by the European Commission.</p>



<p>In late 2021, there were 46 gene therapies in the final, phase 3 stage of clinical trials, including High’s therapy for hemophilia, an early version of which was first tested in humans 20 years ago. In the same year, over 1,220 gene therapy clinical trials were aiming to enroll 90,000 patients worldwide. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency predict they will each approve 10 to 20 gene and cell therapies — therapies that transplant cells, whether genetically modified or not, into a patient’s body as a treatment — per year by 2025.</p>





<p>Each achievement in the field has been like climbing to the pinnacle of a mountain only to realize it’s another base camp, says Samulski. Current mountains include trying to prevent a toxic immune response that can occur in reaction to large doses of a gene therapy, ramping up manufacturing of vectors, and continuing the never-ending hunt for more effective gene delivery systems.</p>



<p>High, now President of Therapeutics at AskBio, is excited about new approaches to gene therapy, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">CAR-T cell therapies</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-editor-first-human-clinical-trials">gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9</a>. But she hopes researchers can learn from the past: It takes time and perseverance to develop a new class of therapeutics. “My excitement is always tempered by my hard-won knowledge,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rounding-numbers-stochastic-machine-learning-quantum-computing">How the way we’re taught to round numbers in school falls short</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imagine needing to estimate the total cost of the items in your grocery basket to decide whether to put something back. So you round to the nearest dollar for each potential purchase, using the “round-to-nearest” technique commonly taught in school. That prompts you to round each item’s cost up if the change portion is at least 50 cents and round down if less.</p>



<p>This rounding approach works well for quickly estimating a total without a calculator. And it yields the same results when a particular rounding task is repeated. For instance, rounding 4.9 to the nearest whole number will always yield five and rounding 302 to the nearest hundred will always yield 300.</p>



<p>But this type of rounding can pose problems for calculations in machine learning, quantum computing and other technical applications, says Mantas&nbsp;Mikaitis, a computer scientist at the University of Manchester in England.</p>





<p>“Always rounding to nearest could introduce bias in computations,” Mikaitis says. “Let’s say your data is somehow not uniformly distributed or your rounding errors are not uniformly distributed. Then you could keep rounding to a certain direction that will then show up in the main result as an error or bias there.”</p>



<p>An alternative technique <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.211631">called stochastic rounding is better suited</a> for applications where the round-to-nearest approach falls short, Mikaitis says. First proposed <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1950-56-01/S0002-9904-1950-09343-4/S0002-9904-1950-09343-4.pdf">in 1949 by computer scientist George Elmer Forsythe</a>, stochastic rounding “is currently experiencing a resurgence of interest,” Mikaitis and colleagues write in the March <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>.</p>



<p>This technique isn’t meant to be done in your head. Instead, a computer program rounds to a certain number with probabilities that are based on the distance of the actual measurement from that number. For instance, 2.8 has an 80 percent chance of rounding to three and a 20 percent chance of rounding to two. That’s because it is 80 percent “along the way” to three and 20 percent along the way to two, Mikaitis explains. Alternatively, 2.5 is equally likely to be rounded to two or three.</p>



<p>But the direction that you round for any instance of rounding is random: You can’t predict when 2.5 will be rounded up to three and when it will be rounded down to two, and there’s that 20 percent chance that 2.8 will sometimes be rounded down to two.</p>



<p>By making sure that rounding doesn’t always go in the same direction for a particular number, this process helps guard against what’s known as stagnation. That problem “means that the real result is growing while the computer’s result” isn’t, Mikaitis says. “It’s about losing many tiny measurements that add up to a major loss in the final result.”</p>



<p>Stagnation “is an issue in computing generally,” Mikaitis says, but it poses the biggest problems in applications such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/computer-science-history-ethics-future-robots-ai">machine learning</a> that often involve adding lots of values, with some of those being much larger than others, (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>). With the round-to-nearest method, this results in stagnation. But with stochastic rounding, the chance of rounding down, for example, in a series of mostly small numbers that are interrupted by a few large outliers helps guard against those oversized values always dominating the rounding and pushing it up.</p>



<p>Most computers aren’t yet equipped to perform true stochastic rounding, Mikaitis notes. The machines lack random number generators, which are needed to execute the probabilistic decision of which way to round. However, Mikaitis and his colleagues have devised a method to simulate stochastic rounding in these computers by combining the round-to-nearest method with three other types of rounding.</p>



<p>Stochastic rounding’s need for randomness makes it particularly suited to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computer-error-correction-multiple-qubits-detect-mistakes">quantum computing</a> applications (<em>SN: 10/4/21</em>). “With quantum computing, you have to measure a result many times and then get an average result, because it’s a noisy result,” Mikaitis says. “You have that randomness in the results already.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-cosmic-background-light-bright-new-horizons">The universe’s background starlight is twice as bright as expected</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even when you remove the bright stars, the glowing dust and other nearby points of light from the inky, dark sky, a background glow remains. That glow comes from the cosmic sea of distant galaxies, the first stars that burned, faraway coalescing gas — and, it seems, something else in the mix that’s evading researchers.</p>



<p>Astronomers estimated the amount of visible light pervading the cosmos by training the New Horizons spacecraft, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/year-review-pluto-unveiled-world-no-other">flew past Pluto in 2015</a>, on a spot on the sky mostly devoid of nearby stars and galaxies (<em>SN: 12/15/15</em>). That estimate should match measurements of the total amount of light coming from galaxies across the history of the universe. But <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac573d">it doesn’t</a>, researchers report in the March 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“It turns out that the galaxies that we know about can account for about half of the level we see,” says Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab in Tucson, Ariz.</p>





<p>For decades, astronomers have measured the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/everlasting-light">extragalactic background light</a> in different wavelengths, from radio waves to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-have-measured-all-starlight-ever-emitted">gamma rays</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/13; SN: 11/29/18</em>). This provides a census of the universe and gives researchers hints into the processes that emit those types of light.</p>



<p>But the background visible light — dubbed the cosmic optical background, or COB — is challenging to measure from the inner solar system. Here, lots of interplanetary dust scatters sunlight, washing out the much fainter COB. The Pluto-visiting New Horizons spacecraft, however, is far enough from the sun that scattered sunlight doesn’t flood the spacecraft’s images.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="3111916" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/031722_lk_cosmic-bgrnd_inline-680" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/031722_LK_cosmic-bgrnd_inline-680.jpg" data-orig-size="680,503" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="031722_LK_cosmic-bgrnd_inline-680" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Sunlight scattering off dust near Earth makes for a lovely photograph (seen here from La Silla Observatory in Chile as a column of light), but it hampers observations of the faint cosmic background.ph&lt;/p&gt;

<p>So in September 2021, Lauer and colleagues pointed the spacecraft’s LORRI camera toward a patch of sky and took a bunch of pictures. They digitally removed all known sources of light — individual stars, nearby galaxies, even heat from the spacecraft’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/after-75-years-plutonium-still-nasas-fuel-choice">nuclear power source</a> (<em>SN: 2/18/16</em>) — and measured what was left to estimate the COB.</p>



<p>Then they used large archives of galaxy observations, like those from the Hubble Space Telescope, to calculate the light emitted by all the galaxies in the universe. The measured COB is roughly twice as bright as that calculation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While Lauer&#8217;s group previously&nbsp;<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abc881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted a discrepancy</a>, this new measurement reveals a wider difference, and with smaller uncertainty. “There&#8217;s clearly an anomaly. Now we need to try to understand it and explain it,” says coauthor Marc Postman, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.</p>



<p>There are several astronomical reasons that could explain the discrepancy. Perhaps, says Postman, rogue stars stripped from galaxies linger in intergalactic space. Or maybe, he says, there is “a very faint population of very compact galaxies that are just below the detection limits of Hubble.” If it’s the latter case, astronomers should know in the next couple years because NASA’s recently launched <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> will see these even-fainter galaxies (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>



<p>Another possibility is the researchers missed something in their analysis. “I&#8217;m glad it got done; it&#8217;s absolutely a necessary measurement,” says astrophysicist Michael Zemcov of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York who was not involved in this study. Perhaps they&#8217;re missing some additional glow from the New Horizons spacecraft and its LORRI instrument, or they didn’t factor in some additional foreground light. “I think there&#8217;s a conversation there about details.”</p>





<p>The light that reflects off the Milky Way’s dust, for example, is “a very subtle beast,” Zemcov says, “and our uncertainties likely get dominated by it at some point, just because it&#8217;s not very well understood.” &nbsp;Several projects in the next few years, such as the <a href="https://ciberrocket.github.io/">CIBER-2 experiment</a> and the <a href="https://spherex.caltech.edu/">space mission SPHEREx</a>, could help astronomers understand this pesky dust-scattered light,&nbsp; Zemcov says.</p>



<p>In addition, he and his research group member, astrophysicist Teresa Symons, are poring through hundreds of old LORRI images of dark sky and running their own analyses. Meanwhile, Lauer and his colleagues will take more pictures of other patches of sky with LORRI to strengthen their confidence in the measurement of the background light and to better understand intrusions from the spacecraft itself.</p>



<p>“There is something going on that we weren&#8217;t expecting,” Zemcov says, “which is where the fun part of science kicks in.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/22/repetition-can-make-even-the-most-bizarre-claims-seem-more-true/">Repetition can make even the most bizarre claims seem more true</a></h4>

              
                <p><em><em>By guest blogger</em></em> <a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>The spread of misinformation over recent years poses huge dangers, and has so far proven extremely difficult to bring under control. Psychological research has revealed much of what brings people to believe false information, but the full picture is still far from complete, and new findings are bringing to light yet more factors that may maintain this problem.</p>



<p>One example is the Truth-by-Repetition (TBR) effect — that repeating a statement increases how true it’s perceived to be. A prominent theory for why this happens emphasises the role of &#8220;processing fluency&#8221;; in essence, repetition makes the information easier to cognitively process, and this ease is misinterpreted as a signal that the information is true.</p>



<p>Until recently, this phenomenon was thought to be limited to statements which could conceivably be true. But new research suggests that the effect extends much further, and can make even outlandish claims seem more truthful.</p>



<span id="more-45790"></span>



<p>Past work in the field had found that a single repetition of nonsensical claims like “The Earth is a perfect square” didn’t influence how true such statements were perceived to be. But this may have been because the methods weren’t sensitive enough to spot a small effect.</p>



<p>To remedy this, Doris Lacassagne and colleagues at UCLouvain in Belgium showed participants more false statement repetitions than previous studies, and also had them respond on a scale with a substantially greater number of discrete ratings. Their recent study involved 232 English-speaking, US-based participants (51% female), recruited online.</p>



<p>In the first phase of the experiment, these participants were presented with eight of a possible 16 statements rated as very implausible by participants from a previous study. These included outlandish claims such as “Elephants weigh less than ants” and “Smoking is good for your lungs”, as well as perhaps more plausible claims (at least for an American sample) such as “Rugby is the sport associated with Wimbledon.”</p>



<p>Participants were asked to rate how interesting they found the eight presented statements, and were advised that they may be asked to rate the same statement multiple times. These statements were presented randomly, and repeated five times each, resulting in 40 trials overall.</p>



<p>Immediately after this, participants were randomly shown all 16 statements — eight of which they had seen repeatedly in the previous phase, and eight of which were new. They were asked to rate how true they felt each statement was, on a scale from −50 (“definitely false”) to +50 (“definitely true”).</p>



<p>Analyses of responses showed that repeating the implausible statements influenced participants’ truth ratings. While all ratings of truthfulness were still well into negative territory, statements that had been shown repeatedly were overall perceived to be less false than newly presented statements. Statements that were arguably less extreme (but still highly implausible), such as “A monsoon is caused by an earthquake”, were most subject to TBR effects.</p>



<p>Further digging also uncovered distinct patterns between participants: 53% showed a positive TBR effect, with their ratings sliding towards truth after statements were repeated, whereas 19% showed no effect, and the remaining 28% showed a <em>negative</em> TBR effect. In this latter group, repetition served to make the statements seem even more implausible. These analyses suggest that not everyone responds to the TBR effect in the same manner.</p>



<p>These findings demonstrate that a surprisingly low number of repetitions can affect the perceived truth of highly implausible statements. This challenges some theories that suggest enhancing feelings of fluency should only make statements seem true if they are plausible.</p>



<p>Further probing into individual differences, particularly why some participants found statements less truthful with repetition, could yield fascinating insights into how fluency of information is interpreted by different people. More longitudinal studies could also be informative. Shifts in truth perceptions were relatively small after a few, tightly spaced repetitions — investigating how this effect might shape perceptions of truth over days and weeks may help us better understand how the TBR effect works in day-to-day life.</p>



<p>In the era of the 24-hour repeating news cycle and online algorithms, the TBR effect gives us some insight into why and how people come to believe increasingly incredible claims. With luck, these findings will be a piece of the wider puzzle in finding more robust ways to prevent misinformation spreading.</p>

<p>Unfair treatment, including discrimination and racism, cannot be disregarded as a contributor to depression and stress in African American people. As the Black Lives Matter movement was increasingly recognized in the headlines, this study sought to investigate the benefit of discussion of unfair treatment. It was found that those in the African American community who spoke to others about said treatment had lower depressive symptoms and perceived stress, compared to those who kept it to themselves. The study also revealed an association between employment status and response to unfair treatment. These findings reinforce the importance of providing social support by reaching out to the African American community and encouraging conversation as a coping mechanism in response to unfair treatment in an effort to ameliorate its effect on mental health.</p>

<p>Monitor lizards, from pocket lizards to dragons, exhibit significant variation in size and habitat preferences, both between species and babies and adults of the same species. This diversity has imposed a fascinating question: is the evolution of growth patterns influenced by size and ecology? The authors of this study scoured numerous collections and found that there is great diversity in the way that the body, limbs, and head of monitors change as they grow. They were surprised to learn that the magnitude of this change has not shifted over time and remains constrained around an optimal value. However, ecological factors, such as habitat preferences and competition, seem to be driving the evolution of developmental change; the rate of which is found to be slower amongst larger lizards, suggesting that size is in fact a limiting factor of ontogenetic evolution.</p>

<p>As a leading global health issue that significantly burdens individuals and the economy, musculoskeletal conditions have been the focus of many scientists aiming to uncover and develop pharmacological and holistic treatments, as the range of available therapies is limited and their efficacy is inconsistent. This study explored the effect of aerobic exercise on pain sensitization in individuals with musculoskeletal pain as it is common in this cohort and significantly influences disability and quality of life. Numerous studies in this review concluded that aerobic exercise reduces pain sensitisation and suggest that it does so by activating pain inhibitory, pain sensitization and/or pain regulatory systems. However, it is not a one-size-fits-all type of non-pharmacological “pill”; the type of aerobic exercise and dosage needed differs according to the condition presented and its severity.</p>

<p>Despite severe acute malnutrition being the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, we still do not have the whole picture, as the current method used to assess its prevalence depends on surveys. These are not only expensive and only run every few years but they merely yield national or first administrative estimates that also contain gaps in area coverage. In order to bypass the security and access constraints imposed by this method of screening, the authors suggest combining the survey data with geospatial data to produce estimates that can be mapped and thus, predict malnutrition risk in both surveyed and non-surveyed areas. This theory was tested and allowed the authors to successfully map the prevalence of severe acute malnutrition in Papua, Indonesia, to a fine spatial resolution. The authors concluded that the use of geostatistical models can provide more spatially detailed data and therefore, guide efficient intervention strategies to help eradicate hunger and malnutrition.</p>

<p>While we have come to expect and appreciate the variety of fragrances provided by different flowers, it has been found that scent can differ within the same species of plants. The authors of this study have become the first to investigate the reason some populations of the evening primrose emit one scent and others, another. As the genes responsible for the differential production of its floral scent are unknown, they conducted extensive genomic analysis and found that the presence of one of the floral scent compounds, Linalool, in the floral head-space varies. They discovered that it is not that the Linalool synthesizing gene is functional in some plants and non-functional in others, but that there is a regulatory polymorphism that mediates its expression. This is believed to be because Linalool can function as a pollinator attractant or as a defense compound, thus suggesting that there is an economy of scale that exists between reproduction and defense which can be distinguished by scent.</p>

<p>Fluorosis is a common cosmetic condition that affects the teeth, characterized by color anomalies, and while we often look to the most expensive option for repair to be the most effective, the authors of this study found the case to be otherwise. Crown restorations have previously been considered to be the optimum choice for aesthetic and functional correction. However, this study found that their long-term success is no match to veneers, the more minimally invasive option and that which preserves tooth structure. As such, given that this disorder usually manifests in children, the authors suggest that clinicians should consider ceramic veneers over crown restorations when restoring the smiles of patients with advanced fluorosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-rock-formations-utah-seismic-stability-climbers-geology">How climbers help scientists vibe with Utah’s famous red rock formations</a></h4>

              
                <p>As Kathryn Vollinger prepared to climb Castleton Tower, a 120-meter-tall sandstone formation in the desert near Moab, Utah, the outdoor guide assessed her gear. Ropes? Check. Helmet and harnesses? Check. Climbing rack? Check. That day in March 2018, Vollinger’s checklist also included an unusual piece of equipment: a seismometer. The excursion wasn’t solely for pleasure; it was also for science.&nbsp;<br><br>Castleton Tower and its peers may appear still. But these soaring geologic structures are in constant motion, vibrating in response to earthquakes, human activity and even distant ocean waves. The same goes for fins, rock formations that are irregularly shaped instead of cylindrical or rectangular like towers, says geophysicist Riley Finnegan of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.</p>



<p>The seismometers measure how much the towers and fins naturally vibrate. Those data are key to assessing the formations’ stability and could even help researchers search the rocks for possible signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shaken-not-stirred-rock-formations-reveal-past-quakes-size-limit">seismic activity in the distant past</a> (<em>SN: 3/15/06</em>).</p>



<p>Such insights are important not just to scientists, but also to Native Americans, including the Eastern Shoshone, Hopi, Navajo, Southern Paiute, Ute and Zuni peoples. Many of the landforms, which are located on the traditional lands of these groups, hold cultural and religious significance, Finnegan says.</p>





<p>Finnegan’s team has been working with Vollinger for nearly five years to assemble the <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/doi/10.1785/0220210325/611796/Ambient-Vibration-Modal-Analysis-of-Natural-Rock?redirectedFrom=fulltext">first dataset on the dynamic physical properties of 14 towers and fins</a>, which the researchers published February 16 in <em>Seismological Research Letters</em>. Without experienced climbers like Vollinger on board, the project wouldn’t have been possible, Finnegan says.</p>



<p>Collecting the data was a tremendous challenge. Safely scaling the trickiest formations requires climbing chops, strength, endurance and a sizeable dose of planning. “There’s only so much risk I’m willing to take for getting those seismometers up,” Vollinger says. “When you’re hauling extra gear, that adds another element to it.”</p>



<p>Vollinger and her climbing partner, husband Nathan Richman, had to ensure that the rock faces were vertical enough to avoid dragging the equipment. Dragging would “likely knock loose rock off,” she says. Once Vollinger reached the top of a formation — after anywhere from one to six hours of climbing — she read books or chatted with her husband while a seismometer collected data. They then hauled the instrument and their other gear back down.</p>



<p>Back at the University of Utah, Finnegan and colleagues analyzed the data, finding that the structures’ lowest natural frequencies — called fundamental frequencies — range from 0.8 to 15 hertz. In other words, the towers sway roughly one to 15 times per second.</p>



<p>The team also used computer models to study the ways in which the formations bend and twist at a given frequency. Those simulations helped provide a more complete picture of how physics influences the behavior of towers and fins, Finnegan says.</p>

<p>What’s more, inputting the height, density, cross-sectional area and other material properties of the formations into the model predicted the formations’ fundamental frequencies.</p>



<p>The findings “strengthen our understanding of the dependence on height and width for the [fundamental frequencies] of these features,” says Ramon Arrowsmith, a geologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who wasn’t involved with the work. Finnegan and her colleagues have proven that “the geometry is sufficient to really talk about the dominant frequencies for the behavior of the pillars.”</p>



<p>Eventually, such a model could eliminate the need for climbers to deploy seismometers to measure frequency. And should future scientists require seismic measurements, Arrowsmith envisions robots putting seismometers in place and drones flying by to collect data later. But for now, Vollinger will continue scaling these formations for science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-diamond-surface-crust-meteorite-impact-graphite">Diamonds may stud Mercury’s crust</a></h4>

              
                <p>A treasure trove of diamonds may be sown into Mercury’s cratered crust.</p>



<p>Billions of years of meteorite impacts may have flash-baked much of Mercury’s surface into <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2022/pdf/1557.pdf">the glittery gemstones</a>, planetary scientist Kevin Cannon reported March 10 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. His computer simulations predict that such impacts may have transformed about one-third of the little planet’s crust into a diamond stockpile many times that of Earth’s.</p>



<p>Diamonds are forged under immense pressures and temperatures. On Earth, the gemstones crystallize <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-rarest-diamonds-form-primordial-carbon-mantle">deep underground</a> — at least 150 kilometers down — then ride to the surface during volcanic eruptions (<em>SN: 9/14/20</em>). But studies of meteorites suggest diamonds can also form during impact.</p>





<p>“When those [impacts] happen, they create very high pressures and temperatures that can transform carbon into diamond,” says Cannon, of the Colorado School of Mines in Golden.</p>



<p>With impact-born diamonds on his mind, Cannon turned to the closest planet to the sun. Surveys of the planet’s surface and experiments with molten rock suggest that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercurys-dark-secret-revealed">the planet’s crust may retain fragments of an old shell of graphite</a> — a mineral made from carbon (<em>SN: 3/7/16</em>). “What we think happened is that when [Mercury] first formed, it had a magma ocean, and that graphite crystallized out of that magma,” Cannon says.</p>



<p>Then, the bombardment. Mercury’s surface today is heavily cratered, evidence of an impact-rich history. Much of the purported graphite crust would have been battered and transformed into diamond, Cannon hypothesized.</p>



<p>Curious how pervasive this diamond forging could have been, Cannon used computers to simulate 4.5 billion years of impacts on a graphite crust. The findings show that if Mercury had possessed a skin of graphite 300 meters thick, the battering would have generated 16 quadrillion tons of diamonds — about 16 times Earth’s estimated reserves.</p>



<p>“There’s no reason to doubt that diamonds could be produced in this way,” says Simone Marchi, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved with the research. But how many might have survived, that’s another story, he says. Some of the gemstones would probably have been destroyed by later impacts.</p>



<p>Cannon agrees that subsequent impacts would probably obliterate some diamonds. But the losses would have been “very limited,” he says, as the ultimate melting point of diamond exceeds 4000° Celsius. Future simulations will incorporate remelting from impacts, he says, to refine the potential size of Mercury’s present day diamond reserves.</p>



<p>An opportunity to scout for diamonds on Mercury may come in 2025, when the BepiColombo mission reaches the planet. Diamonds reflect a distinct signature of infrared light, Cannon says. “And potentially, this could be detected.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-brain-change-size-shape">What do we mean by ‘COVID-19 changes your brain’?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like all writers, I spend large chunks of my time looking for words. When it comes to the ultracomplicated and mysterious brain, I need words that capture nuance and uncertainties. The right words confront and address hard questions about exactly what new scientific findings mean, and just as importantly, why they matter.</p>



<p>The search for the right words is on my mind because of recent research on COVID-19 and the brain. As part of a large brain-scanning study, researchers found that infections of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, were linked with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5">less gray matter</a>, tissue that&#8217;s packed with the bodies of brain cells.</p>



<p>The results, published March 7 in <em>Nature</em>, prompted headlines about COVID-19 causing brain damage and shrinkage. That coverage, in turn, prompted alarmed posts on social media, including mentions of early-onset dementia and brain rotting.</p>





<p>As someone who has reported on brain research for more than a decade, I can say those alarming words are not the ones that I would choose here.</p>



<p>The study is one of the first to look at structural changes in the brain before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. And the study is meticulous. It was done by an expert group of brain imaging researchers who have been doing this sort of research for a very long time. As part of the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank project</a>, 785 participants underwent two MRI scans. Between those scans, 401 people had COVID-19 and 384 people did not. By comparing the before and after scans, researchers could spot changes in the people who had COVID-19 and compare those changes with people who didn’t get the infection.</p>



<p>After a bout of COVID-19, people had, on average, less gray matter in parts of the brain that help handle the sense of smell. That’s an interesting finding, especially given the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-smell-taste-gene-genetic">virus’s ability to steal people’s sense of smell</a>, and one that’s definitely worth a whole lot more research (<em>SN: 1/17/22</em>). But it’s also not surprising, given what we know about the brain’s propensity to change.</p>

<p>I can rattle off a long, long list of things that change the brain, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-flexibility-learning">learning new things</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-strengthens-some-synapses">sleeping</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smartphones-may-be-changing-way-we-think">using a smartphone</a> (<em>SN: 9/5/17</em>; <em>SN: 6/5/14; SN 3/17/17</em>). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268356/">Learning the streets of London</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/427311a">juggling</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00319/full">meditating</a> may all change the structure of the brain. Essentially, the events of our lives are reflected in the size, shape and behavior of our constantly changing brains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Growing up is one of those events that changed your brain. As a toddler, you had the most nerve cell connections in some parts of your brain that you’ll ever have in your life. Those overabundant connections were then pruned and refined. In early adolescence, some parts of your brain were the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410522/">largest they will be</a>, by volume. Over your teenage years, parts of your brain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/adolescent-brains-open-change">got smaller,</a> a trend that continues as you grow older (<em>SN: 10/14/15</em>). Changes continue <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-blueprint-aging-set-early-life">as you age</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/16</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The brain is dynamic,” says neuroscientist Emily Jacobs of the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Less doesn’t mean worse, necessarily, and more doesn’t mean better.”</p>



<p>For instance, Jacobs and her colleagues have found that brain areas grow and shrink over the course of days, changes that are tethered to hormone levels across the menstrual cycle. This change, found in the hippocampus, a brain structure tied to learning and memory, and nearby areas, “belies the notion that the brain is static,” Jacobs says. “Instead, we can see these ebbs and flows of changes.”</p>



<p>Pregnancy, and its ensuing hormone shifts, can also change the brain. In 2016, I covered a study that described <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-linked-long-term-changes-moms-brain">pregnancy-related reductions</a> in gray matter (<em>SN: 12/19/16</em>). That story raised the same sticky question as the recent COVID-19 brain study about the right words to describe this brain change. In the pregnancy and brain study, were the changes shrinkage or damage? Or to cast it in a more positive light, was it maturing or sculpting? Study coauthor Elseline Hoekzema, a neuroscientist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told me back then that to her, the process seemed like a second stage of brain maturing, akin to the refinements that happen during adolescence.</p>

<p>Jacobs also works on menopause, another big hormonal shift that affects the brain. And she has preliminary evidence that men’s brains change day-to-day, too. Like me, Jacobs also grapples with language when describing some of these changes. Words matter, quite a bit, she says. “You can paint [research findings] as a good thing or as a horror story.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So which scenario best captures the new COVID-19 results? It’s probably safe to assume that a viral infection isn’t a good thing. But is it bad for the brain, and if so, how bad? The answer, frustrating though it may be, is that we don’t yet know. “We were quite surprised to see clear differences in the brain, even with mild infection,” says Gwenaëlle Douaud, of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford. “The concern is that these damages will last and make infected people more vulnerable to brain diseases in the future.”</p>



<p>But these differences may not last, Douaud says. The brain can “reorganize and heal itself to some extent, even in older people,” she notes. It’s also possible that the changes the team sees are due to a lack of smell input. Other research has shown that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92224-w">stuffy noses</a> can lead to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28383208/">brain changes</a>, too, some of which are similar to those that the researchers found in the recent brain-scanning study. Perhaps these brain changes would reverse when the sense of smell returns.</p>



<p>Scanning the recent brain study participants again in a few years will help clear up the question of permanence. But for now, there is no way we can say with any certainty whether these brain changes will linger — and what they mean for a healthy brain. “We haven’t distinguished between what are normal changes and what are not,” Jacobs says.</p>



<p>Until scientists figure out more about the brain, including what brain changes are normal, reversible or inconsequential, we can’t possibly know what’s worrisome. So for now, the right words remain elusive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/18/reality-tv-fuels-peoples-belief-in-the-american-dream/">Reality TV fuels people’s belief in the American Dream</a></h4>

<p>The “American Dream” is deeply rooted in the national identity of the United States. It promises that in the Land of Opportunity, any individual can climb the economic ladder and prosper through hard work and ambition alone. And yet, young Americans today are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/social-mobility-upwards-decline-usa-us-america-economics/">struggling to earn more than their parents</a> did at the same age, and upward mobility in the US actually <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-social-mobility-index-2020-why-economies-benefit-from-fixing-inequality">compares unfavourably</a> to that of other industrialised nations.</p>



<p>So why does the idea of the American Dream persist? A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ajps.12702">new study</a> in the <em>American Journal of Political Science</em> identifies one factor that has been overlooked: the influence of reality TV.</p>



<span id="more-45769"></span>



<p>Reality shows have come to dominate US television over the past 20 years, notes Eunji Kim from Vanderbilt University. And her analysis shows that the overwhelming majority of these have a “rags-to-riches” storyline: they feature ordinary Americans who work hard to achieve great economic success. Think of something like <em>American Idol</em>: these are everyday people who put in a lot of work rehearsing and going through multiple nerve-wracking performances, before potentially receiving a life-changing record contract and several thousand dollars. And while these programmes are regularly among the most-watched shows, news broadcasts — which paint a more realistic view of the economic hardship faced by millions of Americans — get a much smaller proportion of the viewership.</p>



<p>So rags-to-riches stories are ubiquitous on TV — but does watching these programmes actually convince people that economic mobility is easily attainable? To find out, Kim’s team had participants watch a 5 minute clip from a reality show such as <em>Shark Tank</em> or <em>America’s Got Talent</em>, edited to ensure it retained its rags-to-riches storyline (for instance, the <em>Shark Tank</em> clip showed two young people pitching their business before getting a successful deal). Control participants watched a clip from a reality show that didn’t have a rags-to-riches story (they saw a woman learning how to improve the behaviour of her dog). After watching the shows, participants rated how much they agreed with four statements relating to the American Dream, such as “It is possible to start out poor in this country, work hard, and become well-off”.</p>



<p>The results showed that those who’d watched a rags-to-riches clip did indeed have a significantly greater belief in the American Dream. Interestingly, when participants were separated by party affiliation, this effect was significant among Republicans but not Democrats, suggesting that the kind of messages implicit in these TV shows may play into people’s existing socioeconomic beliefs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kim also conducted a survey of 3,000 US residents, who again answered questions about their belief in the American Dream. They also rated the extent to which they believed success in life is related to various internal factors (such as ambition) and external factors (such as family wealth). Finally, they read a list of TV programmes and indicated which they regularly watched. These included 12 rags-to-riches shows, 8 other reality shows, and 10 sports programmes.</p>



<p>Participants who were heavy viewers of rags-to-riches programmes (regularly watching 6 or more of the shows) or frequent viewers (regularly watching 3-5 shows) had a stronger belief in the American Dream than those who never watched such shows. Heavy viewers were also more likely than non-viewers to attribute getting ahead in life to internal factors like ambition and hard work. And these effects held when controlling for the amount of other TV participants watched, so it wasn’t simply that these people were watching more TV in general.</p>



<p>Kim concludes that “rags-to-riches entertainment media are an important cultural force that promote and perpetuate beliefs in upward mobility”. And here’s the problem: if people mistakenly believe that hard work is all that is needed for individuals to make a better life for themselves, they may be less supportive of policies that could actually combat inequality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’d be interesting to see whether there are similar links between watching reality TV shows and economic beliefs in other countries, including here in the UK (which may not have the equivalent of the American Dream, but ranks similarly poorly in terms of upward mobility). And, of course, there are many other factors beyond people’s media habits that influence these beliefs: for instance, being older or having immigrant parents were just as important predictors of belief in the American Dream as watching rags-to-riches shows.</p>



<p>Still, the work shows the importance of studying the sociopolitical messages implicit in TV shows — particularly in light entertainment, which has traditionally been ignored by researchers in favour of news and other overtly political media. “In this era of choice, entertainment media is what captivates hearts and minds,” Kim writes. “Its political consequences are anything but trivial”.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/century-scientific-innovation-invention-technology">What made the last century’s great innovations possible?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In the early decades of the 20th century, a slew of technologies began altering daily life with seemingly unprecedented speed and breadth. Suddenly, consumers could enjoy affordable automobiles. Long-distance telephone service connected New York with San Francisco. Electric power and radio broadcasts came into homes. New methods for making synthetic fertilizer portended a revolution in agriculture. And on the horizon, airplanes promised a radical transformation in travel and commerce.</p>



<p>As the technology historian Thomas P. Hughes noted: “The remarkably prolific inventors of the late nineteenth century, such as [Thomas] Edison, persuaded us that we were involved in a second creation of the world.” By the 1920s, this world — more functional, more sophisticated and increasingly more comfortable — had come into being.</p>



<p>Public figures like Edison or, say, Henry Ford were often described as <em>inventors.</em> But a different word, one that caught on around the 1950s, seemed more apt in describing the technological ideas making way for modern life: <em>innovation</em>. While its origins go back some 500 years (at first it was used to describe a new legal and then religious idea), the word’s popularization was a post–World War II phenomenon.</p>





<p>The elevation of the term likely owes a debt to the Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter, <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/GODITS">according</a> to the late science historian Benoît Godin. In his academic writings, Schumpeter argued that vibrant economies were driven by innovators whose work replaced existing products or processes. “Innovation is the market introduction of a technical or organizational novelty, not just its invention,” Schumpeter wrote in 1911.</p>



<p>An invention like Fritz Haber’s process for making synthetic fertilizer, developed in 1909, was a dramatic step forward, for example. Yet what changed global agriculture was a broad industrial effort to transform that invention into an innovation — that is, to replace a popular technology with something better and cheaper on a national or global scale.</p>



<p>In the mid-century era, one of the leading champions of America’s innovation capabilities was Vannevar Bush, an MIT academic. In 1945, Bush worked on a landmark report — famously titled <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm">“Science, The Endless Frontier”</a> — for President Harry Truman. The report advocated for a large federal role in funding scientific research. Though Bush didn’t actually use the word <em>innovation</em> in the report, his manifesto presented an objective for the U.S. scientific and industrial establishment: Grand innovative vistas lay ahead, especially in electronics, aeronautics and chemistry. And creating this future would depend on developing a feedstock of new scientific insights.</p>

<p>Though innovation depended on a rich trove of discoveries and inventions, the innovative process often differed, both in its nature and complexity, from what occurred within scientific laboratories. An innovation often required larger teams and more interdisciplinary expertise than an invention. Because it was an effort that connected scientific research to market opportunities, it likewise aimed to have both society-wide scale and impact. As the radio, telephone and airplane had proved, the broad adoption of an innovative product ushered in an era of technological and social change.</p>

<p>Bringing inventions “to scale” in large markets was precisely the aim of big companies such as General Electric or American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which was then the national telephone monopoly. Indeed, at Bell Laboratories, which served as the research and development arm of AT&amp;T, a talented engineer named Jack Morton began to think of innovation as “not just the discovery of new phenomena, nor the development of a new product or manufacturing technique, nor the creation of a new market. Rather, the process is all these things acting together in an integrated way toward a common industrial goal.”</p>



<p>Morton had a difficult job. The historical record suggests he was the first person in the world asked to figure out how to turn the transistor, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/vacuum-tube-has-rival">discovered in December 1947</a>, from an invention into a mass-produced innovation. He put tremendous energy into defining his task — a job that in essence focused on moving beyond science’s eureka moments and pushing the century’s technologies into new and unexplored regions.</p>



<h4>From invention to innovation</h4>



<p>In the 1940s, Vannevar Bush’s model for innovation was what’s now known as “linear.” He saw the wellspring of new scientific ideas, or what he termed “basic science,” as eventually moving in a more practical direction toward what he deemed “applied research.” In time, these applied scientific ideas — inventions, essentially — could move toward engineered products or processes. Ultimately, in finding large markets, they could become innovations.</p>



<p>In recent decades, Bush’s model has come to be seen as simplistic. The educator Donald Stokes, for instance, has pointed out that the line between basic and applied science can be indistinct. Bush’s paradigm can also work in reverse: New knowledge in the sciences can derive from technological tools and innovations, rather than the other way around. This is often the case with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scanning-microscope">powerful new microscopes</a>, for instance, which allow researchers to make observations and discoveries at tinier and tinier scales. More recently, other scholars of innovation have pointed to the powerful effect that end users and crowdsourcing can have on new products, sometimes improving them dramatically — as with software — by adding new ideas for their own use.</p>



<p>Above all, innovations have increasingly proved to be the sum parts of unrelated scientific discoveries and inventions; combining these elements at a propitious moment in time can result in technological alchemy. Economist Mariana Mazzucato, for instance, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1IPsldbBg">pointed</a> to the iPhone as an integrated wonder of myriad breakthroughs, including touch screens, GPS, cellular systems and the Internet, all developed at different times and with different purposes.</p>



<p>At least in the Cold War era, when military requests and large industrial labs drove much of the new technology, the linear model nevertheless succeeded well. Beyond AT&amp;T and General Electric, corporate titans like General Motors, DuPont, Dow and IBM viewed their R&amp;D labs, stocked with some of the country’s best scientists, as foundries where world-changing products of the future would be forged.</p>



<p>These corporate labs were immensely productive in terms of research and were especially good at producing new patents. But not all their scientific work was suitable for driving innovations. At Bell Labs, for instance, which funded a small laboratory in Holmdel, N.J., situated amid several hundred acres of open fields, a small team of researchers studied radio wave transmissions.</p>



<p>Karl Jansky, a young physicist, installed a moveable antenna on the grounds that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radio-impulse-found-coming-heart-milky-way">revealed</a> radio waves emanating from the center of the Milky Way. In doing so, he effectively <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radio-astronomy-history-cosmos-black-hole-planet-universe">founded the field of radio astronomy</a>. And yet, he did not create anything useful for his employer, the phone company, which was more focused on improving and expanding telephone service. To Jansky’s disappointment, he was asked to direct his energies elsewhere; there seemed no market for what he was doing.</p>



<p>Above all, corporate managers needed to perceive an overlap between big ideas and big markets before they would dedicate funding and staff toward developing an innovation. Even then, the iterative work of creating a new product or process could be slow and plodding — more so than it may seem in retrospect. Bell Labs’ invention of the point-contact transistor, in December 1947, is a case in point. The first transistor was a startling moment of insight that <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1956/summary/">led to a Nobel Prize</a>. Yet in truth the world changed little from what was produced that year.</p>



<p>The three credited inventors — William Shockley, John Bardeen and William Brattain — had found a way to create a very fast switch or amplifier by running a current through a slightly impure slice of germanium. Their device promised to transform modern appliances, including those used by the phone company, into tiny, power-sipping electronics. And yet the earliest transistors were difficult to manufacture and impractical for many applications. (They were tried in bulky hearing aids, however.) What was required was a subsequent set of transistor-related inventions to transform the breakthrough into an innovation.</p>

But there were several hurdles to overcome before the transistor could transform electronics.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3111733">Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first crucial step was the junction transistor, a tiny “sandwich” of various types of germanium, theorized by Shockley in 1948 and created by engineering colleagues soon after. The design proved manufacturable by the mid-1950s, thanks to efforts at Texas Instruments and other companies to transform it into a dependable product.</p>



<p>A second leap overcame the problems of germanium, which performed poorly under certain temperature and moisture conditions and was relatively rare. In March 1955, Morris Tanenbaum, a young chemist at Bell Labs, hit on a method using a slice of silicon. It was, crucially, <em>not</em> the world’s first silicon transistor — that distinction goes to a device created a year before. But Tanenbaum reflected that his design, unlike the others, was easily “manufacturable,” which defined its innovative potential. Indeed, he realized its value right away. In his lab notebook on the evening of his insight, he wrote: “This looks like the transistor we’ve been waiting for. It should be a cinch to make.”</p>



<p>Finally, several other giant steps were needed. One came in 1959, also at Bell Labs, when Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng created the first silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor — known as a MOSFET — which used a different architecture than either junction or point-contact transistors. Today, almost every transistor manufactured in the world, trillions each second, results from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/physical-sciences-182">the MOSFET breakthrough</a>. This advance allowed for the design of integrated circuits and chips implanted with billions of tiny devices. It allowed for powerful computers and moonshots. And it allowed for an entire world to be connected.</p>



<h4>Getting there</h4>



<p>The technological leaps of the 1900s — microelectronics, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mould-kills-bacteria">antibiotics</a>, chemotherapy, liquid-fueled rockets, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/erts-satellite">Earth-observing satellites</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/photograph-heart-maser">lasers</a>, LED lights, disease-resistant seeds and so forth — derived from science. But these technologies also spent years being improved, tweaked, recombined and modified to make them achieve the scale and impact necessary for innovations.</p>



<p>Some scholars — the late Harvard professor Clayton Christensen, for instance, who in the 1990s studied the way new ideas “disrupt” entrenched industries — have pointed to how waves of technological change can follow predictable patterns. First, a potential innovation with a functional advantage finds a market niche; eventually, it expands its appeal to users, drops in cost and step by step pushes aside a well-established product or process. (Over time the transistor, for example, has mostly eliminated the need for vacuum tubes.)</p>



<p>But there has never been a comprehensive theory of innovation that cuts across all disciplines, or that can reliably predict the specific path by which we end up transforming new knowledge into social gains. Surprises happen. Within any field, structural obstacles, technical challenges or a scarcity of funding can stand in the way of development, so that some ideas (a treatment for melanoma, say) move to fruition and broad application faster than others (a treatment for pancreatic cancer).</p>



<p>There can likewise be vast differences in how innovation occurs in different fields. In energy, for example, which involves vast integrated systems and requires durable infrastructure, the environmental scientist and policy historian Vaclav Smil has noted, innovations can take far longer to achieve scale than in others. In software development, new products can be rolled out cheaply, and can reach a huge audience almost instantly.</p>



<p>At the very least, we can say with some certainty that almost all innovations, like most discoveries and inventions, result from hard work and good timing — a moment when the right people get together with the right knowledge to solve the right problem. In one of his essays on the subject, business theorist Peter Drucker pointed to the process by which business managers “convert society’s needs into opportunities” as the definition of innovation. And that may be as good an explanation as any. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even innovations that seem fast — for instance, mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 — are often a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02483-w">capstone</a> to many years of research and discovery. Indeed, it’s worth noting that the scientific groundwork preceding the vaccines’ rollout developed the methods that could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">later be used to solve a problem when the need became most acute</a>. What’s more, the urgency of the situation presented an opportunity for three companies — Moderna and, in collaboration, Pfizer and BioNTech — to utilize a vaccine invention and bring it to scale within a year.</p>

<p>“The history of cultural progress is, almost without exception, a story of one door leading to another door,” the tech journalist Steven Johnson has written. We usually explore just one room at a time, and only after wandering around do we proceed to the next, he writes. Surely this is an apt way to think of our journey up to now. It might also lead us to ask: What doors will we open in future decades? What rooms will we explore?</p>



<p>On the one hand, we can be assured that the advent of mRNA vaccines portends applications for a range of other diseases in coming years. It seems more challenging to predict — and, perhaps, hazardous to underestimate — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/dna-genetics-genome-code-medicine-diversity">human impact of biotechnology</a>, such as CRISPR gene editing or synthetic DNA. And it seems equally hard to imagine with precision how a variety of novel digital products (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/computer-ai-algorithm-moore-law-ethics">robotics, for example, and artificial intelligence</a>) will be integrated into societies of the future. Yet without question they will.</p>



<p>Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford and Andrew McAfee of MIT have posited that new digital technologies mark the start of a “second machine age” that in turn represents “an inflection point in the history of our economies and societies.” What could result is an era of greater abundance and problem-solving, but also enormous challenges — for instance, as computers increasingly take on tasks that result in the replacement of human workers.</p>



<p>If this is our future, it won’t be the first time we’ve struggled with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/materials-plastics-polymers-fiber-optics-history">the blowback from new innovations</a>, which often create new problems even as they solve old ones. New pesticides and herbicides, to take one example, allowed farmers to raise yields and ensure good harvests; they also devastated fragile ecosystems. Social media connected people all over the world; it also led to a tidal wave of propaganda and misinformation. Most crucially, the discovery of fossil fuels, along with the development of steam turbines and internal combustion engines, led us into an era of global wealth and commerce. But these innovations have bequeathed a legacy of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, a warming planet, diminished biodiversity and the possibility of impending environmental catastrophe.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate dilemma</a> almost certainly presents the greatest challenge of the next 50 years. Some of the innovations needed for an energy transition — in solar and wind power, and in batteries and home heat pumps — already exist; what’s required are policies that allow for deployment on a rapid and more massive scale. But other ideas and inventions — in the fields of geothermal and tidal power, for instance, or next-generation nuclear plants, novel battery chemistries and carbon capture and utilization — will require years of development to drive costs down and performance up. The climate challenge is so large and varied, it seems safe to assume we will need every innovation we can possibly muster.</p>

<p>Perhaps the largest unknown is whether success is assured. Even so, we can predict what a person looking back a century from now might think. They will note that we had a multitude of astonishing scientific breakthroughs in our favor at this moment in time — breakthroughs that pointed the way toward innovations and a cooler, safer, healthier planet. They will reflect that we had a range of extraordinary tools at our beck and call. They will see that we had great engineering prowess, and great wealth. And they will likely conclude that with all the problems at hand, even some that seemed fearsome and intractable, none should have proved unsolvable.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6366635">Identifying science in the news: An assessment of the precision and recall of Altmetric.com news mention data | Zenodo</a></h4>

              
                Abstract:  The company Altmetric is often used to collect mentions of research in online news stories, yet there have been concerns about the quality of this data. This study investigates these concerns. Using a manual content analysis of 400 news stories as a comparison method, we analyzed the precision and recall with which Altmetric identified mentions of research in 8 news outlets. We also used logistic regression to identify the characteristics of research mentions that influence their likelihood of being successfully identified. We find that, for a predefined set of outlets, Altmetric’s news mention data were relatively accurate (F-score = 0.80), with very high precision (0.95) and acceptable recall (0.70), although recall is below 0.50 for some news outlets. Altmetric is more likely to successfully identify mentions of research that include a hyperlink to the research item, an author name, and/or the title of a publication venue. This data source appears to be less reliable for mentions of research that provide little or no bibliometric information, as well as for identifying mentions of scholarly monographs, conference presentations, dissertations, and non-English research articles. Our findings suggest that, with caveats, scholars can use Altmetric news mention data as a relatively reliable source to identify research mentions across a range of outlets with high precision and acceptable recall, offering scholars the potential to conserve resources during data collection. Our study does not, however, offer an assessment of completeness or accuracy of Altmetric news data overall.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smoke-australia-fires-ozone-layer-damage-chemistry-climate">Smoke from Australia’s intense fires in 2019 and 2020 damaged the ozone layer</a></h4>

              
                <p>Towers of smoke that rose high into the stratosphere during Australia’s “black summer” fires in 2019 and 2020 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm5611">destroyed some of Earth’s protective ozone layer</a>, researchers report in the March 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Chemist Peter Bernath of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and his colleagues analyzed data collected in the lower stratosphere during 2020 by a satellite instrument called the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment. It measures how different particles in the atmosphere absorb light at different wavelengths. Such absorption patterns are like fingerprints, identifying what molecules are present in the particles.</p>



<p>The team’s analyses revealed that the particles of smoke, shot into the stratosphere by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/willdfire-thunder-pyro-clouds-aerosols-volcanic-eruptions">fire-fueled thunderstorms called pyrocumulonimbus clouds</a>, contained a variety of mischief-making organic molecules (<em>SN: 12/15/20</em>). The molecules, the team reports, kicked off a series of chemical reactions that altered the balances of gases in Earth’s stratosphere to a degree never before observed in 15 years of satellite measurements. That shuffle included boosting levels of chlorine-containing molecules that ultimately ate away at the ozone.</p>





<p>Ozone concentrations in the stratosphere initially increased from January to March 2020, due to similar chemical reactions — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-toxic-ozone-urban-air-pollution-cities">sometimes with the contribution of wildfire smoke</a> — that produce ozone &nbsp;pollution at ground level (<em>SN: 12/8/21</em>). But from April to December 2020, the ozone levels not only fell, but sank below the average ozone concentration from 2005 to 2019.</p>



<p>Earth’s ozone layer shields the planet from much of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Once depleted by human emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-damaging substances, the layer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/drop-cfc-emissions-hole-ozone-layer-back-on-track-closing">has been showing signs of recovery</a> thanks to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to reduce the atmospheric concentrations of those substances (<em>SN: 2/10/21</em>).</p>



<p>But the increasing frequency of large <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">wildfires due to climate change</a> — and their ozone-destroying potential — could become a setback for that rare climate success story, the researchers say (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-light-axion-particle-search-event-horizon">How light from black holes is narrowing the search for axions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The search for a hypothetical subatomic particle that could signal new physics just narrowed a bit — thanks to the light swirling around a gargantuan black hole in another galaxy.</p>



<p>The lightweight particle — dubbed the axion — has been proposed as a solution to the mystery of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particles-axions-how-matter-conquered-universe">why the universe has so little antimatter</a> and as a candidate for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-have-narrowed-the-mass-range-for-hypothetical-dark-matter-axions">elusive dark matter</a> that fills the cosmos (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>;<em> SN: 3/6/20</em>). The twisting and chaotic environs of galaxy M87’s central black hole, the first black hole to have its picture taken, are thought to encode information about such particles.</p>



<p>Now, the particulars of how light around M87’s black hole is oriented could <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01620-3">rule out the likelihood of axion particles in a specific mass range</a>, researchers report March 17 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. This study also shows that scientists could use a similar method in upcoming astrophysical observations to search for these particles in an assortment of masses.</p>





<p>“It’s a very exciting idea,” says physicist Benjamin Safdi of the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with this study. “They&#8217;ve come up with a new method, and they&#8217;ve shown that this method could in principle work.”</p>



<p>First proposed in the late 1970s, axions have yet to be found in experiments. Theoretical work since that initial proposal has shown an extended family of axions could exist, each variety having a different mass but all interacting weakly with ordinary matter. In 2020, physicist Yifan Chen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues described a way to look for axions <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.061102">using observations of the light surrounding black holes</a>.</p>



<p>According to theory, a rapidly spinning black hole can build up a dense clumping of axion particles in the immediate surrounding area. Precisely which types of axions get built up depends on the width of the black hole. And the supermassive black hole in M87 has the right size for brewing a stew of ultralightweight axionlike particles. If this black hole indeed kicked up such a cloud, that would change the orientation, or polarization, of the light coming from that region. In particular, the polarization would wobble over time.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no one had any images of polarized light from a black hole to examine — until last year. That’s when the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, an Earth-spanning network of radio telescopes, revealed its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">image of the polarized light</a> around the supermassive black hole at the center of M87 (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>



<p>This “is precisely the information that we need in order to carry out this theoretical proposal,” says particle physicist Yue Zhao of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “We have a very extreme condition that can produce a huge amount of axions, and we have the right tool to study the signature of the axion.”</p>



<p>So Zhao, Chen and colleagues examined the EHT data for a time-varying change in the polarization’s direction. While a cloud of axions would alter the direction, so too will the active and turbulent region around the black hole. This is a “kind of unavoidable background that we have to deal with,” Zhao says. Once they removed that from the total signal, they found that there is not enough of an additional wobble to say any signal could have come from the axion cloud. They ruled out the existence of ultralightweight axions with a mass of about 10 billionths of a billionth of a billionth of an electron’s mass.</p>



<p>But the same technique could be used to hunt for other axionlike particles. “The larger black hole you have, the lighter is your mass,” Zhao says. The physicists hope to use the EHT’s future observations of other black holes to look for axions of different masses. One black hole on EHT’s radar is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/accretion-disk-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole">the behemoth at the center of our own galaxy</a>, Zhao notes, which is about one-thousandth the mass of M87’s (<em>SN: 6/5/19</em>). If our galaxy’s monster black hole has a cloud of axions, those would be heavier particles.</p>



<p>“This idea of looking for these axionlike particles, is, in my opinion, the most exciting thing happening in particle physics at the moment,” says Safdi.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780374110376">The Brain in Search of Itself</a><br><em>Benjamin Ehrlich</em><br><em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $35</em></p>



<p>Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal is known as the father of modern neuroscience. Cajal was the first to see that the brain is built of discrete cells, the “butterflies of the soul,” as he put it, that hold our memories, thoughts and emotions.</p>



<p>With the same unflinching scrutiny that Cajal applied to cells, biographer Benjamin Ehrlich examines Cajal’s life. In <em>The Brain in Search of Itself</em>, Ehrlich sketches Cajal as he moved through his life, capturing moments both mundane and extraordinary.</p>





<p>Some of the portraits show Cajal as a young boy in the mid-19th century. He was born in the mountains of Spain. As a child, he yearned to be an artist despite his disapproving and domineering father. Other portraits show him as a barber-surgeon’s apprentice, a deeply insecure bodybuilder, a writer of romance stories, a photographer and a military physician suffering from malaria in Cuba.</p>



<p>The book is meticulously researched and utterly comprehensive, covering the time before Cajal’s birth to after his death in 1934 at age 82. Ehrlich pulls out significant moments that bring readers inside Cajal’s mind through his own writings in journals and books. These glimpses help situate Cajal’s scientific discoveries within the broader context of his life.</p>





<p>Arriving in a new town as a child, for instance, the young Cajal wore the wrong clothes and spoke the wrong dialect. Embarrassed, the sensitive child began to act out, fighting and bragging and skipping school. Around this time, Cajal developed an insatiable impulse to draw. “He scribbled constantly on every surface he could find — on scraps of paper and school textbooks, on gates, walls and doors — scrounging money to spend on paper and pencils, pausing on his jaunts through the countryside to sit on a hillside and sketch the scenery,” Ehrlich writes.</p>



<p>Cajal was always a deep observer, whether the subject was the stone wall in front of a church, an ant trying to make its way home or dazzlingly complicated brain tissue. He saw details that other people missed. This talent is what ultimately propelled him in the 1880s to his big discovery.</p>



<p>At the time, a prevailing concept of the brain, called the reticular theory, held that the tangle of brain fibers was one unitary whole organ, indivisible. Peering into a microscope at all sorts of nerve cells from all sorts of creatures, Cajal saw over and over again that these cells in fact had space between them, “free endings,” as he put it. “Independent nerve cells were everywhere,” Ehrlich writes. The brain, therefore, was made of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/see-these-first-kind-views-living-human-nerve-cells">many discrete cells, all with their own different shapes</a> and jobs (<em>SN: 11/25/17, p. 32</em>).</p>



<p>Cajal’s observations ultimately gained traction with other scientists and earned him the 1906 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. He shared the prize with Camillo Golgi, the Italian physician who developed a stain that marked cells, called the black reaction. Golgi was a staunch proponent of the reticular theory, putting him at odds with Cajal, who used the black reaction to show discrete cells’ endings. The two men had not met before their trip to Stockholm to attend the awards ceremony.</p>

<p>Cajal and Golgi’s irreconcilable ideas — and their hostility toward each other — came through clearly from speeches they gave after their prizes were awarded. “Whoever believed in the ‘so-called’ independence of nerve cells, [Golgi] sneered, had not observed the evidence closely enough,” Ehrlich writes. The next day, Cajal countered with a precise, forceful rebuttal, detailing his work on “nearly all the organs of the nervous system and on a large number of zoological species.” He added, “I have never [encountered] a single observed fact contrary to these assertions.”</p>



<p>Cajal’s fiercely defended insights came from careful observations, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/famous-brain-sketches-cajal-come-life-again-embroideries">his intuitive drawings of nerve cells</a> did much to convince others that he was right (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 32</em>). But as the book makes clear, Cajal was not a mere automaton who copied exactly the object in front of him. Like any artist, he saw through the extraneous details of his subjects and captured their essence. “He did not copy images — he <em>created</em> them,” Ehrlich writes. Cajal’s insights “bear the unique stamp of his mind and his experience of the world in which he lived.”</p>



<p>This biography draws a vivid picture of that world.</p>

                <p>The first global atlas of ocean light pollution shows that large swaths of the sea are squinting in the glare of humans’ artificial lights at night.</p>



<p>From urbanized coastlines along the Persian Gulf to offshore oil complexes in the North Sea, humans’ afterglow is powerful enough <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2021.00049">to penetrate deep into many coastal waters,</a> potentially changing the behaviors of creatures that live there, researchers report December 13 in <em>Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene</em>. Regional and seasonal differences — such as phytoplankton blooms or sediment from rivers — also affect the depth to which light penetrates.</p>



<p>Artificial lights are known to affect land dwellers, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weather-radar-grasshopper-swarm-las-vegas-night-artificial-light">such as by swelling</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">shrinking certain insect populations</a>, or by making it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-prolong-risk-sparrows-passing-along-west-nile-virus">harder for sparrows to fight off West Nile virus</a> (<em>SN: 3/30/21; SN: 8/31/21; SN: 1/19/18</em>). But the bright lights of coastal cities, oil rigs and other offshore structures can also create a powerful glow in the sky over the sea.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>All lit up</h3>



<p>The waters of the Persian Gulf&nbsp;(upper right)&nbsp;are heavily light-polluted, due to extensive offshore development and — to a lesser extent — its populous coastal cities.&nbsp;Light pollution near Jeddah, on the western coast of Saudi Arabia, also extends deep into the waters of the Red Sea (at left).&nbsp;These effects combine to send biologically significant levels of light down as far as 50 meters in some parts of the water.</p>

<p>To assess where this glow is strongest, marine biogeochemist Tim Smyth of Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England and colleagues combined a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/third-population-cant-see-milky-way-night">world atlas of artificial night sky brightness</a> created in 2016 with ocean and atmosphere data (<em>SN: 6/10/16</em>). Those data include shipboard measurements of artificial light, satellite data collected monthly from 1998 to 2017 to estimate the prevalence of light-scattering phytoplankton and sediment, and computer simulations of how different wavelengths of light move through the water.</p>



<p>Not all species are equally sensitive to light, so to assess impact, the team focused on copepods, ubiquitous shrimplike creatures that are a key part of many ocean food webs. Like other tiny zooplankton, copepods use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/moon-drives-migration-arctic-zooplankton">the sun or the winter moon as a cue</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/masses-shrimp-and-krill-may-play-huge-role-mixing-oceans">plunge en masse</a> to the dark deep, seeking safety from surface predators (<em>SN: 1/11/16</em>; <em>SN: 4/18/18</em>).</p>



<p>Humans’ nighttime light has the most impact in the top meter of the water, the team found. Here, artificial light is intense enough to cause a biological response across nearly 2 million square kilometers of ocean, an area roughly that of Mexico. Twenty meters down, the total affected area shrinks by more than half to 840,000 square kilometers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sacred-pool-ancient-seafarers-phoenicians-largest-mediterranean">Ancient seafarers built the Mediterranean’s largest known sacred pool</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a tiny island off Sicily’s west coast, a huge pool long ago displayed the star-studded reflections of the gods.</p>



<p>Scientists have long thought that an ancient rectangular basin, on the island of Motya, served as an artificial inner harbor, or perhaps a dry dock, for Phoenician mariners roughly 2,550 years ago. Instead, the water-filled structure is the largest known sacred pool from the ancient Mediterranean world, says archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro of Sapienza University of Rome.</p>



<p>Phoenicians, who adopted cultural influences from many Mediterranean societies on their sea travels, put the pool <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2022.8">at the center of a religious compound</a> in a port city also dubbed Motya, Nigro reports in the April <em>Antiquity</em>.</p>





<p>The pool and three nearby temples were aligned with the positions of specific stars and constellations on key days of the year, such as the summer and winter solstices, Nigro found. Each of those celestial bodies was associated with a particular Phoenician god.</p>



<p>At night, the reflecting surface of the pool, which was slightly longer and wider than an Olympic-sized swimming pool, was used to make astronomical observations by marking stars’ positions with poles, Nigro suspects. Discoveries of a navigation instrument’s pointer in one temple and the worn statue of an Egyptian god associated with astronomy found in a corner of the pool support that possibility.</p>



<p>It was an archaeologist who explored Motya around a century ago who first described the large pool as a harbor that connected to the sea by a channel. A similar harbor had previously been discovered at Carthage, a Phoenician city on North Africa’s coast.</p>



<p>But excavations and radiocarbon dating conducted at Motya since 2002 by Nigro, working with the Superintendence of Trapani in Sicily and the G. Whitaker Foundation in Palermo, have overturned that view.</p>



<p>“The pool could not have served as a harbor, as it was not connected to the sea,” Nigro says. He and his team temporarily drained the basin, showing that it is instead fed by natural springs. Only after Greek invaders conquered Motya in a battle that ended in 396 B.C. was a channel dug from the pool to a nearby lagoon, Nigro’s group found.</p>



<p>Phoenicians settled on Motya between 800 B.C. and 750 B.C. The sacred pool, including a pedestal in the center that originally supported a statue of the Phoenician god Ba’al, was built between 550 B.C. and 520 B.C., Nigro says. Two clues suggested that the pedestal had once held a statue of Ba’al. First, after draining the pool, Nigro’s team found a stone block with the remnants of a large, sculpted foot at the basin’s edge. And an inscription in a small pit at one corner of the pool includes a dedication to Ba’al, a primary Phoenician god.</p>

Nigro/<em>Antiquity </em>2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Gods worshipped by Phoenicians at Motya and elsewhere were closely identified with gods of other Mediterranean societies. For instance, Ba’al was a close counterpart of the divine hero Hercules in Greek mythology.</p>



<p>An ability to incorporate other people’s deities into their own religion “was probably one of the keys to Phoenicians’ success throughout the Mediterranean,” says archaeologist Susan Sherratt of the University of Sheffield in England, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/charting-past-surveys-map-two-lost-harbors-phoenicia">Seafaring traders now called Phoenicians </a>lived in eastern Mediterranean cities founded more than 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/25/06</em>). Phoenicians established settlements from Cyprus to Spain’s Atlantic coast. Some researchers suspect that <a href="https://www.asor.org/anetoday/2018/07/Were-There-Phoenicians">Phoenicians lacked a unifying cultural or ethnic identity.</a></p>



<p>Nigro disagrees. Phoenicians developed an influential writing system and spoke a common Semitic language, key markers of a common eastern Mediterranean culture, he contends. As these seafarers settled islands and coastal regions stretching west across the Mediterranean, they created hybrid cultures with native groups, Nigro suspects.</p>



<p>Motya excavations indicate that Phoenician newcomers created a distinctive West Phoenician culture via interactions with people already living there. Pottery and other artifacts indicate that groups from Greece, Crete and other Mediterranean regions periodically settled on the island starting as early as around 4,000 years ago. Metal objects and other cultural remains from various stages of Motya’s development display influences from all corners of the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>Though much remains unknown about political and social life at Motya, its Phoenician founders oversaw an experiment in cultural tolerance that lasted at least 400 years, Nigro says.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper &quot;Uncovering the Topology of Time-Varying fMRI Data Using Cubical Persistence&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology
for gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed
from fMRI measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over
time. However, analysing such data presents a challenge due to the
large degree of noise and person-to-person variation in how
information is represented in the brain. To address this challenge, we
present a novel topological approach that encodes each time point in
an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features,
i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation
naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust
to noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be
clustered to find meaningful groupings between participants, and that
they are also useful in studying within-subject brain state
trajectories of subjects performing a particular task. Here, we apply
both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to a group of
participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We observe
significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall
topological activity between adults and children watching the same
movie.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-hemophilia-clotting-blood-clot-protein">A gene therapy for hemophilia boosts levels of a crucial clotting protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>A gene-based therapy is potentially a step closer to becoming a one-time treatment for men with hemophilia. The life-threatening genetic disorder hinders the body’s ability to form blood clots.</p>



<p>In hemophilia A, the most common type, the gene responsible for a blood clotting protein called factor VIII has errors, leading the body to produce an insufficient amount of the protein. A new study describes how 132 men with a severe form of the disease who received <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2113708">one infusion of the gene therapy</a> fared. A year later, 88 percent of them had factor VIII levels high enough to have either a mild form or no disease, researchers report March 16 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Hemophilia A is an inherited disorder. The gene that provides instructions for making factor VIII is found on the X chromosome, so the condition more typically affects males than females. In the United States, there are 12 hemophilia A cases per 100,000 males.</p>





<p>The severity of hemophilia is classified by the amount of factor VIII that the body manages to produce. People with mild disease, who have 5 to 40 percent of typical factor VIII levels, are most likely to have excessive bleeding only after injury or surgery. Moderate hemophilia, with levels 1 to 5 percent of the usual amount, can also include bleeding that occurs spontaneously, without a clear cause. People with severe hemophilia have next to no factor VIII and, without treatment, face frequent, spur-of-the-moment bleeding internally that can damage their joints or brain.</p>



<p>But thanks to the treatment options available, hemophilia patients “now have a normal life expectancy and are encouraged to live normal lives,” says director of the Washington Center for Bleeding Disorders and hematologist Rebecca Kruse-Jarres of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the gene therapy study.</p>



<p>The standard treatment to prevent bleeding is a replacement infusion of factor VIII, which is needed every 2 to 3 days. That means a person with hemophilia A could face more than 150 of these treatments a year. More recently, a monoclonal antibody that mimics the action of factor VIII has become available, giving adults and children with the disease a once-weekly treatment option.</p>



<p>The gene therapy, called valoctocogene roxaparvovec, consists of a one-time infusion containing genetic instructions for producing factor VIII, delivered by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-gene-therapy-techniques-show-potential">an adeno-associated virus</a>, which does not cause disease (<em>SN: 10/28/02</em>). The virus is taken up by many different cells, but only liver cells can use the instructions to make the clotting protein.</p>



<p>While most of the study participants saw an improvement in their factor VIII levels, the therapy did not work for a small percentage. And most participants also experienced a concerning side effect — elevated levels of a liver enzyme that can be sign of inflammation or potential damage to the organ, which required treatment with immunosuppressants.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear how long the effects of the treatment will last. The researchers report that in 17 participants followed for two years, the clotting protein levels achieved in the first year decreased in the second year. The gene therapy can only be given once because a person would have an immune response to a second dose. More research is needed to understand the long-term durability of the treatment and the best way to manage the increased liver enzyme levels, says study coauthor and hematologist Margareth Ozelo of the University of Campinas in São Paulo.</p>



<p>“This will be not a treatment for all patients,” Ozelo says, but “will benefit a group of patients in the hemophilia community.” With more work, it may be possible to determine which patients are more likely to respond well to the gene therapy, she says.</p>



<p>Gene therapy could be a wonderful option, because it would almost eliminate the burden of treatments, says Kruse-Jarres. But when considering gene therapy, “a lot of unknowns come into play,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fabric-hear-heartbeat-fiber-vibration-voltage-sound-material">This fabric can hear your heartbeat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Someday our clothing may eavesdrop on the soundtrack of our lives, capturing the noises around and inside us.</p>



<p>A new fiber acts as a microphone — picking up speech, rustling leaves and chirping birds — and turns those acoustic signals into electrical ones. Woven into a fabric, the material <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04476-9">can even hear handclaps and faint sounds</a>, such as its wearer’s heartbeat, researchers report March 16 in <em>Nature</em>. Such fabrics could provide a comfortable, nonintrusive — even fashionable — way to monitor body functions or aid with hearing.</p>



<p>Acoustic fabrics have existed for perhaps hundreds of years, but they’re used to dampen sound, says Wei Yan, a materials scientist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Fabric as a microphone is “totally a different concept,” says Yan, who worked on the fabric while at MIT.</p>





<p>Yan and his colleagues were inspired by the human eardrum. Sound waves cause vibrations in the eardrum, which are converted to electrical signals by the cochlea. “It turns out that this eardrum is made of fibers,” says Yoel Fink, a materials scientist at MIT. In the eardrum’s inner layers, collagen fibers radiate from the center, while others form concentric rings. The crisscrossing fibers play a role in hearing and look similar to the fabrics people weave, Fink says.</p>



<p>Analogous to what’s happening in an eardrum, sound vibrates fabric at the nanoscale. In the new fabric, cotton fibers and others of a somewhat stiff material called Twaron efficiently convert incoming sound to vibrations. Woven together with these threads is a single fiber that contains a blend of piezoelectric materials, which produce a voltage <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-antennas-are-hundredth-size-todays-devices">when pressed or bent</a> (<em>SN: 8/22/17</em>). The buckling and bending of the piezoelectric-containing fiber create electrical signals that can be sent through a tiny circuit board to a device that reads and records the voltage.</p>



<p>The fabric microphone is sensitive to a range of noise levels, from a quiet library to heavy traffic, the team reports, although it is continuing to investigate what signal processing is needed to detangle target sounds from ambient noise. Integrated into clothing, this sound-sensing fabric feels like regular fabric, Yan says. And it continued to work as a microphone after washing it 10 times.</p>

<p>Piezoelectric materials have “huge potential” for applications from observing the function of bodies to monitoring the integrity of aircraft materials, says Vijay Thakur, a materials scientist at Scotland&#8217;s Rural College in Edinburgh who was not part of this work. They’ve even been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nanogenerators-harvest-bodys-energy-power-devices">proposed for energy generation</a>, but, he says, many uses have been limited by the tiny voltages they produce (<em>SN: 10/1/15</em>). The way the fibers are made in this fabric — sandwiching a blend of piezoelectric materials between other components, including a flexible, stretchy outer material — concentrates the energy from the vibrations into the piezoelectric layer, enhancing the signal it produces.</p>



<p>As a proof of concept, the team incorporated the fabric into a shirt, which could hear its wearer’s heart like a stethoscope does. Used this way, the fabric microphone could listen for murmurs and may someday be able to provide information similar to an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart, Thakur says. If it proves effective as a monitoring and diagnostic tool, placing such microphones into clothing may someday make it easier for doctors to track heart conditions in young children, who have trouble keeping still, he says.</p>



<p>The team also anticipates that fabric microphones could aid hearing and communication. Another shirt the team created had two piezoelectric fibers spaced apart on the shirt’s back. Based on when each fiber picked up the sound, this shirt can be used to detect the direction a clap came from. And when hooked up to a power source, the fabric microphones can project sound as a speaker.</p>



<p>“For the past 20 years, we’ve been trying to introduce a new way of thinking about fabrics,” Fink says. Beyond providing beauty and warmth, fabrics may help solve technological problems. And perhaps, Fink says, they can beautify technology too.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-raindrops-car-windows-gravity-wind">Physicists explain the mesmerizing movements of raindrops on car windshields</a></h4>

              
                <p>Staring at raindrops on a car windshield is more than just a way to get in touch with your emo side. You might also learn some physics.</p>



<p>As a car speeds along in the rain, some water droplets slide up the windshield, others slide down, and some seem stuck in place. “It’s very hypnotizing, isn’t it?” says fluid mechanics researcher Sungyon Lee of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.</p>



<p>Lee and Alireza Hooshanginejad, a fluid mechanics researcher at Cornell University, used mathematical equations to describe the forces on the raindrops. That work <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.033601">revealed several factors</a> that determine a droplet’s behavior, the pair reports March 4 in <em>Physical Review Fluids</em>.</p>





<p>Raindrops on a moving car’s angled windshield simultaneously experience forces from gravity and from the wind that speeds over the car. The direction that a raindrop moves depends on its size, Lee and Hooshanginejad say.</p>



<p>For larger raindrops, gravity wins, pulling the droplets down. For smaller raindrops, wind prevails, pushing them up the slope. For medium-sized raindrops, the forces balance out and the droplets sit still. The tiniest raindrops also stay put, because the wind doesn’t provide enough oomph to overcome water&#8217;s tendency to adhere to the glass.</p>



<p>Other factors affect the raindrops&#8217; behavior, too. As the car’s speed, and therefore wind speed, increases, larger raindrops get pushed up the windshield. Decreasing the car’s speed has the opposite effect. And if the car moves slowly enough, there won’t be enough wind to coax any raindrops to move upward. Meanwhile, windshields that are more steeply angled allow smaller raindrops to succumb to gravity than shallower windshields do, the results suggest.</p>



<p>To simplify the calculations, the researchers studied an idealized version of raindrops, based on only two dimensions. That means that the results won’t translate perfectly to real-world raindrops, Lee says, but can still give a sense of why water droplets do what they do.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Nabhan-presenting-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><em>Welcome to our </em><strong><em>SDG Editorial Board Members</em></strong><em> blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members’. </em></p>
<hr />
<p>I am an Egyptian Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. I work as a consultant of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a University Hospital, one of the largest maternity hospitals in the Middle East and Africa, with more than 16,500 births per year. A decade ago, I established the Egyptian Center of Evidence-Based Medicine (ECEBM) to produce and disseminate high quality synthesis of research evidence, to support guideline development, and to strengthen research capacity in developing countries. I am a Senior Editorial Board Member of <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em>. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of the editorial board to help the research community and to learn from them. I have particular interest in research related to high-risk pregnancy, preterm birth, and reproductive health. I contribute as a member of Guideline Development Groups of several international organizations to produce synthesized evidence and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Recently I contributed as a regional coordinator for the WHO Global Maternal Sepsis Study. Currently, I contribute as a principal investigator to an international multi-country multi-center randomized trial for women with severe pre-eclampsia. Further, I lead a group of research fellows at the ECEBM in collaboration with the WHO in multiple research projects related to women’s reproductive span, maternal age at first and last birth, and finally the indicators of fertility care. Recently, we have <a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-021-01495-y">published</a> a synthesis of research evidence regarding the effects of self-administered versus healthcare provider-administered subcutaneous medroxy progesterone for improving continuation of contraceptive use. We have shown that self-administration, compared to provider-administration, increased continuation of contraceptive use. Self-injection appears to be making more of an impact on continuation for younger compared to older women and on women living in low- and middle-income compared to high-income countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>Self-care contributes to reproductive healthcare by enhancing health literacy, empowering women and lowering pressure on health systems.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Link to the SDGs</strong></h3>
<p>Our recent published evidence synthesis and current work are directly related to at least two SDG goals, namely Goals 3 (Good health and wellbeing) and 5 (Gender equality). The work will help to reduce maternal mortality, to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.</p>
<p>Self-care refers to the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider. Self-care contributes to reproductive healthcare by enhancing health literacy, empowering women and lowering pressure on health systems. The value of self-care goes beyond its impact on resource constraints. Self-care interventions give women greater choice, access, control, satisfaction and affordable options to manage their reproductive health needs. This will help achieve health-related SDGs and cost savings to health systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the unique and critical role that self-care interventions have played in mitigating disease and saving lives through personal self-care actions such as wearing masks and physical distancing, and prioritization at national levels of self-care interventions such as smoking cessation, exercise, healthy diet, personal hygiene, etc., that people can use during period of lockdown.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenges and future directions</strong></h3>
<p>We need to work together to reduce research waste. Each step in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical studies must be rigorous to avoid misleading results and wasting valuable resources. We need to mandate the public availability of a detailed written protocol with each manuscript submitted for publication. Several challenges exist globally. These include failure to involve knowledgeable methodologists from the outset and failure to train clinical researchers, who are usually overwhelmed by their clinical workload and duties. More attention is mandatory to the issue of research reproducibility. Finally, reward systems incentivize quantity more than quality, and novelty more than reliability, leading to a flood of publications that might be methodologically flawed, misleading, or at the very least decent but not useful. This needs to be rectified if we care to reduce research waste.</p>

<p>We must make scientific research FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). The first step in (re)using research data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Once we find the required data, we need to know how they can be accessed. The data need to inter-operate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. The goal is to optimize the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined using different methods of evidence synthesis.</p>
<p>We need to expand our implementation research that addresses implementation bottlenecks, identifies optimal approaches for a particular setting, and promotes the uptake of research findings. It is critical for obstetricians to understand the most effective pathways from research to practical application. Implementation research, being systematic, multidisciplinary, contextual, and complex, is essential in obstetrics and gynecology because it addresses the challenges of the know-do gap in real-world settings and the practicalities of achieving national and global health goals.</p>
<p>In short, I believe we need better research, not only more research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lithium-mining-flamingo-technology-climate-change">Lithium mining may be putting some flamingos in Chile at risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Flamingos may be a kind of canary in the coal mine when it comes to warning of a hidden cost of green technologies. Lithium mining appears to be a major threat to the iconic pink birds that rely on ecologically fragile salt flats bordering the high Andes Mountains. Mining of the metal and climate change together <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2388">are causing the decline of two flamingo species</a> found only on Andean plateaus, researchers report March 9 in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Lithium, used in lightweight, rechargeable batteries for electric cars, smartphones and other items, is expected to play a major role in helping fight climate change. Within the next decade or so, global demand for the metal is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">estimated to quadruple</a> (<em>SN</em>:<em> 5/</em>7<em>/19</em>). The new finding highlights that the quest for lithium is not without drawbacks, fitting into a growing body of research revealing lithium mining’s adverse impacts on ecosystems.</p>



<p>One of the world’s richest deposits of lithium spans parts of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina, an area sometimes referred to as the “lithium triangle.” The region is also home to the Atacama Desert plateau, one of the driest places on Earth, and hosts a series of shallow, salt flat lake ecosystems that depend on the limited water supply. These ecologically sensitive “salares” nourish cyanobacteria and diatom algae, which in turn are eaten by three types of flamingos, half of the world’s flamingo species.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This fragile ecosystem is now in an existential conflict because lithium refinement ponds and other industrial mining processes use a massive amount of water — an estimated 400,000 liters per ton of lithium, says Nathan Senner, a population ecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there’s only so much water to go around. “This is literally the driest desert in the world,” Senner says. “Much of that [mining] water has to come from groundwater.”</p>



<p>Senner —&nbsp;with ecologist Jorge Gutiérrez of the University of Extremadura in Spain and bird ecologist Juan Navedo of the Austral University of Chile in Valdivia and others — gathered over 30 years’ worth of flamingo surveys. The researchers also examined satellite imagery tracking water surface area changes in five salt flats in the Chilean portion of the lithium triangle.&nbsp;And the team tracked cyanobacteria levels using satellite data, along with climatic factors that could influence the salt flats’ water levels, such as precipitation and temperature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Senner and his colleagues found that since 1984, the five salares have each shrunk by at least 30 percent in surface area, partially due to increased evaporation, which is influenced by climatic factors like wind, humidity and temperature. &nbsp;The team also found that there’s a great deal of variability in water level between years. And those fluctuations appear to strongly dictate the number of flamingos in a given year by determining the availability of the birds’ food.</p>



<p>Flamingo counts “can change by literally thousands of individuals across just a couple of years,” Senner says.</p>



<p>The long-term drying trend from climate change, which may reduce overall availability of food for flamingos, is being exacerbated by ever-thirsty lithium mining, the team says. And it’s leaving a mark on two of the flamingo species: the Andean (<em>Phoenicoparrus andinus</em>) and the James’ (<em>P. jamesi</em>) flamingos, whose populations declined 12 percent and 10 percent over 11 years, respectively, in Chile’s Salar de Atacama. This is a loss of hundreds of birds.</p>



<p>The team ties this decline directly to lithium mining. As the mining ponds grew in the Salar, nearby James’ and Andean flamingo populations dwindled in tight correlation. Water loss from new mining activity may be a major culprit. Between 1986 and 2018, the groundwater pumping for lithium production increased from zero to 1.8 cubic meters per second. Simultaneously, the Salar lost about five football fields’ worth of surface area every year.</p>

<p>Though the declines didn’t occur over the entire region, the findings are especially concerning for these two species because they don’t live anyplace else in the world. “They are entirely wedded to these saline lakes,” Senner says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flamingo declines and salar drying could have reverberating effects on people too since the popular, flamingo-based ecotourism in the region would probably suffer, the team says.</p>



<p>“Science-based conservation management guidelines might still allow future preservation of some key hypersaline systems in the region,” says Mattia Saccò, an ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, who was not involved with the research. </p>



<p>As the need for lithium is set to rise for use in technologies like electric vehicles, the threat to the flamingos may only increase.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a real conundrum because obviously no one is going to argue that climate change is not this monster that we need to contend with,” Senner says.&nbsp;Still, as this study suggests, the technologies that could help humankind combat climate change may have their own suite of negative ecological effects. Being aware of those consequences is going to be crucial to weighing the costs and benefits of such solutions, Senner says.</p>



<p>Finding ways to reduce those ecological costs could be one helpful way forward, he says, particularly by making lithium mining more water efficient or improving the ability to recycle lithium from used batteries.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-mask-mandate-coronavirus-transmission-covid">School mask mandates in the U.S. reduced coronavirus transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>The verdict is, once again, in: Masking in schools is effective.</p>



<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic’s delta variant wave, schools that required masking had approximately <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2022-056687/185379/School-Masking-Policies-and-Secondary-SARS-CoV-2">one-fourth the rates</a> of in-school coronavirus transmission than schools with optional or partial masking policies, researchers report online March 9 in <em>Pediatrics</em>.</p>



<p>While the findings reinforce past research on masking efficacy, this is the first study to focus on secondary transmissions, or transmissions that happen at school, and how the rate is impacted by vaccination, community spread and district size, says study coauthor Danny Benjamin, an epidemiologist at Duke University. The team found that schools play a small role in terms of transmission in a community, accounting for less than 10 percent of total cases in the study. But masks are what help keep that number low.</p>

<p>To conduct a wide-reaching study, the researchers reached out to every kindergarten through 12th grade public school district in the United States — more than 13,800 of them — to track their case numbers and origins from July to December 2021. The 61 districts that answered the call consisted of more than 1 million students and nearly 160,000 staff across nine states.</p>



<p>Now that vaccines are available for kids ages 5 to 11, the researchers are collecting more data from schools. Masking has continued to work during the omicron variant surge, but even short intervals of mask removal, such as at lunchtime, result in much higher transmission than during the delta wave, Benjamin says.</p>



<p>As state mask mandates lift, the onus for mask requirements in schools falls to the school districts. To help school administrators decide if and when students need to mask, Benjamin and colleagues developed the <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiY2EwMWM5MWYtYjFlMS00ZDhjLTllZWItMWEyZWNhZGQ3NjFhIiwidCI6ImNiNzJjNTRlLTRhMzEtNGQ5ZS1iMTRhLTFlYTM2ZGZhYzk0YyIsImMiOjF9">Masking and Mitigation Considerations Calculator</a>. The tool allows administrators to input their community COVID-19 rates and determine how masking decisions in schools will affect case numbers.</p>



<p>“This is a very granular and local and nuanced decision,” Benjamin says. Right now, as the omicron surge recedes in some parts of the country, “it’s a reasonable discussion to be having.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/15/a-mothers-early-life-experiences-of-adversity-can-influence-her-babys-sensitivity-to-stress/">A mother’s early life experiences of adversity can influence her baby’s sensitivity to stress</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Over the past few decades, it’s become clear that experiences even before birth influence later psychological wellbeing. A mother’s stress levels during pregnancy have emerged as a key influence. Greater stress seems to programme her child to &#8220;expect&#8221; a difficult environment, and so to be more sensitive to potential threats — and more vulnerable to developing an anxiety disorder. It’s uncertain, though, whether adversity earlier in life affects stress levels during pregnancy, and so might impact the child’s sensitivity to stress. So Cassandra L. Hendrix at New York University and colleagues set out to investigate.</p>



<span id="more-45267"></span>



<p>For <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-30396-001">their study</a>, reported in the <em>Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, </em>the team recruited 217 Black American mother-infant pairs from two hospitals in the Atlanta, Georgia area. To try to ensure a socioeconomically diverse sample, one hospital was public and the other private.</p>



<p>At around the end of the first trimester, each woman reported on their perceived stress, anxiety and depression. The team combined their answers to generate single individual scores of early pregnancy prenatal distress. The women also reported on their lifetime experience of race-based discrimination, and on any traumas, such as abuse or divorce, during their childhood. When they were in their third trimester, they completed the stress, anxiety and depression questionnaires again, generating late pregnancy distress scores.</p>



<p>After their babies were born, the team measured the infants’ stress sensitivity in two ways.</p>



<p>Firstly, they used a behavioural measure, called the NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale. For this, a trained examiner induces mild stress, and monitors the infant’s responses. This was done when the babies were just two weeks old.</p>



<p>The second measure was hormonal. The team measured levels of cortisol (which is produced as part of the stress response) in saliva samples gathered from a subset of the babies when they were aged between three and six months.</p>



<p>Their analysis of all the data led to a few main findings.</p>



<p>Greater maternal distress in late pregnancy, specifically, was linked to poorer scores on one component of the behavioural measure: attention. This was a measure of the infant’s ability to respond to, attend to, and track objects in the environment. Earlier work has found that newborns with poorer scores on this grow into toddlers who are less able to regulate their emotions — which makes them more reactive to potentially stressful experiences. (In line with these findings, the researchers found that lower attention at two weeks was linked to greater cortisol responsivity at 3-6 months).</p>



<p>The researchers also found that women who’d experienced more race-based discrimination during their lives also reported higher levels of late pregnancy distress. Greater experience of race-based discrimination was, then, indirectly linked to lower newborn attention scores</p>



<p>“This pattern of results highlights late gestation as a sensitive period for the intergenerational effects of stress exposure on developing attentional abilities,” the team writes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the team also found that, even when prenatal distress scores were taken into account, those who’d reported more race-based discrimination before pregnancy and/or more childhood trauma were more likely to have babies with atypical cortisol levels.</p>



<p>This suggests that however stressed a pregnant woman feels, stressful experiences from <em>before</em> her pregnancy can also have their own impact on her child’s sensitivity to stress. This might happen through changes to the way particular genes are expressed in the mother, affecting her own cortisol levels and then influencing her foetus as it develops.</p>



<p>It isn’t easy to draw very firm conclusions from this kind of research. That’s because it’s hard to control for every possible factor that might influence a child’s stress sensitivity. For example, a woman who is stressed late in pregnancy is likely to still be stressed after her baby is born — and this will affect the infant, too. It’s also certainly worth pointing out that the link reported between maternal distress in late pregnancy and poorer scores on attention was only marginally statistically significant.</p>



<p>However, the team is far from alone in finding that stress has a &#8220;cascading&#8221; impact across generations. And as they write, work that enhances our understanding of the specific contributors to this process “is integral in illuminating how adversity becomes biologically embedded and ultimately increases psychological risk across generations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saber-toothed-mammal-hypercarnivore-fossil">A new saber-toothed mammal was among the first hypercarnivores</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly 42 million years ago, a fearsome bobcat-sized creature prowled the forests of what is now San Diego. Unlike most animals at the time, it was a hypercarnivore, built to eat meat and almost only meat.</p>



<p>Meet <em>Diegoaelurus vanvalkenburghae — </em>a newly identified species of the mysterious and now-extinct Machaeroidine family, thought to be the first mammals with saberlike fangs and sharp slicing teeth.</p>



<p>Until now, only about a dozen other Machaeroidine fossils have been described, most from Wyoming but a few from Asia. Paleontologists identified <a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13032">this new </a><a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13032">predator</a>, described March 15 in <em>PeerJ</em>, thanks to a 71-millimeter-long lower jawbone with teeth that was originally found in a San Diego County fossil bed.</p>



<p>The fossil gives away that the creature had long saberlike canine teeth because the bony chin is downturned, to protect the fangs, and there is a gap in the lower teeth to fit them, says Ashley Poust, a paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. The canines themselves weren’t recovered.<a></a></p>

<p>“Those big fangs were either used to bite into the throat of the prey or were used to rip and tear the flesh,” Poust says. “This fossil, in particular, helps us understand what the whole food web would&#8217;ve looked like.… Now we know that there might have been this crazy saber-toothed animal stalking primates in the branches or maybe stalking the tapirs in the leaves below.”</p>



<p>Today’s hypercarnivores range from massive polar bears and fierce tigers to your cuddly (or not) housecat. But that lifestyle was uncommon for predators of the Eocene Epoch, which ended around 34 million years ago, and there aren&#8217;t a lot of these carnivores known from that time.</p>



<p>So <em>D. vanvalkenburghae</em> provides an early glimpse into how animals independently evolved the ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-reveal-saber-toothed-cats-may-have-pierced-rivals-skulls">slice flesh with ease</a> (<em>SN: 5/31/19</em>). Such daggerlike fangs have turned up in a wide range of ancient animals from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saber-toothed-anchovy-relatives-hunted-sea-50-million-years-ago">anchovies</a> to the much more recent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saber-toothed-cats-smilodon">saber-toothed cats</a> such as&nbsp;<em>Smilodon, w</em>hich appeared on Earth millions of years after <em>D. vanvalkenburghae</em> went extinct (<em>SN: 5/18/20; SN: 3/24/19</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/murder-hornet-asian-giant-trap-sex-pheromone">How to make irresistible traps for Asian giant hornets using sex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Male Asian giant hornets captivated by the chemical signals of a ready-to-mate queen could one day find themselves stuck in a trap instead.</p>



<p>In a new study, scientists identified three chemicals in the sex pheromone of Asian giant hornet queens. When traps with those chemicals were placed near the hornets’ nests in China — part of their native range — <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.01.065">the traps ensnared thousands of males but no other insects</a>, researchers report March 14 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The finding is a step toward designing pheromone traps, a common tool to monitor or control insect populations, for these hornets, says James Nieh, a behavioral ecologist at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Starting in 2019, nests housing Asian giant hornets (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>) — nicknamed “murder hornets” for their habit of feasting on honeybees — have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornet-sightings-washington-canada">popped up in a few places</a> in western North America (<em>SN: 5/29/20</em>). Studies hint that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asian-giant-murder-hornets-new-map-habitat-united-states">the insects could spread</a> across eastern Washington, Oregon and British Columbia in Canada, and scientists have launched efforts to control the invasion (<em>SN:</em> <em>10/1/20</em>). The Washington State Department of Agriculture even <a href="https://agr.wa.gov/departments/insects-pests-and-weeds/insects/hornets/trapping">encourages state residents to help trap the hornets</a> using plastic bottles, orange juice and rice cooking wine. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But potent insect traps should provide “something that would ideally be irresistible,” Nieh says.</p>



<p>Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, Nieh and colleagues identified hexanoic acid, octanoic acid and decanoic acid as key components of a queen’s sex pheromone. In the lab, male hornet antennae reacted — a sign of attraction — to each of the pure compounds as well as a mixture of the three. The team then crafted traps using a sticky board, a dummy male hornet and a vial filled with each of the individual pure acids, a mix of the three or extracts from the pheromone-secreting glands from a queen.</p>





<p>The male hornets had a clear preference for the queen extracts, though the isolated chemicals as well as mixes of the three trapped many hornets as well. In one test, for example, extracts from just one gland trapped about 500 male hornets — more than twice the number trapped by full concentrations of the three-chemical cocktail, which itself performed on par with two of the undiluted isolated chemicals. Control traps lacking the extracts or pure chemicals, meanwhile, attracted few males.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because male Asian giant hornets were most attracted to the pheromone gland chemicals compared with the individual acids or the mix, that means there are probably other compounds in the pheromone that could make traps even more effective, Nieh says.</p>





<p>It’s unclear whether the traps work over longer distances. But hornet queens’ sex pheromones probably lure males from farther away to avoid “incestuous inbreeding,” Nieh says. The traps could be most useful in late fall during the hornets’ mating season.</p>



<p>The finding is “important work,” says Timothy Lawrence, an apiculturist at Washington State University in Coupeville, who wasn’t involved with the study. Finding a way to attract worker hornets, not just males in search of a mate, would be great, but the results are still a “major step forward,” he says. “The sooner we find a reliable way to attract males and find nests, the better.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-coronal-loop-illusion-atmosphere-plasma-astronomy">Some of the sun’s iconic coronal loops may be illusions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coronal loops, well-defined hot strands of plasma that arch out into the sun’s atmosphere, are iconic to the sun’s imagery. But many of the supposed coronal loops we see might not be there at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some coronal loops might be an illusion created by “wrinkles” of greater density in a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3df9">curtain of plasma dubbed the coronal veil</a>, researchers propose March 2 in <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. If true, the finding, sparked by unexpected plasma structures seen in computer simulations of the sun’s atmosphere, may change how scientists go about measuring some properties of our star.</p>



<p>“It’s kind of inspiring to see these detailed structures,” says Markus Aschwanden, an astrophysicist at Lockheed Martin’s Solar &amp; Astrophysics Lab in Palo Alto, Calif., who was not involved in the study. “They are so different than what we anticipated.”</p>





<p>Scientists have begun to develop a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-corona-outer-atmosphere-complex">better understanding of the sun’s complex atmosphere</a>, or corona, only in the last few years (<em>SN: 12/19/17</em>). Coronal loops have been used to measure many properties of the corona, including temperature and density, and they may be key to figuring out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">why the sun’s atmosphere is so much hotter than its surface</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). But astronomers have long wondered just <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-solar-loops">how the loops appear to be so orderly</a> when they originate in the sun’s turbulent surface (<em>SN: 8/17/17</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So solar physicist Anna Malanushenko and her colleagues attempted to isolate individual coronal loops in 3-D computer simulations originally developed to simulate the life cycle of a solar flare. The team expected to see neatly oriented strands of plasma, because coronal loops appear to align themselves to the sun’s magnetic field, like metal shavings around a bar magnet.</p>



<p>Instead, the plasma appeared as a curtainlike structure winding out from the sun’s surface that folded in on itself like a wrinkled sheet. In the simulation, many of the supposed coronal loops turned out to not be real objects. While there were structures along the magnetic fields, they were neither thin nor compact as expected. They more closely resembled clouds of smoke. As the team changed the point of view from which they looked at these wrinkles in the veil in the simulation, their shape and orientation changed. And from certain viewing angles, the wrinkles resembled coronal loops.</p>



<p>The observations were mind-blowing, says Malanushenko, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. “The traditional thought was that if we see this arching coronal loop that there is a garden hose–like strand of plasma.” The structure in the simulation was much more complex and displayed complicated boundaries and a raggedy structure.</p>



<p>Still, not all coronal loops are necessarily illusions within a coronal veil. “We don’t know which ones are real and which ones are not,” Malanushenko says. “And we absolutely need to be able to tell to study the solar atmosphere.”</p>



<p>It’s also not clear how the purported coronal veil might impact previous analyses of the solar atmosphere. “On one hand, this is depressing,” Malanushenko says of the way the new findings cast doubt on previous understandings. On the other hand, she finds the uncertainty exciting.&nbsp;Astronomers will need to develop a way to observe the veil and confirm its existence. “Whenever we develop new methods, we open the door for new knowledge.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>In 2020, we looked at the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/13/how-well-do-you-know-yourself-research-on-self-insight-digested/">mistakes we make in seeing ourselves psychologically</a>. But how well do you know what you <em>physically </em>look like? Given that you probably see yourself in a mirror every day, you might imagine that your judgements about your face and body should be pretty accurate. But it turns out that we make some often surprising mistakes about our physical appearance, too.</p>



<span id="more-45721"></span>



<p><strong>Facial errors</strong></p>



<p>Most of us are incredibly familiar with the sight of our own faces. But that doesn’t stop us from making errors. If you become close friends with someone, you might well find it <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/08/08/close-friends-become-absorbed-into-our-self-concept-affecting-our-ability-to-distinguish-their-faces-from-our-own/">harder to tell apart their face from your own</a>. The researchers behind this study suspect that this is because close friends become partially absorbed into our self-concept. A clever study published earlier this year also found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/14/our-mental-self-portraits-contain-clues-about-our-personalities/">our perceptions of our own personalities affect how we see our face in our mind’s eye</a>. For a self-reported extravert, say, their mental image of their own face had exaggerated facial features known to relate to extraversion. It seems, then, that there are clear links between how we see ourselves psychology and physically. And this holds not just for the face but the body, too…</p>



<p><strong>Distorted bodies</strong></p>



<p>The team behind the face and personality research also asked 39 young female students to produce a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211018618">body shape self-portrait</a>. They were terrible at it. In fact, there was a “negligible” relationship between the two main measures that the team analysed: perceived and actual hip width. In this study, levels of self-esteem were linked with these misperceptions — the lower a person’s self-esteem, the more likely they were to exaggerate their own hip size, and the slimmer they considered a &#8220;typical&#8221; woman to be.</p>



<p>We make all kinds of other body-related mistakes, too. For example, when people feel powerful, they’re more likely to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120116154024.htm">think they are taller than they actually are</a>. Also, typical <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/07/first-study-of-its-kind-finds-healthy-people-have-a-distorted-sense-of-their-body-volume/">healthy people have a distorted sense of their body volume and length</a>, according to a paper in <em>Cortex</em> in 2019. The 40 young adults involved in this study tended to overestimate the length of various body parts (such as their hands and legs) but underestimate the volume of those parts. These findings add to growing evidence that, contrary to previous assumptions, healthy adults don’t in fact have a highly accurate understanding of their own body size, the team writes.</p>



<p><strong>Strange body changes</strong></p>



<p>You might not have a great grasp of your physical body, but you probably think of it as being pretty stable. Yet it’s surprisingly easy to make people feel as though they are drastically changing. The &#8220;<a href="https://magicshoes.es/the-team/">magic shoes</a>&#8221; experiments led by Ana Tajadura-Jimenez are a great example. Study participants wore sandals fitted with microphones that transmitted, via headphones, only the higher-pitched portion of their walking sounds. This had the effect of making the wearer feel physically lighter. Why? The team thinks it’s because higher-pitched walking sounds are generally made by small animals — so in an attempt to resolve the mismatch, participants’ brains reduced their perceived size.</p>



<p>Tajadura-Jimenez has also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/19/this-weird-sound-induced-illusion-makes-you-feel-that-your-finger-has-grown-longer/">recently explored the &#8220;auditory Pinocchio illusion&#8221; </a>: if adults pull up on their index finger while listening to brief sounds of rising pitch, they have the feeling that their finger is getting longer. Young children don’t succumb to this, however, so it’s likely to be something that we learn. Other research has found that we associate a “high” pitch with a high position in physical space. And so, Tajadura-Jiménez suspects, as we learn this link, it starts to influence perceptions more generally.</p>



<p><strong>Third arm, anyone?</strong></p>



<p>Feeling that we’re suddenly a bit lighter, or that one of our fingers is growing, is one thing. But we are vulnerable to even more extreme bodily illusions. While the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15709864/">&#8220;rubber hand illusion&#8221;</a> is a classic, and the &#8220;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017208">three-arm illusion</a>&#8221; is pretty cool, my own personal favourite is the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020195">Barbie illusion</a>, in which people are made to feel that they are the size of a small doll. The participants in this study wore headsets that displayed a video feed of what the doll would see if it were able to look down at its body. Then the researchers repeatedly touched both the doll and the participant on the leg, in the same place, at the same time. The illusion worked because (as also shown in the Magic Shoes studies) our brains use input from our senses to build and update a mental representation of our &#8220;self&#8221; — and if the input changes, that representation does, too.   </p>



<p><strong>Body-hopping</strong></p>



<p>Very similar techniques can also lead people to flip into feeling that another person’s face, hand, or even entire body has become their own. And when we take on someone else’s body, we change in other ways, too. Psychologists have made people feel that they were <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00917/full">inhabiting the body of Einstein </a>(increasing cognitive performance for some) and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep13899">also Freud</a> (improving the quality of advice that they were able to offer themselves). As work published in 2021 revealed (again using similar techniques), it’s also possible to make people <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/12/audio-technique-makes-people-feel-that-their-doppelganger-is-in-the-room-with-them/">feel as though they have been duplicated</a>, and that another version of themselves is in the same room.</p>



<p>Body-swapping experiments with pairs of friends have produced some fascinating results, too. Relating back to the findings on facial mental images and personality, Pawel Tacikowski at the Karolinksa Institute, Sweden and colleagues used the Barbie illusion procedure to lead one friend to &#8220;inhabit&#8221; the body of the other, and found that they <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101429">took on some of their friend’s psychological attributes, too</a>. So if they rated their friend as being really talkative and confident, for example, their self-reported scores on those traits became higher after the body swap. This is further evidence that our bodily and psychological self-representations are linked in our sense of who we &#8220;are&#8221;.</p>



<p><strong>Voice</strong></p>



<p>There’s another aspect of our physical selves that we often have trouble with: our voices. Many of us will have had the experience of hearing our voice in a recording for the first time — and hating the sound of it. This phenomenon of &#8220;voice confrontation&#8221; was documented by psychologists back in 1966. It’s thought to happen because when we talk, inner transmission of the sound through bone provides us with more low-frequency sounds than we get when hearing a voice only through air. So in a recording, our voice sounds higher-pitched than we’re used to, and that’s unsettling because it makes us question our self-concept.</p>



<p>However, there are also times when your voice is likely to actually <em>be</em> higher-pitched. A study in <em>PLOSOne</em> found that we tend to talk to high status people (bosses, high-achievers, and so on) <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179407">with a higher pitch</a>. Higher-pitched voices are perceived to be less dominant, so this could be a signal of subservience, which, depending on the circumstances, might be practically useful to you, or not — but either way, it’s worth knowing about. </p>



<p><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder</strong></p>



<p>Some physical misconceptions are more extreme than others. Though healthy people do make mistakes, someone who becomes obsessed with a perceived flaw in their physical appearance — a flaw that either doesn’t exist, or that is over-exaggerated in their minds — suffers from body dysmorphic disorder. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2010.12.2/abjornsson">This is thought to affect up to about 1 in 50 people</a>, and there are fears that selfie filters designed to &#8220;fix&#8221; imperfections <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1001/jamafacial.2018.0486">actively encourage it</a>. For some patients, their physical misperceptions relate to their body shape — they believe that it is either thinner and less muscular, or that they carry more weight, than they do in reality. This can have serious implications, as poor body image judgements are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40519-020-01018-y">thought to play a part in various eating disorders,</a> including anorexia.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>What all this work shows is though we might imagine that we have a clear picture of our physical selves, the reality is very different. Not only are we vulnerable to misperceptions in just about every aspect of what we look like, our mental grip on our bodily self is pretty tenuous, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/686106698/0/oupblogpsychology/">Managing the power of music to foster safety and avoid harm</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/managing-the-power-of-music-to-foster-safety-and-avoid-harm/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Managing-the-power-of-music-to-foster-safety-Blog-Post-Image-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>Pulitzer Prize recipient and American playwright Lynn Nottage shared in a recent interview, &#8220;What music can do is get to the emotion with incredible economy and efficiency.&#8221; This capacity that music holds to reach in and connect to the wide range of emotions we experience as human beings can be a wonderful asset as it accesses those feelings we want to revisit and are ready to express. This becomes challenging and potentially harmful when it relates to unexpressed or unresolved emotions and experiences. The potency of music can reach within us and connect to emotions and experiences we are not prepared or ready to feel, experience, or revisit.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of trauma-informed care has evolved over the past three decades and is being applied in a wide range of community and clinical-based settings with students and clients of all ages. Trauma-informed care encourages teachers, healthcare professionals, and care providers to recognize and understand the role that trauma and the lingering effects of traumatic stress can play in the lives of the individuals they serve. Next, providers discover the steps and practices to implement to avoid adding new stress, triggering, or inadvertently re-traumatizing the client.&nbsp;</p><p>While music holds a potency to connect to our emotions, it has many characteristics that can be utilized to address different needs. As a result, it is important to explore with the client healthy uses of music versus unhealthy uses of music. This can help to ensure that the client can make informed decisions about using music in ways that support their health and well-being. This can also help them recognize when they may be using music in unhealthy ways, such as listening to a song repeatedly that keeps them fixated or stuck in a negative mood state.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to determine the client’s needs, how they prefer and feel comfortable engaging with music, their desire to explore new ways of engaging with music, and when they want or need to use music in their day-to-day life. While we can listen, sing, play, improvise, and compose music, in a trauma-informed care approach, it is important to begin where a client feels safe. The client may be ready to move into other types of music experiences in time, but it is important to determine a starting place with music that does not cause the client to experience additional stress.&nbsp;</p><h2>Listening to music</h2><p>Listening to music can help to manage stress and foster relaxation. These capacities innate in music are well suited to address the principles of trauma-informed care. Designing and structuring relaxation experiences with slow tempo music (60-80 beats per minute) that is preferred by the client, can help to slow down the heart and breathing rates and foster an overall relaxation response. Listening to music at these slower tempos allows the rhythms of the body to slow down, fostering a relaxation response. This in turn can help a client feel a greater sense of safety. Additionally, working with the client to identify their preferred music gives them the power of choice and helps them to feel more empowered in making decisions for their well-being.&nbsp;</p><h2>Developing playlists</h2><p>Developing playlists of music that are calming, supportive, or empowering can give the client tools to use and easily access in their everyday life. Working collaboratively with the client in this process can foster a sense of mutuality that helps them in building their knowledge and skills to create their playlists in time. Through this process, they discover what helps them to feel safe, develop a sense of trust as co-creators in the process, and feel empowered as they communicate their preferences, and make choices and decisions about the music. They can create playlists to address a wide array of needs including shifting or elevating their mood, fostering relaxation, providing distraction, or supporting sleep.&nbsp;<em>Wellness Well Played: The Power of a Playlist&nbsp;</em>by music therapist Jennifer Buchanan is a book dedicated to exploring the use of playlists and provides suggestions for creating them to support various aspects of health and wellbeing.</p><h2>Creating music</h2><p>Singing and playing music may be a familiar experience for some clients and very unfamiliar for others. If a client is interested and ready to create music it is important to understand where they feel ready to begin. Do they need something simple? Such as chanting words on a mantra that fosters a sense of safety. Is there a favorite song they want to sing or play that fosters their confidence and helps them feel strong and empowered? Will they feel grounded playing a slow heartbeat rhythm to a relaxing piece of music? The level of simplicity and complexity of the experience can be tailored to meet the needs of the client. Additionally, this type of active engagement with music can be adapted over time as the client is ready to explore engaging in the music in new or more complex ways.&nbsp;</p><h2>Composing</h2><p>Composing a song or music may feel like a daunting task to some clients. Maybe they have a favorite song or a song that inspires or motivates them? The song can be personalized by rewriting segments of or all lyrics, so the song expresses or communicates the client&#8217;s feelings or experiences. Maybe the client is interested in writing a mantra and the melody to chant it to? Supporting the client in using their voice to express what they want to say and/or hear can help them to discover how they can create their sense of safety and can discover a sense of empowerment as they sing and hear their own words in a song.&nbsp;</p><h2>Improvising</h2><p>Improvising music may feel overwhelming to some clients as they may experience it as a lack of structure, which may leave them feeling vulnerable and exposed. If a client is interested and ready to explore improvisation, it will be important to determine the level of structure and support they need to feel safe and to be able to trust their co-creator(s) in the experience. The level of structure can be altered and changed when the client is ready, but it is important to explore this with the client so they are not caught off guard and feel unsafe in the music experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Music holds a great capacity to connect to our emotions and experiences, positive, challenging, and negative experiences. Integrating a trauma-informed care approach when using music and in music therapy helps to ensure that clients feel safe, secure, and are not triggered or inadvertently harmed. A vital element of trauma-informed practice is understanding how to use music and its elements to safely address the client’s needs. Clients may not always have an awareness that they have experienced trauma, so infusing a trauma-informed care approach in everyday practice is an important safety measure.</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by Vinzent Weinbeer on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/music-headphones-volume-to-play-5190768/">Pixabay</a></sub></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/686106698/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/686106698/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f02%2fManaging-the-power-of-music-to-foster-safety-Blog-Post-Image-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/686106698/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/tawnie-olson-re-imagining-the-magnificat/">Tawnie Olson: re-imagining the Magnificat</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/11/covid-19-and-mental-health-where-do-we-go-from-here-podcast/">COVID-19 and mental health: where do we go from here?
