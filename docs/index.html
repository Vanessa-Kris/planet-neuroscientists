<p>We’re taught from an early age that it is polite and assertive to look people in the eyes when we’re talking to them. Psychology research backs this up – people who make plenty of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/28/the-psychology-of-eye-contact-digested/">eye contact</a> – as long as it’s not excessive – are usually perceived as more competent, trustworthy and intelligent. If you want to make a good impression, then, it’s probably a good idea to meet the gaze of the person you’re talking to. However, following this advice is not necessarily straight-forward for everyone. It’s well-documented that mutual gaze can be <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190108-why-meeting-anothers-gaze-is-so-powerful">emotionally intense and distracting</a>, even uncomfortably so for some.</p>
<p>If this is your experience, you may welcome <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0301006619827486?journalCode=peca">a study</a> published recently in the journal <em>Perception</em> that documents a phenomenon known as the “eye contact illusion” – put simply, we are not that good at telling whether an interlocutor is looking us in the eye or not. In fact, we tend to think they are, even when they’re not (a bias that is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/16/after-rejection-your-brain-performs-this-subtle-trick-to-help-you-make-friends/">magnified</a> after we’ve been rejected). Thanks to this illusion, you can give the impression of making eye contact simply by ensuring you are looking in the general direction of your conversant’s face.</p>
<p><span id="more-36618"></span></p>
<p>To demonstrate the eye contact illusion, one member of the Edith Cowan University research team, Oliver Guidetti, held 4-minute “getting to know you” chats with 46 male and female university students. Both Guidetti, and the students he chatted to, wore eye tracking glasses. For half the students, Guidetti made plenty of eye contact (around 77 per cent of the time, resulting in mutual eye contact during 52 per cent of the chat) just as he usually would. For the other students, he chatted in the same casual way, but deliberately reduced his eye contact to around 25 per cent, focusing more on the mouth region of their faces instead (resulting in mutual eye contact for just 3 per cent of the chat).</p>
<p>The critical test was how much the students in the two groups believed Guidetti had tried to make eye contact and how much they enjoyed the chat. In fact both groups of students perceived the same amount of eye contact and enjoyed the chat the same amount. A follow-up experiment confirmed this wasn’t because the eye-tracking glasses made it hard to judge gaze direction.</p>
<p>The researchers, including lead author Shane Rogers, said their findings were consistent with past evidence suggesting that during normal conversation, the perception of eye contact is driven by the other person looking in the general direction of your face, not into your eyes specifically. The new findings may be reassuring to anyone who wants to be a good communicator but who finds eye contact uncomfortably intense. “Don’t get hung up on seeking out the eyes of the audience, just look more generally at their face, and let the eye contact illusion experienced by your partner do the work for you,” the researchers advised.</p>

Therefore, it is very common that older adults have more than one chronic medical problem at the same time, which impacts treatment for each of the conditions. Multimorbidity is a growing concern worldwide, especially in countries with aging populations. Numerous previous studies have reported that multimorbidity is associated with functional decline (i.e., older adults cannot take care of themselves in some aspects or more), decreased quality of life, and possibly even higher mortality, all of which are of concern to older adults and those who care for them. Aside from the burden on the individual from the conditions, there is also a societal burden from the costs associated with care for these individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Medical and long-term care insurance systems and these expenditures in Japan</strong></h3>
<p>Japan has a mandatory universal medical insurance system, established in 1961. It covers services provided by medical professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, various therapists), diagnostic tests, prescriptions, surgery, and anesthesia. In addition to the universal medical insurance system, Japan also launched a mandatory public long-term care insurance system in 2000. Those aged 65 years and older, as well as those aged between 40 and 64 years with specific aging-related diseases, are eligible for services. These include not only institutional care, whether long-term admission or short-term stay in a long-term care facility, but also community- and home-based care such as adult day care, outpatient rehabilitation, home help, or home-visit nursing. Long-term care insurance is also available in other countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea.</p>
<blockquote><p>The economic burden on society caused by multimorbidity could be better evaluated by the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures … providing a more-accurate assessment.</p></blockquote>
<p>A steady increase in health-related spending has been a great concern in countries with aging populations. For example, in Japan in 2016, the annual medical expenditures were approximately US$372 billion and the annual long-term care expenditures were approximately US$88 billion. These figures represent 9% and 21% increases, respectively, over the past 5 years. These expenditures are projected to further increase with a rapidly aging society, both in Japan and around the world.</p>
<h3><strong>The associations between multimorbidity and expenditures</strong></h3>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1057-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our recent study</a>, we examined the associations between multimorbidity and the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures using medical and long-term care claims data from Kashiwa City, a suburb in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. It was already known that multimorbidity is associated with higher medical expenditures. We found that multimorbidity is also associated with higher long-term care expenditures, thereby increasing the sum of both types of expenditures. Our study further indicated that the economic burden on society caused by multimorbidity could be better evaluated by the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures than by medical expenditures alone, providing a more-accurate assessment.</p>
<p>Japan has one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world and has not only medical but also long-term care insurance systems. As far as we know, this is the first study to examine the associations of multimorbidity with long-term care expenditures and with the sum of medical and long-term care expenditures, worldwide. As the steady increase in health-related spending has been a great threat for maintaining sustainable healthcare systems in many countries with aging populations, our results are meaningful not only for Japan but also globally. Effective strategies for reducing the prevalence of multimorbidity could provide not only medical and functional but also economic benefits for individuals and society.</p>

<p>Claims that violent video games lead to aggression have been around <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-26277-001">since the days of <i>Space Invaders</i></a>. When young people are exposed to violent media, the theory goes, their aggressive thoughts become more prominent, leading them to commit acts of violence. But while several studies have found results that seem to back up this idea, the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/18/hard-core-players-of-violent-video-games-do-not-have-emotionally-blunted-brains/">evidence is far from unequivocal</a>.</p>
<p>Now a study published in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i> <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.171474">has failed to find any association</a> between the time spent playing violent video games and aggressive behaviour, adding to a growing body of literature that suggests that such a link has been overstated – or may not exist at all.</p>
<p><span id="more-36626"></span></p>
<p>Many past studies in the field suffered from important methodological limitations, such as relying on people reporting their own levels of aggression, which opens results up to “mischievous responding”, where participants give dishonest responses just for the sake of it –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X14534297">particular problem in research with young people</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps more worryingly, researchers have often taken a “flexible” approach to analysis. For example, when calculating scores that represent the level of violence in games or how aggressive an individual is, researchers have decided to use just a small subset of all the questions that they’ve asked participants, allowing them to pick and choose from their measures to produce results consistent with their theories.</p>
<p>In the new study, Andrew Przybylski and Netta Weinstein sought to examine the link between violent video games and aggression more rigorously, avoiding the methodological pitfalls of past work and sticking to an analysis plan they described before starting out the study.</p>
<p>The pair asked just over one thousand British 14- and 15-year-olds to list the games they had played in the past month, and how long they played them for. Rather than relying on the teenagers to describe whether these games were violent, the researchers checked whether or not each game contained violent content according to the European video game rating system, PEGI (of the more than 1,500 games participants listed, nearly two in three, such as <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, were rated as violent).</p>
<p>To measure aggression, the researchers again avoided questioning the gamers directly. Instead, they asked the teenagers’ caregivers to complete a survey on the aggressive behaviours their child had shown over the past month, such as whether they had fought or bullied other children.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They also directly measured the teens’ “trait” levels of aggression, asking them the extent to which they felt that various statements characterised them (for example, “Given enough provocation, I may hit another person”). The researchers used this measure to control for baseline levels of aggression in the analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Przybylski and Weinstein found that their participants played video games for two hours per day, on average, and almost 49 per cent of the girls and 68 per cent of the boys had played one or more violent games in the past month. But the amount of time they’d spent playing violent video games did not predict how aggressive they had been. These results remained the same when the researchers classified the games’ content on the American rather than European video game rating scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given on-going concerns from parents and policy-makers about the potential negative consequences of violent video games, a null finding from a large, carefully designed study should offer some reassurance. Of course, there’s always the possibility that gaming could be associated with other bad behaviour like bullying and trolling, and the authors say that these issues are worth further exploration. And while there are clearly benefits of having a third-party rate the teenagers’ aggression, it seems possible that some caregivers could still underplay or be unaware of their children’s aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>It’s also true that the new study is just the latest in a field containing many contradictory results. But it stands apart from many past papers because of its methodology. The paper was published as a Registered Report, a format in which a journal provisionally accepts a paper based on its protocol, <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/were-offering-registered-reports-across-all-eleven-our-academic-journals">regardless of how the results turn out</a>. The authors show that it would have been possible – though statistically inappropriate – to fish around in their data until they had found a significant result somewhere. For example, there was a correlation between aggression and self-reported time spent playing games generally (a question that wasn’t part of the planned analysis). “If we had not preregistered our empirical approach and felt motivated to publish a positive result we might have seized on this correlation and made it the central focus of our research report,” they say.</p>
<p>At a time when many experts believe unsubstantiated fears surrounding technology are obscuring legitimate and more nuanced questions about the role of media in society, it is promising that researchers are grappling with these important methodological issues. As the authors write, “it is crucial that scientists conduct work with openness and rigour if we are to build a real understanding of the positive and negative dynamics and impacts of technology in people’s lives.”</p>

<p>A well-known effect in psychology is that if you try to suppress a thought, ironically this can make the thought all the more salient – known as the “<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-11/thoughts-suppression">rebound effect</a>“. What are the implications of this effect for highly religious teenagers who have been taught to believe that sexual thoughts are taboo? Before now there has been little research on the rebound effect in this context, but in a recent <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2018.1461796">paper</a> in <em>The Journal of Sex Research</em>, Yaniv Efrati at Beit Berl College, Kfar-Saba, Israel, presents evidence that the rebound effect could explain why orthodox Jewish teens have more compulsive sexual thoughts and fantasies than their secular peers. What’s more, his results suggest this mental dynamic might be responsible for the religious teens’ lower scores on self-reported wellbeing.</p>
<p><span id="more-36571"></span></p>
<p>Three studies involved hundreds of secular Israeli teen volunteers, boys and girls aged 14 to 18, and a similar number of teen orthodox Jews of both sexes, who will have been taught by the religious text the <em>Talmud</em> that “thoughts of transgression are more severe than transgression” – as well as receiving other decrees to avoid impure thoughts and masturbation – and therefore may have learned to try to conceal and suppress their sexual thoughts and feelings out of fear of shame and guilt.</p>
<p>True to this prediction, Efrati found that the orthodox Jewish teens tended to score higher on a questionnaire measuring their frequency of compulsive sexual fantasies and thoughts (for example, they agreed more often with statements like “I feel like my sexual fantasises hurt those around me”). He also found that higher scorers on compulsive sexual thoughts tended to report being less happy, and this association explained why the orthodox Jewish teens tended to report being less happy than their secular peers.</p>
<p>In the final and most revealing study, Efrati linked the earlier findings with the rebound effect. Using a questionnaire measuring sexual suppression (an example item was “very often I find myself trying to suppress my sexual thoughts”), he found that Jewish orthodox teens engaged in more suppression of their sexual thoughts, and in turn this was linked with their having more compulsive sexual thoughts and fantasies, and also lower overall happiness (presumably because of the shame and guilt associated with the taboo thoughts, although they didn’t score any higher for depression or distress). Efrati said this result “corroborates with studies on the rebound effect in many other domains … and shows that suppression of sexual thoughts only begets higher pre-occupation with sexual thoughts and fantasies.”</p>
<p>Although the findings are consistent with Efrati’s argument that the thought suppression rebound effect causes greater sexual thoughts among the religious teens, it’s important to note that the studies were purely correlational leaving them open to other interpretations. One alternative explanation, for instance, is to see everything in reverse – that the lower happiness among the Jewish orthodox teens (whatever is causing it) leads them to have more compulsive sexual thoughts, which triggers more attempts to suppress those thoughts. Even if Efrati’s interpretation is the correct one, it remains to be seen whether the same results will also apply among other religious groups besides orthodox Jews in Israel.</p>
<p>“Despite these shortcomings, ” Efrati concluded, “we view the current research as an important step in understanding adolescents’ suppression of sexual thoughts, taking into account the cultural- religious context as a major component in adolescents’ sexual development.”</p>

<p>Community water fluoridation (CWF), the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply, has been described by the Centers for Disease and Control as one of the most positively impactful public health achievements of the modern day. CWF was first implemented in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1945 and has since been employed across the United States and the wider world. CWF has been shown to significantly reduce childhood caries, the most common childhood disease.</p>
<p>This retrospective comparative analysis used dental claims records of 0-18 year old patients from Juneau (Alaksa) to explore the consequences of CWF cessation on dental health.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of CWF was confirmed by this investigation. The frequency of caries related procedures (particularly for 6-7 year olds) significantly increased during the fluoridation cessation period and there was an increase in the relative cost to treat the caries, suggesting an increase in caries severity.</p>
<p>CWF can be viewed as a kind of government investment which works towards protecting young people from childhood disease and school absences whilst simultaneously reducing government spending on healthcare claims.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0490-x"><u>Reporting of child maltreatment amongst public dental health personnel</u></a></strong></h3>
<p>According to the World Health Organisation, child maltreatment can come in the form of physical, sexual, psychological abuse, as well as generalized neglect. One quarter of adults worldwide were physically abused as children. Although abuse reporting continues to rise, an estimated third of victims of childhood sexual abuse cases go unreported. The importance of developing frameworks to detect potential hidden victims or at-risk children is immeasurable.</p>
<blockquote><p>The repeated missing of dental appointments is considered to be an early indicator of struggling households and possible maltreatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Norway, all children below the age of 19 are provided with free and regular dental treatments from the Public Dental Health Service (PDHS). The PDHS are required by law to report suspicion of child maltreatment to the Child Welfare Services (CWS). The CWS is required to respond to PDHS maltreatment concerns within 3 weeks, unless the concern is unsubstantiated. When PDHS concerns result in CWS investigation, the reporter is provided with outcome information.</p>
<p>1200 PDHS employees answered questionnaires regarding their reasons for sending a report to CWS and the responses the CWS gave.  The most common reason for sending a report of concern was if a child did not attend a dental visit, and not direct suspicion of neglect or interaction with parents/guardians. The repeated missing of dental appointments is considered to be an early indicator of struggling households and possible maltreatment. Grave caries and a lack of hygiene came 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> on the list, respectively. 40% of PDHS reports of suspicion of psychological abuse and trauma resulted in CWS investigation and measures.</p>
<p>A quarter of reports resulted in measures, but the PDHS was not aware of the outcome of a third of submitted reports. Sexual abuse, grave caries and suspicion of neglect were the most strongly associated with CWS led outcomes. Although the PDHS were shown to be efficient reporters of potential maltreatment, the relatively low measures taken by the CWS, and even feedback to the PDHS , highlights a gap between the two organisations that requires some work to close.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0591-6"><u>Using machine learning to predict bad breath from the mouth microbiome</u></a></strong></h3>
<p>Oral malodour, otherwise known as halistosis, chronically affects around 50% of the developed world. It can lead sufferers to experience low self-esteem and bullying. The molecular culprits are volatile sulphuric and acidic compounds produced by periodontis-associated oral bacteria. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) are produced by approximately 700 bacterial species residing in the human mouth. It is the concentration of the different compounds that each bacterial species produces, rather than presence of the species itself, which generates the resulting odour. For this reason it has been very difficult to establish a framework for predicting oral malodour.</p>
<p>To tackle this problem, the authors turned to Deep Learning, a machine learning process which is inspired by the communication patterns seen within the neurons of the human brain.  Bacterial samples were taken from 90 patients, half with malodour and half without. Bacteria present in each sample were identified via 16s rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. This data, bacterial identity and the odour profile of individuals, was then sorted via deep learning.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Healthy breath was associated with an abundance of Streptococcus, Granulicatella and Rothia, and malodour was associated with Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, and Porphyromonas. The authors have provided evidence that saliva samples are a suitable substrate from which to assess oral malodour and have offered a potential deep learning based method in which the efficacy of malodour treatment can be measured.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0500-z"><u>The association between stress, saliva and dental caries</u></a></strong></h3>
<p>There has been much debate regarding the purported link between stress and the occurrence of dental caries. Stress can induce behavioural changes in people that can, in turn, be detrimental to oral health. A student’s tendency to increase sugar intake and neglect oral hygiene around exam time are examples of such behavioral changes. Stress can also induce flow rate changes in saliva. Behavioral and morphological changes collaborate to potentially increase the risk of dental caries amongst a stressed population.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10859" style="width: 970px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10859 size-full" height="640" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/stressed.jpg" width="960" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">source: pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In this scoping review, the authors performed a search in OVID, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and WoS.</p>
<p>Six studies, which used cortisol as the biomarker of stress, were included in the review. 4 of these studies identified a link between salivary cortisol and caries, and the remaining 2 did not. The authors do not concede a causative link between cortisol and caries; however they instead identify cortisol and caries as an oral health research gap.</p>
<p>Regarding stress-induced salivary changes, the authors identify the limitation of the studies to have only measured acute stress responses instead of chronic stress exposure. The authors suggest the need for well designed, rigorous prospective cohort studies in which the extent that chronic stress (for example induced by low socio-economic status) effects caries is examined. The authors also suggest expanding cortisol-related measurements to more than just a single time-point (as seen in the examined studies) to better represent the complex factors contributing to human stress. The authors propose augmenting the measurement to also include:</p>
<p>1.     The source of stress</p>
<p>2.     The subject’s perception of stress</p>
<p>3.     Physiological stress responses, for instance heart rate</p>
<p>The authors conclude that although evidence can be found to support links between stress and caries, the studies actually provide impetus for a pressing need for precise, detailed, methodologically sound studies.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-018-0514-6">Comparative effectiveness of school-based caries prevention</a></strong></h3>
<p>School-based caries prevention affords children greater access to dental care, and helps to homogenise the kind of care that children from different socio-economic backgrounds experience. School-based dental treatment involving the application of dental sealants is endorsed by The American Dental association. However, efficacy of such procedures has been identified as a knowledge gap and unexplored area of research by the Institute of Medicine (Washington, USA).</p>
<p>For this reason, the authors conducted a prospective observational study on 2 populations of children receiving school-based dental treatments. Both cohorts received glass ionomer sealants, but only one of the cohorts received a secondary intervention: interim therapeutic restorations placed on all asymptomatic teeth with carious lesions. Both interventions across both cohorts were performed every 6 months, and data was collected over the course of a decade.</p>
<p>Regarding teeth, examination of any decay, missing, filled, sound or pulpal abnormalities were noted. Variables such as pain, swelling, infection and abscess were also recorded. Data was collected by the dental hygienists and dentists performing these procedures in an e-Case Report Forms, which were electronically collated and analysed.</p>
<p>There was no statistically significant difference in the number of decayed or filled teeth across the cohorts. Interestingly however, there was a significant interaction between treatment and time, interpreted by the authors to mean that the incidence rate of decayed or filled teeth slowed over time for the children who received both primary and secondary interventions. This study offers important information to those involved in school-based optimal program design.</p>

<p>It’s now well known that many of us over-estimate our own brainpower. In one study, more than 90 per cent of US college professors famously claimed to be better than average at teaching, for instance – which would be highly unlikely. Our egos blind us to our own flaws.</p>
<p>But do we have an even more inflated view of our nearest and dearest? It seems we do – that’s the conclusion of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618302150">new paper published in <i>Intelligence</i> journal</a>, which has shown that we consistently view our romantic partners as being much smarter than they really are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36608"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, Gilles Gignac at the University of Western Australia and Marcin Zajenkowski at the University of Warsaw, also tested whether the couples’ actual IQs influenced their relationship satisfaction – with surprising results.</p>
<p>There had been some previous signs that we are especially optimistic about our loved ones’ attributes. When it comes to physical attractiveness, for instance, we tend to think that we have managed to attract someone who is even hotter than us – an effect sometimes called the “love is blind bias”. But past studies had failed to find a similar optimism for estimates of partners’ intelligence. Overall, people seemed to judge their partners’ intelligence as equal to their own – rather than thinking that they were especially clever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For the new study, the researchers recruited 218 heterosexual couples, who had been together for an average of six years, and around a quarter were married. Rather that guessing IQ scores – which might be confusing for participants who have little knowledge of IQ tests and their scoring – the participants had to estimate their own intelligence and their partner’s intelligence using a more intuitive, graphical scale (see below). The researchers then converted those estimates to IQ points according to the known statistical distribution of intelligence – the famous bell curve. To find the participants’ actual, objective IQ scores, the researchers also asked them to take a standard test of non-verbal intelligence known as the Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>As the previous research on individual overconfidence had found, most participants over-estimated their own intelligence by a huge margin – the equivalent of around 30 IQ points on average. Overall, only 0.9 per cent of women and 1.8 per cent of men assessed their own intelligence as being below average (even though 68.8 per cent of the women and 55.0 per cent of the men in this study scored below 100 – the mean IQ of the population as a whole).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants’ estimates of their partners’ intelligence were even more skewed. The men thought their wives and girlfriends’ IQs were around 36 points higher than they really were; the women thought their husbands and boyfriends’ IQs were 38 points higher than the reality. In other words, if you are like the majority of people in this sample, your partner is probably much less clever than you believe.</p>

<p>Besides this eye-catching result, Gignac and Zajenkowski’s paper is rich with other findings. They were interested, for instance, in whether people tend to hook up with someone of similar cognitive ability – and whether that “intellectual compatibility” is important for their happiness together. As previous research has found, there was a moderate correlation between the partners’ actual IQ scores – so in general people do seem to pick partners who roughly match their intelligence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Maybe we have a slight preference for people with similar smarts to ourselves, or maybe it’s due to the fact that we have more opportunity to get romantically involved with people of roughly similar intelligence – in education or at work. Whatever the reasons, the degree of similarity of couples’ IQs didn’t seem to influence their relationship satisfaction – overall, couples with lower “intellectual compatibility” appeared to be just as happy as the couples who were more closely matched.</p>
<p>Gignac and Zajenkowski also examined whether the men or the women in their sample were better at estimating their partners’ intelligence. According to some evolutionary psychologists, because the responsibility of pregnancy, childbirth, and usually childrearing, falls more directly on women, they should be pickier than men about the kind of person they choose to reproduce with. If true, it would make sense for women to have evolved to be more perceptive than men of differences in other people’s intelligence. Yet the researchers found no evidence of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers admit, there are some limitations to their study. They only used a non-verbal IQ test, for instance, and it’s possible you would see different results if you also looked at verbal questions. After all, the size of someone’s vocabulary and their linguistic fluency may be easier for a partner to judge accurately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But overall, the findings help extend our understanding of our self-serving biases, showing our egotism and self-confidence can sometimes spill-over to our loved ones. Maybe we like to think we’re with a partner who reflects an even better version of ourselves.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/eCMuFBXT4t4/">Celebrate Open Data Day with Us!</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/03/screenshot-3-1-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p>Around the world tomorrow groups from all sectors will be celebrating <a href="https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> – an annual event that highlights the benefits of open data and encourages the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society. As publishers, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">data availability</a> is crucial for the validation and foundation of new research and key to our mission to help researchers advance the scientific record. In the spirit of Open Data Day, we’ve decided to defer to researchers and data enthusiasts to answer the questions: why is data important and how can we make it better?</p>
<p>We got our answers from <a href="https://prabakaran-group.org/index.html">Sudhakaran Prabakaran</a>, one of a number of dedicated volunteers at Cambridge University known as the <a href="https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/intro-data-champions">Data Champions</a> who are helping advise members of the research community on managing their data. Read his thoughts below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Who are the Data Champions? What kinds of data questions do you help researchers navigate?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think it’s a fantastic forum. [We have] a lot of discussions and people exchange ideas and not necessarily just in the sciences but also in every other field. [Data management] can be kind of confusing, even simple things like can I put my [datasets] in Dropbox? Can I share them in Google Drive? You’re talking about even labeling stuff in desktop computers. There is no clarity because this landscape is fast-moving and people are not trained to catch up with that kind of speed at which things change.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What are you working on right now? How does open data play a role in it?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our lab thrives on open data. We train machine learning algorithms that looks at specific regions of the human genome and trying to identify the most important mutations and then identify drugs to target them. Most of the datasets I work with people have already published and analyzed those datasets and they’ve extracted what they want. I’m kind of looking at things that they don’t want – I’m looking at non-coding regions, just kind of digging deeper into the datasets.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Why do you think open data is important? What do you think the future open data landscape looks like?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I don’t think open data is enough…it’s the analysis also. For example, we train a lot of machine learning algorithms and in the process we fail many, many times and we know the pitfalls we know what to avoid. But if you share that process with other people that will enable them to overcome it, to get there. It is very difficult and that process can be shared with people.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think future young people are going to be brought up in an environment where they can just click something and get access to the code and get access to the data themselves. And then the issues of reproducibility would be mitigated if you can share what you’ve done and the data set is there for other people to work with.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What advice would you give to authors and researchers to encourage them to share their data?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think we have encountered these scenarios even as a data champion in my own department. I think if you if you have incentives, as in [getting] your DOI and authorships for the dataset even before publication then it’s easy to share. It’s your data, [someone] can probably do a different kind of analysis and publish it but they have to cite this data and you will be benefited by that.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And it’s in the best interest of the authors to share it ahead of time because of reproducibility.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What can you do to encourage good data management?</strong></p>
<p>You can practice the open data lifestyle by sharing your research data in an open repository and making it available when you submit your manuscript. If you’re reviewing a submission, knowing how to evaluate the associated datasets can be tricky which is why we’ve worked with the Data Champions to cover everything you need to know in this <a href="https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/Peer+Reviewing+Datasets.pdf"><strong>Reviewer’s Quick Guide to Assessing Datasets</strong></a>. If the manuscript you’re reviewing doesn’t have an associated dataset, request it!</p>
<p><strong>About the Data Champions Program</strong></p>
<p>The Data Champions Programme is a network of volunteers who advise members of the research community on proper handling of research data. In this, they promote good research data management (RDM) and support Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (<a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/newsitem/?id=4615">FAIR</a>) research principles. It is run by the Research Data Management Facility at the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Dr. Ryohei Yasuda of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has received a grant by the National Institute of Mental Health of the NIH. The award is for $2.9 million over 5 years and will continue the funding of Yasuda’s work with Rab proteins.</p>
<p>Using cutting-edge imaging techniques, Dr. Yasuda is studying Rab proteins’ impact on learning and memory by tracking how molecules become activated and interact with each other. By better understanding how these proteins communicate with each other, scientists may one day be able to develop interventions for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Disease and other brain disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda is a Scientific Director of MPFI and leads the Neuronal Signal Transduction Lab. He has received many recognitions for his outstanding research in neuroscience, including the 2015 National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Pioneer Award, which recognizes scientists demonstrating creativity and groundbreaking approaches in biomedical or behavioral science. Dr. Yasuda was one of only 13 scientists in the country to receive the NIH Pioneer Award in 2015.</p>
<p>Additional awards include the Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the New Investigator Award from the Alzheimer’s Association, and Research Award for Innovative Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience.</p>
<p>Dr. Yasuda received his PhD in Physics in 1998 from Keio University Graduate School of Science and Technology in Yokohama, Japan. In his PhD studies, he demonstrated that the enzyme ATP synthase is a rotary motor made of single molecule and that its energy conversion efficiency is close to 100%. From 2000 to 2005, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he built an imaging device to monitor protein interactions in living cells with high sensitivity and resolution. From 2005 to 2012, he was an assistant professor of the Neurobiology department at the Duke University Medical Center where he developed a number of techniques to visualize signaling activity in single synapses. From 2009 to 2012, Dr. Yasuda served as an Early Career Scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute before coming to MPFI in 2012.</p>

<p>Major disasters clearly take a toll on the survivors who had the misfortune to go through them. But there is another group of people who can suffer mental and physical distress from disasters: those who experience them second-hand, through media coverage and conversation. After 9/11, for example, researchers found an increase in symptoms of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002214650504600304">depression</a> and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-10485-003">stress</a> among Americans who hadn’t directly experienced the terrorist attacks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But there have always been doubts about studies purporting to show evidence of vicarious distress. Because disasters occur randomly researchers are usually unable to gather data until weeks after the event, and they often have no record of people’s baseline mood before the disaster.</p>
<p>By chance a new study was able to overcome these limitations. When tragedy struck the Netherlands in 2014, there was a ready-made group of participants who were already recording their daily experiences. In May of that year, Bertus Jeronimus and colleagues at the University of Groningen had begun a crowd-sourced diary study called “HowNutsAreTheDutch” to examine mental health in the Netherlands. Three times per day for 30 days, participants completed questionnaires on their phones that measured their mood and recent activities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two months into the project, on 17 July 2014, Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists, killing all 298 on board. One hundred and ninety-six of the victims were Dutch and the disaster received widespread attention in the Dutch media.</p>
<p>For their study published recently in the <i>British Journal of Psychology</i>, Jeronimus and colleagues took advantage of this tragic twist of fate and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjop.12358">examined the data</a> gathered from 141 participants who were taking part around the time of the MH17 crash, to see how they were affected by their vicarious experience of the disaster.</p>
<p><span id="more-36590"></span></p>
<p>The team compared participants’ ratings of their mood and physical discomfort in the three days immediately following the crash with their average ratings earlier and later in the study. In each questionnaire, participants had rated themselves for six positive moods (e.g. energetic, cheerful) and six negative moods (e.g. irritable, tired). The questionnaires also measured the extent of general physical discomfort – for example, experience of symptoms like headaches or diarrhoea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As expected, in the three days after the crash the participants showed a higher level of negative emotion and a lower level of positive emotion, and also reported more physical discomfort. But although statistically significant these responses were pretty small: each rating scale ranged from 0 to 100, and the biggest effect (for physical discomfort) represented a change of just 2.78 points on this scale.</p>
<p>The researchers then looked at whether these changes were associated with aspects of participants’ personality like neuroticism and extraversion. These results were surprising: they had expected that people high in neuroticism, who worry and ruminate a lot, might be more affected by the crash – but in fact these participants tended to show <i>less</i> of a reduction in positive mood than people low in neuroticism. On the other hand, strong extraverts, who usually score higher on happiness and mood than introverts, tended to have a greater drop in mood than the quieter types.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors speculated that extraverts tend to socialise more and so could have spent more time talking about the disaster with others, precipitating a drop in their mood. High scorers on neuroticism, they suggested, might be more likely to respond to stress that directly involves themselves, rather than vicarious experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Personality had no association with changes to negative mood, and overall the authors concluded that “broad personality domains are of little importance in predicting differences in vicarious exposure effects.” In this respect, age seemed more important: older participants tended to have less of an increase in negative emotions. Older people may have better strategies for coping with traumatic events, the author say.</p>
<p>Although the study was exploratory, it provides a rare insight into how indirect experience of disasters can affect the general population, albeit in small ways. But while the MH17 crash was a shocking event, it also occurred halfway across Europe and didn’t involve a continuing threat to the population of the Netherlands, which, the authors say, “may have allowed them to retain their sense of safety”. The effects of vicariously experiencing a more immediate disaster – and the importance of personality differences in this response – could be quite different.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Multimorbidity is the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions in a patient. Technological and social changes are resulting in increases in both sedentary lifestyles and life expectancy, which in turn lead to more people developing multimorbidity. This trends has begun putting significant pressures on the medical sector and its infrastructure. Nurses, in particular, are faced with significant challenges whilst coordinating multiple care plans for their patients’ individual conditions.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10851" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10851 size-medium" height="176" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/02/nurs-twitter-300x176.png" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Most frequently used words during the #FutNur Twitter chat, from O’Connor et al.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The Florence Nightingale Fodunation took to Twitter to ask nurses four questions related to multimorbidity and encouraged Twitter users to suggest solutions and to debate amongst each other. Twenty-four users responded using the hashtag created by the foundation, #FutNur, potentially reaching over 50,000 Twitter users. In a recent paper, O’Connor <em>et al.</em> used these data to research what nurses believe is needed to care for patients with multimorbidity.</p>
<p>The replies were grouped into five particular themes of what the nursing profession must focus on in order to effectively cope with morbidity. Helping patients and their friends and family deal with the burden of having multiple chronic conditions was the initial focus. Next was the type of care nurses need to deliver, with the respondents believing holistic care is essential. Additional themes were the need for more evidence on methods of treating multimorbidity and the quality of education nurses receive regarding this issue. Finally, the respondents expressed a frustration in the way the health services were designed, and several suggestions were made to improve it.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that Twitter, and other social media, can potentially be very helpful in research amongst health professionals. Furthermore, they found that there are many ways in which coping with multimorbidity can be made easier. These include investing in research and nursing education surrounding the topic and creating better tools and guidelines to help nurses care for those with multimorbidity.</p>
<h3><a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-018-0277-z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">From apprehension to advocacy:  nursing students’ experiences with care home placement</a></h3>
<p>As populations around the world age, more nurses with experience caring for older adults are needed. However, lack of interest among nursing students and insufficient education in nursing schools focused on care of older adults have contributed to a nursing workforce, already stretched thin across all fields, that is not prepared to care for this growing demographic. One potential solution is placement of nursing students within residential aged care (RAC) settings for clinical education.</p>
<p>In order to explore key stakeholders’ experiences with nursing student placement in RAC, Moquin <em>et al.</em> conducted a qualitative study using a participatory action research approach. Nursing students were interviewed both before and after placement, and their instructors, RAC staff, and residents were interviewed after.</p>
<p>The study found that although students began their placements with a range of concerns, over the course of the placement, they became comfortable in the setting and actively engaged with and advocated for the residents.  Although many of the students indicated that they were unlikely to pursue a career in RAC, they did value the skills learned and felt that they would be better prepared to care for older patients in other settings.</p>
<h3><a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-018-0309-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nurses’ experiences of an unfamiliar method of assisted suicide</a></h3>
<p>Assisted suicide in Switzerland is legal and not uncommon. Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking (VSED) is a method of actively hastening one’s own death, and doesn’t require a doctor’s approval or a terminal diagnosis, though it does often require medical support from nurses or medical staff. It is the individual’s choice, and it allows them, and their friends and families, time to prepare for their death. But how do nurses feel about VSED in their professional role?</p>
<p>Saladin <em>et al.</em> conducted an embedded single case study of a patient living in a long-term care institution choosing to end her life via VSED. By conducting group and individual interviews, they gathered information regarding the impact of this choice on those closest to the patient, including relatives and care institution staff.</p>
<p>The results of the interviews showed that the nursing staff felt obliged to help the patient hasten her death via VSED, as it was her choice to do so. They further described how the general manager of the institution initially did not want to allow VSED to occur, but the nursing staff advocated for the patient. In doing so, the staff sometimes struggled between caring for the person and arguing with the institution they worked for. They had to find an acceptable way both for the patient to be allowed to choose her death and for the institution to be comfortable with the process.</p>

<p>The study concludes that the attitude of the institution itself can be decisive in how VSED is dealt with; VSED can be perceived as suicide or as natural dying, and institutions are generally less comfortable with the former. Therefore, the authors believe it is important that health care professionals develop a professional opinion of VSED, thereby benefiting patients who choose VSED towards the end of their lives, as well as their relatives and those who care for them.</p>

<p>Many of the healthcare interventions launched as part of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> rely on a sufficient workforce of nurses with relevant competencies, but Sub-Saharan Africa has an estimated shortfall of 600,000 nurses needed for these initiatives. Improvements in nursing education are needed to increase the nursing workforce and improve the quality of healthcare. This review from Bvumbwe and Mtshali integrated literature reporting on nursing education challenges and their solutions, in order to identify needs for and possible methods of improvement.</p>
<p>Systematic and targeted searches of academic and gray literature led to a final sample of 20 academic and five gray-literature articles. Thematic analysis was used to identify six themes, representing different challenges and their possible solutions: curriculum reforms, professional regulation, transformative teaching strategies, collaboration and partnership, capacity building, and infrastructure and resources. Within each of these areas, gaps and unmet demands were identified along with reforms and interventions that were beginning to address them in some contexts.</p>
<p>This review highlighted common challenges in nursing education faced by many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, from lack of infrastructure to insufficient faculty. Strategies to address these challenges are being implemented and this review points to those that have had positive effects and to where further efforts are needed.</p>

<p>In contact sports like boxing and rugby you can use your pre-match nerves to fuel your determination, speed and aggression. In contrast, in a sport like table tennis that involves fine motor control, nerves can also stifle your performance, making you stiff and clumsy. It seems obvious that learning to control your emotions prior to games should therefore be important to table tennis players (and competitors in other sports that require precision). Yet, surprisingly, as the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12451?af=R">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality</em> point out, “to date, only a few studies have investigated the relation between emotional regulation and … sport performance”.</p>
<p>To find out more, Jeanette Kubiak and her colleagues, at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, surveyed hundreds of league table tennis players in Germany about the ways they controlled their emotions prior to matches, and then compared these results against objective measures of the participants’ league performance. The research uncovered several emotional control strategies used more often by better and improving players. “Taken together, the findings provide evidence for the importance of emotion regulation regarding sport performance,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><span id="more-36560"></span></p>
<p>Over 300 table tennis players took part covering a wide range of ability and with an average of 24 years experience playing the game (the average age was 39 and there were 70 women). Reflecting on the prior season, players rated how often they tended to use ten different emotional control strategies based on the “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2014.940781">process model of emotion regulation</a>” put forward by Stanford clinical psychologist James Gross.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at two end-of-season objective measures of success. The first was the players’ end-of-season ranking. They found that higher-ranked players more often calmed their pre-match nerves by: using physical preparation (e.g. swinging their arms and getting warmed up); using positive self-talk (e.g. telling themselves they will win); planning (e.g. thinking about their tactics); and by suppressing their negative emotions and deliberately giving off an impression of supreme confidence. At the same time, higher-ranked players <em>less</em> often reported catastrophising, such as thinking how badly the game could go.</p>
<p>The second outcome measure was improved performance over the previous season – that is, winning more games this season than last. Improving players more often used positive self-talk and less often indulged in self-blame (e.g. thinking they should have practiced more); ruminated less about their anxious feelings; and catastrophised less.</p>
<p>The study is limited by its cross-sectional design. For instance, it’s possible that winning and earning a higher ranking changed how players managed their emotions, rather than emotional regulation driving better performance. The retrospective nature of the survey is another short-coming – it’s even possible that winning changes how players think about and remember their emotional strategies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Kubiak and her team point out, “no [previous] studies have investigated several emotion regulation strategies affiliated with different stages in the process model of emotion regulation in handling emotions prior to a competition”.  They added that their findings “are interesting for sports psychology because they help to clarify why some competitive athletes fail to take full advantage of their performance potential, whereas others are successful.”</p>

<p>Sam Sutton's journal club session, where he will present the paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8094937">ASP, Learning to Forget With Adaptive Synaptic Plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks (Panda et al., 2018)</a>"</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A fundamental feature of learning in animals is the “ability to forget” that allows an organism to perceive, model, and make decisions from disparate streams of information and adapt to changing environments. Against this backdrop, we present a novel unsupervised learning mechanism adaptive synaptic plasticity (ASP) for improved recognition with spiking neural networks (SNNs) for real time online learning in a dynamic environment. We incorporate an adaptive weight decay mechanism with the traditional spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning to model adaptivity in SNNs. The leak rate of the synaptic weights is modulated based on the temporal correlation between the spiking patterns of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This mechanism helps in gradual forgetting of insignificant data while retaining significant, yet old, information. ASP, thus, maintains a balance between forgetting and immediate learning to construct a stable-plastic self-adaptive SNN for continuously changing inputs. We demonstrate that the proposed learning methodology addresses catastrophic forgetting, while yielding significantly improved accuracy over the conventional STDP learning method for digit recognition applications. In addition, we observe that the proposed learning model automatically encodes selective attention toward relevant features in the input data, while eliminating the influence of background noise (or denoising) further improving the robustness of the ASP learning.</p>

<p>For decades, linguists have debated the extent to which language influences the way we think. While the more extreme theories that language <i>determines</i> what we can and can’t think about have fallen out of favour, there is still considerable evidence that the languages we speak shape the way we see the world in more subtle ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For instance, people are better at perceiving the difference between light and dark blue <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/02/your-native-language-affects-what-you-can-and-cant-see/">if they have dedicated words for those colours</a> (like in Russian) than if they don’t (like in English). But it turns out it’s not just the words that we use: the way in which a language is structured – its syntax – is also important. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37654-9">In a recent study</a> in <i>Scientific Reports</i>, Federica Amici and colleagues show that the word order of a language predicts how good its speakers are at remembering the first or last parts of a list.</p>
<p><span id="more-36556"></span></p>
<p>The team conducted memory tasks with speakers of eight different languages around the world. Four of the languages were what’s known as right-branching – Ndonga, Khmer, Thai and Italian – and four were left-branching – Japanese, Korean, Khoekhoe and Sidaama. They included 24-30 speakers of each language, and tested them in their local area, with the help of a translator where necessary.</p>
<p>In a right-branching language, the most important part of a phrase, known as the “head”, comes first, followed by words that give more information about that word. So in the phrase “The tiger who came to tea”, the head ‘tiger’ is at the beginning of the sentence, followed by words that reveal more about him (i.e. that he came to tea).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A left-branching language is the opposite: the extra information comes first, and the head is at the end of the sentence. The same phrase in a left-branching language would be something like “who came to tea, the tiger”. (English is mainly right-branching, but has some left-branching tendencies: we put adjectives <i>before</i> the noun that they modify, as in “the hungry tiger”, rather than “the tiger hungry”).</p>
<p>In right-branching languages, the meaning of a sentence is clear from the start because the head is encountered immediately. But in left-branching languages, speakers need to keep a lot of information in mind before they get to the important part of the sentence that clarifies what it’s all about. So the researchers wondered whether speakers of left-branching languages would be generally better at remembering the early parts of lists of stimuli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants completed three tests designed to tap into working memory, which involves holding information in mind while also processing other information – a key skill in language. For each test, they viewed a sequence of pictures (or some other visual sequence) while simultaneously completing a second distracting task like performing mental arithmetic or judging whether an image was symmetrical. At the end of each series they had to recall the sequence they’d seen in the correct order. These sequences varied across tests and included pictures of animals and objects, different numbers of blue circles, and red squares in a series of grids.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The team then compared how well the speakers of the two kinds of language remembered stimuli from the first and second halves of the sequences. As they predicted, left-branching speakers were better at recalling the first half of lists than right-branching speakers, and worse at recalling the second half.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results show how the languages we speak can have fairly broad influences on cognition, say the authors. “Specific characteristics of a language appear to predict not only the way we perceive and conceptualize the world,” they write, “but also the way we process, store and retrieve information.”</p>
<p>The research also demonstrates how differences in culture and language can bias findings in psychology. For example, based almost entirely on Western participants, memory researchers have found that people tend to recall the first and last parts of lists better than the middle parts – phenomena referred to as the “primacy” and “recency” effects –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>which have long been considered a fundamental aspect of how memory works. It is clear from this new study that the language participants speak could have a significant impact on these kinds of results, potentially challenging whether human memory always works that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But for now, the study remains preliminary. The overall differences in memory between left- and right-branching languages appear fairly small, and the eight languages the authors studied are just a tiny fraction of the more than 7,000 spoken around the world. Whether the results will be replicated in a larger sample remains to be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>Say you’re planning to run a marathon, and you have a target time in mind. Or you’re on a weight- loss diet, and your aim is to lose six kilos in six weeks. Or, there’s an exam coming up, and you want to score above 75 per cent. These are all individual goal pursuits. In theory, you’re not in direct competition with anybody else, though of course if you’re part of a running club, or a weight loss group, or an undergraduate class, you will be aware that others around you are striving to achieve their own goals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s plenty of evidence that sharing your own goals and hearing about other people’s can be helpful – in providing mutual encouragement, emotional support and motivation. However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspi0000170">paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> shows how, in certain circumstances, we can’t help ourselves from competing with others – an effect that can be surprisingly counterproductive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The findings suggest that when we’re paired with an individual striving for a similar goal and who is similarly able, we begin to view this other person as an opponent – leading us to sabotage their efforts, ultimately to the detriment of our own performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Pursuing individual goals together with others can at times lead to counter-productive behaviours that not only harm others but also harm oneself,” report Szu-chi Huang at Stanford University, and her colleagues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-36545"></span></p>
<p>The researchers ran six experiments. In the first, 200 participants performed rounds of a “word creativity” task, in which they had to make make as many words as possible from a string of letters. They were told they were paired with a “partner” (in fact, a fictional person) who had done slightly better on each round. The participants were given their own personal goal: if they created enough words, they’d be rewarded with a gift card. Another detail is that participants were also able to make the tasks harder or easier for their partner – an opportunity they exploited. Even though their partner’s performance was technically irrelevant to their own goal pursuit, as participants got close to achieving their goal, they tended to choose to make the task harder for their partner – “sabotaging” their partner’s chances. What’s more, after doing this, the participants eased up on their own efforts – they “coasted”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Subsequent experiments, some involving other tasks (such as a card game), revealed that the pattern of getting close to a personal goal, sabotaging one’s partner, then coasting, happened whether the participants were led to believe they were slightly ahead of or slightly behind their partner. However, a further study revealed that only participants who believed their sabotaging efforts were successful eased up on their own efforts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers write: “This study thus provided further support that the main purpose of sabotage was to ‘take the opponent down’ a notch; when this positional gain was plausibly realised, people relaxed their effort, even though their sabotaging act did nothing to advance their own individual goal.”</p>
<p>Huang and her colleagues said their findings suggest that when we perform alongside other people who share similar goals to us, we can’t help ourselves from becoming competitive, which shifts our focus from bettering ourselves to defeating our “opponent”, and then relaxing our own efforts. “This is unexpectedly counterproductive to the attainment of people’s own individual goals,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The work contributes to a growing field of research on the social side of goal pursuit. It seems that although we can help each other in the early stages of own parallel journeys, these relationships can become harmful when our goal comes into sight. Being aware of this may help you to understand when to stop paying attention to other people’s progress, and to focus on keeping your own efforts up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

The Journal of Health Psychology has just published an extraordinary pair of papers that call for a new inquiry into a 30-year old case of probable scientific fraud.

According to Anthony J. Pelosi, author of the main paper, the case was "one of the worst scientific scandals of all time" and yet has never been formally investigated. The journal's editor, David F. Marks, agrees and, in an editorial, also calls for the retraction or correction of up to 61 papers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the number of referrals to the UK’s only gender identity development service (GIDS, at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust) increasing sharply in recent years – a pattern seemingly mirrored in other European countries and the US (anecdotally, at least — many countries don’t keep comprehensive data the way the UK does) – debate has inevitably intensified over how best to help transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) youth. As some expert clinicians </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/images/sgd-sgd0000167_tcm7-211986.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there has been a tendency for commentators, campaigners and the general public to adopt an oversimplified view in which therapists are seen as fitting one of two categories: those who don’t believe their clients when they say they are trans (and who are therefore condemned by trans advocacy groups for practicing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversion therapy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and others who simply accept their clients’ statements about their gender, and who are therefore </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">affirming</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">affirmative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clinical reality is more complicated: these days, there is a welcome consensus against actual <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/psychologists-back-call-end-conversion-therapy">conversion therapy</a> — forcing a young person to “go back” to being cisgender — but at the same time responsible clinicians do not simply nod along to what a young person with gender dysphoria says. There are complexities inherent to childhood and adolescent development, and many experts warn it’s important not to accidentally medicalise perfectly normal qualms about growing up, hitting puberty, and being exposed to powerful and often frustratingly restrictive gender roles. Young people present at gender clinics with a wide variety of issues ranging from </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/17/most-children-and-teens-with-gender-dysphoria-also-have-multiple-other-psychological-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comorbid mental-health issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to unexamined trauma, and the process of helping them determine the best path forward, particularly with regard to medical interventions like </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/23/systematic-review-puberty-suppressing-drugs-do-not-alleviate-gender-dysphoria/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a lot more complicated than making a rapid decision to deny or approve such interventions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, in </span><a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/103/7/631.full?ijkey=HsMwyZDRtsKu83z&amp;keytype=ref"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an open-access practice review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMJ</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, clinicians at UCL, GIDS and Great Ormond Street Hospital explained that the thorough psychosexual assessment period for such clients “usually takes 6 months or more over a minimum of four to six sessions” and involves a range of psychometric measures and interviews, covering the client’s expectations and understanding of social and physical transition, their mood and emotional functioning. The review adds that, “With the adolescents, there is an in-depth consideration of their sexuality and fertility, and possible preservation approaches are discussed. The attitude of important people in the child’s life towards gender dysphoria needs to be explored and understood.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290">a study published in </a></span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2019.1568290"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology &amp; Sexuality </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by a pair of Norwegian researchers, Reidar Schel Jessen and Katrina Roen, has explored these complexities from clinical psychologists’ perspective, including what it means to help a young person work through the issues they are facing and to make important decisions about medical treatment.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-36483"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the study, “Five clinical psychologists working with gender non-conforming youth in an interdisciplinary team at a specialized gender identity clinic in Europe participated in interviews.” In reading their work, I was struck repeatedly by how similar their experiences were to what I heard when I spoke with American clinicians for </span><a href="https://theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an in-depth article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about transgender youth for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, Jessen and Roen write that “Sometimes the clients themselves want to transition, but sometimes the possibility seems driven by the family or others in the young person’s life, such as school staff.” The pair include a poignant example of this:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One young person I worked with […] was referred by school. Biological male, who presented in very… like stereotypically… call it female clothes, like pink and yellow, long hair. Often was read as female, and the school didn’t know what to do with the young person. But when I met the young person, the young person didn’t have any issues with the body or […] developing in a masculine way. So all, so I was kind of again looking at where the stress lies, and it was really in the separation or gender division at school […] and they would ask him to cut his hair short, because he is a boy […] and I think in my report I wrote that… you know, I would really advise you not to address… the pupils as girls and boys, but just call them pupils, students. (Participant C) </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t come across any examples quite so dramatic in my own reporting, but this was a common general storyline: I noted that “Several of the clinicians I spoke with, including Nate Sharon, Laura Edwards-Leeper, and Scott Leibowitz, recounted new patients’ arriving at their clinics, their parents having already developed detailed plans for them to transition. ‘I’ve actually had patients with parents pressuring me to recommend their kids start hormones,’ Sharon said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are gender nonconforming often make adults uncomfortable, and in some cases one way adults attempt to dispel this discomfort is to push for transition. “The [clinical psychologist] participants have the impression that sometimes the school or family expect these young boys to transition to girls,” write Jessen and Roen, “because they do not want them to be feminine boys. This illustrates how difficult it can sometimes be to understand which expectations belong to whom, and how gender non-conforming youth can be referred to the clinic by adults who hold the opinion that gender non-conformity is a problem to be addressed clinically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, as I wrote in my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantic </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">article, clinicians told me about instances in which “the child might be capably navigating a liminal period of gender exploration; it’s the parents who are having trouble not knowing whether their kid is a boy or a girl.” Sure enough, this theme of pressure to choose a gender ‘side,’ too, popped up among the Norwegian clinicians:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants were concerned about the possibility that binary gender norms force gender non-conforming youth to become “the opposite gender,” instead of allowing them space to explore their unique gender expression. According to the clinical psychologists interviewed, many clients and families believe that gender is binary, and that there are only two gender identities. This belief does seem to influence clients’ expectations of outcomes, and may encourage them to seek physical treatment at the expense of exploratory work. According to the participants, many clients and their families experience societal and community pressure to conform to gender norms.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploration and nuance and liminality are key concepts that come up over and over again in interviews with experienced youth TGNC clinicians. But it can be challenging to tell a child who is in distress, or his or her parents, that it’s worth taking a bit more time to explore before proceeding to physical interventions or making other major decisions about transition — perhaps doubly so given the belief in some quarters that “exploration” or “therapy” are near-synonyms for “transphobia” and “conversion therapy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As “Participant B” told the researchers, “Not surprisingly, exploratory strategies can be aggravating to clients and families. We are always very subject to this discourse of the bigot […] this idea of you know transphobia […] so people that are bigoted are very narrow-minded […] this is where then you know the power that we then have starts to really create lots of tension and problems.” That is, at the end of the day, clinicians stand between young people (and their parents) and medical treatments they feel they need, so it’s an understandable reaction for delays caused by responsible, thorough clinical work to be misread as transphobia. This tension was partly what motivated last year’s practice review in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMJ</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Faced with very distressed young people, they [clinicians] may feel under pressure to initiate physical intervention without consultation with psychosocial colleagues,” the review states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If gender clinics in three very different countries with three very different healthcare systems are experiencing the same sorts of scenarios over and over, that’s a signal that everyone should try to better understand what’s going on. Many of the young people mentioned in this study likely will, in the long run, benefit from puberty blockers and hormones. But some won’t — their gender exploration will lead them elsewhere, whether or not they come to identify with their biological sex. It’s important to understand what separates these two groups, and scientists have only barely begun to do so.</span></p>

<h2>Ageing in harmony: why the third act of life should be musical</h2>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-macritchie-171595">Jennifer MacRitchie</a>, <em><a href="http://theconversation.com/institutions/western-sydney-university-1092">Western Sydney University</a></em></p>
<p>It’s never too late to pick up a musical instrument. In fact, there are many reasons why it’s a great idea, particularly in old age.</p>
<p>We normally hear about reasons to increase music education for children, and for good cause. There are <a href="http://ijm.sagepub.com/content/28/3/269">many cognitive and social benefits</a> to playing an instrument that aid a child’s development. Consequently, as an older adult, there are long-term effects of having taken part in these musical activities, as it can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21463047">limit cognitive decline</a>.</p>
<p>Even a <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17667.full">small amount of training</a> can have long-lasting effects. But this doesn’t mean that those who have never played an instrument in childhood have missed the boat. The ageing brain is <em>plastic</em>: that means it is able to learn new things all the time. So, should we consider an increase in music programs for those in the third age?</p>
<h2>Playing music as a workout for the brain</h2>
<p>Learning to play a musical instrument is an extremely complex task that involves the coordination of multiple sensory systems within the brain. Many instruments require precise coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands in order to play a musical note. Using the resulting sound as feedback, the brain prepares for the next note and so it continues. The act of music-making is quite a brain workout.</p>
<p>The relationship between the motor and auditory parts of the brain is strengthened when physically playing music. This may explain why adults trained to <em>play</em> certain melodies have an <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/39/9632.long">enhanced representation of music</a> in the brain compared to adults only trained to <em>listen</em> to the same melodies.</p>
<p>As playing music involves many different parts of the brain, even a short-term program for older adult musical novices can lead to generalised improvements for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00810/full">cognitive ability</a>.</p>
<h2>Music as a workout for the fingers</h2>
<p>Learning to play an instrument such as the piano involves many complex finger sequencing and coordination tasks. As such, it can be a great test-bed for learning to move fingers independently.</p>
<p>The creativity of music and the enjoyment people take in playing is particularly important for rehabilitation, as it encourages sustained practice leading ultimately to higher benefits.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img alt="" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/124735/original/image-20160601-1964-11dnlm4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" /></a><span class="attribution"><span class="source">Shutterstock</span></span></figure>
<p>It’s thanks to this that piano lessons have been used to successfully retrain hand function for <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00662/full">patients who have had a stroke</a>. The immediate auditory feedback from each finger movement is thought to help adults <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25721795">reduce errors in movement</a> and work towards moving at a more regular pace.</p>
<p>Music training is an excellent environment to train cognitive and motor abilities, both in the contexts of child development and for rehabilitation. The question for older adults is this: can learning a musical instrument not only put the brakes on cognitive and motor decline but actually allow development of new skills?</p>
<p>Older adults can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1995805/">improve their motor learning</a> – that is, they can improve their rate of learning new things – and the best environments for brain training are ones that are <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00183/full">novel and flexible</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, many activities can be novel such as juggling or knitting, but the advantages of learning an instrument can be found in the breadth of skills required to play. At Western Sydney University, we are currently investigating how piano training can be used with healthy older adults to improve their general hand function in unrelated daily tasks.</p>
<h2>Music for health and wellbeing</h2>
<p>Often, the worry is that playing an instrument will be too difficult for older adults to manage. On the contrary, learning to play an instrument can provide a great sense of <a class="broken_link" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41162324">achievement</a> and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Older adults relish the opportunity to <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2014.999361">learn something new</a>.<br />
Cognitive benefits aside, music can also be a great <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02601370.2014.991951">social activity for older adults</a>, facilitating social bonding and decreasing feelings of loneliness or isolation.</p>
<p>Music programs are linked to improvements measured in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113005138">markers of the body’s immune system</a> such as the presence of antibodies and vital signs (heart rate/blood pressure).</p>
<p>It’s suggested that this is a consequence of decreases in stress that can happen when taking part in musical activities. However, further research is needed to determine exactly how this relationship functions.</p>
<h2>Music for all</h2>
<p>It’s vital to understand how we can aid the current generation of older adults, in terms of both health and personal enjoyment. With the myriad benefits provided by playing a musical instrument, it would seem beneficial to have a wider variety of musical activities on offer to the older generation.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if the third age wasn’t viewed as a final descent from some mid-life peak, but some new act of life that opens up these opportunities? Perhaps we should give older adults the chance to develop in ways they could never have imagined before.</p>
<p>Activities such as singing in a choir, or playing the piano can provide this opportunity, as well as offering many general benefits to health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So whether it’s in independent living, retirement or assisted care, let’s make the third act of life a musical one!<img alt="The Conversation" height="1" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/57799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" style="border: none !important; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important;" width="1" /></p>
