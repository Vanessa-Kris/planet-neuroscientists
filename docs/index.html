Neuroscientists have launched an assault on the American Psychiatric Association headquarters and are engaged in bitter, boardroom-to-boardroom fighting. Psychiatrists have captured the leader of a militant pro-brain faction. A ceasefire, brokered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, is due to come into effect at midnight.

Yes, indeed. A blog post by Daniel Barron in Scientific American yesterday claimed that there is a War between Neuroscience and Psychiatry

<p>Humans are infovores, hungry to discover, and nothing holds more fascination than the future. Once we looked for answers through divination, now science can forecast significant events such as the onset of certain hereditary disease. But the fact that some people choose <i>not </i>to know – even when information is accessible, and has a bearing on their lives – has encouraged scientists, including Gerd Gigerenzer and Rocio Garcia-Retamero, to try to map out the limits of our appetite for knowledge. Their <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/124/2/179/">recent study</a> in <i>Psychological Review</i> suggests that it is a fear of what we might discover – and wishing that we’d never known – that often drives us to deliberate ignorance.</p>
<p><span id="more-23103"></span></p>
<p>Gigerenzer, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and Garcia-Retamero at the University of Granada, asked nationally representative samples of participants in Germany and Spain whether they would be willing to know the date or cause of their own or their partner’s death; whether their marriage would end in divorce; as well as information relating to positive future events like knowing the gender of their unborn child, or what was in store for them under the Christmas wrapping paper.</p>
<p>Whereas previous research with people at heightened risk of specific diseases found rates of deliberate ignorance of between 10 and 30 per cent, the rates here were far higher. Close to 90 per cent of participants said they’d prefer not to know about future negative events (this tended to generalise: a person who didn’t want to know about one negative outcome usually said they didn’t want to know about any others). Rates of deliberate ignorance were also high for positive events, but more variable – only a third of participants said they did not want to know their child’s gender, for instance, compared with three quarters preferring not to know the outcome of a football match they were watching. So wilful ignorance is commonplace, but what’s driving it?</p>
<p>Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero’s suspicion is that it’s about anticipated regret: people’s fear that they may regret hearing what’s going to happen; after all, you can’t “unknow” an unwelcome fact. People susceptible to fearing regret also tend to be risk-averse: taking risks often involves seeing the repercussions of your decision, whereas ducking a gamble simply leaves you in the dark – you’ll never know what might have been.</p>
<p>To test whether anticipated regret was driving deliberate ignorance, Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero asked their participants to complete classic measures of risk aversion, like choosing between the option of different sized cash sums now versus a 50 per cent chance to win 100 Euros, with preference for guaranteed lower sums corresponding to more risk aversion. Supporting their explanation, the researchers found that the participants who’d been keener to stay in deliberate ignorance were also more risk averse. This was true for positive events too, where the regret is related to the possibility of spoiling enjoyable suspense – such as asking to know the football results because the game seems lifeless but then discovering that it turned into a 3-2 nailbiter.</p>
<p>Also consistent with the anticipated regret hypothesis was the finding that participants were more in favour of ignorance when events were imminent. So 13 per cent of under-35s said they would want to know about the date their partner would die, for example, but only 8 per cent of over-50s (similarly 54 per cent of the younger group said they’d want to know about life after death compared with 46 per cent of the older group).</p>
<p>This seems surprising, because information about an imminent outcome is usually considered more relevant, and we tend to think of the young as uninterested in the future and living for today. But if it is regret that’s driving things, it makes more sense: a youngster discovering that they will die in their 60s, not the more typical 70s, is unlikely to be devastated by the bad news, but for a 60-year-old, this is too ugly a fact to risk knowing. The researchers also found that participants who bought more insurance policies – a real-world measure of risk avoidance – were also slightly more likely to choose deliberate ignorance for the future events.</p>
<p>From a purely rational perspective, it seems surprising that so many people shy away from potentially useful information. Knowing the timing of your future demise could shape how you save for old age, for example, while learning whether an infinite existence lies beyond death would likely shape how you approach this life. But it seems many of us prefer ignorance, driven by the fear that we might regret discovering something better left unknown.</p>

<img alt="10_1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/10_1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>A <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-017-0900-8">recent study</a> published in BMC Evolutionary Biology demonstrated that a transplanted soft coral from the Caribbean Sea (Antillogorgia bipinnata) changed its shape consistently as the corals living in the new environment. This type of manipulation known as “common garden experiments” allowed the authors to determine the adaptive value of that change that means life or death for a species across a depth gradient.</p>
<img alt="2" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8891" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/2-225x300.jpg" width="225" />
<p>This individual capacity is called phenotypic plasticity when the same genotype can exhibit several phenotypes due to environmental influences, and it is the equivalent of a person getting a tan after some holidays on a sunny beach.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different types of skin and some people can hardly get any tan whereas others can be unrecognizable. The coral studied by Iván Calixto-Botía and Juan Sánchez from the University of the Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, is the kind that changes dramatically its tree-like shape to an extent that the extremes have even been considered as different species.</p>
<p>That observation was also published in BMC Evolutionary Biology by Sánchez and collaborators ten years ago. <em>Antillogorgia bipinnata</em> changed the size of its branches up to ten times from shallow-water down to 40 m at the Belize barrier reef but no genetic differentiation was found.</p>
<img alt="9" class="wp-image-8892 alignright" height="277" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/9-300x224.png" width="371" />
<p>The authors since then were wondering what was the limit of such plasticity, the adaptive canvas and if that such shape transformation can lead to an isolated population at the extremes.</p>
<p>Marine scientists studying biodiversity in the tropics are always amazed by the great number of species living in the same environments. It is difficult to image a process leading to species diversification without geographic barriers.</p>
<p>Scientists like Calixto and Sánchez are betting on plasticity as the first step to speciation without geographic barriers only with some type of selective effects at the extremes. They are now tracking the footsteps of selection in the genome of the species and the effects of depth on the coral reproductive synchronization.</p>

<p>The early detection of relapse following primary surgery for non-small cell lung cancer and the characterization of emerging subclones seeding metastatic sites might offer new therapeutic approaches to limit tumor recurrence. The potential to non-invasively track tumor evolutionary dynamics in ctDNA of early-stage lung cancer is not established. Here we conduct a tumour-specific phylogenetic approach to ctDNA profiling in the first 100 TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study participants, including one patient co-recruited to the PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) post-mortem study. We identify independent predictors of ctDNA release and perform tumor volume limit of detection analyses. Through blinded profiling of post-operative plasma, we observe evidence of adjuvant chemotherapy resistance and identify patients destined to experience recurrence of their lung cancer. Finally, we show that phylogenetic ctDNA profiling tracks the subclonal nature of lung cancer relapse and metastases, providing a new approach for ctDNA driven therapeutic studies</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22364">doi: 10.1038/nature22364</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/M1n6f8lWJKo" width="1" />

<p>
 Netrin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved, secreted extracellular matrix protein involved in axon guidance at the central nervous system midline. Netrin-1 is expressed by cells localized at the central nervous system midline, such as those of the floor plate in vertebrate embryos. Growth cone turning assays and three-dimensional gel diffusion assays have shown that netrin-1 can attract commissural axons. Loss-of-function experiments further demonstrated that commissural axon extension to the midline is severely impaired in the absence of netrin-1 (refs 3, 7, 8, 9). Together, these data have long supported a model in which commissural axons are attracted by a netrin-1 gradient diffusing from the midline. Here we selectively ablate netrin-1 expression in floor-plate cells using a Ntn1 conditional knockout mouse line. We find that hindbrain and spinal cord commissural axons develop normally in the absence of floor-plate-derived netrin-1. Furthermore, we show that netrin-1 is highly expressed by cells in the ventricular zone, which can release netrin-1 at the pial surface where it binds to commissural axons. Notably, Ntn1 deletion from the ventricular zone phenocopies commissural axon guidance defects previously described in Ntn1-knockout mice. These results show that the classical view that attraction of commissural axons is mediated by a gradient of floor-plate-derived netrin-1 is inaccurate and that netrin-1 primarily acts locally by promoting growth cone adhesion.

<p>
 The development of the nervous system involves a coordinated succession of events including the migration of GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) neurons from ventral to dorsal forebrain and their integration into cortical circuits. However, these interregional interactions have not yet been modelled with human cells. Here we generate three-dimensional spheroids from human pluripotent stem cells that resemble either the dorsal or ventral forebrain and contain cortical glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids can be assembled in vitro to recapitulate the saltatory migration of interneurons observed in the fetal forebrain. Using this system, we find that in Timothy syndrome—a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the CaV1.2 calcium channel—interneurons display abnormal migratory saltations. We also show that after migration, interneurons functionally integrate with glutamatergic neurons to form a microphysiological system. We anticipate that this approach will be useful for studying neural development and disease, and for deriving spheroids that resemble other brain regions to assemble circuits in vitro.

<p>
 Human pluripotent stem cells (hPS cells) can self-renew indefinitely, making them an attractive source for regenerative therapies. This expansion potential has been linked with the acquisition of large copy number variants that provide mutated cells with a growth advantage in culture. The nature, extent and functional effects of other acquired genome sequence mutations in cultured hPS cells are not known. Here we sequence the protein-coding genes (exomes) of 140 independent human embryonic stem cell (hES cell) lines, including 26 lines prepared for potential clinical use. We then apply computational strategies for identifying mutations present in a subset of cells in each hES cell line. Although such mosaic mutations were generally rare, we identified five unrelated hES cell lines that carried six mutations in the TP53 gene that encodes the tumour suppressor P53. The TP53 mutations we observed are dominant negative and are the mutations most commonly seen in human cancers. We found that the TP53 mutant allelic fraction increased with passage number under standard culture conditions, suggesting that the P53 mutations confer selective advantage. We then mined published RNA sequencing data from 117 hPS cell lines, and observed another nine TP53 mutations, all resulting in coding changes in the DNA-binding domain of P53. In three lines, the allelic fraction exceeded 50%, suggesting additional selective advantage resulting from the loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus. As the acquisition and expansion of cancer-associated mutations in hPS cells may go unnoticed during most applications, we suggest that careful genetic characterization of hPS cells and their differentiated derivatives be carried out before clinical use.

<p>The relative contribution of the effector molecules produced by T cells to tumour rejection is unclear, but interferon-γ (IFNγ) is critical in most of the analysed models. Although IFNγ can impede tumour growth by acting directly on cancer cells, it must also act on the tumour stroma for effective rejection of large, established tumours. However, which stroma cells respond to IFNγ and by which mechanism IFNγ contributes to tumour rejection through stromal targeting have remained unknown. Here we use a model of IFNγ induction and an IFNγ–GFP fusion protein in large, vascularized tumours growing in mice that express the IFNγ receptor exclusively in defined cell types. Responsiveness to IFNγ by myeloid cells and other haematopoietic cells, including T cells or fibroblasts, was not sufficient for IFNγ-induced tumour regression, whereas responsiveness of endothelial cells to IFNγ was necessary and sufficient. Intravital microscopy revealed IFNγ-induced regression of the tumour vasculature, resulting in arrest of blood flow and subsequent collapse of tumours, similar to non-haemorrhagic necrosis in ischaemia and unlike haemorrhagic necrosis induced by tumour necrosis factor. The early events of IFNγ-induced tumour ischaemia resemble non-apoptotic blood vessel regression during development, wound healing or IFNγ-mediated, pregnancy-induced remodelling of uterine arteries. A better mechanistic understanding of how solid tumours are rejected may aid the design of more effective protocols for adoptive T-cell therapy.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22311">doi: 10.1038/nature22311</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/iZmWQlccuZw" width="1" />

<p>
 Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are irreversibly activated by proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus, which unmasks a tethered peptide ligand that binds and activates the transmembrane receptor domain, eliciting a cellular cascade in response to inflammatory signals and other stimuli. PARs are implicated in a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and inflammation. PARs have been the subject of major pharmaceutical research efforts but the discovery of small-molecule antagonists that effectively bind them has proved challenging. The only marketed drug targeting a PAR is vorapaxar, a selective antagonist of PAR1 used to prevent thrombosis. The structure of PAR1 in complex with vorapaxar has been reported previously. Despite sequence homology across the PAR isoforms, discovery of PAR2 antagonists has been less successful, although GB88 has been described as a weak antagonist. Here we report crystal structures of PAR2 in complex with two distinct antagonists and a blocking antibody. The antagonist AZ8838 binds in a fully occluded pocket near the extracellular surface. Functional and binding studies reveal that AZ8838 exhibits slow binding kinetics, which is an attractive feature for a PAR2 antagonist competing against a tethered ligand. Antagonist AZ3451 binds to a remote allosteric site outside the helical bundle. We propose that antagonist binding prevents structural rearrangements required for receptor activation and signalling. We also show that a blocking antibody antigen-binding fragment binds to the extracellular surface of PAR2, preventing access of the tethered ligand to the peptide-binding site. These structures provide a basis for the development of selective PAR2 antagonists for a range of therapeutic uses.

<p>
 Mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) has a central role in both metabolic regulation and cell death signalling, however its role in homeostatic function and disease is controversial. Slc8b1 encodes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), which is proposed to be the primary mechanism for mCa2+ extrusion in excitable cells. Here we show that tamoxifen-induced deletion of Slc8b1 in adult mouse hearts causes sudden death, with less than 13% of affected mice surviving after 14 days. Lethality correlated with severe myocardial dysfunction and fulminant heart failure. Mechanistically, cardiac pathology was attributed to mCa2+ overload driving increased generation of superoxide and necrotic cell death, which was rescued by genetic inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore activation. Corroborating these findings, overexpression of NCLX in the mouse heart by conditional transgenesis had the beneficial effect of augmenting mCa2+ clearance, preventing permeability transition and protecting against ischaemia-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis and heart failure. These results demonstrate the essential nature of mCa2+ efflux in cellular function and suggest that augmenting mCa2+ efflux may be a viable therapeutic strategy in disease.

<p>
 Retracing the evolutionary history of arthropods has been one of the greatest challenges in biology. During the past decade, phylogenetic analyses of morphological and molecular data have coalesced towards the conclusion that Mandibulata, the most diverse and abundant group of animals, is a distinct clade from Chelicerata, in that its members possess post-oral head appendages specialized for food processing, notably the mandible. The origin of the mandibulate body plan, however, which encompasses myriapods, crustaceans and hexapods, has remained poorly documented. Here we show that Tokummia katalepsis gen. et sp. nov., a large bivalved arthropod from the 508 million-year-old Marble Canyon fossil deposit (Burgess Shale, British Columbia), has unequivocal mandibulate synapomorphies, including mandibles and maxillipeds, as well as characters typically found in crustaceans, such as enditic, subdivided basipods and ring-shaped trunk segments. Tokummia and its closest relative, Branchiocaris (in Protocarididae, emended), also have an anteriormost structure housing a probable bilobed organ, which could support the appendicular origin of the labrum. Protocaridids are retrieved with Canadaspis and Odaraia (in Hymenocarina, emended) as part of an expanded mandibulate clade, refuting the idea that these problematic bivalved taxa, as well as other related forms, are representatives of the basalmost euarthropods. Hymenocarines now illustrate that the subdivision of the basipod and the presence of proximal endites are likely to have been ancestral conditions critical for the evolution of coxal and pre-coxal features in mandibulates. The presence of crustaceomorph traits in the Cambrian larvae of various clades basal to Mandibulata is reinterpreted as evidence for the existence of distinct ontogenetic niches among stem arthropods. Larvae would therefore have constituted an important source of morphological novelty during the Cambrian period, and, through heterochronic processes, may have contributed to the rapid acquisition of crown-group characters and thus to greater evolutionary rates during the early radiation of euarthropods.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/DMNakGlSz4Q/nature22078">Polyglutamine tracts regulate beclin 1-dependent autophagy</a></h4>

<p>Nine neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in different proteins, such as huntingtin in Huntington’s disease and ataxin 3 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Age at onset of disease decreases with increasing polyglutamine length in these proteins and the normal length also varies. PolyQ expansions drive pathogenesis in these diseases, as isolated polyQ tracts are toxic, and an N-terminal huntingtin fragment comprising exon 1, which occurs in vivo as a result of alternative splicing, causes toxicity. Although such mutant proteins are prone to aggregation, toxicity is also associated with soluble forms of the proteins. The function of the polyQ tracts in many normal cytoplasmic proteins is unclear. One such protein is the deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin 3 (refs 7, 8), which is widely expressed in the brain. Here we show that the polyQ domain enables wild-type ataxin 3 to interact with beclin 1, a key initiator of autophagy. This interaction allows the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin 3 to protect beclin 1 from proteasome-mediated degradation and thereby enables autophagy. Starvation-induced autophagy, which is regulated by beclin 1, was particularly inhibited in ataxin-3-depleted human cell lines and mouse primary neurons, and in vivo in mice. This activity of ataxin 3 and its polyQ-mediated interaction with beclin 1 was competed for by other soluble proteins with polyQ tracts in a length-dependent fashion. This competition resulted in impairment of starvation-induced autophagy in cells expressing mutant huntingtin exon 1, and this impairment was recapitulated in the brains of a mouse model of Huntington’s disease and in cells from patients. A similar phenomenon was also seen with other polyQ disease proteins, including mutant ataxin 3 itself. Our data thus describe a specific function for a wild-type polyQ tract that is abrogated by a competing longer polyQ mutation in a disease protein, and identify a deleterious function of such mutations distinct from their propensity to aggregate.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22078">doi: 10.1038/nature22078</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/DMNakGlSz4Q" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/GoOgNl8AxPU/nature22065">A 130,000-year-old archaeological site in southern California, USA</a></h4>

<p>
 The earliest dispersal of humans into North America is a contentious subject, and proposed early sites are required to meet the following criteria for acceptance: (1) archaeological evidence is found in a clearly defined and undisturbed geologic context; (2) age is determined by reliable radiometric dating; (3) multiple lines of evidence from interdisciplinary studies provide consistent results; and (4) unquestionable artefacts are found in primary context. Here we describe the Cerutti Mastodon (CM) site, an archaeological site from the early late Pleistocene epoch, where in situ hammerstones and stone anvils occur in spatio-temporal association with fragmentary remains of a single mastodon (Mammut americanum). The CM site contains spiral-fractured bone and molar fragments, indicating that breakage occured while fresh. Several of these fragments also preserve evidence of percussion. The occurrence and distribution of bone, molar and stone refits suggest that breakage occurred at the site of burial. Five large cobbles (hammerstones and anvils) in the CM bone bed display use-wear and impact marks, and are hydraulically anomalous relative to the low-energy context of the enclosing sandy silt stratum. 230Th/U radiometric analysis of multiple bone specimens using diffusion–adsorption–decay dating models indicates a burial date of 130.7 ± 9.4 thousand years ago. These findings confirm the presence of an unidentified species of Homo at the CM site during the last interglacial period (MIS 5e; early late Pleistocene), indicating that humans with manual dexterity and the experiential knowledge to use hammerstones and anvils processed mastodon limb bones for marrow extraction and/or raw material for tool production. Systematic proboscidean bone reduction, evident at the CM site, fits within a broader pattern of Palaeolithic bone percussion technology in Africa, Eurasia and North America. The CM site is, to our knowledge, the oldest in situ, well-documented archaeological site in North America and, as such, substantially revises the timing of arrival of Homo into the Americas.

<p>
 In vitro models of the developing brain such as three-dimensional brain organoids offer an unprecedented opportunity to study aspects of human brain development and disease. However, the cells generated within organoids and the extent to which they recapitulate the regional complexity, cellular diversity and circuit functionality of the brain remain undefined. Here we analyse gene expression in over 80,000 individual cells isolated from 31 human brain organoids. We find that organoids can generate a broad diversity of cells, which are related to endogenous classes, including cells from the cerebral cortex and the retina. Organoids could be developed over extended periods (more than 9 months), allowing for the establishment of relatively mature features, including the formation of dendritic spines and spontaneously active neuronal networks. Finally, neuronal activity within organoids could be controlled using light stimulation of photosensitive cells, which may offer a way to probe the functionality of human neuronal circuits using physiological sensory stimuli.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/f1sWz2NkXuc/nature22043">A chromosome conformation capture ordered sequence of the barley genome</a></h4>

<p>
 Cereal grasses of the Triticeae tribe have been the major food source in temperate regions since the dawn of agriculture. Their large genomes are characterized by a high content of repetitive elements and large pericentromeric regions that are virtually devoid of meiotic recombination. Here we present a high-quality reference genome assembly for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We use chromosome conformation capture mapping to derive the linear order of sequences across the pericentromeric space and to investigate the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus at megabase resolution. The composition of genes and repetitive elements differs between distal and proximal regions. Gene family analyses reveal lineage-specific duplications of genes involved in the transport of nutrients to developing seeds and the mobilization of carbohydrates in grains. We demonstrate the importance of the barley reference sequence for breeding by inspecting the genomic partitioning of sequence variation in modern elite germplasm, highlighting regions vulnerable to genetic erosion.

<p>Officially at least, last week’s global <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com">March for Science</a> was politically neutral. However, there’s a massive over-representation of people with liberal, left-leaning views in science, and much of the science community is unhappy, to put it mildly, with the way politics is going, such as the Trump administration’s proposed deep cuts to science funding, and here in the UK, the impact of Brexit on British science.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of these anxieties, many of the banners on display – such as “Alternative hypotheses, not alternative facts” and “Science reveals the truth” – conveyed a barely concealed message: if only right-wing conservatives could be a little more objective, less biased, more open-minded – you might say a little more “scientific” – then the world would be a better place.</p>
<p>Plenty of past psychology research lends some credence to this perspective: for instance conservatives tend to score lower on the trait of open-mindedness than liberals, and of course conservatives, more often than liberals, are sceptical toward the scientific consensus that human activity has had a significant impact on climate change. But it’s also easy to find psychological evidence of liberals’ bias, and liberals too are often in denial of unwelcome scientific theory, such as evolutionary accounts of sex differences in behaviour.</p>
<p>Now two new articles, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2952510">published at the Social Science Research Network</a> (SSRN) and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116304024">in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em></a>, respectively, provide further compelling evidence that liberals, as much as conservatives, are prone to partisan bias – that is, showing rapid, easy acceptance of evidence that supports their existing beliefs – and that they are just as motivated to avoid hearing viewpoints that differ from their own. Whether we’re liberal or conservative, a first step toward combating our political prejudices, the paper in SSRN concludes, is “to recognize our collective vulnerability to perceiving the world in ways that validate our political beliefs”.</p>
<p><span id="more-22950"></span></p>
<p>That paper in SSRN is a meta-analysis that combined the results of 41 previous experimental studies into partisan bias, collectively involving over 12,000 participants self-categorized as either liberal or conservative.</p>
<p>Each of the included studies followed a similar format: participants rated the credibility of evidence, such as a survey, experiment or op-ed, which either supported or contradicted their existing beliefs, such as on gun ownership or affirmative action. By holding the quality of the evidence and methods the same, but altering whether it supposedly came up with data supporting or contradicting participants’ viewpoints, this kind of research is able to reveal partisan bias – that is, whether participants’ are less sceptical and discerning when confronted with evidence that backs their own views.</p>
<p>Looking at the combined data from all these studies, Peter Ditto at University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues, found that liberals were as prone to partisan bias as conservatives. What’s more, partisan bias on all sides was especially on display when participants were presented with scientific data, perhaps undermining the chants of the science march: that it might be easier to reach political consensus if we could all agree to just stick to the facts. As Ditto and his team put it, “the prognosis for eradicating partisan bias with harder data and better education does not seem particularly rosy.”</p>
<p>The other new paper, led by Jeremy Frimer at the University of Winnipeg, used five studies to test American and Canadian participants’ motivation to encounter viewpoints different from their own. For instance, the first study offered participants more money to read an essay that contradicted their own views on same-sex marriage. The researchers found that equally among liberals and conservatives, a majority of participants preferred to forego cash if that meant avoiding opposing views.</p>
<p>Other studies involving other topics, such as gun control, abortion and climate change, led to similar results: liberals as much as conservatives were disinclined to hear the perspective of the other side. And the reasons they gave were similar: they thought hearing opposing views would make them feel uncomfortable or angry and harm their relationship with the source of the opposing views.</p>
<p>“The result of this desire to avoid ideological incongruous views is that liberals and conservatives live in ideological information bubbles, and what could ultimately be a contest of ideas is being replaced by two, non-interacting monopolies,” Frimer and his colleagues concluded.</p>
<p>This new research has some short-comings and shouldn’t be seen as the last word. It’s obviously North-American centric, and it’s not clear how much the results would apply in other parts of the world. It’s also extremely difficult to separate the moral dimension from psychology research into politics: for instance, how to deal with the potential argument that avoiding exposure to some opinions actually <em>is</em> more justified than avoiding exposure to others?</p>
<p>So of course more careful research is required, into ways that liberals and conservatives are similar and different. But if these new studies help us recognise that we all, no matter our political colours, could work harder to be more open-minded of opposing viewpoints, then this is surely constructive. As Sean Blanda put it in a <em>Medium</em> essay last year “<a href="https://medium.com/@SeanBlanda/the-other-side-is-not-dumb-2670c1294063">The other side is not dumb</a>“; well, probably no more than your side anyway.</p>

These newcomers prey on or compete with native species, they carry new parasites and diseases, and even cause extinctions of long-established residents. But why are some species such successful invaders while the advances of other species in foreign territory remain unrecognized?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we focused on one of the most pervasive examples of invasive species: rats. These rodents are found nearly everywhere on the planet and are known for having detrimental effects on native ecological communities, particularly on islands. As part of his PhD thesis Toky Randriamoria from the University of Antananarivo spent many months in central eastern Madagascar to catch small mammals. Rats were what he mainly found in his traps, in agricultural fields, close to villages, and in natural forests alike. Originally introduced by Seafarers from the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle Ages, black and Norway rats have overrun Madagascar. Today, they occur in virtually all natural and anthropogenic habitats on the island, representing &gt;95% of rodent captures in certain areas.</p>

Randriamoria</div></figure>
<p>Toky collected nearly 600 hair samples of black and Norway rats, which I used to encipher the diet and habitat use of these individuals by stable isotope analysis. Stable isotopes are “one of nature’s ecological recorders” and integrate information on what and where an individual fed during the period of hair growth. We found that rats mixed animal and plant matter and had an extremely broad dietary niche. Indeed, rats covered a dietary niche that was larger than a whole community of around 20 native species! Moreover, rats were opportunistic foragers and changed their diet according to what was available.</p>
<p>But we learnt even more from stable isotope analysis: the signature of some individuals did not match to their habitat. This can only mean that certain individuals move between agricultural fields near villages and natural forests; and with them their parasites and diseases.</p>
<p>Thus overall, our results suggest that due to their flexible and generalist diet and potential movement between natural forest and anthropogenic habitats, rats might affect native forest-dependent Malagasy rodents as competitors, predators, and disease vectors. The combination of these effects helps explain the invasion success of rats and the detrimental effects of this genus on the endemic fauna.</p>

<p>Most of us tend to think we’re better than average: <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167211432763">more competent, honest, talented and compassionate</a>. The latest example of this kind of optimistic self-perception is the “invisibility cloak illusion”. In research <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/112/4/589/">published recently</a> in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>, Erica Boothby and her colleagues show how we have a tendency to believe that we are incredibly socially observant ourselves, while those around us are less so. These assumptions combine to create the illusion that we observe others more than they observe us.</p>
<p><span id="more-22918"></span></p>
<p>As a first step, the researchers asked participants on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website how much they usually observe other people. Participants indicated that they were more observant of others than they expected the average person to be, whilst they believed they were observed less than other people.</p>
<p>Next the researchers asked students about their experience immediately after lunch in a university canteen. Participants rated themselves almost twice as observant of strangers in the canteen, as these other people were of them. When participants had been dining with friends, they said they had noticed more about their friends than their friends had of them. They also indicated that, when accidentally making eye contact with someone, they felt it was because they were already watching that person – not because they themselves were being watched.</p>
<p>While this provides initial support for the invisibility cloak bias, the researchers also wanted to test this experimentally. They set up a waiting room, where two student participants of the same sex believed they were waiting for the experiment to begin. The participants sat opposite each other for seven minutes, giving them the opportunity to watch one another. They were then taken to separate rooms and given the role of either observer or target (unbeknown to them, whichever role they were given, the other participant was allocated the other role) . The observer’s task was to write down everything they had noticed about the target, while the target’s task was to write down everything they believed the other person would have noticed about them. This process was repeated with multiple pairs of participants and there was a consistent mismatch, showing the invisibility cloak illusion in action: the observers tended to produce far more detailed notes about their fellow participant than the targets expected.</p>
<p>This illusion seems at odds with the “spotlight effect”, which you may recall from a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3d2a/1c99395124bf9372e1493f314f6990a78473.pdf">particularly cruel experiment</a> published in 2000: participants were asked to wear a Barry Manilow t-shirt in public, and were convinced more people noticed it than actually had. To understand how the spotlight effect and the invisibility cloak illusion could coexist, the Boothby and her colleagues repeated the waiting room experiment. The only difference was some of the targets wore a t-shirt with a large image of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on it. Targets wearing the t-shirt overestimated how noticeable it was to the observer, replicating the spotlight effect. However, this did not generalise beyond the t-shirt, as they didn’t suspect observers had noticed anything else about them. This shows that the two biases are not incompatible; one can be self-conscious about a particular aspect of themselves, while still believing they go less noticed on the whole.</p>
<p>The mechanisms behind the invisibility cloak illusion seem fairly straightforward. We know we have lots of private thoughts about what we’ve noticed of other people, but we mistakenly overlook that most other people have these kind of private thoughts too. This is compounded by the fact that, when observing others, most of us are careful to be discreet –  looking away or pretending to be engrossed in something else – with the result that we rarely notice when other people are watching us. The researchers suggest that this illusion could even be beneficial as it helps us feel a sense of control, a theory that needs to be investigated further.</p>
<p>We need more research to test the robustness of this illusion, especially with older participants. If it does replicate, it may have important implications for our social interactions. For example, it suggests we are likely to underestimate the impact our actions have on others. Take emergency situations: we may look to others to see how they are reacting, while not realising that they in turn are taking their cues from us. It’s worth remembering that we are just as present, and visible, as everyone else.</p>
<p>At the same time, these new findings may be disconcerting for anyone who suffers from painful self-consciousness. But it’s worth remembering that people typically aren’t paying attention to what we’re self-conscious about. Moreover, being observed is not the same thing as being judged. Our own observations of others typically drift through our minds without us paying them much attention – in that regard, the part of the new research in which participants wrote down what they noticed about each other was a rather unnatural task. In real life, it’s likely these details would be forgotten quickly. Earlier, more comforting studies have also shown that other people tend to judge us far less harshly and with more empathy, even when we think we’ve embarrassed ourselves, than we expect.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/24/targeting-alzheimers-new-unorthodox-approaches/">Targeting Alzheimer’s: New Unorthodox Approaches</a></h4>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease affects an estimated 5 million individuals in the US and causes a devastating loss of cognitive function due to the buildup of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain. Previous efforts to combat this disease have focused on developing drugs that target beta-amyloid, but such treatments have been unsuccessful in patients so far. Several exciting new approaches for treating Alzheimer’s are currently being tested in clinical trials in the US and Europe. These trials will assess the efficacy of an anti-viral drug that is normally used to treat herpes, and a new vaccine that generates antibodies against tau protein.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease was first identified in 1906 and is the most common cause of dementia, responsible for an estimated 60–70 percent of dementia cases. Alzheimer’s predominantly affects the elderly, but approximately 5 percent of cases involve early-onset disease (prior to the age of 65). The predominant symptoms of Alzheimer’s are a loss of memory and other intellectual capacities, which must be severe enough to interfere with everyday functioning. Mood swings and behavioral difficulties are also predominant symptoms. As the disease progresses, motor functions can also be impacted, inhibiting the ability of patients to speak, swallow, and even walk. Affected individuals typically survive between 4–20 years beyond the time that their symptoms become noticeable to others, with an average survival time of 8 years.</p>
<p>Research into the causes of Alzheimer’s has revealed that two proteins, beta-amyloid and tau, play a key role in disrupting the neural processes that underlie memory and other cognitive abilities. Beta-amyloid normally acts to combat oxidative stress, regulate cholesterol transport, and fight off bacteria in the brain. In Alzheimer’s, however, beta-amyloid is overproduced. The excess protein forms clumps, or plaques, around neurons that can interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses. Tau is found in abundance in neurons and normally acts to stabilize cell proteins called microtubules in neuronal axons. In Alzheimer’s disease, defective forms of tau are produced, often containing large numbers of attached phosphate groups, termed hyperphosphorylated tau. Defective tau fails to stabilize microtubules, and instead binds together into insoluble aggregates or “tangles” of protein. The buildup of these neurofibrillary tangles inside of neurons, combined with amyloid plaques surrounding neurons, disrupts cell-to-cell communication in the brain.</p>
<p>Current therapies for Alzheimer’s include drugs that treat the symptoms of dementia by regulating neurotransmitter levels; however, none of these treatments directly addresses the cause of the disease. Research efforts have focused on finding a drug that can prevent the buildup of plaques by interfering with beta amyloid synthesis and aggregation. Unfortunately, despite promising preclinical data from animal studies, these drugs failed to produce results in humans or had devastating side effects. For example, one anti-beta-amyloid vaccine caused meningoencephalitis or inflammation of the brain tissue and surrounding membranes. This side effect may have resulted from the reaction of the vaccine with beta-amyloid normally present in the walls of blood vessels. Such serious side effects were cause for cessation of the trial, and researchers have subsequently turned their attention to other possible treatments.</p>
<p>A research team led by Hugo Lövheim from the Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation and the Unit of Geriatric Medicine at Umeå University in Sweden is piloting the first clinical study to address the effect of a herpes virus drug on Alzheimer’s disease. Lövheim’s group previously showed that infection with herpes virus was correlated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. People who tested positive for antibodies associated with the reactivated form of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1 anti-IgM) had double the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Thus, the researchers surmised that brain signaling pathways activated by the virus might trigger the disease, and conversely, that anti-viral drugs might reverse disease symptoms.</p>
<p>The VALZ-Pilot study is currently recruiting participants with Alzheimer’s to investigate the effects of Valaciclovir, sold by the brand name Valtrex, a drug typically prescribed to treat genital herpes, cold sores, and shingles. Thirty-six participants will receive four weeks of drug treatment. Markers in the spinal fluid will be examined to assess the effect of the drug on several Alzheimer’s disease parameters, including levels of tau protein. A subset of subjects will also undergo positive emission tomography (PET) brain imaging analysis. By using a tracer that accumulates in cells with active herpes infection, this methodology can potentially detect this infection in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.</p>
<p>A second new approach for treating Alzheimer’s, spearheaded by Petr Novak and colleagues at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, is the generation of a vaccine that targets the tau protein. Previous vaccine treatments for Alzheimer’s, which have thus far proven unsuccessful, focused only on beta-amyloid. The new vaccine, AADvac1, will prompt the body to generate antibodies against tau. The production of anti-tau antibodies will hopefully direct the immune system to clear tau protein from inside brain cells, similar to the way it fights off viruses and bacteria.</p>
<p>Developing a tau vaccine wasn’t easy; tau is a protein also found in healthy brains, and thus the removal of “healthy tau” by a vaccine could have negative side effects. The researchers compared differences in the structure of the healthy and pathological tau proteins, and identified what they call the “Achilles heel” of the abnormal protein. They were then able to create a vaccine that recognizes this feature of the abnormal protein, yielding treatment specificity for the disease-causing tau.</p>
<p>So far the AADvac1 vaccine is in phase 1 of clinical trials, which involves administration of the drug to healthy volunteers to assess side effects, but does not address efficacy. No serious side effects have been observed thus far, and volunteers have experienced only minor reactions at the injection site, similar to other types of vaccines. The lack of side effects is a promising first step. Moreover, the trial has also demonstrated the effectiveness of the drug to elicit an immune response, which is a critical factor for its success. These promising preliminary data provide much-needed hope for Alzheimer’s patients and their families.</p>

<p>But what, exactly, are NTDs? They are a diverse group of communicable diseases that flourish in tropical and subtropical conditions in 149 countries, costing developing economies billions of dollars every year, according to the <strong><a href="http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a></strong> (WHO). NTDs mainly affect populations living in poverty, without adequate sanitation and in close contact with infectious vectors, domestic animals and livestock. In addition to causing mortality, NTDs remain an impediment to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development (WHO). Approximately 1.2 billion people globally have their quality of life and economic productivity diminished by NTDs.</p>
<p>In this context, however, there has been tremendous progress in the <strong><a href="http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/Global_resolve_to_end_NTDs_amid_unprecedented_progress/en/" target="_blank">past five years</a></strong>. “For some diseases we’re ahead of our 2020 targets,” says Dirk Engels, Director, WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. WHO, Uniting to Combat NTDs and the NTD community collaborated to host the recent 2017 NTD Summit celebrating the 5th year since the signing of the<strong> <a href="http://unitingtocombatntds.org/resource/london-declaration" target="_blank">London Declaration</a></strong>, a collaborative disease eradication program inspired by the <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70809/1/WHO_HTM_NTD_2012.1_eng.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>WHO 2020 roadmap</strong></a> to eradicate or negate transmission for at least ten NTDs.</p>
<p>Partnering with summit organizers and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, <em>PLOS NTDs</em> – on the occasion of its 10th anniversary – co-hosted a <strong><a href="http://unitingtocombatntds.org/sci-research-fri-2pm" target="_blank">panel</a></strong> at the summit with <em>PLOS NTDs</em> co-Editor-in-Chief Peter Hotez and PLOS Executive Editor Veronique Kiermer as moderators. The panel brought together experts on lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminth infection and schistosomiasis, all who have been involved with the journal either as frequent contributors or editors. These leading scientists from the WHO Regional Director’s Office of Africa (drawing on expertise gained in Tanzania); the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka; and the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, People’s Republic of China participated in an engaging discussion of how providing access to publication – as a reader, author and editor – can help build capacity for research in disease-endemic countries.</p>
<p>Published in parallel with the panel, the Symposium article “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005530" target="_blank">Partnering to Promote Research Where It Matters</a></strong>” focuses on capacity-building efforts and the positive impact of Open Access scientific literature for those working in disease-endemic countries. In China, “We work together on issues like health education, behavior change, and communication skills,” says panelist Xiao-Nong Zhou, Director of the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “Our university could only afford a very restricted number of titles,” says Nilanthi de Silva, parasitologist at the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka. <em>PLOS NTDs</em> (and other Open Access journals publishing NTD-related research) offers an essential venue for researchers in low- and middle-income countries. Of the papers published to date, 25% have at least one author from Africa and 23% have an author from South America.</p>
<p>It is possible that nearly half of the current NTDs could be eliminated, eradicated or show significant gains in these directions <strong><a href="http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/Global_resolve_to_end_NTDs_amid_unprecedented_progress/en/" target="_blank">within the decade</a></strong>. That would take continued dedication, and funding. “The last decade has seen a mixed picture when it comes to success stories in the progress to control or eliminate the world’s NTDs,” acknowledge <em>PLOS NTDs</em> Editors-in-Chief Serap Aksoy and Peter Hotez. According to David Molyneux, Emeritus Professor Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and lead of their overarching Neglected Tropical Diseases program, “The future is going to be about building capacity for NTDs and recognizing that we’re talking about a broader problem of sustainable development.” Molyneux is a long-term editorial advisor for <em>PLOS NTDs</em>.</p>
<p>In the <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary" target="_blank">10th Anniversary Collection</a></strong>, Editorial Board members and other experts examine this progress in 20 of the major NTDs over the last decade. Those familiar with these diseases, those wanting a comprehensive overview or those wanting to focus on a specific disease will find in the collection reflections on significant lessons and successes as well as remaining challenges. The collection lays out a roadmap for future research priorities and identifies key opportunities for further progress in disease elimination. The Editorial by Aksoy and Hotez, “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005355" target="_blank">PLOS NTDS: Ten Years of Progress in Neglected Tropical Disease Control and Elimination…More or Less</a></strong>,<strong>“</strong> provides an excellent introduction to the <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/ntds-10th-anniversary" target="_blank">PLOS NTDs Tenth Anniversary Collection</a></strong>.</p>
<p>With support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation <em>PLOS NTDs</em> was <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000077" target="_blank">founded</a> </strong>to represent the needs of a community of scientists, public health experts and global advocates working on diseases of the poor and simultaneously to be a capacity-building tool for disease experts living and working in Africa and other disease-endemic regions of the world. Since founding, the journal has published over 4,700 articles (Research Articles, Editorials, Viewpoints, Policy Platforms, From Innovation to Application articles and more) written by more than 8,000 authors. Currently 40% of the journal’s 255 editorial board members are from disease-endemic countries. For more details of the journal’s history and impact over the past ten years, see the Editorial, “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005479" target="_blank">The PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases Decade</a></strong>.”</p>
<p>Journal editors and staff have worked diligently on its dual mission to build capacity and encourage the submission and publication of the work of authors living and conducting research in disease-endemic countries. Editors have hosted 26 writing workshops in affected countries around the globe and provide training on best practices to ensure robust peer review, avoid plagiarism, handle data management and address other <strong><a href="https://ori.hhs.gov/infographics" target="_blank">issues of research integrity</a></strong>. They also cover tips on crafting comments to authors and editing decision letters. These activities build a strong NTDs community to ensure ongoing success of the journal and scientific endeavors related to NTDs research.</p>

The peptide agonist engages the receptor by binding to an extended hydrophobic pocket facilitated by the large outward movement of the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices 6 and 7. This conformation is accompanied by a 60° kink in helix 6 and a large outward movement of the intracellular end of this helix, opening the bundle to accommodate interactions with the α5-helix of Gαs. Also observed is an extended intracellular helix 8 that contributes to both receptor stability and functional G-protein coupling via an interaction with the Gβ subunit. This structure provides a new framework for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor function.

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>In women, a major role of prolactin is to initiate and sustain pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland is important for pregnancy maintenance and prolactin levels are correlated with miscarriage occurrence. When prolactin levels fail to increase properly, there is a higher risk of miscarriage<sup>1</sup>. But prolactin levels are also important during the female reproductive cycle – as increased prolactin secretion can cause infertility by inhibiting the release of hormones that trigger ovulation. So prolactin levels cannot be too high to allow ovulation and pregnancy to occur, but also have to increase at a proper rate during early pregnancy to ensure pregnancy success. But how the body carefully regulates prolactin in real time has been a mystery – until now.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation of prolactin secretion</strong></p>
<p>The body controls its hormonal release by means of positive and negative feedback. In a general way, hormones secreted in the hypothalamus (area of the brain that controls the body’s homeostasis) stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete several hormones. These hormones enter the blood stream and act in peripheral target glands, stimulating further hormonal release (positive feedback). Subsequently, those hormones secreted by the target glands reach back to where the process started, suppressing hormonal secretion in both hypothalamus and pituitary (negative feedback). Like your home thermostat, sensing when your house is getting too warm, and turning on the air conditioner. Once the optimal temperature is reached, the air conditioner is turned back off.</p>
<p>But prolactin is different. It lacks a target peripheral gland, and therefore is not regulated through the standard negative feedback mechanisms that resemble your thermostat. Unlike other pituitary hormones that are stimulated by the hypothalamus, prolactin secretion is controlled by inhibitory dopaminergic inputs, produced in the tuberoinfundibular region of the hypothalamus (TIDA). We know that dopamine inhibits prolactin (and prolactin in turn, stimulates dopamine), but we do not know the temporal relationship among these players. The activity of dopaminergic neurons is very fast, firing in bursts of spikes happening at 20 seconds intervals<sup>2</sup>. Prolactin response, in turn, occurs in a much slower way. So how does all this rapid activity of dopaminergic neurons translate into dopamine release at the median eminence and subsequent (slower) prolactin secretion?</p>
<p>In a recent study published in PNAS, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/9/2379.abstract">Romano and colleagues</a> used an innovative new approach to investigate real time interaction between dopamine and prolactin. The researchers were able to measure dopaminergic release from TIDA neurons, correlating it to prolactin levels in freely moving mice, in real time, for several days! They implanted several miniaturized carbon fibers directly into the median eminence of female mice. This area is the part of the hypothalamus where the hormones are released, being the connection between brain and pituitary gland.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19315" style="width: 480px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-19315" height="307" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/04/Romano-1-300x192.jpg" width="480" /></a>This figure show how TIDA neurons release dopamine at the level of the median eminence.</figure>
<p><strong>There is a hierarchical relationship between different dopaminergic neurons </strong></p>
<p>By analyzing dopaminergic secretion over several days, the authors found that dopamine release was more frequent during the night, and that periods of intense dopaminergic activity were always followed by periods of silence. This makes sense within the feedback nature of the neuroendocrinology system, where hormones are released in pulses, to prevent down-regulation of target receptors. Elevated constant hormonal levels results in a decrease in the quantity of the hormone receptor, resulting in decreased sensitivity (down-regulation).</p>
<p>Analyzing dopaminergic currents on the basis of their shape, the authors realized that the dopaminergic neurons are stereotypically organized in distinct groups, with different and specific firing rates. These stereotypical features of the dopaminergic neurons were consistent between different animals and different days of recording.  When dual-carbon fiber recordings were performed in two distinct dopaminergic neurons 500 μm from each other, the authors discovered that dopaminergic firing events were coordinated within minutes during most of the recordings. Therefore, the activity from all those different TIDA groups is somehow coordinated over a range of minutes before dopaminergic release in the median eminence.</p>
<p><strong>Novel integrated view of how dopamine controls prolactin secretion </strong></p>
<p>Although all TIDA neurons release dopamine in the median eminence, there are different subsets of TIDA neurons, with similar firing patterns among the members of the same group, but not coordinated with other groups (those different TIDA groups are shown in the figure as green, orange, and magenta). Each one of those groups of TIDA neurons follows a stereotyped sequence of events. Meaning that locally, there is an organization of frequencies and the firing events occur as sequences (Short-term interaction). Those local dopaminergic patterns are fine-tuned within pre-established time windows, being totally integrated in the median eminence, before actual dopaminergic release (Long-term interaction).</p>
<p>This type of hierarchical organization of rhythmic activity has been previously seen in several other brain regions, and evolutionarily preserved among several species<sup>3</sup>. This repetitive rhythmic neural activity generates neural oscillations, which can vary in magnitude and/or frequency. In brain regions with hierarchical organization, several different neuronal oscillators form a linear progression, with slower oscillations regulating the amplitude (size) of the faster ones. This serves as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks to the fast, and local cortical, integrating functional systems across multiple spatial and time scales.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a study has been capable to show that the median eminence is capable of integrating hierarchical neuronal oscillating networks, in a specific spatio-temporal pattern. This study opens a whole new path to investigate how hormonal rhythms can occur on multiple time-scales, ranging from minutes and days to seasons, helping to explain slow endocrine events such as reproduction, growth, metabolism, and stress.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/21/new-developments-in-treating-parkinsons-disease/">New Developments in Treating Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 10 million people worldwide. The disease primarily results from selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta part of the brain. Its key clinical features include motor symptoms of rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. However, recent findings have confirmed that the disease is also characterized by its non-motor symptoms that appear before the onset of motor symptoms, strongly suggesting that Parkinson’s disease is not motor-specific. </p>
<p>The pre-motor phase is mainly characterized by olfactory abnormality, rapid eye movement behavior, and constipation. In addition, the patient may also experience somnolence, apathy, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Although the disease is not curable, currently available treatments alleviate symptoms, improve the quality of life and prolong survival. This article aims to review some of the recent developments that can make a difference to the patient’s quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Levodopa: the long-time gold standard for PD</strong></p>
<p>To date, levodopa (a dopamine precursor) has been considered as the most effective drug for controlling both motor and non-motor symptoms. Hence, it is regarded as the long-time gold standard for treating PD. However, as the disease progresses (4–5 years after the onset), the ability of the drug to smooth out symptoms declines, and the patients start to experience motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, i.e., excessive involuntary abnormal movements. The motor fluctuations shift between ON-time, a state when the drug is effective and symptoms are controlled, and OFF-time, a period during which control of symptoms is lost. To overcome this limitation, levodopa is usually combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to diminish rapid metabolism of levodopa in the periphery and thereby increase its availability for uptake into the brain. Recent research has further improved this add-on therapy to levodopa (i.e., levodopa/carbidopa) to provide sustained-release of levodopa and thereby improve motor fluctuations in PD patients.</p>
<p><strong>New adjunct therapy to levodopa</strong></p>
<p>Recently, a novel extended-release formulation of levodopa/carbidopa has been introduced in the US market with the name IPX066. This newly designed formulation features both the immediate and extended release properties of carbidopa/levodopa, thus it allows for both immediate and longer duration clinical benefits. IPX066 pills can be taken orally and are recommended for all PD patients.</p>
<p>In two clinical trials, the efficacy of IPX066 was tested in both early and advanced PD patients. In these patients, the administration of IPX066 significantly reduced the OFF-time and increased the ON-time without causing dyskinesia.  No serious drug-related adverse effects were reported, although some patients experienced nausea, headache, dizziness, and insomnia.</p>
<p>Concurrently, another novel improved formulation of levodopa is XP21279. This drug is not available on the market as it is still in the earlier phases of clinical development. The XP21279 is a levodopa prodrug that is readily absorbed in the small intestine where it is metabolized into levodopa. The levodopa then enters the plasma and transfers into the brain. The efficacy of XP21279 was tested in a clinical trial conducted on 14 PD patients with motor fluctuations. Out of 10 patients who completed the study, 6 patients showed a 30% reduction in OFF-time, whereas ON-time was not affected.</p>
<p>Opicapone (trade name ONgentys®) is another novel drug that is used as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/carbidopa for mitigating motor complications in patients with PD. The drug was approved by the European Commission in July 2016. This is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that acts by blocking an enzyme that metabolizes levodopa, enhancing its efficacy and thereby significantly improving motor fluctuations. Unlike other COMT inhibitors such as tolcapone and entacaopne, opicapone is not associated with liver toxicity, as confirmed by experimental studies in animals.</p>
<p>The use of opicapone as adjunctive therapy to levodopa was investigated in two clinical trials: i) 14- to 15-week, double-blind, multinational trial; and ii) 1-year, open-label extension study in the same patients. The results were promising. Administration of opicapone (50 mg/day) caused a significant improvement in motor fluctuations in patients during the double blind trials. The opicapone-mediated improvements in motor fluctuations were maintained in the 1-year extension study. There were few reports of dyskinesia and decreased drug effects along with other common adverse effects, such as constipation, insomnia, and dry mouth, showed no drug relationship.</p>
<p>Safinamide, a highly selective MAO-B inhibitor, has been newly introduced as an add-on therapy to levodopa in mid-to-late-stage PD. The efficacy of safinamide as an adjunct to levodopa was tested in clinical trials of 6 months, 8 months, and 2 years, on middle to advanced-stage PD patients with motor fluctuations. The intake of safinamide (50–100 mg daily) in these patients had drastically increased ON-time without increased dyskinesia. The beneficial effect of increased ON-time was maintained in both 18 month and 2 year extension studies. In addition, the use of safinamide in these patients improved daily living, depression, clinical status, and quality of life.</p>
<p>In addition to levodopa, safinamide is also used as an add-on therapy to dopaminergic agonists in early-stage PD. Administration of safinamide at a dose of 100–200 mg/day was found as an effective PD therapy in combination with dopaminergic agonists.</p>
<p>Although we still have no cure for Parkinson’s disease, recent developments have helped to improve symptomatic therapy, allowing patients to experience a better quality of life.</p>

<img alt="© jarun011 / Fotolia" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia-Hemophilia-positive-jarun011-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Bleeding disorders often arise when there is a problem with the clotting process. Hemostasis is the process by which the body arrests bleeding via the damaged blood vessels and it involves three major steps: vasoconstriction, formation of a temporary blockage (platelet plug), and blood coagulation. When injury causes a blood vessel to bleed, vascular constriction limits the flow of blood to the injured area. The vessel wall injury, via a series of reactions, triggers the attachment and activation of platelets which aggregates at the site of injury. Platelets adhere to collagen which becomes exposed in the endothelial cell lining of blood vessels at the site of injury creating the platelet plug. Initial platelet adhesion is to von Willebrand factor, a major component in the blood coagulation process. Coagulation factor VIII circulates in the blood stream in an inactive form when bound to von Willebrand factor.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8866" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="© science photo / Fotolia" class="size-medium wp-image-8866" height="240" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia_69426835_Subscription_Yearly_XXL.jpg-smaller-300x240.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© science photo / Fotolia</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>When injury to a blood vessel occurs, factor VIII becomes activated and separates from von Willebrand factor and interacts with factor IX, another coagulation factor. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F8">blood clot</a>. Activation of a sequence of blood clotting factors generates thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin mesh is then produced around the hemostatic plug in turn strengthening the clot.</p>
<p>von Willebrand disease is the most common type of bleeding disorder and is <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/vwd/#what_is_von_willebrand_disease">usually less severe</a> in comparison to other bleeding disorders. It occurs due to decrease in or malfunctioning von Willebrand factor activity which ultimately affects the hemostasis process and slows the formation of blood clots resulting in prolonged bleeding episodes. It is estimated that around 1% of the world’s population is affected by von Willebrand disease.</p>
<p>Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder where the blood is unable to clot properly. It can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding after injury or surgery. Those who suffer from hemophilia can bleed longer than usual, although <a href="https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=646">not faster</a>. There are two main types of hemophilia which are hemophilia A and hemophilia B with the former being the most common of the two. Although it is the most common type of hemophilia, it is a rare condition and it affects about <a href="http://haemophilia.org.uk/bleeding-disorders/haemophilia-a/">one in every 10,000 males</a> whilst hemophilia B affects <a href="http://haemophilia.org.uk/bleeding-disorders/haemophilia-b/">one in every 50,000 males</a>. The condition arises when a mutation or change occurs in one of the genes that provide instructions for making the clotting factor proteins needed to form a blood clot thus resulting in reduced production or deficiency of the respective clotting factor. The F8 gene and F9 gene, both situated on the X-chromosome, provides the instructions for producing coagulation factors VIII and IX respectively. A mutation in the F8 gene causes hemophilia A whilst a mutation in the F9 gene results in hemophilia B. Suffers therefore have low levels of either clotting factor VIII or IX and the severity is determined by the level of the factor in the blood.</p>

<p>Due to the sex-linkage of the disorder, the <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia">prominence</a> amongst male is greater than in females. Although the disorder mainly affects males, females can be carriers of the affected gene and experience symptoms. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder. However, it has been found that in about a <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia">third</a> of new diagnoses there is no previous family history. This could be due to <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/hemophilia/types-of-hemophilia.php">new or spontaneous genetic mutations</a>. It is estimated that worldwide, around 400,000 people are living with hemophilia with 20,000 of these cases present in the <a href="http://www.hemophiliafed.org/bleeding-disorders/hemophilia/">United States</a> and around 6,000 in the <a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index2.html#Haemophilia">United Kingdom</a>. Main symptoms can include a prolonged bleeding from cuts, a tendency to bruise easily especially in early childhood, and bleeding into joints and muscles causing pain, swelling, and stiffness which can result in joint deformity and limitation of movement if left untreated. Women can experience prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and the <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms">excessive blood loss</a> can lead to anemia resulting in weakness and fatigue. In general, during the process of ovulation, women can develop simple/ functional ovarian cysts which are small and not usually problematic. However, it has been found that carriers of hemophilia are more likely to experience significant bleeding during ovulation and have a greater risk of bleeding into these simple cysts which then become <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms">hemorrhagic ovarian cysts</a> that can cause considerable pain and may require urgent medical intervention. Women with hemophilia are also more likely to have postpartum bleeding following <a href="http://elearning.wfh.org/elearning-centres/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia/#carriers_bleeding_symptoms">childbirth</a>.</p>
<p>It has been reported that of the 400,000 people living with hemophilia worldwide, only around <a href="https://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=642">25%</a> receive adequate treatment. The recommended treatment plan for hemophilia depends on the severity of the condition. The main treatment for hemophilia is <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia/treatment">replacement therapy</a> whereby the missing clotting factor is slowly dripped or injected into a vein. A CDC- sponsored <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa067659#t=article">randomised clinical trial</a> found that regular treatment to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII) was effective in preventing joint damage and decreased the frequency of joint and other hemorrhages in young boys with severe hemophilia. The children who were treated on a regular basis also had less evidence of joint damage by 6 years of age than did those who were treated after a bleed had commenced.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8865" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="© curlymary / Fotolia" class="size-medium wp-image-8865" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fotolia-Medic-with-tube-of-blood-takes-a-blood-test.-World-hemophilia-day-curlymary-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">© curlymary / Fotolia</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>However, factor replacement therapy has its limitations as it has been found that approximately <a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-014-0019-8">25–30%</a> of people with severe hemophilia A and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934290/">1–5%</a> of people with severe hemophilia B develop an antibody (inhibitor) to the treatment which causes major complications.</p>
<p>There are a number of new therapies under development which include gene therapy where researchers are investigating means by which the faulty genes that cause bleeding disorders such as hemophilia can be corrected. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemophilia/research.html">Research</a> is also being conducted to design and implement interventions that will help combat complications. Although there is no cure for hemophilia, with the right treatment, care, and lifestyle changes, those who suffer from hemophilia can lead fulfilled lives.</p>

<img alt="Word Cloud(1)" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Word-Cloud1-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Rheumatology is a branch of medicine that is mainly concerned with disorders of joints, soft tissues, autoimmune diseases, vasculitis, and heritable connective tissue disorders – collectively known as rheumatic diseases. As these disorders generally involve inflammation/the immune system, rheumatology is generally seen as increasingly moving in the direction of autoimmunity.</p>
<p>The most common, and therefore well studied, rheumatic diseases are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, which cause pain and inflammation of joints and affect approximately 8.5 million people in the UK alone. However, these two conditions are just a couple of examples of rheumatic diseases as this umbrella term incorporates over 200 disorders. As illustrated in the figure above, these include conditions such as giant cell arteritis, fibromyalgia, Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, gout and lupus, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Given the nature of these conditions, they are often referred to as systematic and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In addition to the burden of the rheumatic diseases themselves, it is now becoming clear that there are an increasing number of co-morbidities associated with rheumatic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignancies and infections.</p>
<p>It is upon this background that <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> is being launched to provide the rheumatology community with an open access avenue to disseminate research findings into these diseases with the ultimate aim of improving patient care. As a member of the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC</em> series</a>, the ethos of <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will be <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/12/05/vital-importance-inclusive/">open and inclusive</a>, and the Journal will not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. Like other journals in the <em>BMC </em>series, submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed to assess scientific validity. Furthermore, as an open access peer-reviewed journal, published articles will be freely available to all readers whatever their location.</p>
<p>The remit of <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a> will be to consider research on all aspects of the prevention, treatment and management of rheumatic diseases, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but the Journal will place a special emphasis on systemic and inflammatory conditions and connective tissue diseases, along with related co-morbidities.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Rheumatology</em></a> will complement and expand the open access journal portfolio within the area of rheumatology at BioMed Central and will be a sister journal to <a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em></a> within the <em>BMC</em> series. Although there is some overlap in scope, <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> and <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em> will sit very comfortably alongside each other: <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em> will have a focus on studies with a definite musculoskeletal component (i.e. bone, cartilage, tendon etc.), whereas <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will cover all areas of rheumatology, including systemic conditions and related co-morbidities, which are topics that will fall outside the scope of <em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders</em>.</p>
<p>To encompass the spectrum of rheumatology research, <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will be supported by an international <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board">Editorial Board</a>, with oversight from three expert Section Editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Clinical rheumatology’ edited by Susan Goodman (Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, USA)</li>
<li>‘Epidemiology and public health’ section edited by Edward Roddy (Keele University, UK)</li>
<li>‘Pre-clincial and translational science’ edited by Alessia Alunno (University of Perugia, Italy)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Section Editors will be pleased to consider papers on all aspects of rheumatology across a variety of article types, including <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/research-article">Research articles</a> and <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/case-report">Case reports</a>, as well <a href="http://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/study-protocol">Study protocols</a> for proposed or ongoing prospective clinical research.</p>
<p>Why not submit your next paper to the journal? <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> will have its launch issue in November 2017, so submit now and be part of the journal’s launch.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about the journal, please do contact me, the journal’s Editor, by email (<a href="mailto:james.mockridge@biomedcentral.com">james.mockridge@biomedcentral.com</a>).

<p>What do you take from this hypothetical headline: “Reading the Research Digest blog is associated with higher intelligence”? How about this one: “Reading this blog might increase your intelligence”? According to science writing guides like <a href="http://HealthNewsReview.org">HealthNewsReview.org</a>, taking the first correlational finding from a peer-reviewed article and reporting it for the public using the second wording, implying causation, is a sin of exaggeration, making a relationship appear more causal than the evidence suggests.</p>
<p>Yet this happens a lot. A 2014 <i>British Medical Journal</i> <i>(BMJ)</i> <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7015">article</a> showed these exaggerations to be rife in media coverage of correlational studies, with 81 per cent of news articles committing the sin. Dismayingly, one third of press releases were also guilty. These normally involve editorial input from professionals and often the scientists themselves, who should really know better. Reading about this, we might conclude that science communicators of all stripes need to get more familiar with the best practice of describing causality.</p>
<p>However, the authors of that <i>BMJ</i> analysis started to ponder whether readers interpret these headlines literally, or whether they draw their own conclusions. Now their research group has tested this for <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2016-52933-001/">a paper</a> in <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, and their findings suggest that while science writers need to pick up their game, science-writing guides also have some catching up to do.</p>
<p><span id="more-22882"></span></p>
<p>Rachel Adams and her colleagues at Cardiff University presented 71 online participants, average age 27, with real and modified headlines drawn from news stories about science, politics and sport. Take the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) Being breast fed makes children behave better</li>
<li>(B) Being breast fed is linked to better behaviour in children</li>
<li>(C) Being breast fed is associated with better behaviour in children</li>
</ul>
<p>Style guides consider causal claims on a ladder, with a simple causal statement (A) at the top, ambiguous causal statements like (B) somewhere below, and (C) being on the bottom rung, as it makes a correlational rather than a causal claim. But when the participants reviewed a series of these kind of statements, rating in each case how much the initial term was causing the final one, a different picture emerged. While they gave the first type of headline high scores for causality at 75 or more out of 100, they scored headlines in the style of B and C similarly, at around the 50/100 mark, suggesting that they saw them both as suggesting a moderate amount of causality. This was true across all topics, and unaffected by the participants’ level of science education.</p>
<p>In further experiments the researchers examined the effect of modifying a causal claim with a modal verbs – may, can, might and could – e.g. <i>Being breast fed may make children behave better</i>. Modal verbs introduce some uncertainty, and the style guides recommend them when research demonstrates causality but the claim may not be watertight, such as when based on small or unusual samples. Participants’ interpretations suggested that they saw “can make” as a pretty strong statement, weaker than a pure causal statement but above all the others, such  as “might make” – much as style guides suggest. But whereas the style guides claim that “may make” is a stronger causal statement than equivalent headlines using “might” and “could”, participants saw these three modifiers as interchangeable and understood them to severely weaken the causal claim, rating them at, or even below, the causality of a purely correlational statement.</p>
<p>Adams’ team concluded that readers do not have a highly sophisticated hierarchy of causality, but three broad categories: direct cause, can cause, and large bucket of moderate cause statements, including weaker modals, ambiguous statements, and even correlation itself. This evidence suggests we should be a bit more forgiving of press offices: re-analysing the <i>BMJ</i> data from 2014 found that only one fifth of articles involved an exaggeration as defined in terms of how readers were likely to have interpreted them. Style guides may want to reconsider their recommendations.</p>
<p>One final point: the research group also looked at the uptake of science coverage – how much a piece was read and shared – and found no evidence that exaggeration was of any benefit in increasing coverage. That’s heartening for science writers who prefer to focus on telling the truth in an engaging way rather than resorting to hype.</p>

<img alt="An American alligator attacks an invasive Burmese python in Florida. Can the humble microbe help us predict which species will become successful invaders?" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Gator_and_Python-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Current global changes impact all biota. There are those species that can utilize the changes and those that will have a hard time coping with the human induced changes. Invaders are among the winners and pose a serious threat to native species. Mitigation of the problems associated with invaders has sparked interest in predicting which type of invader species and genotypes could become invaders. However, invasion is always an interplay of the invader’s and resident community’s characteristics. Therefore one should remember that in the changing world anthropogenic change affects not only the invader but also community composition. Moreover, different areas are known to harbour different kinds of species assemblages. It is, thus, worthwhile to ask which kinds of communities could be more vulnerable to invasions.</p>
<p>Let’s make it clear that this idea is by no means new. Many researchers since Charles Darwin and Charles S. Elton have done research on this subject: correlating species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and relatedness between the community and the invader. Despite decades of work on invasions and coexistence mechanisms the evidence seems to be mixed, regardless of the study taxa and methodology. One thing, however, is rather clearly evident: more systems where key aspects of invasion theories can be manipulated are in demand, as from naturally occurring invasions it is hard to explicitly show the determinants of invasions.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-017-0126-z">In our recent publication in <em>BMC Ecology</em> </a>we present a microbial system for the study of invasion theories, and use it to show that diversity in phylogenetic similarity between the invader and the community members (i.e. the closeness of their evolutionary relationships) affects invasion success. Those communities with diversity in phylogenetic distances to invaders resist invasions better than communities that are less diverse in their phylogenetic relationships to an invader.</p>
<p>This is actually a rather novel finding, as effects of diversity on invasions have been studied mostly at ecological level (species diversity), and not at the evolutionary level of phylogenetic diversity. Since invasion was explained by a metric that describes relatedness between the invader and the community our result casts a doubt on easy recognition of potential invaders, or vulnerable communities. Invader and community act together in the invasion process.</p>
<p>Blaah – microbes – you might think, close the link, and forget that lots of ecological and evolutionary theory has been created and tested with microbes. But, microbes invade as well, and knowing about microbial invasions of different habitats – lakes, pools, foods, teeth, wounds, and lungs – has direct implications for our day-to-day life.</p>

Other species used in the experiment can be seen as white colonies without a halo.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Emmi Räsänen</div></figure>
<p>In our experiments we used the opportunistic environmentally growing pathogen <em>Serratia marcescens</em> as an invader. This species infects literally everything. For healthy humans, it is rather harmless, but it hosts range span from corals and plants to insects. Several species of insects, when infected, die within few days.</p>
<p>The coolest thing in our system is that we can identify it from other bacteria with very simple agar plating. In addition to red pigment, <em>S. marcescens</em> creates a halo around its colonies in DNAse agar plates, whereas other bacteria in our system are seen as white colonies without a halo. The other bacteria are traditional “lab rats” in microbiology like <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas species</em>.</p>
<p>This system can be used to test several key hypotheses concerning invasions; not only by manipulating species in the community but also their evolutionary background. Easily culturable bacteria can be put through experimental evolution with ease. Such new adapted genotypes can be used to create different invasion scenarios. For example mimicking anthropogenic change – and this is the direction where we are going to head next.</p>

<p>At least one in four readers of this post will die of cancer. This is a simple statistic that leads rationally thinking people to treat the possibility as very likely. And this is what many do: they try to adopt a lifestyle that minimises the risk to some degree. But how do we know what minimises and what increases this risk? Of course, by listening to experts, the best of whom are scientists who research these things. However, whenever there is disquiet brought about by uncertainty, self-titled experts come out of the woodwork. Discussion of factors increasing the risk of cancer is today not only the domain of medical doctors and psycho-oncologists, but is also engaged in by some alternative medicine proponents, pseudopsychologists, and fringe psychotherapists, whose opinions are disseminated by journalists, some more thorough than others (<a href="https://books.google.pl/books/about/50_Great_Myths_of_Popular_Psychology.html?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;redir_esc=y">see myth #26 in <em>50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology</em> for more background</a>).</p>
<p>Among these opinions is the common claim that negative thinking, pessimism, and stress create the conditions for the cells in our body to run amok, and for cancer to develop. Similar declarations accompany therapeutic propositions for changing our way of thinking into a more positive one that will protect us from cancer, or even cure us of the disease. Should you, therefore, begin to fear the possibility of cancer if you are not prone to optimism, or – even worse – have bouts of depression?</p>
<p><span id="more-22827"></span></p>
<p>In <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.4084/abstract">a paper</a> published recently in <em>Psycho-Oncology</em>, four Korean scholars have attempted to provide answers to this question by way of meta-analysis. The first difficulty they encountered was the heterogeneity of the assessment of depression in the published literature. To clarify the mixed findings, they limited data to articles that used a reliable method of defining depression based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and/or the International Classification of Disease (ICD). Only nine studies fulfilled their criteria.</p>
<p>What are the results? Although some low-quality studies found that patients with depressive disorder were at increased risk for cancer, overall the meta-analysis did not demonstrate that patients with clinically diagnosed depressive disorder had an increased risk of developing cancer relative to the general population.</p>
<p>So should readers with depressive tendencies breathe a sigh of relief? In the researchers’ cautious opinion, it is possible that some epidemiological biases affecting the diagnosis of depressive disorder or cancer could have affected their findings, thus concealing a depression-cancer link. Another limitation of their study was the narrow research database: most existing findings were obtained from Western societies and cannot be generalized to other cultures. Additionally, cancer detection depends on screening programmes and the application of new technologies, which vary across countries. Antidepressant medication is also a potential confounder for the relationship between depression and cancer. Furthermore, in the researchers’ opinion too much difference between studies causes a potential problem when interpreting the combined results. Finally, they think that possible publication bias may have affected their review, with negative results (a lack of an association between depression and cancer) less likely to see the light of day.</p>
<p>Scientists write articles which are most often read by other scientists. The careful wording of conclusions is, in this context, essential. However, when cautious words of authors aware of the limitations facing their work are confronted with <a href="https://books.google.pl/books/about/Smile_Or_Die.html?id=YLb1148-VWcC&amp;redir_esc=y">the arrogant declarations of healers and falsehoods spread via the Internet and other media</a>, there is reason to fear that the former will be drowned out. The meta-analysis of the Korean scholars delivers data that are in agreement with a robust body of research. Many studies have shown that such factors as positive vs. negative attitudes, mood, emotions and stress have nothing to do with cancer (for example, see <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198568773.001.0001/acprof-9780198568773-chapter-28">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17955501">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824713">here</a>). Moreover, <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7516/548">some</a> of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561987">these studies</a> demonstrated that the relationship could even be the reverse of what is expected: depressed people and those who experienced more stress were less likely to get cancer than those who were positive and did not suffer from stress.</p>
<p>The conviction that positive thinking and emotions prevent the development of cancer, or can even cure it, is consistent with our need for control. We prefer to live with the conviction that we have control over something rather than it being out of our hands. Unfortunately, as a matter of fact, we are powerless to influence the overwhelming majority of cancer-inducing factors, and there are still others which simply remain unknown.</p>

<img alt="The Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, one of the many locations the researchers work took them too." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/IMG_4772_rainbowsmall-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Variation in environmental conditions across habitats has led to variation in life histories between species. To successfully reproduce and survive, an animal’s physiology, morphology and behaviour needs to be tuned to the environmental conditions of their habitat.</p>
<p>For example, environmental variation along a latitudinal gradient has led to consistent differences in vertebrate life histories. In most vertebrates tropical species lead a slower pace of life than temperate vertebrates. This is especially well studied in birds where it has been shown that tropical birds usually lay smaller clutches of eggs, but live longer than temperate species.</p>
<p>In temperate birds, the beginnings of each breeding season are challenging times for males. Upon arrival to their breeding grounds, they have to establish and defend a territory against other males. Once they have found a female that is willing to mate with them, she also has to be guarded against other males; especially during her fertile times just before egg-laying.</p>
<p>Territorial defence behaviour and mate-guarding is facilitated by the sex steroid hormone testosterone in many vertebrates. Accordingly, blood samples from breeding males often reveal elevated testosterone levels at the beginning of the breeding season.</p>
<p>In contrast, tropical birds are often resident and form life-long pair bonds with their mates. Is the breeding season for tropical males less challenging? Studies on testosterone levels of tropical birds have provided mixed results: while most tropical birds that have been tested so far have lower testosterone levels than usually measured in temperate ones, a number of tropical birds have now been found to have as high testosterone levels as their temperate counterparts. Do tropical species with high testosterone levels also have high levels of aggressive behaviour and song at the beginning of the breeding season?</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8849" style="width: 1290px;"><img alt="Male European stonechat" class="size-full wp-image-8849" height="854" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Stonechat_Saxicola_rubicola_male_Beaulieu_Hampshire.jpg" width="1280" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Male European stonechat</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Charles J Sharp</div></figure>
<p>Due to their extensive breeding range from Siberia to Southern Africa, common stonechats (<em>Saxicola spp</em>) are an excellent study system to determine whether testosterone, aggressive behaviour and song vary similarly during the breeding season at tropical and temperate latitudes. Tropical stonechats lay smaller clutches of eggs, have a longer lifespan and lower metabolic rates than their temperate conspecifics. They are residents and pair with their mates for life. Intriguingly, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X06001875">a previous study</a> found testosterone levels in Kenyan stonechats were as high as in German stonechats at the beginning of the breeding season.</p>
<p>Does this hold true for other tropical stonechat populations? Are tropical male stonechats as aggressive and sing as much as temperate males? To find this out we sampled multiple populations in tropical East Africa and temperate West and Central Europe.</p>
<p>Our quest took us to Masai villages, to the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater, the steep hills of the Usambara and Pare mountains, to the grasslands of Kinangop, the gentle hills of the Ngong Hills and Ol Kalou and the slopes of Mount Meru and Mount Kenya in Tanzania and Kenya. In Europe it took us to grasslands and fields full of poppy below the impressive range of the Sierra Nevada and the medieval town of Ávila where we caught stonechats in the mountain ranges nearby. We went to the rugged, wild coast of the South of Ireland and to pastures in Germany.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8847" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="Birds had blood samples taken to allow later analysis of their testosterone levels." class="wp-image-8847 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Bird-handling-200x300.jpeg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Birds had blood samples taken to allow later analysis of testosterone levels.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>To answer our questions we caught male stonechats with baited traps and took small blood samples from their wing veins. Later testosterone concentrations were quantified in the endocrinology laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Germany. We tested their aggressive response by placing a stuffed male stonechat into the centre of their territories and playing back stonechat song. We analysed their song performance by recording males early in the morning when they sing most.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8846" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="By using this stuffed bird, combined with recorded songs, the researchers provoked aggressive responses from territorial males." class="wp-image-8846 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/04/Fake-bird-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">By using this stuffed bird, combined with recorded songs, the researchers provoked aggressive responses from territorial males.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Kim Mortega &amp; Beate Apfelbeck</div></figure>
<p>We found that tropical and temperate stonechats indeed have very similar testosterone levels during the breeding season. We also found no differences in aggressive behaviour. Both tropical and temperate male stonechats had the highest testosterone levels when they were caught and tested during nest-building – the period of highest female fertility. In contrast, temperate stonechats were singing much more than tropical ones at the beginning of the breeding season.</p>
<p>Thus, despite their very different life histories, their variation in migratory behaviour and stability of pair bonds, life seems to be equally challenging for tropical and temperate stonechats at the beginning of the breeding season. In one important point the tropical and temperate environments of stonechats do not differ: both allow only for a short breeding season. In consequence stonechats probably breed relatively synchronously at all latitudes, which may increase the risk of being cheated during the fertile period of females. Males may therefore profit from high testosterone levels during nest-building to aggressively guard their mates from other rival males.</p>
<p>In contrast, high song rates may be especially important for temperate males to attract a mate at the beginning of the breeding season and less so for tropical males that stay with their females year-round.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study suggests that short breeding seasons may be a major selective force for high peak testosterone levels during breeding regardless of latitude and pace of life, but that particular behaviors, in our case song, can be uncoupled from peak testosterone levels.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Reddit,</strong></p>
<p>My name is Shashwath Meda and I am a Senior Clinical Research Associate at Olin Neuropsychiatry, Hartford Hospital/Institute of Living. I am also joined by Dr. Godfrey Pearlson who is the Director of Olin Neuropsychiatry and a Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University. A primary component of our research here at the center focuses on studying the effects of substance use on brain cognition and function.</p>
<p>We recently published a study titled <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172213&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=ama&amp;utm_campaign=reddit-ama-0417">Longitudinal influence of alcohol and marijuana use on academic performance in college students</a> in <em><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone">PLOS ONE</a></em>. In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of alcohol and marijuana on academic GPA in 1142 freshman college students who were followed up longitudinally over a two-year time period. During this period, each month we collected data on their alcohol and marijuana use patterns while in college through a secure self-report website. In analyzing these data, we identified three substance-use groups, <strong>a)</strong> a group that used either no or very low amounts of both alcohol and marijuana, <strong>b)</strong> students that used no/low marijuana but medium-high amounts of alcohol and <strong>c)</strong> students that consumed medium-high quantities of both substances. Interestingly, we found almost no one that consumed no-low alcohol but high amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p>Our findings show that despite students having the same pre-baseline academic achievement as measured using the SAT scores, at the end of incoming semester those who heavily used either alcohol or alcohol+MJ had a significantly lower GPA compared to those who abstained or had very little of it. We also noticed that students who consumed fairly large quantities of alcohol alone (very little MJ) did not have a consistent decrease in GPA across the two-year period (we only noticed a significant decrease in GPA for the incoming semester). Finally, <strong>our follow up analysis suggested that those who moderated drug use over the period of the study could recover and perform better academically</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Shashwatch, thanks for doing this AMA it’s a great topic.</p>
<p>So the elephant in the room for any of these sorts of longitudinal studies is 3rd variables. For instance, it’s quite easy to make an argument that there could be personality or emotional or experiential differences that make someone more likely to consume alcohol and marijuana but also likely to decline in achievement. Do you think this is indeed a causal relationship whereby the combination of alcohol and weed is affecting cognitive ability?</p>

<p>Author SM: Hello – Thanks for the question. What you say is absolutely possible, however as we explicitly indicate in our paper, the analysis that we did just wasn’t geared towards examining any causality. We tried to somewhat alleviate effects of intermediate variables by controlling for baseline measured personality and emotional traits. However to properly investigate what you allude to requires a causal modelling analysis such as SEM etc. We plan on doing this in the near future at least on the baseline variables to see what the data shows us. Again this is just the tip of the iceberg, much more to come in the future years!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/neurogenetik/">Bj</a>ö<a href="http://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/neurogenetik/">rn Brembs</a> is based a the University of Regensburg, Germany, where his group studies how brains generate spontaneous behavior, how they evaluate the sensory feedback from these actions and how different states of the animal influence the way these processes take place. He completed his PhD at the University of Würzburg, Germany and did a PostDoc in the Houston Health Science Center at the University of Texas, USA. Björn then spent a few years as an independent researcher at the Freie Universität in Berlin, Germany before becoming Adjunct Professor at the University of Leipzig. He finally joined the Institute of Zoology as a professor of neurogenetics of the University of Regensburg in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first become interested in the neurobiology of behaviour?</strong></p>
<p>I was inclined to study science in general and biology in particular already in my high-school years. After spending much of my youth outdoors observing all kinds of animals in the wild I started reading scientific books by all kinds of scientists. In the late eighties, nonlinear dynamics were very popular (at the time known as “chaos theory”), I learned about relativity, was fascinated by Quantum Mechanics, and read books by Konrad Lorenz on animal behavior, by Rupert Riedl on evolution and many other biologists. My compulsory one-year project was on the homing behavior in salmons.</p>
<p>So I was fascinated by big questions and thus broadly interested in the sciences, but the only area of biology I was sure I would never get into was neuroscience: I had read a book about the split-brain patients of Michael Gazzaniga’s, as well as Popper &amp; Eccles’ book “the self and its brain”. I was captivated by the question of how our mind works, of whether we had free will and how we can know anything with any kind of certainty, but what I read in these books seemed so incomprehensibly complicated that I was sure it was way too complex for me.</p>
<p>During my first undergraduate semesters I became particularly interested in developmental biology: how could a largely uniform zygote bring about a highly differentiated adult individual? However, just about the time when I started to realize that I found the actual work in this field mind-numbingly boring (seemingly endless pipetting of clear liquids into other clear liquids and then waiting for hours for a machine to complete its job), I attended the <em>Drosophila</em> neurogenetics lecture by Martin Heisenberg (youngest son of Werner of uncertainty principle fame) and was hooked! I learned that in this field, not only could I study the questions Gazzaniga, Eccles, Popper, etc. had been writing about, but that <em>Drosophila</em> may constitute an experimental system which at least would only make me feel dumb, incompetent and insufficient some of the time and not all the time. During this time, I also worked on a few projects in population and behavioral ecology. These areas also involved a lot of time spent with animals and sometimes their behavior, but the ecological and evolutionary aspects again seemed highly interesting but much more complex and intractable than I thought my limited intellectual capacity allowed me to master.</p>
<p>I completed all Dr. Heisenberg’s department had to offer in terms of lectures and courses and I was even more thrilled by the work than initially. Eventually, Dr. Heisenberg became my thesis advisor and continues to be my mentor to this day. He became the first of three critical mentors who went above and beyond any ‘supervisor’ duties, supporting me at every step of the way. Without them I wouldn’t have stood a chance of survival in science. The research topic of the neurobiology of spontaneous behavior and how feedback modulates this spontaneity in operant learning situations fascinates me to this day.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges and developments can we expect to see for this field in the next few years?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a scientist and not a prophet, so I find it difficult to make predictions, in particular about the future.</p>
<p>In general I think we are in the middle of a genuine paradigm shift in the neurosciences that probably started sometime in the early nineties. Until then, large sections of neuroscience operated under the impression that neurons, circuits and indeed entire nervous systems operated like the machines we engineer: passively receiving some input and generating output. The early work of the ethologists in the mid-late 20th century as well as later neurophysiological evidence from mollusks and other accessible animals contradicted this concept, but had little effect on the larger community, despite the Nobel Prize for Lorenz and the other ethologists. My thesis advisor, Martin Heisenberg, also contributed many contradicting experiments and provided cogent and evidence-based arguments without much effect. It probably was the converging flood of evidence from a variety of disparate fields around the turn of the century, not the least the discovery of resting-state network in the human brain, that started shifting peoples’ attitudes. In addition to the work in humans, ethological work showed that the kind of reproducible behavior neuroscientists love to study in the lab carry the risk of being exploited in the wild, raising issues about how generalizable any knowledge from this kind of behaviors is to other behaviors. Many new preparations were developed where experimentally isolated nervous systems (‘brain in a vat’) generated organized, ethologically relevant spontaneous activity in the absence of any sensory organs. Evolutionary work seemed to suggest that the ancestral functional organization of nervous systems was to generate activity first and have sensory input modulate that activity later. Perhaps most amusingly, basic neuroscience research that had started in the 1980s suddenly became medically relevant and hence subject to much more attention. That work had accumulated evidence over about two decades that even spinal reflexes (e.g., knee-jerk reflex) are far from the input-output systems most textbooks portray them as.</p>
<p>All of this evidence, together with ever more refined imaging capabilities of nervous system activity across the field, has led to a much more refined, almost reversed conceptual framework in neuroscience: now, nervous systems are increasingly conceptualized as constantly active, incessantly varying  this neural activity, with sensory stimuli exerting a modulating effect, the magnitude of which depends on the network state at which the stimulus arrives. As is so often the case in science, the most exciting new findings will probably come from experiments derived from this new perspective, experiments one could not have thought of from the old perspective.</p>
<p><strong>You joined <em>PLOS ONE</em>‘s editorial board when the journal was launched 10 years ago. What attracted you to <em>PLOS ONE</em> in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>At the time, access seemed like such a huge issue. I hadn’t realized, yet, what other, larger issues loomed behind those paywalls. <em>PLOS</em> in general and <em>PLOS ONE</em> in particular was a hip, new initiative. Supporting it helped me hit several birds with the same stone, two of which are: a) it enabled me to help push progress on publishing reform, both in terms of access and in terms of challenging journal rank. b) the work as an academic editor elevated my formal standing in the community and allowed me both to gather invaluable experience in the process of editing (crucial to the publication process) and to connect with colleagues in related fields I would otherwise not have been able to interact with.</p>
<p><strong>The journal has grown beyond expectations. Why do</strong><strong> you think a journal like <em>PLOS ONE</em> – a multidisciplinary and</strong><strong> rigor-focused journal- is relevant to scientists in general and within</strong><strong> your field in particular?</strong></p>
<p>While there are now several of such journals, they help to continue demonstrating to authors and readers that the concept of thematically arranged journals is antiquated. In the digital age, we have much better ways of channeling relevant information to readers than pre-selected information silos that build walls, not bridges between the different research objects. “Megajournals” are not overloading us with irrelevant information, as we only see what is relevant – although much of the process remains to be optimized and more current technology needs to be leveraged in this regard. Only few of these journals, e.g. F1000 Research, are still pushing any boundaries. For most, this once innovative form of publishing seems to now have become a cash cow from which profits need to be milked, rather than sandboxes to be widened and expanded to eventually provide an actual library where all scholarly content can be found: narrative, data and code.</p>
<p><strong>The publishing landscape has changed a lot in these 10 years. What do you think has been a positive change and where is there more work to do?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, from my perspective, it has hardly changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing is still dominated by the main publishers which keep increasing their profit margins, sucking the public teat dry,</li>
<li>Most of our work is still behind paywalls</li>
<li>You won’t get a job unless you publish in high ranking journals.</li>
<li>Higher ranking journals still publish less reliable science, contributing to potential replication issues</li>
<li>The increase in number of journals is still exponential</li>
<li>Libraries are still told by their faculty that subscriptions are important</li>
<li>The digital functionality of our literature is still laughable</li>
<li>There are no institutional solutions to sustainably archive and make accessible our narratives other than text, or our code or our data</li>
</ul>
<p>The only difference in the last few years really lies in the fraction of available articles, but that still remains a small minority, less than 30% total.</p>
<p>So the work we need to do is the same as it was at the time the subversive proposal was written, 23 years ago: getting rid of paywalls. This goal won’t be reached until all institutions have stopped renewing their subscriptions. As I don’t know of a single institution without subscriptions, that task remains just as big now as it was 23 years ago. Noticeable progress has only been on the margins and potentially in people’s heads.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the future of publishing? Are there any initiatives that you find particularly exciting or promising?</strong></p>
<p>Again, I’m not a prophet. If I had my way, I’d like to see institutions start dropping their subscriptions en masse and investing the money in a modern infrastructure, the sort of I have sketched out <a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/2015/04/what-should-a-modern-scientific-infrastructure-look-like">here</a>.</p>
<p>I currently only see a few marginal initiatives or small groups of individuals starting to coalesce around this idea. Most larger or more well-known initiatives are still trying to care palliatively at for the symptoms, rather than attempting to cure the disease.</p>
