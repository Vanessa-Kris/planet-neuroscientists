              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kangaroo-island-dunnart-marsupial-extinction-feral-cats-wildfires">These tiny marsupials survived wildfires only to face extinction from feral cats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Few marsupials have gone from miraculous survival to the brink of extinction as quickly as the Kangaroo Island dunnart.</p>



<p>In 2019 and 2020, devastating fires burned nearly 10 million hectares of southeastern Australia. The flames threatened hundreds of species with extinction, but the Kangaroo Island dunnart (<em>Sminthopsis aitkeni</em>) — which already numbered less than 500 before the fires — seemed to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">one that defied expectations</a> in the aftermath (<em>SN: 3/9/21).</em></p>



<p>But now these rare creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11383-6">may be more at risk than ever</a>, researchers say June 16 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The danger, as domestic as it sounds, is getting eaten by a cat.</p>





<p>As of 2008, invasive <a href="https://abcbirds.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medina_et_al_2011-Global_review_of_invasive_cat_impacts_on_endangered_vertebrates.pdf">feral cats had contributed to at least 13 percent of extinctions worldwide</a>. That&#8217;s one reason the government has been euthanizing cats on Kangaroo Island for years. The scientists who conducted the dunnart study knew all this — but when they studied the remains of cats euthanized in 2020, they were still surprised by what they saw: Seven out of 86 cats had recently dined on dunnart.</p>



<p>“We were not expecting to find so many,” says Louis Lignereux, a field researcher at the University of Adelaide School of Animal and Veterinary Science. It’s particularly bad news, he says, if you think of what was in the cats as only a snapshot of what they ate in the last 36 hours. Taking that into account, those seven cats alone could have eaten enough to wipe out the Kangaroo Island dunnart within a few months, if they had survived — and there are hundreds of other cats on the island.</p>



<p>A small habitat makes the dunnarts especially vulnerable. It’s like putting all your eggs in one basket, Lignereux says. Since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-fires-incinerated-habitats-threatened-species-ecological-disaster">the fires</a>, the Kangaroo Island dunnart is thought to now live in an area about one-tenth of the size of Manhattan <em>(SN: 1/13/20)</em>.</p>



<p>“If something happened to this spot,” he says, “then [the dunnart] is gone forever.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-greeland-sea-ice-glacial-melange-climate-change">Some polar bears in Greenland survive on surprisingly little sea ice</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Pihoqahiak” means “ever-wandering one,” and is an Inuit name for the polar bear, a creature known to roam vast expanses of sea ice, sometimes plodding thousands of kilometers a year in search of seals.</p>



<p>But along the fjord-cut coastline of southeast Greenland, where the sea freezes over for just a few months of the year, some isolated polar bears are surviving as homebodies.</p>



<p>Unlike most polar bears, these bears don’t follow the sea ice during its annual recession or move onto land to hunt. Instead, the crafty ursids <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq5267">stalk seals on nearby glacial mélange</a> — a floating mishmash of icebergs, sea ice fragments and snow that persists year-round near the front of glaciers in the fjords, researchers report in the June 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“They’re residents in fjords that are sea ice–free for more than eight months of the year,” says Kristin Laidre, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “Normally, a polar bear wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive without sea ice for that long.”</p>



<p>For polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>), sea ice isn’t just frozen seawater; it’s the platform they usually use to hunt their preferred prey — seals. But as human-caused climate change raises Earth’s global temperature, <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/233/2021/tc-15-233-2021.html">that ice is disappearing</a>. The number of polar bears that live on sea ice in the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean and Canada’s Hudson Bay is already declining. Researchers estimate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0818-9">most other subpopulations of the bears will collapse by 2100</a> unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as “vulnerable.”</p>



<p>The fjords of southeast Greenland and similar, limited areas could become a last, temporary refuge for a small number of bears, though only curbing climate change can save the ice-dependent species, Laidre and her colleagues say. Glacial mélange isn’t widespread in the Arctic, and what exists could disappear if temperatures rise too much.</p>



<p>Laidre and her colleagues estimate that several hundred bears may dwell in the fjords of southeast Greenland, though further work is needed to obtain a more precise count.</p>



<p>The southeast Greenland group came to the researchers’ attention while they were studying polar bears along east Greenland’s coast to provide advice to the Indigenous peoples who hunt the bears for subsistence. An analysis of 83 receiver-tagged polar bears from 1993 to 2021 revealed that, for the most part, bears living south of about 64° N latitude don’t interact with bears to the north, and vice versa.</p>



<p>Southeast Greenland bears may be mostly isolated by Greenland’s ice sheet to the west and a rapid current to the east, which could sweep seafaring bears south and stifle northward movement, the researchers say.</p>



<p>In northeast Greenland, the median distance traveled by tagged bears was 40 kilometers every four days. But in the southeast region, the median distance traveled was just 10 kilometers every four days, with bears sometimes traveling between neighboring fjords and sometimes remaining in the same fjord all year.</p>



<p>“For a polar bear, that&#8217;s nothing,” says Steven Amstrup, a zoologist and chief scientist of the conservation organization Polar Bears International, based in Bozeman, Mont., who was not involved in the study. “Apparently they&#8217;re finding enough resources there that they don&#8217;t have to make these huge, big movements.”</p>



<p>Southeast Greenland bears hunted on sea ice when it was present during a few months in winter and spring, the researchers found. For the rest of the year, the ursids used the glacial mélange that packed the fjords as hunting grounds. <a></a></p>



<p>“They use it just like sea ice,” Laidre says. “They&#8217;re able to walk [and hunt] on the mélange … and they can swim around between the pieces of ice and ambush seals.”</p>

<p>It’s not entirely surprising that polar bears have settled at the fronts — or toes — of glaciers in the fjords, Amstrup says. “Oftentimes, the toes of these glaciers are very productive areas,” he says, because glacial meltwater can flush nutrients from deeper in the ocean up toward the water’s surface. “You might expect that they would have seal populations [that] could support bears.”</p>



<p>The researchers also analyzed rare genetic variations in the southeast Greenland bears. That work revealed that the sampled animals shared a common ancestor about 200 years ago and have essentially kept to themselves since. “They’re the most genetically isolated polar bears in the world,” Laidre says. Conserving the distinctive bears will be important for protecting the species’ genetic diversity, which is already low, she says.</p>



<p>But for all their peculiarity, even southeast Greenland polar bears will perish without <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-action-could-save-polar-bears">human climate action</a>, Laidre and Amstrup agree (<em>SN: 12/15/10</em>). “Loss of Arctic sea ice is still the primary threat to all polar bears,” Laidre says. “This study does not change that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-sun-carbon-nitrogen-metals-elements">Neutrinos hint the sun has more carbon and nitrogen than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>After two decades of debate, scientists are getting closer to figuring out exactly what the sun — and thus the whole universe — is made of.</p>



<p>The sun is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. There are also heavier elements such as oxygen and carbon, but just how much is controversial. New observations of ghostly subatomic particles known as neutrinos suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15975">the sun has an ample supply of “metals,”</a> the term astronomers use for all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, researchers report May 31 at arXiv.org.</p>





<p>The results “are fully compatible with [a] high metallicity” for the sun, says Livia Ludhova, a physicist at Research Center Jülich in Germany.</p>



<p>Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are crucial for creating rock-iron planets like Earth and sustaining life-forms like humans. By far the most abundant of these elements in the universe is oxygen, followed by carbon, neon and nitrogen.</p>



<p>But astronomers don’t know exactly how much of these elements exist relative to hydrogen, the most common element in the cosmos. That’s because astronomers typically use the sun as a reference point to gauge elemental abundances in other stars and galaxies, and two techniques imply very different chemical compositions for our star.</p>



<p>One technique exploits vibrations inside the sun to deduce its internal structure and favors a high metal content. The second technique determines the sun’s composition from how atoms on its surface absorb certain wavelengths of light. Two decades ago, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2009ARA&amp;A..47..481A/doi:10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145222">a use of this second technique</a> suggested that oxygen, carbon, neon and nitrogen levels in the sun were 26 to 42 percent lower than <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1989GeCoA..53..197A/doi:10.1016/0016-7037(89)90286-X">an earlier determination found</a>, creating the current conflict.</p>



<p>Another technique has now emerged that could decide the long-standing debate: using solar neutrinos.</p>



<p>These particles arise from nuclear reactions in the sun’s core that turn hydrogen into helium. About 1 percent of the sun’s energy comes from reactions involving carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which convert hydrogen into helium but do not get used up in the process. So the more carbon, nitrogen and oxygen the sun actually has, the more neutrinos this CNO cycle should emit.</p>



<p>In 2020, scientists announced that Borexino, an underground detector in Italy, had spotted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-sun-core-nuclear-fusion-reactions-borexino">these CNO neutrinos</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/20</em>). Now Ludhova and her colleagues have recorded enough neutrinos to calculate that carbon and nitrogen atoms together are about 0.06 percent as abundant as hydrogen atoms in the sun — the first use of neutrinos to determine the sun’s makeup.</p>



<p>And though that number sounds small, it’s even higher than the one favored by astronomers who support a high-metal sun. And it’s 70 percent greater than the number a low-metal sun should have.</p>



<p>“This is a great result,” says Marc Pinsonneault, an astronomer at Ohio State University in Columbus who has long advocated for a high-metal sun. “They’ve been able to demonstrate robustly that the current low-metallicity solution is inconsistent with the data.”</p>



<p>Still, because of uncertainties in both the observed and predicted neutrino numbers, Borexino can’t fully rule out a low-metal sun, Ludhova says.</p>



<p>The new work is “a significant improvement,” says Gaël Buldgen, an astrophysicist at Geneva University in Switzerland who favors a low-metal sun. But the predicted numbers of CNO neutrinos come from models of the sun that he criticizes as too simplified. Those models neglect the sun’s spin, which could induce mixing of chemical elements over its life and change the amount of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen near the sun’s center, thereby changing the predicted number of CNO neutrinos, Buldgen says.</p>



<p>Additional neutrino observations are needed for a final verdict, Ludhova says. Borexino shut down in 2021, but future experiments could fill the void.</p>



<p>The stakes are high. “We’re arguing about what the universe is made of,” Pinsonneault says, because “the sun is the benchmark for all of our studies.”</p>



<p>So if the sun has much more carbon, nitrogen and oxygen than currently thought, so does the whole universe. “That changes our understanding about how the chemical elements are made. It changes our understanding of how stars evolve and how they live and die,” Pinsonneault says. And, he adds, it&#8217;s a reminder that even the best-studied star — our sun — still has secrets.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a his paper &quot;Effect of Extracellular Volume on the Energy Stored in Transmembrane Concentration Gradients&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The amount of energy that can be retrieved from a concentration gradient across
a membrane separating two compartments depends on the relative size of the
compartments. Having a larger low-concentration compartment is in general
beneficial. It is shown here analytically that the retrieved energy further
increases when the high- concentration compartment shrinks during the mixing
process, and a general formula is derived for the energy when the ratio of
transported solvent to solute varies. These calculations are then applied to
the interstitial compartment of the brain, which is rich in Na+ and Cl- ions
and poor in K+. The reported shrinkage of this compartment, and swelling of the
neurons, during oxygen deprivation is shown to enhance the energy recovered
from NaCl entering the neurons. The slight loss of energy on the part of K+ can
be compensated for by the uptake of K+ ions by glial cells. In conclusion, the
present study proposes that the reported fluctuations in the size of the
interstitial compartment of the brain (expansion during sleep and contraction
during oxygen deprivation) optimize the amount of energy that neurons can store
in, and retrieve from, their ionic concentration gradients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">Here’s why pumpkin toadlets are such clumsy jumpers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some frogs just can’t stick the landing.</p>



<p>After launching into a leap, pumpkin toadlets careen through the air as if flung from a toddler’s fist. They roll, cartwheel or backflip and then plummet to the ground, often belly flopping or crash-landing on their backs.</p>



<p>“I’ve looked at a lot of frogs and these are the weirdest things I’ve ever seen,” says Richard Essner, Jr., a vertebrate zoologist at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.</p>



<p>Essner and colleagues now propose an explanation for <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn1104">why the tiny frogs are such clumsy jumpers</a>. The animals lack the proper gyroscopic equipment to sense small changes in rotation, the team suggests June 15 in&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em>.</p>

</div><figcaption><em>Brachycephalus pernix</em>&nbsp;frogs have trouble sensing small changes in rotation, which makes landing jumps difficult, a new study suggests. The frogs can roll, cartwheel or backflip through the air, and then hit the ground on their backs or bellies.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When&nbsp;Essner saw videos of&nbsp;<em>Brachycephalus</em>&nbsp;frogs’ awkward aerial maneuvers, he was so shocked that he hopped on a plane to study the animals with his colleagues in Brazil. Small enough to fit on a person’s thumbnail, the frogs are tricky to find in the wild. Scientists listen for the amphibians’ high-pitched, buzzy calls and then scoop leaf litter into a bag, hoping to find a few toadlets.</p>





<p>In the lab, the team used high-speed video to record more than 100 tiny frog jumps. The klutzy tumbles suggested that the toadlets have trouble orienting themselves in space.</p>



<p>Typically, fluid sloshing through bony tubes in the inner ear help vertebrates sense their body’s position. CT scans revealed that the frogs’ tubes are the smallest ever recorded for adult vertebrates. Studies of other tiny animals suggest that the tubes don’t work so well in miniature. It’s difficult for the fluid to flow freely, Essner says. That means the frogs probably can’t sense how they’re twirling through the air, making it tough to prep for landing.</p>



<p>It’s possible that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-glowing-bony-plates">bony back plates</a> offer some species crash protection, but the animals may stay grounded for safety (<em>SN: 4/3/19</em>). As Essner observed, the frogs are “almost always crawling really slowly.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plague-black-death-ancient-dna-bacteria-europe-origin-asia">Ancient bacterial DNA hints Europe’s Black Death started in Central Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although best known as a plague that killed millions of Europeans from 1346 to 1353, the Black Death originated about a decade earlier in Central Asia, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A strain of the plague-causing <em>Yersinia pestis</em> bacterium that killed people in what’s now Kyrgyzstan in 1338 and 1339 was a common ancestor of four <em>Y. pestis</em> strains previously linked to the deadly European outbreak, say archaeogeneticist Maria Spyrou of Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen in Germany and colleagues.</p>





<p>Spyrou’s group identified <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA in teeth of three individuals from an ancient Central Asian cemetery where tombstone inscriptions say that they, as well as many others buried there, died in 1338 and 1339 from an unspecified “pestilence.” Comparisons of that genetic material to modern and historic samples of <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA indicate that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04800-3">Central Asian folks perished from an initial version of the plague bacterium that would wreak havoc on Europe</a>, the Middle East and northern Africa until the early 1800s, the scientists report June 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“The source location and time when this plague emerged was most likely in Central Asia in the first half of the 14th century,” Spyrou said in a June 14 news briefing.</p>



<p>Origins of the Black Death, or bubonic plague, have long been debated. What’s certain is that <em>Y. pestis</em> gets transmitted to humans by fleas that live on rodents. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/125/5/1601/6040962">One current proposal holds that the plague bacterium originated in East Asia</a> and was carried across the continent starting in the 1200s as the Mongol Empire expanded. That scenario leaned on genetic evidence from European Black Death victims and written accounts of an unidentified plague outbreak encountered by Mongol invaders of Baghdad in the 1200s.</p>



<p>But the first archaeological and genetic clues to the Black Death’s place and time of birth come from Central Asia, Spyrou says. Excavations at two cemeteries in northern Kyrgyzstan almost 140 years ago revealed tombstones indicating that many people buried there in 1338 and 1339 had died of an unknown epidemic. The cemeteries were used from the mid-1200s to the mid-1300s, but tombstone inscriptions indicated that deaths spiked in 1338 and 1339. Of 467 dated tombstones, 118 mark deaths in those two years.</p>

Leybin, August 1886</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Spyrou’s group was able to reconstruct the entire <em>Y. pestis</em> genome for two of three Central Asian individuals who died in 1338 or 1339 and whose teeth contained remnants of bacterial DNA. Comparisons with the genetic instructions of 203 modern <em>Y. pestis</em> samples and 47 <em>Y. pestis</em> samples dating from the 14th to 19th centuries pegged the Central Asian genomes as a single strain that was a direct ancestor of Black Death strains.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that marmots and other rodents now living in the same region of Central Asia carry forms of <em>Y. pestis</em> closely related to the ancient variant. The <em>Y. pestis</em> variant that killed Central Asians in 1338 and 1339 may thus have emerged locally, the investigators suggest.</p>



<p>Reasons for the rise of a particularly deadly form of <em>Y. pestis</em> in Central Asia during the early 1300s remain unclear. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-plague-bacteria-strain-human-victim-bones">earliest known <em>Y. pestis</em> strain</a>, which dates to around 7,100 years ago in Eastern Europe, lacked a plague-inducing gene that enables rapid transmission from fleas to humans (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Spyrou’s group convincingly traces the origin of <em>Y. pestis</em> strains involved in Europe’s Black Death to Central Asia, says evolutionary biologist Nils Stenseth of the University of Oslo, who did not participate in the study. He regards the new findings as consistent with a scenario in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubonic-plague-was-serial-visitor-european-middle-ages">periods of warm weather in Central Asia triggered repeated plague outbreaks</a> in Europe starting in the 1300s (<em>SN: 2/23/15</em>). Troops, travelers and merchants moving along <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2101940118">trade routes from Asia kept bringing the plague into Europe</a>, Stenseth suspects.</p>



<p>While the newly identified <em>Y. pestis</em> strain appears to be an ancestor of later European strains, clear-cut origins of the Black Death — and other pandemics, including COVID-19 — are notoriously hard to pin down, says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.</p>



<p>For instance, it will be challenging to determine whether the ancient <em>Y. pestis</em> strain from Central Asia existed even earlier across a broad swath of the continent, he says. If so, then a precursor strain of the Black Death may have arisen prior to 1338 in an as-yet-undetermined part of Asia. Temptations to translate ancient DNA findings into a story of the Black Death’s precise place and time of origin “need to be tempered,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butterfly-wing-tail-loss-break-birds-escape">Butterflies may lose their ‘tails’ like lizards</a></h4>

              
                <p>On some butterfly wings, “tails” may be more than just elegant adornments. They’re survival tools too, a study suggests.</p>



<p>The tails seem to attract the attention of attacking birds, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.0562">keeping them away from a butterfly’s more vital body parts</a>, researchers report May 25 in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. The finding could help explain why wing tails have independently evolved multiple times across different moth and butterfly groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Ariane Chotard of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris studies the wings of swallowtail butterflies, which make up the hundreds of species in the family Papilionidae.&nbsp;“A lot of these butterflies display tails,” Chotard says. “And we don&#8217;t really know why.”</p>





<p>Some butterfly species with false head or eyespot patterns on their wings are known to receive more attacks from predators in those regions. And Chotard and her colleagues wondered if tails were also a target.</p>



<p>So in the summer of 2020, the researchers collected 138 sail swallowtail butterflies (<a><em>Iphiclides podalirius</em></a>) from the wild in Ariege, France. Sail swallowtails — found throughout Eurasia — sport two, conspicuous black tails on hind wings with some blue and orange spotting, contrasting greatly with the rest of the insects’ yellow, striped coloration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the collected swallowtails, 65, or 41 percent, had damaged wings, all of which had at least one tail damaged. When all 130 wings in this group of damaged butterflies were counted, more than 82 percent of the wings had damaged tails, suggesting that predators may be targeting the spindly parts.</p>



<p>To test that idea, the team kept wild-caught songbirds called great tits (<em>Parus major</em>) in cages. The researchers then showed the birds dummy butterflies made from gluing real swallowtail wings to a fake body made of small pieces of black cardboard, and filmed the birds’ attacks on the faux insects.</p>



<p>Forty-three out of 59 beak strikes, or nearly 73 percent, were on the hind wings. Twenty-three, or 39 percent, of the strikes touched both a tail and colored areas on the upper part of a hind wing simultaneously, more than any other body area on the dummies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Butterfly &#039;tails&#039; may help the insects escape hungry birds | Science News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sshOdQv5ypI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>A captive great tit (<em>Parus major</em>) attacks the hind wings and “tails” of a dummy made with real wings from a sail swallowtail butterfly (<em>Iphiclides podalirius</em>). A new study suggests that the tails deflect attacks away from key body parts to brittle extensions that easily tear off, allowing the insect to flee.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chotard and her colleagues also measured how much force was needed to tear various sections of the swallowtail wing. They found that the vein of the hind wing tail was the most fragile part of the wing and is probably the location most apt to break off in a hungry bird’s beak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together, the findings suggest that swallowtail tails deflect attacks away from the butterfly’s vulnerable body to brittle extensions that easily tear off, allowing the insect to escape, the researchers say. This may be similar to the strategy some lizards use when sacrificing their detachable tails to hungry predators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear if there are any costs to losing one or two tails, Chotard says. “You survived, you escaped from a predator, but maybe there&#8217;s a trade-off and maybe your flight will be [slower].”</p>



<p>Some moth tails can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fooled-you-whirling-tails-luna-moths-deflect-bat-attacks">deflect the attacks of echolocating bats</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 2/16/15</em>). “Now we have evidence that butterfly tails provide a similar benefit against visual predators,” says evolutionary biologist Juliette Rubin of the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Future work determining the survival benefits of the tails could be one next step, Rubin says. “It would be informative to see how live swallowtail butterflies — both with and without tails — fare against bird predators.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541674899">Bitch</a><br><em>Lucy Cooke</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>To Charles Darwin, nature had a certain order. And in that order, males always came out on top. They were the leaders, the innovators, the wooers and the doers.</p>



<p>“The males of almost all animals have stronger passions than the females,” Darwin wrote in 1871. “The female, on the other hand, with the rarest of exceptions, is less eager.” The founder of evolutionary theory posited that throughout the animal kingdom, males are active, females are passive, and that’s pretty much that. Females, in sum, are boring.</p>





<p>That’s poppycock, Lucy Cooke writes in her latest book, <em>Bitch</em>. This blinkered view of nature as a man’s world was conceived and promulgated by Victorian men who imposed their values and world view on animals, she says. Cooke, a documentary filmmaker and the author of <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/truth-about-animals-isnt-always-pretty">The Truth About Animals</a></em> and two children’s books (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 26</em>), has traveled the world and met scientists who are exposing the truth about the sexes. She takes readers on a wild ride as she observes the ridiculous mating rituals of sage grouse, searches for orca poop (to monitor sex hormones) and watches female lemurs boss around males.</p>



<p>Through such adventures, Cooke learns that females are anything but boring. “Female animals are just as promiscuous, competitive, aggressive, dominant and dynamic as males,” she writes.</p>



<p>That may not sound radical to today’s feminists, but in the field of evolutionary biology, such a pronouncement has long bordered on the heretical. Generations of biologists have focused on male behavior and physiology, on the assumption that females are little more than baby-making machines to be won over by the strongest, showiest males.</p>





<p>Historically, when females did something potentially interesting, like exercise leadership over their social groups, many scientists scratched their heads and chalked it up as an aberration. When behavior didn’t fit the mold, like female-dominant spotted hyenas or peaceable male pinyon jays, it was either ignored or shoehorned into existing theory. For instance, ornithologists posited that aggressive female pinyon jays must suffer “the avian equivalent of PMS,” Cooke writes. The reality is that pinyon jays have a complex social hierarchy that doesn’t include the “alpha male” that scientists had expected. In recent years, scientists (many, but not all of them, female themselves) have begun to challenge Darwinian dogma about the sexes and submit it to rigorous testing.</p>



<p>Cooke draws on this recent science to systematically take down myths about females. She begins by asking what biological sex actually is — what makes a male a male, and a female a female — and shows that it’s far less black-and-white than we’ve been led to believe. Take the case of the European mole, in which the female sports gonads called ovotestes that produce eggs during the short breeding season, and testosterone the rest of the time. As a result, the female’s genitalia look just like the male’s, with a penislike clitoris and a vagina that vanishes after the breeding season.</p>



<p>The mole is just one example of sexual ambiguity among many that Cooke outlines. As the science of recent decades has revealed, even the genetics of sex is far more complicated than having either XX or XY chromosomes (which themselves are just one of many genetic systems for determining sex across the animal kingdom). In humans, males and females have the same set of about 60 sex-determining genes, which can create either testes or ovaries. Because of shared biology, the sexes are far more alike than they are different, and they exist in more of a continuum of bodies and behaviors than many people may be comfortable with.</p>



<p>Cooke also takes on many other ways scientists have misread sexual dynamics over the years, such as the myth that males benefit evolutionarily from promiscuity and females from monogamy. She addresses misconceptions about sexual cannibalism and animal genitals, complete with silicone replicas of animal vaginas. And she challenges ideas about the maternal instinct. As Cooke points out, males and females share the same neural circuitry, leading to fascinating experiments that stimulate certain nerve cells to flip male mice from infanticidal to doting dads.</p>



<p>In short, Cooke demolishes much of what you probably learned about the sexes in biology class. This may be disconcerting, even confronting for those who feel comfortable in the warm embrace of Darwinian order. But it’s also exciting, and fascinating, and very well might change the way you see the world. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history/">Published Peer Review History at PLOS: Observations from the past three years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">Three years ago</a> PLOS implemented our version of open peer review, which we named with our typical scrupulous precision and total disregard for word count: <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/">Published Peer Review History</a>. Since then, the PLOS journals have together published over 18,000 articles with accompanying peer review history. We&rsquo;re pleased to share more preliminary observations based on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#numbers">our first three years of data below</a>. But first, a bit of background&hellip;</p>



<h2>How published peer review works at PLOS</h2>



<p>Open peer review can mean many different things. The main unifying feature is an element of openness somewhere in the peer review process, which can range from public comments on all submissions, to an open decision letter after acceptance. PLOS&rsquo; version of open peer review is simple, flexible and modular, dictated by the choices reviewers and authors make during the peer review and publication process.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals default to anonymous peer review. Reviewers have the option to sign their peer reviews if they wish to do so, and are advised of the potential for the review to be published. After an article has been accepted for publication, authors can opt-in to publish the Peer Review History, which includes the key documents from the peer review assessment:</p>



<ul><li>Editor decision letters</li><li>Peer reviews (with reviewers&rsquo; signatures, if applicable)</li><li>Authors&rsquo; responses to reviews</li></ul>



<p>The result is four possible gradations of openness in peer review.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="862" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1024x862.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20442" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-300x253.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-768x647.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1536x1293.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-2048x1725.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It is very important, we think, to note that the benefits of Published Peer Review History are by no means predicated on reviewers signing their reviews. While reviewers have the opportunity to claim credit if they so choose, the value to the wider scholarly community stems from the availability of their comments. We want to make this absolutely clear because, too often, critique of open peer review can focus on signing, missing the more vital aspect of constructive feedback.</p>



<p>PLOS Peer Review History is organized, time stamped, and machine readable, with the goal of enabling future meta-research. Each element of the history package has a sub-DOI and is tagged and indexed, making it easy to discover and cite, even if you&rsquo;re not reading it on one of the PLOS journal websites. It&rsquo;s also included in <a href="https://plos.org/text-and-data-mining/">AllofPLOS</a> for easier mining and analysis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="717" height="672" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/2022-06-07-14_33_20-Peer-review-and-preprint-policies-are-unclear-at-most-major-journals-_-PLOS-ONE.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20457" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/2022-06-07-14_33_20-Peer-review-and-preprint-policies-are-unclear-at-most-major-journals-_-PLOS-ONE.png 717w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/2022-06-07-14_33_20-Peer-review-and-preprint-policies-are-unclear-at-most-major-journals-_-PLOS-ONE-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></figure>



<h2>What makes PLOS Published Peer Review History different?</h2>



<p>You might be thinking <em>&lsquo;so what?&rsquo; </em>When PLOS introduced Peer Review History in 2019, various versions of public review had been available in the scholarly marketplace for a decade or more&mdash;at BMJ, EMBO Press, and <em>eLife</em>, just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All implementations of open review&mdash;signed and unsigned, posted as public commentary or published after the fact&mdash;serve to improve transparency and accountability, to demonstrate the quality of peer review and reinforce the validity of the published research, to acknowledge and honor peer reviewers&rsquo; contributions to the literature, and to enrich the scientific record with more expertise.</p>



<p>Our own particular version emphasizes flexibility and author control. After acceptance, PLOS authors must click a check box and <strong>opt-in</strong> to have their peer reviews published. As a large international publisher with a very broad scope, our goal with Published Peer Review History, as with Open Science in general, has been to bring openness within easy reach for all, while at the same time respecting researchers&rsquo; different values and requirements across disciplines, career stages, and regions. Opt-in works at scale for all the researchers across our portfolio.</p>



<p>The opt-in model is somewhat unusual, as compared to the more established pioneers in Open Peer Review, many of whom mandate openness (e.g. BMJ) or use an opt-out model (e.g. EMBO Press). PLOS&rsquo; opt-in approach results in lower uptake: on average, 40% of PLOS authors opt-in, as compared to the reported greater than 95% of EMBO Press authors who <a href="https://www.embo.org/features/a-decade-of-transparent-peer-review/">don&rsquo;t opt-out</a>. At the same time, PLOS&rsquo; large publication volume means that, even with a lower rate of uptake, the journals contribute significantly to the total number of articles with public peer reviews available across the published literature. (PLOS journals together published nearly 18,000 articles in 2020. For comparison, the same year <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/6771f3db/annual-report-2020-in-review"><em>eLife </em>published</a> 1,870 articles, <em>BMJ Open</em> published 3,610<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#asterisk">*</a>, and the five EMBO Press journals published 1,063*.) This absolute scale is helpful with normalizing practices and behaviors.</p>



<p>The opt-in model, in combination with our size and breadth of scope also produces a wealth of data, which we hope can help us to better understand the communities we serve, and inform our future direction with regard to published review.</p>



<h2 id="numbers">Published Peer Review History by the numbers, May 2019 to May 2022</h2>



<p>Since PLOS Published Peer Review History was first introduced, opt-in has remained a remarkably consistent 40%, year after year.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#asterisk">**</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year of acceptance</strong></td><td><strong>Opt-ins</strong></td><td><strong>Total eligible articles&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Percent opt-in</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>1,300</td><td>3,383</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>7,107</td><td>17,775</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>7,585</td><td>18,923</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>2,387</td><td>5,983</td><td>40%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; two highly selective journals, <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, also saw the highest rates of Published Peer Review opt-in&nbsp; among accepted authors, followed by two of the four community journals, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, and <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.<em> PLOS ONE</em> and the remaining two community journals,<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> and <em>PLOS NTDs</em> saw the lowest opt-in rates. <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s broad scope and high publication volume accounts for its lower average opt-in rate. Lower adoption among <em>Pathogens </em>and <em>NTDs </em>authors as compared with the other community journals may likewise relate to subject-specific norms and preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal</strong></td><td><strong>Opt-ins</strong></td><td><strong>Total eligible articles</strong></td><td><strong>Percent opt-in</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td>294</td><td>463</td><td>63%</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>425</td><td>688</td><td>62%</td></tr><tr><td>Computational&nbsp; Biology</td><td>1,038</td><td>1,883</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>Genetics</td><td>561</td><td>1,129</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>532</td><td>1,369</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td>ONE</td><td>14,911</td><td>38,918</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>NTDs</td><td>618</td><td>1,614</td><td>38%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>When <em>PLOS ONE </em>opt-in rates are broken out by discipline a pattern of subject-area preference becomes apparent. In fields with more than 100 published articles in the time period, opt-ins were strongest in computational biology, public health fields (women&rsquo;s health, public health, mental health), research on caregiving (healthcare, nursing), and specific medical disciplines (emergency medicine, neurology, obstetrics, urology, anesthesiology, pulmonology, clinical trials, etc.). Lower opt-in rates were observed in engineering, math, chemistry, materials science, earth science, geography and various branches of biology (molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, biotechnology), as well as in fields where medical and bench science intersect, such as basic cancer research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While clinical in their potential translational applications, <em>PLOS NTDs </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> frequently publish research on the molecular and cellular aspects of disease, and therefore might expect commensurately lower opt-in rates.</p>



<p>However, <em>PLOS Biology</em> also publishes in the biological fields where <em>PLOS ONE</em> opt-in tends to be weaker&mdash;yet it has the highest opt-in rate of any journal. Why is that? Perhaps, the journal&rsquo;s hands-on, personalized editorial and peer review process influences author opt-in. This would be a fascinating area for investigation.</p>



<h2>Observations on peer review signing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>PLOS has always allowed reviewers to sign their reviews if they choose, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the system updates introduced at the same time as Published Peer Review History (May 22, 2019) that we gained the ability to easily and systematically measure signing. Since then, we&rsquo;ve received 49,555 signed reviews (17.81% of all completed reviews). Those signed reviews were performed by 40,276 individuals (about 19.26% of active reviewers) and were linked to 32,869 manuscripts (35.55% of manuscripts considered).</p>



<p>Overall, reviewers&rsquo; decisions to sign reviews are distributed across journals and subject areas in a pattern similar to authors&rsquo; decisions to publish reviews. Signing rates were higher in public health, medicine, and related disciplines and less common in some branches of biology, as well as the physical sciences, earth sciences, engineering and math. Of articles with published peer reviews, 44% also had at least one signed review.</p>



<p>The clearest determinant of signed review was the reviewer&rsquo;s recommendation (although reviewer recommendations are visible only to Academic Editors and the journal office). Signing rates were highest among reviewers recommending accept or revise decisions. For that reason, rates of signing on published articles (42.19%) are higher than for manuscripts generally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal Name</strong></td><td><strong>Accept</strong></td><td><strong>Minor</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Revision</strong></td><td><strong>Major Revision</strong></td><td><strong>Reject</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td>19.74%</td><td>17.32%</td><td>11.59%</td><td>3.62%</td></tr><tr><td>Computational Biology</td><td>16.49%</td><td>16.15%</td><td>12.30%</td><td>4.59%</td></tr><tr><td>Genetics</td><td>12.15%</td><td>11.23%</td><td>7.60%</td><td>3.19%</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>35.03%</td><td>35.23%</td><td>31.99%</td><td>25.50%</td></tr><tr><td>NTDs</td><td>18.29%</td><td>19.20%</td><td>13.01%</td><td>5.30%</td></tr><tr><td>ONE</td><td>17.42%</td><td>17.48%</td><td>14.38%</td><td>7.85%</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>8.40%</td><td>7.89%</td><td>5.56%</td><td>1.71%&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Listening to authors and reviewers</h2>



<p>At PLOS we have formal and informal conversations with our stakeholders and community members; we gather feedback in person and by email; we conduct surveys and structured interviews; we do meta-research; we observe.</p>



<p>Three years ago, PLOS chose an opt-in over an opt-out model of published review for a number of reasons. Our in-house editorial teams and editorial boards alike were committed to open peer review, and committed to ensuring it was only received positively by giving authors a real choice in the decision. More practically, PLOS serves more than 200 communities of research, each with their own needs and priorities. Open peer review is too important a development to force on those who have concerns and need to see a community embrace it first. Therefore, we chose to make openness easy. By leaving the door open, hopefully we can learn more from those who choose to walk through. And, it&rsquo;s our hope that information like this can help inform the next round of discussions, innovations, and policies, leading ultimately to a more efficient, equitable, and trustworthy peer review system.</p>

                <p>A solitary celestial object — more massive than the sun, yet far smaller — is wandering the galaxy a few thousand light-years from Earth. It might be the first isolated stellar-mass black hole to be detected in the Milky Way. Or it might be one of the heaviest neutron stars known.</p>



<p>The interstellar wanderer first revealed itself in 2011, when its gravity briefly magnified the light from a more distant star. But at the time, its true nature eluded researchers. Now, two teams of astronomers have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images to unmask the traveler’s identity — and have come to somewhat different conclusions.</p>





<p>The mysterious rogue is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13296">a black hole roughly seven times as massive as the sun</a>, one team reports in a study in press in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01903">Or it’s a bit lighter</a> — a mere two to four times the weight of our nearest star — and therefore either an unusually lightweight black hole or a curiously hefty neutron star, another group reports in a study in press in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes form when massive stars — at least several times the heft of the sun — collapse under their own gravity at the end of their lives. Astronomers believe that about a billion neutron stars and roughly 100 million stellar-mass black holes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/we-share-milky-way-100-million-black-holes">lurk in our galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/17</em>). But these objects aren’t easy to spot. Neutron stars are so tiny — about the size of a city — that they don’t produce much light. And black holes emit no light at all.</p>



<p>To detect these kinds of objects, scientists typically observe how they affect their surroundings. “The only way that we can find them is if they influence something else,” says Kailash Sahu, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</p>



<p>To date, scientists have detected nearly two dozen stellar-mass black holes. (These relatively lightweight black holes are puny compared to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">supermassive behemoths that sit at the center of most galaxies</a>, including our own (<em>SN: 1/18/21</em>).) To do so, researchers have watched how these objects interact with their nearby celestial neighbors. When a black hole is locked in a gravitational dance with another star, it rips away matter from its partner. As that material falls onto the black hole, it emits X-rays, which telescopes orbiting the Earth can detect.</p>



<p>But finding black holes in binary systems doesn’t paint a whole picture of the black hole kingdom. Because these objects are continually accreting matter, it’s challenging to determine the mass at which they formed. And since birthweight is a key characteristic of a black hole, that’s a significant drawback to looking at binary systems, Sahu says. “If we want to understand the properties of black holes, it’s best to find isolated ones.”</p>



<p>For more than a decade, researchers have been scanning the heavens for solitary black holes. The searches have hinged on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of general relativity</a>, which states that any massive object, even an unseen one, bends space in its vicinity (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). That bending causes light from background stars to be magnified and distorted, a phenomenon known as gravitational microlensing. By measuring changes in the brightness and apparent position of stars, scientists can calculate the mass of the intervening object that’s acting like a lens — a technique that’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fewer-big-rogue-planets-roam-galaxy-recount-shows">rounded up a few extrasolar planets</a> as well (<em>SN: 7/24/17</em>).</p>



<p>In 2011, researchers announced that they had spotted a star <a href="http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/ews/2011/blg-0462.html">that suddenly had gotten more than 200 times brighter</a>. But those initial observations, made using telescopes in Chile and New Zealand, were unable to reveal whether the star’s apparent position was also changing. And that information is key to pinning down the mass of the intervening object. If it’s a heavyweight, its gravity would distort space so much that the star would appear to move. But even a “big” shift in the star’s position would have been extremely small and hard to detect. And unfortunately fine details in astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-ice-dome-world-clearest-views-night-sky-milky-way">tend to be blurred out</a> because of our planet’s turbulent atmosphere (<em>SN: 7/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>To circumvent this Earthly limitation, two independent teams of astronomers turned to the Hubble Space Telescope. This observatory can capture extremely detailed images since it orbits above most of Earth’s atmosphere. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Both groups found that the star’s location shifted over the course of several years. One of the teams, led by Sahu, concluded that the star’s apparent dance was caused by an object roughly seven times as hefty as the sun. A star of that mass would have been blazingly bright in the Hubble images, but the researchers saw nothing. Something that heavy and dark must be a black hole, the team reports.</p>



<p>But another group of researchers, led by astronomer Casey Lam at the University of California, Berkeley, found different results. Lam and her colleagues calculated that the mass of the lensing object was lower, only about two to four times the mass of the sun. It could therefore be either a neutron star or a black hole, the group concluded.</p>



<p>Whatever it is, it’s an intriguing object, says astronomer Jessica Lu, a member of Lam’s team also at UC Berkeley. That’s because it’s a bit of an oddball in terms of mass. It’s either one of the most massive neutron stars discovered to date, or it’s one of the least massive black holes known, Lu says. “It falls within this strange region we call the mass gap.”</p>



<p>Despite the disagreement, these are thrilling results, says Will M. Farr, an astrophysicist at Stony Brook University in New York not involved in either study. “To be working at the instrumental limit at the real forefront of what’s measurable is very exciting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supersonic-sonic-booms-acoustics-cities">Why even small sonic booms are more annoying in cities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sonic booms can be particularly annoying in cities, where tall buildings and narrow streets boost noise levels and cause the noise to linger, new research shows.</p>



<p>Planes traveling faster than the speed of sound create a shock wave in the form of a short-lived boom. These intense sonic booms have harmed people’s hearing, shattered windows and caused other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/supersonic-transports-come-closer-reality">physical damage to homes and buildings</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/64</em>). NASA is developing aircraft with more subdued booms, but the sound won’t go away entirely. Even modest booms might be a problem in cities.</p>





<p>“The noise levels induced by these lower-level booms are still expected to be significant,” says study coauthor Didier Dragna of the École Centre de Lyon in France.</p>



<p>Dragna and colleagues simulated booms from supersonic planes passing over buildings. For a building standing out in the open, boom-induced noise lasted about a tenth of a second. Sound reflecting from the building boosts noise levels slightly for the side facing an approaching plane and reduces it on the side facing away.</p>



<p>For packed cityscapes, however, noise reflected from buildings following a sonic boom fills in the regions between buildings and <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/10.0010452?dm_i=3Q4Y%2C1G8HT%2C68V2ZI%2C5B8ET%2C1">resonates like the echoes of a hand clap in an empty hall</a>, the team reports in the June <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>. Their simulations showed that even after the initial boom has passed the noise persists for several seconds, creating what Dragna describes as a thunderous, window- and door-rattling rumble.<br><br>Civilian aircraft in the United States are generally prohibited from traveling over land at supersonic speeds. But NASA will begin test flights of its “quiet” <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/Quesst/">X-59 supersonic aircraft</a> over cities in 2024. “It is important to predict what will be the noise levels and the annoyance due to these supersonic planes,” Dragna says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/13/showing-off-your-status-and-wealth-makes-you-seem-less-co-operative/">Showing off your status and wealth makes you seem less co-operative</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>People who can afford luxury goods tend to buy them, and to show them off.  “This is unsurprising given the myriad social benefits associated with being perceived as well-off and high status,” note the authors of a<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53095-001"> new study</a>, led by Shalena Srna at the University of Michigan. But in some situations, there might be downsides to conspicuous consumption. After all, as the team writes: “it conveys a boastful self-interest, which is incompatible, in people’s minds, with pro-sociality”.</p>



<p>So what happens when — as is so often the case — it’s in our interests to work with others? Given the opportunity, do we show off, and signal high status — or do we choose to be more modest? The team’s findings, reported in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em>, contain some important insights.</p>



<span id="more-46394"></span>



<p>In an initial online study, the team adopted a version of the widely used <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/">Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD)</a> game. Participants were told that they’d have to decide whether to co-operate with a partner to do half each of 60 units of work (solving captchas) — or to defect. If both partners chose to defect, they’d have to complete 60 units of work each. If only one did, the co-operator would have to do 90 units, while the defector wouldn’t do any.</p>



<p>Before they made their decision, they were shown an avatar that was purportedly made by their partner. They were informed that their partner had chosen the hairstyle, skin tone and clothing — and also whether to include a luxury logo on the clothing, or to opt for unbranded clothing. In fact, the partners were fictional and the avatars were created by the team. They generated one male and one female avatar (the gender was matched to the participant’s gender), which were identical, except that some wore a shirt featuring a Gucci, Louis Vuitton or Burberry logo, while the other had an unbranded shirt.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants elected to co-operate with partners whose avatars had unbranded clothing 57% of the time, but when the avatar sported a luxury logo, this figure dropped to 45%. A subsequent questionnaire revealed that the participants indeed perceived partners with logo-wearing avatars as trying harder to signal status and wealth (and indeed to have more status and wealth) — and expected them to be less co-operative, and more self-interested.</p>



<p>A second study, in which participants could first choose the design of their own avatar, found that those who chose branded rather than unbranded clothing themselves were still less likely to choose to co-operate with partners with brand-boasting vs logo-free avatars.</p>



<p>The team then switched to a more real-world setting — social network profiles. They found further support for these initial results: participants who saw (fictional) profiles that used status-signalling posts and hashtags were less likely to recommend that individual for admittance into a group that prioritized co-operation, selflessness and generosity.</p>



<p>The work also produced another key result: when it was useful to appear co-operative  — when a group that participants wanted to join stressed its desire for co-operative, prosocial people — the participants tended to become strategically modest; when choosing from prewritten social media posts that described various activities, they were less likely to go for posts that signalled status. (It’s worth noting, however, that when the goal was to be perceived as <em>competitive</em>, status-signalling was beneficial.)</p>



<p>This last finding suggests that we’re aware that status-signalling can be counter-productive, and understand when to avoid it. However, we surely all know people who get this wrong. Many people show off their status to &#8220;friends&#8221; through posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the team notes. “Such posts may be beneficial for communicating one’s wealth and status, but as we have shown, they can also have negative effects.” In 2019, Stephen M. Garcia and colleagues even found that people <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550618783712">believe signalling status will make them more attractive potential friends — but when seeking friends, we in fact prefer people who are more modest</a>. So while we might have some implicit understanding of when not to signal status, it’s clearly not perfect.</p>



<p>Garcia’s research was in the US and the new work was on participants mostly from Western countries. Clearly, non-WEIRD work in this area is needed.  But this new paper certainly highlights a clear disadvantage of status signalling in Western contexts, and suggests that we should be more careful. There are all kinds of environments, including schools and workplaces, where this could clearly have implications for relationships. There’s an ongoing debate about the pros and cons of school uniforms, for example. In schools without uniforms, kids who choose to wear luxury brands might think that they’re benefitting from signalling high status — but if this makes the rest of the class view them as less co-operative and more self-interested, that’s a clear downside for everyone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">New Gaia data paint the most detailed picture yet of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>1.6 billion stars. 11.4 million galaxies. 158,000 asteroids.</p>



<p>One spacecraft.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s Gaia space observatory, which launched in 2013, has long surpassed its goal of charting more than a billion <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-missions-milky-way-map-pinpoints-locations-billion-plus-stars">stars in the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 10/15/16)</em>. On June 13, the mission extended that map into new dimensions, releasing more detailed measurements of hundreds of millions of stars, plus — for the first time — asteroids, galaxies and the dusty medium between stars.</p>





<p>“Suddenly you have a flood of data,” says Laurent Eyer, an astrophysicist at the University of Geneva who has worked on Gaia for years. For some topics in astronomy, the new results effectively replace all the observations that were taken before, Eyer says. “The data is better. It’s amazing.”</p>



<p>Data in the new survey, which were collected from 2014 to 2017, are already leading to some discoveries — including the presence of surprisingly massive&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">“starquakes”</a> on the surfaces of thousands of stars (<em>SN: 8/2/19</em>). But more than anything, the release is a new tool for astronomers, one that will aid their efforts to understand how stars, planets and entire galaxies form and evolve.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the long-standing puzzles the data could help solve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Asteroid mishmash</h4>



<p>The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is a mess of history. After the Earth and other planets formed, the rocky building blocks that were left over smashed into each other, leaving behind jumbled fragments. But if scientists know enough about individual asteroids, they can reconstruct when and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">where they came from</a> <em>(SN: 4/13/19)</em>. And that can provide a peek into the solar system’s earliest days.</p>

<p>Gaia’s massive new dataset may help solve this puzzle, says Federica Spoto, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. It includes data on the chemical makeup of over 60,000 asteroids — six times more than researchers had such details on before using other tools. That information can be essential for tracing asteroids back to their shattering origins.</p>



<p>“You can go back in time and try to understand all the formation and evolution of the solar system,” says Spoto, a Gaia collaborator.<strong> “</strong>That’s something huge that before Gaia we couldn’t even think about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asteroids aren’t just pieces of the past, though; they’re also dangerous. The new data could reveal asteroids that are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-asteroid-has-been-found-nearer-sun-than-venus">next to impossible to spot</a> from Earth because they orbit too close to the sun, says Thomas Burbine, a planetary scientist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., who is not involved with the mission <em>(SN: 2/15/20)</em>. Since these asteroids would have originally come from farther out (say, the asteroid belt), they can tell us about the rocks going past Earth that can potentially hit us. “We’ll know our neighborhood better,” Burbine says.</p>



<h4>Dating a star</h4>



<p>It is notoriously difficult to measure <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">the age of stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21)</em>. “It’s not uncommon to have uncertainty of more than a billion years,” says Alessandro Savino, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley who is not involved with Gaia. Unlike brightness or location, age is not directly visible. Astronomers have to rely on theories of how stars evolve to predict ages from what they can measure.</p>



<p>If past versions of the Gaia survey were like a photograph of stars, the new release is like shifting the photograph from black and white to color. It provides a deeper look at hundreds of millions of stars by measuring their temperature, gravity and chemistry. “You imagine the star as this point in space, but then they have so many properties,” Spoto says. “That’s what Gaia is giving you.”</p>



<p>Although these kinds of measurements are far from new, they have never been collected in the Milky Way on such a scale before. Those data could provide more insight into how stars evolve. “We can improve the resolution of our clocks,” Savino says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Milky Way snacks</h4>



<p>Though it may seem unchanging, the Milky Way is actually gorging on a steady diet of smaller galaxies —it’s even in the process of eating one right now. But for decades, predictions of when and how these cosmic mergers happen have been at odds with evidence from our galaxy, says Bertrand Goldman, an astrophysicist at the International Space University in Strasbourg, France, who is not involved in the Gaia data release. &nbsp;“That has been controversial for a long time,” Goldman says, “but I think that Gaia will certainly shed light.”</p>



<p>The key is to be able to pick apart <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-wave-gas-star-nursery-lurks-near-our-solar-system">different structures in the Milky Way</a> and see how old they are (<em>SN: 1/10/20)</em>. Gaia’s latest release helps in two ways: By mapping the chemistry of stars and by measuring their motion. Previous versions of the survey described how millions of stars were moving, but mostly in two dimensions. The new catalog quadruples the number of stars with full 3-D trajectories from 7 million to 33 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has implications beyond our neighborhood. Most of the mass in the universe is contained in galaxies like the Milky Way, so knowing how our own galaxy works goes a long way to understanding space on the largest scales. And the more scientists understand the parts of galaxies they can see, the more they can learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-milky-way-galaxy-central-bar-stars-slow-rotation">dark matter</a>, the mysterious substance that exerts gravity but doesn’t interact with light (<em>SN: 6/25/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Even as astronomers mine this latest dataset, they are already looking ahead to future treasure hunts. The next round is years off, but it is expected to enable the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, produce rare measurements of black holes and help astronomers clock how fast the universe is expanding. In part, this is because Gaia is designed to track the motion of objects in space, and that gets easier as more time passes. So Gaia’s observations can only get more powerful. “Like good wine, they age very, very well,” Savino says.</p>

To this day, publications written by ABCT members – including members in prominent leadership roles – are used by anti-SGM activists to justify their ongoing use of these damaging so-called “therapies.” ABCT deeply regrets behavior therapists’ role in the creation, study, and use of these practices, and recognizes and accepts responsibility for the ways in which both our actions and inactions have harmed SGM people. ABCT recognizes it is time for us to document our history and legacy and say that we are truly sorry.<span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span></blockquote><p><br />But documentation of this history and legacy is rather sketchy...

Barlow sent a forthcoming book chapter from his 2016 retrospective, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barlow-Neurotic-Paradox-Routledge-Library/dp/1138850799" target="_blank"><i>The Neurotic Paradox, Volume 1: Progress in Understanding and Treating Anxiety and Related Disorders</i></a>. A sort-of not-really apology appeared on p. 6-7:</p><blockquote>But it was also during this time [late 60s-early 70s] that I undertook what has come to be from my own personal point of view the most regrettable initiative in my clinical research career. Specifically ... I began treating and evaluating the effects of [covert sensitization]&nbsp; treatment in individuals with what came to be called paraphilias but what was then called sexual deviation (Barlow, 1974a). While our focus was mostly on pedophilia (e.g. Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969), the aggressive behavior of rapists (e.g. Abel, Barlow, Blanchard, &amp; Guild, 1977), and other paraphilias (e.g. Hayes, Brownell, &amp; Barlow, 1978), included in this series of studies were participants presenting with same-sex arousal patterns with consenting adults. (e.g., Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969). At that time homosexuality was considered a disorder in all systems of nosology and, under extreme pressures from society and the associated stigma, these individuals sought out treatment; so very few clinicians even gave it a second thought. But by the mid-1970s several individuals began questioning these treatment goals.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These practices were “embedded in the continually shifting landscape of cultural values and mores”<i> and</i> homosexuality wasn't de-pathologized until “later in the decade” of the 1970s [<i>it was actually <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/122341839/DSM-II-Homosexuality-Revision" target="_blank">1973</a></i>] <i>and</i> “most of the work was on paraphilias” [<i>but <b>many</b> papers were on attempted conversion of gay men and transgender women (who were called </i><i>male transsexuals)</i>]. Most importantly, Barlow did not acknowledge the harm inflicted on the recipients of his treatments. </p><p>Besides the bizarre <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/921523" target="_blank">exorcism in a transsexual article</a>, three more papers described covert modeling procedures and a “therapeutic package” to change the gender identity of transgender youth and young women (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/490883" target="_blank">Barlow et al., 1973</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/492176" target="_blank">1979</a>; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-26335-001" target="_blank">Hay et al., 1981</a>).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-nasal-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-fluenz-tetra-flumist">Nasal vaccines for COVID-19 offer hope and face hurdles</a></h4>

              
                <p>A few weeks ago, I was obsessed with my nose and throat. I was on a trip to Seattle to speak at a small, masks-required virology meeting about being a journalist during a pandemic. I went to graduate school there, so I was thrilled to see old friends and colleagues. But the irony that I was risking getting infected amid rising COVID-19 cases to get on a plane to talk with virologists about the pandemic didn’t escape me. I spent the whole week on high alert for the slightest hint of a sore throat or a runny nose. Despite masking, I worried that I’d get sick and be stuck thousands of miles from home or that I’d unknowingly pass the virus on to someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this story has a happy ending. I didn’t catch the coronavirus. None of my friends or former colleagues got sick. Although I didn’t escape completely unscathed; I did come down with a mystery, non-COVID cold that I suspect I caught from a friend’s baby. Still, the experience made me wonder ​​— what if I didn’t have to worry so much about becoming a disease spreader because there were COVID-19 vaccines that helped my body control the virus in my nose?</p>

<p>Researchers are working on vaccines that would hopefully do just that. You squirt these vaccines into your nostrils, rather than inject them into your arm muscle like the current COVID-19 shots. Sprayed up the nose, the vaccines teach our immune systems to fortify our nostrils against coronavirus, perhaps meaning we get less sick or making us less likely to transmit the virus to other people.</p>



<p>Jabs in the arm may not be as good at preventing transmission as nasal spray vaccines, some scientists suspect. The shots <em>are</em> better at building defenses that circulate in the blood or fluid that surrounds cells, which makes them great at protecting the lungs. And they have done what they are designed to do: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">curb severe disease and death</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">Booster doses help fend off severe COVID-19</a> better than the first two shots — especially for older people, studies show (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>). But even with death rates down, that doesn’t mean our fight with coronavirus is over. Waning immune defenses combined with slippery versions of the coronavirus that can evade parts of our immune systems leave vaccinated people susceptible to infection. So we still need additional protection.</p>



<p>A panel of experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet later this month to weigh in on whether we might need a vaccine update for the fall. Updated shots may indeed be on the horizon: Preliminary data from vaccine developer Moderna show that its latest vaccine, which includes both omicron and the original virus, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Announces-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Superior-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron/default.aspx">boosts the immune response against omicron</a> as well as other variants such as delta, the company announced on June 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on June 7 the FDA advisory committee recommended that the agency authorize a new COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. This one, developed by the company Novavax, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">is based on a traditional method</a> —&nbsp; showing the immune system purified viral proteins — which may be appealing to still unvaccinated people who are hesitant about the novel mRNA technology in Moderna’s and Pfizer’s shots (<em>SN: 1/28/21</em>). Other experts are working on vaccines that might hold up against an onslaught of variants, both present and future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then, there are the nasal spray vaccines. They could not only protect our lungs, but also the mucous membranes that line the upper regions of our respiratory tracts such as the nose. Such sprays would give us not only a motion detector ready to sense an intruder in an inner room of a building but also an alarm system that goes off the second the front door opens.</p>



<p>That type of alarm system isn’t a brand-new tool. For example, there is a nasal influenza vaccine available in the United States called FluMist, which teaches the body to recognize four different strains. And there is a similar one in Europe called Fluenz Tetra. Each flu virus included in these vaccines is weakened but can replicate in the body. The attenuated viruses grow best at<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm"> cooler temperatures found in our noses</a>, not the warm environment of our lungs, a barrier that keeps them from making it to the lungs and causing influenza. But by taking off in the nose, replicating viruses kick off an immune response, so our bodies learn to set up reinforcements there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2352-3964%2822%2900025-1"> roughly a dozen potential COVID-19 nasal vaccines have made it to clinical trials</a> around the world. One developed by a company called Altimmune was abandoned after <a href="https://ir.altimmune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/altimmune-announces-update-adcovidtm-phase-1-clinical-trial">early results showed the vaccine didn’t prompt a good immune response</a> in healthy participants. Others have<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.16.492138v1"> shown promise when tested in animals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prospect of having nasal vaccines that may be able to curb transmission better than existing shots is understandably exciting. But these types of vaccines still have a way to go before hitting local pharmacies or doctors’ offices.</p>



<p>First, it’s crucial for the nasal vaccines to strike the right balance. Their sprays must be strong enough to provoke our immune systems, but still weak enough that there aren’t unwelcome symptoms or side effects. It’s also of course important to ensure the safety of vaccine candidates that include live, weakened viruses.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Some nasal vaccine candidates are similar to the influenza vaccine and include live, weakened viruses. Most of these viruses aren’t the coronavirus itself, but rather harmless-to-human viruses that sport one coronavirus protein for our bodies to recognize. Others may not need a virus to grow in the body to work. One team is developing a nasal spray that includes only the coronavirus spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells. That spike spray <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/nasal-approach-to-covid-vaccination-gains-traction-at-yale/">could serve as a boost for people who received one of the mRNA vaccines</a>, coaxing important immune cells to come live in the nose and other parts of the respiratory tract. Once there, those immune cells would be poised to kick into high gear if the coronavirus invades.</p>



<p>Second, nasal sprays face the same problem as current COVID-19 vaccines. What happens when the virus evolves in ways that help it hide from our immune system? We’ve already seen the consequences of that thanks to the delta and omicron waves that raced around the globe. And from 2016 to 2018, FluMist <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm">stumbled in the face of tweaked versions of some influenza viruses</a>. Experts recommended that people get a different type of flu shot in those seasons. Just as researchers are considering updating existing COVID-19 shots to better mimic the viral variants currently wreaking havoc, nasal vaccines may also need regular updating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had a choice, I would never catch coronavirus. But in the grand scheme of things, it’d be nice if a spray up my nose could drastically lower my chances of passing it on to someone else if I did get infected. If they make it to consumers, the nasal vaccines could make future COVID-19 waves much smaller than they are now. And after more than two years of navigating ever-larger waves, wouldn’t that be nice?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-smoke-ring-light">Scientists created ‘smoke rings’ of light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Smoke rings are being seen in a new light.</p>



<p>Doughnut-shaped structures called vortex rings are sometimes seen swirling through fluids. Smokers can form them with their mouths, volcanoes can spit them out during eruptions and dolphins can blow them as bubble rings. Now, scientists can create the rings with light.</p>



<p>A standard vortex is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-gets-tied-knots">an eddy</a> in a liquid or gas, like a whirlpool (<em>SN: 3/5/13</em>). Imagine taking that swirling eddy, stretching it out and bending it into a circle and attaching it end-to-end. That’s a vortex ring. These rings travel through the liquid or gas as they swirl — for example, smoke rings float through the air away from a smoker’s head. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01013-y">the new vortex rings</a>, described June 2 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>, light behaves similarly: The flow of energy swirls as the ring moves.</p>





<p>Optics researcher Qiwen Zhan and colleagues started from a vortex tube, a hurricanelike structure they already knew how to create using laser light. The team used optics techniques to bend the tube into a circular shape, creating a vortex ring.</p>



<p>The light rings aren’t that different from smoke or bubble rings, says Zhan, of the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. “That’s kind of cool.”</p>



<p>Zhan is interested in seeing whether scientists could create vortex rings out of electric current or a magnetic field. And further study of the light rings might help scientists better understand how topology — the geometry of doughnuts, knots and similar shapes — affects light and how it interacts with matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/10/heres-how-our-visual-system-decides-how-cute-a-baby-is/">Here’s how our visual system decides how cute a baby is</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What makes one baby seem cuter than another (parental bias aside)? Large and round eyes, a small nose and mouth, a high and protruding forehead, chubby cheeks and soft skin have all been associated with cuteness, not just in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/07/07/men-are-as-motivated-by-cute-baby-faces-as-women/">babies</a> but <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/why-do-we-find-puppies-so-cute/">puppies</a>, kittens, dolls and Japanese anime and manga characters. But now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53880-001">new paper</a> in <em>Emotion</em> suggests that another factor has an impact: the &#8220;spatial frequency&#8221; of what we see.</p>



<span id="more-46387"></span>



<p>Our visual system uses spatial frequencies to rapidly process variations in relative light and dark in an image. &#8220;Low&#8221; spatial frequencies convey coarse information — the location of a dark eye against pale skin, for example. &#8220;High&#8221; spatial frequencies convey fine detail such as edges. But other frequencies are important, too; research shows that medium spatial frequencies are most useful for recognising faces, for example. Spatial frequency (SF) processing is the basic mechanism for visual analysis, write Mengni Zhou at Okayama University, Japan, and colleagues. “Therefore understanding the effect of SFs is essential for a better understanding of the processing of cuteness,” they argue.</p>



<p>The team first asked 32 participants from Okayama University to rate the cuteness of 40 black and white images of infant faces (aged up to one). Using these ratings, the researchers assembled a set of four faces from the bottom cuteness quartile. They did the same for the second, third and top cuteness quartiles, generating a total of four sets. (Fourteen of the infants were identified as ‘Caucasian’, one ‘Asian’ and one ‘Indian’).  The team then manipulated the spatial frequency of each of the faces, generating four filtered versions, ranging from low to high SF. </p>

From <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53880-001">Zhou et al (2022)</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the next stage of the study, a fresh group of 30 students from the same university used a 7-point scale to rate each of these filtered images, as well as the originals, for cuteness.</p>



<p>As the team expected, the unfiltered original photos got higher cuteness ratings than their filtered versions. But within the filtered versions, some were seen as cuter than others.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that faces with the lowest SF always got the lowest cuteness ratings. When the team talked to participants after the study, some said that these faces looked “eyeless with dark empty orbits.” These versions were seen as “distasteful, even scary,” the team writes</p>



<p>In comparison with low SF, faces with medium and high SF got relatively high cuteness ratings. This is probably because the facial features associated with cuteness (small nose, chubby cheeks, etc) are more obvious at relatively high spatial frequencies, the team notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when the cuteness of the <em>unfiltered</em> faces was high, the medium SF versions got better ratings than the high SF versions. This might relate to earlier findings that medium SFs are most important for facial recognition, the team suggests. &#8220;One possible explanation is that the processing mechanism of positive cuteness&#8221; — i.e. finding a baby’s face definitely cute — &#8220;is strongly related to face identity,&#8221; they suggest.</p>



<p>“In the future, eye tracking and neuroimaging studies are also necessary to verify these results and explore the mechanism of cuteness processing in depth,” they add. For now, though, the team argues that this work provides “direct evidence that the perception of infant facial cuteness is affected by SF information”.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how this finding might have any real world impacts — except perhaps in the production of cartoon, manga and anime characters. My own kids enjoy manga and anime. I — no doubt like the participants in this study, who were all at a Japanese university — am well aware of <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/cutest-anime-characters/anna-lindwasser">anime caricatures of cuteness</a>. But perhaps SF could be manipulated to influence our perceptions of a character’s cuteness, too. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">Samples of the asteroid Ryugu are scientists’ purest pieces of the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Samples of the asteroid Ryugu are the most pristine pieces of the solar system that scientists have in their possession.</p>



<p>A new analysis of Ryugu material confirms the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-texture-instant-coffee">porous rubble-pile asteroid</a> is rich in carbon and finds it is extraordinarily primitive (<em>SN: 3/16/20</em>). It is also a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7850">member of a rare class of space rocks</a> known as CI-type, researchers report online June 9 in <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their analysis looked at material from the Japanese mission Hayabusa2, which collected 5.4 grams of dust and small rocks from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hayabusa2-touchdown-asteroid-ryugu-second-sample-subsurface">multiple locations</a> on the surface of Ryugu and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">brought that material to Earth</a> in December 2020 (<em>SN: 7/11/19</em>; <em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). Using 95 milligrams of the asteroid’s debris, the researchers measured dozens of chemical elements in the sample and then compared abundances of several of those elements to those measured in rare meteorites classified as CI-type chondrites. Fewer than 10 meteorites found on Earth are CI chondrites.</p>





<p>This comparison confirmed Ryugu is a CI-type chondrite. But it also showed that unlike Ryugu, the meteorites appear to have been altered, or contaminated, by Earth’s atmosphere or even human handling over time. “The Ryugu sample is a much more fresh sample,” says Hisayoshi Yurimoto, a geochemist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.</p>



<p>The researchers also measured the abundances of manganese-53 and chromium-53 in the asteroid and determined that melted water ice reacted with most of the minerals around 5 million years after the solar system’s start, altering those minerals, says Yurimoto. That water has since evaporated, but those altered minerals are still present in the samples. By studying them, the researchers can learn more about the asteroid’s history. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-machine-learning-google-computer">Quantum physics exponentially improves some types of machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Machine learning can get a boost from quantum physics.</p>



<p>On certain types of machine learning tasks, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7293">quantum computers have an exponential advantage</a> over standard computation, scientists report in the June 10 <em>Science</em>. The researchers proved that, according to quantum math, the advantage applies when using machine learning to understand quantum systems. And the team showed that the advantage holds up in real-world tests.</p>



<p>“People are very excited about the potential of using quantum technology to improve our learning ability,” says theoretical physicist and computer scientist Hsin-Yuan Huang of Caltech. But it wasn’t entirely clear if machine learning could benefit from quantum physics in practice.</p>





<p>In certain machine learning tasks, scientists attempt to glean information about a quantum system — say a molecule or a group of particles — by performing repeated experiments, and analyzing data from those experiments to learn about the system. </p>



<p>Huang and colleagues studied several such tasks. In one, scientists aim to discern properties of the quantum system, such as the position and momentum of particles within. Quantum data from multiple experiments could be input into a quantum computer’s memory, and the computer would process the data jointly to learn the quantum system’s characteristics.</p>



<p>The researchers proved theoretically that doing the same characterization with standard, or classical, techniques would require exponentially more experiments in order to learn the same information. Unlike a classical computer, a quantum computer can exploit entanglement — ethereal quantum linkages — to better analyze the results of multiple experiments.</p>



<p>But the new work goes beyond just the theoretical. “It’s crucial to understand if this is realistic, if this is something we could see in the lab or if this is just theoretical,” says Dorit Aharonov of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>So the researchers tested machine learning tasks with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google’s quantum computer</a>, Sycamore (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Rather than measuring a real quantum system, the team used simulated quantum data, and analyzed it using either quantum or classical techniques.</p>



<p>Quantum machine learning won out there, too, even though Google’s quantum computer is noisy, meaning errors can slip into calculations. Eventually, scientists plan to build quantum computers that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">correct their own errors</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>). But for now, even without that error correction, quantum machine learning prevailed.</p>

                <p>Antarctica’s Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are losing ice more quickly than they have at any time in the last few thousand years, ancient penguin bones and limpet shells suggest.</p>



<p>Scientists are worried that the glaciers, two of Antarctica’s fastest-shrinking ones, are in the process of unstable, runaway retreat. By <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00961-y">reconstructing the history of the glaciers</a> using the old bones and shells, researchers wanted to find out whether these glaciers have ever been smaller than they are today.</p>





<p>“If the ice has been smaller in the past, and did readvance, that shows that we’re not necessarily in runaway retreat” right now, says glacial geologist Brenda Hall of the University of Maine in Orono. The new result, described June 9 in <em>Nature Geoscience,</em> “doesn’t give us any comfort,” Hall says. “We can’t refute the hypothesis of a runaway retreat.”</p>



<p>Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers sit in a broad ocean basin shaped like a bowl, deepening toward the middle. This makes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">the ice vulnerable to warm currents</a> of dense, salty water that hug the ocean floor (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>). Scientists have speculated that as the glaciers retreat  farther inland, they could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">tip into an irreversible collapse</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). &nbsp;That collapse could play out over centuries and raise the sea level by roughly a meter.</p>

<p>To reconstruct how the glaciers have changed over thousands of years, the researchers turned to old penguin bones and shells, collected by Scott Braddock, a glacial geologist in Hall’s lab, during a research cruise in 2019 on the U.S. icebreaker <em>Nathaniel B. Palmer</em>.</p>



<p>One afternoon, Braddock clambered from a bobbing inflatable boat onto the barren shores of Lindsey 1 — one of a dozen or more rocky islands that sit roughly 100 kilometers from where Pine Island Glacier terminates in the ocean. As he climbed the slope, his boots slipped over rocks covered in penguin guano and dotted with dingy white feathers. Then, he came upon a series of ridges — rocks and pebbles that were piled up by waves during storms thousands of years before — that marked ancient shorelines.</p>



<p>Twelve thousand years ago, just as the last ice age was ending, this island would have been entirely submerged in the ocean. But as nearby glaciers shed billions of metric tons of ice, the removal of that weight allowed Earth’s crust to spring up like a bed mattress — pushing Lindsey 1 and other nearby islands out of the water, a few millimeters per year.</p>



<p>As Lindsey 1 rose, a series of shorelines formed on the edges of the island — and then were lifted, one after another, out of reach of the waves. By measuring the ages and heights of those stranded shorelines, the researchers could tell how quickly the island had risen. Because the rate of uplift is determined by the amount of ice being lost from nearby glaciers, this would reveal how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers had retreated — and whether they had gotten smaller than they are today and then readvanced.</p>



<p>Braddock dug into the pebbly ridges, collecting ancient cone-shaped limpet shells and marble-sized fragments of penguin bones deposited when the shorelines formed. Back in Maine, he and his colleagues radiocarbon dated those objects to estimate the ages of the shorelines. Ultimately, the researchers dated nearly two dozen shorelines, spread across several islands in the region.</p>



<p>These dates showed that the oldest and highest beach formed 5,500 years ago. Since that time, up until the last few decades, the islands have risen at a steady rate of about 3.5 millimeters per year. This is far slower than the 20 to 40 millimeters per year that the land around Pine Island and Thwaites is currently rising, suggesting that the rate of ice loss from nearby glaciers has skyrocketed due to the onset of rapid human-caused warming, after thousands of years of relative stability.</p>



<p>“We’re going into unknown territory,” Braddock says. “We don’t have an analog to compare what’s going on today with what happened in the past.”</p>



<p>Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, sees the newly dated shorelines as “an important piece of information.” But he cautions against overinterpreting the results. While these islands are 100 kilometers from Pine Island and Thwaites, they are less than 50 kilometers from several smaller glaciers — and changes in these closer glaciers might have obscured whatever was happening at Pine Island and Thwaites long ago. He suspects that Pine Island and Thwaites could still have retreated and then readvanced a few dozen kilometers: “I don’t think this study settles it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-finger-human-skin-self-healing">Scientists grew living human skin around a robotic finger</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Terminator may be one step closer to reality.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of Tokyo have built a robotic finger that, much like Arnold Schwarzenegger’s titular cyborg assassin, is <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00239-9">covered in living human skin</a>. The goal is to someday build robots that look like real people — albeit for more altruistic applications.</p>



<p>Super realistic-looking robots could more seamlessly interact with humans in medical care and service industries, say biohybrid engineer Shoji Takeuchi and his colleagues June 9 in <em>Matter</em>. (Whether cyborgs masked in living tissue would be more congenial or creepy is probably in the eye of the beholder.)</p>





<p>To cover the finger in skin, Takeuchi and colleagues submerged the robotic digit in a blend of collagen and human skin cells called dermal fibroblasts. The mixture settled into a base layer of skin, or dermis, covering the finger. The team then poured a liquid containing human keratinocyte cells onto the finger, which formed an outer skin layer, or epidermis. After two weeks, skin covering the finger measured a few millimeters thick — comparable to the thickness of human skin.</p>



<p>The lab-made skin was strong and stretchy enough to withstand the robotic finger bending. It could also heal itself: When researchers made a small cut on the robotic finger and covered it with a collagen bandage, the skin’s fibroblast cells merged the bandage with the rest of the skin within a week.</p>

<p>“This is very interesting work and an important step forward in the field,” says Ritu Raman, an MIT engineer who also builds machines with living components. “Biological materials are appealing because they can dynamically sense and adapt to their environments.” For instance, she’d like to see a future version of the living robot skin embedded with nerve cells to make robots more aware of their surroundings.</p>



<p>But a robot can’t wear this lab-grown skin suit out and about just yet, Raman notes. The skin-covered robotic finger spent most of its time soaking in sugar, amino acids and other ingredients that skin cells need to survive. A Terminator or other cyborg wearing this skin would have to bathe often in a broth of nutrients or use some other complex skin care routine.</p>

                <p><em>By guest blogger</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>In many countries, including the United Kingdom and United States, people from non-White communities have been hardest hit by Covid-19. Those from non-White communities generally have less access to good healthcare, are more likely to be essential workers, and are more likely to die from Covid than their White counterparts.</p>



<p>And though many of us are aware of this, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362200257X">new research</a> suggests that within the White demographic, simply hearing the reasons for these facts may be enough to make Covid seem like less of a threat, and reduce support for public health measures.</p>



<span id="more-46380"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team from the University of Georgia, US, looked at how White US residents’ perception of Covid racial disparities was related to their fear of Covid and support for Covid-centric safety precautions.</p>



<p>In September 2020, the researchers asked 498 White adult participants across 48 US states whether they felt White people or people of colour were more impacted in terms of infection rates and deaths. The team also probed participants’ knowledge of systemic factors that created said disparities, asking the extent to which they agreed with several factual statements, such as “people of colour in the U.S. are less likely to have access to drive-through testing services (relative to White people), which increases the spread of COVID-19 among people of colour”.</p>



<p>The participants were then presented with several measures in a randomised order, which looked at their fear of Covid, support for safety precautions (such as wearing a mask and social distancing), intentions to socially distance from those of different races, and racial attitudes. Participants also provided demographic data.</p>



<p>Somewhat in line with the team’s expectations, those that perceived greater Covid disparities between races reported less fear of the disease, though no less endorsement of Covid-related public health measures. In contrast, those with more knowledge of the systemic factors responsible for these disparities showed increased fear of Covid, as well as more support for Covid-related safety precautions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those who were more conservative were less likely to support Covid public health measures.</p>



<p>The team took these findings further in their second study, investigating whether exposure to information about Covid racial disparities might move the needle in similar ways. For this leg of their research, 1,505 newly recruited White participants were randomly presented with one of three articles. Two of these referred to racial disparities in Covid outcomes, only one of which provided an explanation: that these disparities were the product of long-standing healthcare inequalities. A control article didn’t mention racial disparities at all. Participants then completed the same measures as in study one, with the addition of a measure of empathy.</p>



<p>This study again showed that having more knowledge about racial disparities led to less concern about Covid. However, this effect seemed to be strongest for the group presented with information about the role of systemic issues in producing these disparities. Reduced concern in this group in turn led them to show less support for safety precautions. In essence, it seems as though the more the participants knew, the less they cared.</p>



<p>The authors speculate that explaining how Covid racial disparities are a product of enduring health inequalities affecting non-White communities may have made White participants feel that they were unlikely to be similarly affected. This psychological distance may be part of the problem.</p>



<p>In their paper, the team draws lines between several psychological factors that may also contribute to this surprising outcome. Firstly, when faced with a threatening health situation, people are likely to contrast their own situation with that of people more at risk as a method of coping, drawing distance between the two for comfort. Perceiving a group and their situation as psychologically distant from one’s own (i.e. an out-group rather than an in-group) can make threats facing other groups also seem distant from oneself, and therefore less of a threat. The combination of these factors is likely to leave White people with reduced empathy for members of those at-risk racial minorities, while also reducing engagement with public health precautions.</p>



<p>Future efforts to create practical strategies and programs which lessen these particular psychological quirks may prove important in future public health efforts. In the meantime, the authors believe that additional care should be taken when reporting on racial disparities during the pandemic, as fuelling this phenomenon may perpetuate inequalities and have damaging effects on public health behaviour.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mental-health-care-workers-nonviolent-police-calls-crime-denver-star">How having health care workers handle nonviolent police calls may impact crime</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the last two years, a person acting erratically in downtown Denver has likely first encountered unarmed health care workers rather than police. That shift stems from the rollout of a program known as Support Team Assisted Response, or STAR, which sends a mental health clinician and paramedic to respond to certain 911 calls about nonviolent behavior.</p>



<p>The program, and others like it, aim to defuse the tensions that can arise when police officers confront civilians in distress. Critics of these experimental programs have suggested that such reduced police involvement could allow crime to flourish. Now, researchers have found that during its pilot phase, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2106">the STAR program did not appear to lead to more violent crime</a>. And reports of minor crimes substantially decreased, the researchers conclude June 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Much of that reduction occurred because the health responders <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">do not issue citations</a> or make arrests <em>(SN: 12/18/21</em>). But even that reduction in reported crime is beneficial, says economist Thomas Dee of Stanford University. “That person is getting health care instead of being arrested.”</p>



<p>Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer and the subsequent rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, cities throughout the country have been rolling out programs like STAR. “We cannot police our way out of every social problem,” says Temitope Oriola, a sociologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. But so far there have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-reform-why-little-evidence-data-body-cameras-implicit-bias">few studies</a> of these programs’ effects on crime, let alone on the reduction of violence between police and the public (<em>SN: 7/9/20</em>).</p>



<p>Dee and Jayme Pyne, a sociologist also at Stanford, looked at the STAR program’s impact on crime reports. The duo investigated the program&#8217;s pilot phase, which ran from June to November 2020 and encompassed eight of the city’s 36 police precincts. Police officers and 911 operators in those eight precincts redirected calls for minor and non-dangerous complaints to STAR providers. These calls included concerns about trespassing, indecent exposure, intoxication and similar low-level offenses. During the six-month pilot, STAR providers responded to 748 calls, averaging roughly six incidents per eight-hour shift.</p>



<p>Dee and Pyne analyzed criminal offenses in all 36 precincts from December 2019 to November 2020. They then compared the change in crime rates in the eight precincts receiving STAR services with the change in crime rates in the other 28 precincts. The rate of violent crime remained unchanged across the board, including in the precincts where the STAR program was active, the researchers found. But there was a 34 percent drop in reports of minor offenses in the STAR precincts, from an average of about 84 offenses per month in each district to an average of about 56 citations.</p>



<p>The data also suggest that the actual level of minor crimes and complaints dropped too — that is, the drop wasn’t just due to a lack of reporting, the researchers say. Prior to the pilot, minor offenses in the eight precincts receiving STAR services resulted in an average of 1.4 citations per incident. So having health care workers rather than police respond to 748 such calls should generate roughly 1,000 fewer citations, the authors calculate. Instead, citations dropped by almost 1,400. Providing people in crisis with access to health services may be preventing them from reoffending, Dee says.</p>



<p>Research into these sorts of programs is crucial, says Michael Vermeer, a justice policy researcher with the RAND Corporation, a public policy research organization headquartered in Santa Monica, Calif. &nbsp;But he cautions against drawing firm conclusions from a single study launched at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, which dramatically changed crime rates and patterns across the country. “They just got confounded by the pandemic,” Vermeer says.</p>



<p>Dee agrees that he and other researchers now need to replicate this study across more cities, and also scale up in Denver. The city has since expanded the STAR program beyond the initial pilot.</p>



<p>Even if researchers eventually find that STAR and similar programs don’t budge crime rates much, that doesn’t mean that the programs are unsuccessful, says sociologist Brenden Beck of the University of Colorado Denver. He points to the potential to save taxpayer dollars. Dee and Pyne estimate that a single offense processed through STAR costs about $150, compared with the roughly $600 it costs to process one through the criminal justice system.</p>



<p>What’s more, helping people having nonviolent mental health crises get help and stay out of jail lets these individuals hold onto their jobs and stay present in their family members’ lives, Beck says. “I would hope we as a research community move on to study the benefit of these programs not just in terms of crime but also in terms of human welfare.”</p>

<p>Paintings conservator Nouchka De Keyser of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and colleagues analyzed the rose using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-antoinette-letters-ink-analysis-hidden-words-censor">noninvasive techniques including X-ray fluorescence imaging</a> and X-ray powder diffraction (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>). The team first mapped the lingering traces of arsenic, lead, calcium and other chemical elements in the layers of paint to reveal how Mignon carefully layered paint to create a nearly three-dimensional rose out of light and shadow.</p>



<p>The analyses also revealed two newer crystals on the rose containing both lead and arsenic. Called mimetite and schultenite, the crystals are the product of a series of chemical reactions. First, the reaction of orpiment with light created a highly mobile type of arsenic called arsenolite. That mobilized arsenolite then found its way to an underlying layer of lead white paint and chemically reacted with it to produce the mimetite and schultenite. The crystals lack the bright color of the orpiment — instead, they are colorless and flatten the flower’s appearance.</p>

<p>Science can’t turn back the clock on the chemical transformation to restore the rose’s erstwhile glory — that’s a one-way street. But digital reconstructions made using similar techniques as in the new study could offer several benefits and not just to scientists and art historians, De Keyser says. Not only can such reconstructions reveal now-faded elements in other paintings — they might also appear in museums, allowing visitors a ghostly glimpse of a painting’s true past.</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>A new study has cast doubt on historic research suggesting that the season or month of someone’s birth is associated with an increased risk of certain mental health conditions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10892-8">paper</a>, published in<em> Scientific Reports, </em>looks at symptoms of anxiety and depression among more than 70,000 older adults in Europe. And it finds that there is no relationship between when they were born and the likelihood that they experience anxiety or depression.</p>



<span id="more-46363"></span>



<p>A number of past studies have found a link between season of birth and mental health diagnoses: research <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8885042/#:~:text=Results%3A%20'Process'%20schizophrenia%2C,was%205.8%25%20for%20bipolar%20disorder.">has linked bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with birth month</a>, for example. Researchers have suggested that such links could arise from nutrient intake and disease exposure varying across the course of the year. However, evidence has been mixed and more recent studies have suggested that confounding factors, particularly socioeconomic background, has more to do with these diagnoses than month of birth.</p>



<p>To see whether season of birth does make a difference to mental health, the team used data from a survey of 72,370 older adults from across Europe, who had been asked questions on their health. Information gathered for this study included their month and season of birth (winter, spring, summer or autumn), and the extent to which they experienced symptoms of depression or anxiety.</p>



<p>Overall, there was no significant relationship between participants’ month of birth and symptoms of depression or anxiety. There was some variability in some countries — for example in Hungary and Poland, depressive symptoms fluctuated a little depending on birth month, and in the Czech Republic the same was true of anxiety symptoms — but, on the whole, there was no systematic pattern.</p>



<p>The team also compared younger and older participants (below and above the ages of 65), male and female participants, and those from different regions of Europe. And again, there was no meaningful effect of month of birth, regardless of how participants were split up.</p>



<p>As noted, previous research had suggested that season of birth had a strong association with mental health. This has largely been attributed to the impact of climate, differences in sunlight and vitamin D exposure, nutrition and other factors. The team suggests that an improvement in access to healthy food — and an understanding of the nutrients pregnant women and children need — may therefore be able to explain why there was no link between month of birth and mental health symptoms in this study.</p>



<p>The study, therefore, indicates that season of birth may not be a good predictor of mental health later in life. However, the social and environmental factors that potentially drove the links previously found between season of birth and mental health, such as nutrition and maternal health, are still worth considering when it comes to the physical and mental health of whole families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-sleep-deprivation-blood-disease">Mosquitoes prefer dozing over dining when they are sleep-deprived</a></h4>

              
                <p>Turns out there <em>is</em> rest for the wicked: Sleepy mosquitoes are more likely to catch up on missed z’s than drink blood, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Most people are familiar with the aftermath of a poor night’s sleep. Insects also suffer; for instance, drowsy honeybees struggle to perform their signature waggle dance, and weary fruit flies show signs of memory loss. In the case of sleep-deprived mosquitoes, they <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/225/11/jeb244032/275550/Behavioral-and-postural-analyses-establish-sleep">give up valuable time for feeding in favor of sleeping overtime</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.</p>





<p>The preference for dozing over dining is surprising given that “we know that mosquitoes love blood a lot,” says Oluwaseun Ajayi, a disease ecologist at the University of Cincinnati.</p>



<p>Scientists have long been interested in mosquitoes’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cracking-body-clock-code-wins-trio-nobel-prize">circadian rhythms</a>, the internal clock that determines their sleep and awake times (<em>SN: 10/2/17</em>). Knowing when a mosquito is awake —&nbsp;and biting — is important for understanding and limiting disease transmission. For instance, malaria, often transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes, is kept under control by slinging netting around beds. But new research suggests that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104282119">mosquitoes that feed during the day may also spread</a> the disease.</p>



<p>It’s challenging to study sleeping bloodsuckers in the lab. That’s partly because awake mosquitoes are aroused by the presence of a meal — the experimenter. And when mosquitoes do fall asleep, they look rather similar to peers that are merely resting to conserve energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the tricky — and often species-specific — question: “How can you tell [when] an insect is sleeping?” says Samuel Rund, a mosquito circadian biologist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>One way to tell is by tracking the insect’s behavior. So Ajayi and colleagues watched mosquitoes sleep. The team focused on three species known to carry diseases, including malaria: <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, which are active during the day; <em>Culex pipiens</em>, which prefer dusk; and the nocturnal <em>Anopheles stephensi</em>. The mosquitoes were left alone in a room in small enclosures, where the team used cameras and infrared sensors to spy on them.</p>



<p>After about two hours, the mosquitoes appeared to nod off. Their abdomens lowered to the ground and their hind legs drooped, the footage showed. As time went on, <em>C. pipiens </em>and <em>A. aegypti</em> showed a reduced response when the experimenter walked in the room, suggesting a tasty smell was less likely to wake those species when in a deep sleep. Taken together, the change in posture, periods of inactivity and lower arousal were determined to identify a snoozing mosquito.</p>



<p>What started as a relaxing experiment for the mosquitoes quickly changed gears. The insects were placed in clear tubes that received vibration pulses every few minutes, preventing them from falling into deep sleep. After four to 12 hours of this sleep deprivation, the team mimicked the presence of a host with a pad of heated artificial sweat. In another experiment, a plucky human volunteer offered up a leg to be fed on for five minutes by sleep-deprived and well-rested <em>A. aegypti </em>in batches of 10 insects.</p>



<p>In both cases, the mosquitoes that had had a full night’s rest were much more likely to land on the host than those that had been deprived of sleep. And the leg exposed to sleepy mosquitoes fared much better than when it was exposed to the control group: In eight tests, on average 77 percent of the well-rested mosquitoes went for a blood meal, compared with only 23 percent of sleepy mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The findings, Rund says, open avenues for research into controlling mosquito populations and reducing disease using the insects’ circadian rhythms.</p>

                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p>A year ago, in response to <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">community desire</a> for a strong position on code sharing, and in acknowledgement of the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/uphold-the-code/">immense value</a> that code adds to the scientific literature, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced a new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/supporting-community-needs-with-an-enhanced-code-policy-on-plos-computational-biology/">code-sharing policy</a>. The policy requires that any code supporting a publication be shared (unless there are ethical or legal restrictions that prevent sharing).</p>



<p>Now, a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010193">editorial</a> reports the results of an analysis of code-sharing behavior at the journal both before and after the policy implementation. The investigation found that, &ldquo;the rate of code sharing for research articles published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> before the policy was implemented was 53% in 2019 and 61% in 2020. This rose to 73% for research articles published in 2021, which includes a high proportion of research articles that were submitted before the policy was implemented.&rdquo; When looking only at articles submitted after the introduction of the policy, the code-sharing rate is 87%. For comparison, it is estimated that more than 99.5% of research articles published in the journal between 2019 and 2022 generated code that supported the research presented.</p>

<p>This remarkable increase demonstrates the efficacy of a policy-based approach to code-sharing. &ldquo;These results show that the mandatory code sharing policy is such a great fit for the computational biology community. Many researchers were already showing great commitment to openness and transparency by voluntarily sharing code before the policy came into effect and now the policy just helps to cement this as the norm for the field.&rdquo; said Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager at PLOS and one of the authors of the editorial.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062951519">The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</a><br><em>Steve Brusatte</em><br><em>Mariner Books, $29.99</em></p>



<p>In my opinion, the most satisfying science documentary TV series ever made was a 1970s British production called <em>Connections</em>. Hosted by impish historian James Burke, wearing bell-bottoms and thick-framed tortoiseshell glasses, each episode revealed how one small innovation from earlier human civilizations led to another and then another and another, culminating in the invention of some ultramodern (for the 1970s) technology.</p>



<p>Watching these pieces of the past come together was deeply gratifying, if not a little dizzying. The present is so familiar that it feels inevitable. But it was striking to see modern civilization, even modern humans, in context, to recognize how all that we are now actually hinges on countless moments of invention, improvement and experimentation in the deep past.</p>





<p>I had a similar reaction to <em>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</em>, paleontologist Steve Brusatte’s sweeping history of the animals that have, for the moment, inherited the Earth. Moving generally forward in time, the book describes how the mammalian line progressively acquired a range of features that have come to define what a mammal is.</p>



<p>Some of the moments of evolutionary invention that led to what we now think of as a mammal are remarkably subtle. There’s the hard roof of the mouth that created a dedicated airway to the lungs, allowing mammal ancestors to eat and breathe at the same time. There’s the change from a spine that bends from left to right (which produces the classically reptilian side-to-side gait) to one that enables bending up and down, which ultimately allowed mammals to take in more oxygen as they moved, helping them run faster. And there’s the variety of tooth shapes — incisors, canines, premolars and molars — that made it possible for mammals to eat many kinds of food. A reptile, by contrast, tends to have just one tooth type.</p>



<p>Some mammalian characteristics are very familiar: milk production, warm-bloodedness, hair. But there’s one less–well-known evolutionary advance that was in its humble way quite profound, setting “us apart from amphibians, reptiles, and birds,” Brusatte writes. It’s a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flexible-bone-helps-mammals-chew-dates-back-jurassic-period">joint in the jaw that makes chewing possible</a> (<em>SN: 8/17/19, p. 8</em>). The ability to chew was “a major evolutionary turning point,” he writes. “It triggered a domino chain of changes to mammalian feeding, intelligence, and reproduction.”</p>





<p>Brusatte also describes a second small, curious adaptation: the transformation of two bones in the reptile jaw, which migrated to the inner ear to become two members of a famous trio, the hammer and anvil (the third is the stirrup). These inner ear bones are the basis for yet another key mammalian feature: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-may-shed-light-when-mammals-middle-ear-evolved">the ability to hear a wide range of frequencies</a>, particularly in the upper register (<em>SN Online: 12/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>The story of the Age of Mammals is often told as the flip side to the dinosaurs’ demise. But the fossil record reveals that mammals were hardly newcomers: They arose around the same time as the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago. Even during the Age of Dinosaurs, “in the smaller and hidden niches, it was already the Age of Mammals,” Brusatte writes. “Mammals were <em>better</em> than the dinosaurs at being small.”</p>



<p>Within just a few hundred thousand years of the asteroid impact that wiped out all nonbird dinos some 66 million years ago, mammals moved in to fill the vacancy, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-capture-mammals-recovery-after-dinosaur-killing-asteroid">rapidly getting a lot bigger</a>, ballooning from, say, mouse-sized to beaver-sized (<em>SN: 12/7/19, p. 32</em>). Pretty soon, they got a lot smarter too. In a geologic blink — a scant 10 million years — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils">mammals’ brains caught up with their brawn</a>, and then the Age of Mammals was off to the races (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Paleontology narratives often require refocusing a story’s lens in a way that can be jarring, zooming out to encompass Earth-wide climate cataclysms and mass extinctions and then in again to describe tiny bones and obscure species. Brusatte, though, is a nimble storyteller and he’s chosen an engrossing story to tell.</p>



<p>As a science writer, I often find myself focusing on minute advances, studying tiny threads. So it’s satisfying to sit back and admire the full tapestry as presented in <em>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</em>. Reading this book reminded me what I most enjoy about geology, paleontology and the evolution of life on Earth: This planet has got some epic stories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zircon-earthquake-gemstone-history-chemistry">Ancient zircons offer insights into earthquakes of the past</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earthquakes have rocked the planet for eons. Studying the quakes of old could help scientists better understand modern tremors, but tools to do such work are scarce.</p>



<p>Enter zircons. Researchers used the gemstones to home in on the temperatures reached within a fault during earthquakes millions of years ago. The method offers insights into the intensity of long-ago quakes, and could <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GC010291">improve understanding of how today’s tremors release energy</a>, the researchers report in the April <em>Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems</em>.</p>





<p>“The more we understand about the past, the more we can understand what might happen in the future,” says Emma Armstrong, a thermochronologist at Utah State University in Logan.</p>



<p>Armstrong and colleagues focused on California’s Punchbowl Fault. That now-quiet portion of the larger San Andreas Fault was probably active between 1 million to 10 million years ago, Armstrong says.</p>



<p>Heat from friction is generated in a fault when it slips and triggers an earthquake. Previous analyses of preserved organic material suggested that temperatures within the Punchbowl Fault peaked between 465° Celsius and 1065° C. The researchers suspected that zircons in rocks from the fault could narrow that broad window.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">Zircons</a> often contain the radioactive chemical elements uranium and thorium, which decay to helium at a predictable rate (<em>SN: 5/2/22</em>)<em>.</em> That helium then builds up in the crystals. But when a zircon is heated past a temperature threshold — the magnitude of which depends on the zircon’s composition — the accumulated helium escapes.</p>



<p>Measuring the amounts of the three elements in zircons from the fault suggests that the most intense earthquake generated temperatures lower than 800° C. That roughly halves the range previously reported. The finding provides clues to the amount of heat released by quakes, something difficult to measure for modern tremors because they often occur at great depths.</p>



<p>Armstrong plans to continue studying zircons, in the hopes of finding more ways to exploit them for details about ancient quakes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-domestication-bones-origin-asia-rice-fields-exotic-animals">A new origin story for domesticated chickens starts in rice fields 3,500 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>It turns out that chicken and rice may have always gone together, from the birds’ initial domestication to tonight’s dinner.</p>



<p>In two new studies, scientists lay out a potential story of chicken’s origins. This poultry tale begins surprisingly recently <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2121978119">in rice fields planted by Southeast Asian farmers</a> around 3,500 years ago, zooarchaeologist Joris Peters and colleagues report. From there, the birds were transported westward not as food but as exotic or culturally revered creatures, the team suggests June 6 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>“Cereal cultivation may have acted as a catalyst for chicken domestication,” says Peters, of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.</p>



<p>The domesticated fowl then arrived in Mediterranean Europe <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2021.90">no earlier than around 2,800 years ago</a>, archaeologist Julia Best of Cardiff University in Wales and colleagues report June 6 in <em>Antiquity</em>. The birds appeared in northwest Africa between 1,100 and 800 years ago, the team says.</p>



<p>Researchers have debated where and when chickens (<em>Gallus gallus domesticus</em>) originated for more than 50 years. India’s Indus Valley, northern China and Southeast Asia have all been touted as domestication centers. Proposed dates for chickens’ first appearance have mostly ranged from around 4,000 to 10,500 years ago. A 2020 genetic study of modern chickens suggested that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0349-y">domestication occurred among Southeast Asian red jungle fowl</a>. But DNA analyses, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">increasingly used to study animal domestication</a>, couldn’t specify when domesticated chickens first appeared (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>Using chicken remains previously excavated at more than 600 sites in 89 countries, Peters’ group determined whether the chicken bones had been found where they were originally buried by soil or, instead, had moved downward into older sediment over time and thus were younger than previously assumed.</p>



<p>After establishing the timing of chickens’ appearances at various sites, the researchers used historical references to chickens and data on subsistence strategies in each society to develop a scenario of the animals’ domestication and spread.</p>



<p>The new story begins in Southeast Asian rice fields. The earliest known chicken remains come from Ban Non Wat, a dry rice–farming site in central Thailand that roughly dates to between 1650 B.C. and 1250 B.C. Dry rice farmers plant the crop on upland soil soaked by seasonal rains rather than in flooded fields or paddies. That would have made rice grains at Ban Non Wat fair game for avian ancestors of chickens.</p>



<p>These fields attracted hungry wild birds called red jungle fowl. Red jungle fowl increasingly fed on rice grains, and probably grains of another cereal crop called millet, grown by regional farmers, Peters’ group speculates. A cultivated familiarity with people launched chicken domestication by around 3,500 years ago, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Chickens did not arrive in central China, South Asia or Mesopotamian society in what’s now Iran and Iraq until nearly 3,000 years ago, the team estimates.</p>



<p>Peters and colleagues have for the first time assembled available evidence “into a fully coherent and plausible explanation of not only where and when, but also how and why chicken domestication happened,” says archaeologist Keith Dobney of the University of Sydney who did not participate in the new research.</p>



<p>But the new insights into chickens don’t end there. Using radiocarbon dating, Best’s group determined that 23 chicken bones from 16 sites in Eurasia and Africa were generally younger, in some cases by several thousand years, than previously thought. These bones had apparently settled into lower sediment layers over time, where they were found with items made by earlier human cultures.</p>

<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that chickens and rice cultivation spread across Asia and Africa in tandem, Peters’ group says. But rather than eating early chickens, people may have viewed them as special or sacred creatures. At Ban Non Wat and other early Southeast Asian sites, partial or whole skeletons of adult chickens were placed in human graves. That behavior suggests chickens enjoyed some sort of social or cultural significance, Peters says.</p>



<p>In Europe, several of the earliest chickens were buried alone or in human graves and show no signs of having been butchered.</p>



<p>The expansion of the Roman Empire around 2,000 years ago prompted more widespread consumption of chicken and eggs, Best and colleagues say. In England, chickens were not eaten regularly until around 1,700 years ago, primarily at Roman-influenced urban and military sites. Overall, about 700 to 800 years elapsed between the introduction of chickens in England and their acceptance as food, the researchers conclude. Similar lag times may have occurred at other sites where the birds were introduced.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>In just the first few years of life, children develop a strong sense of fairness. At 16 months old, toddlers <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/15/at-just-16-months-old-toddlers-will-reward-someone-for-acting-fairly/">will reward someone who has fairly distributed food or toys</a> between two other people, for example. By two, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/01/toddlers-have-an-instinct-for-fairness-and-generosity/">they tend to share toys equally themselves</a>.</p>



<p>A new study shows that children’s judgements of fairness also take into account the <em>method</em> by which resources have been allocated. Kids as young as four think that a teacher who has counted out cookies for a reward is fairer than one who gives that exact same reward without counting.  The research, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001160">published in <em>Cognition</em></a>, suggests that when judging fairness, young children are able to consider the motivations of the person distributing resources.</p>



<span id="more-46355"></span>



<p>Colin Jacobs and colleagues from Yale University conducted a series of studies, all following the same basic methodology. First, children aged four to six were told a story about two puppets who had been asked by their teachers to help clean the classroom. They learned that one of the puppets had worked hard and cleaned a lot, while the other had not worked very hard. The children were then shown videos of two teachers distributing cookies to the puppets as a reward.</p>



<p>In the key study, one teacher split the cookies up into two piles by sight before giving them to the puppets, while the other teacher counted them out. In both cases, the hard-working puppet received seven cookies and the lazier puppet received three. But when asked which of the teachers was more fair, 73% of the kids chose the teacher who had counted the cookies out.</p>



<p>These results suggest that the kids weren’t only concerned with whether the ultimate distribution of cookies was fair — they also considered the process that the teacher used to divvy them up. This implies that they had some understanding of the teachers’ intent: the counting teacher presumably wanted to divide up the resources precisely, to appropriately reward the hard-working puppet, while the other teacher was less concerned about being precise — and so less concerned about being fair.</p>



<p>In the next study, the team explored an alternative explanation: that the kids believed the fairer teacher is the one who puts more effort into the task — in this case, the one who counts all the cookies. This time, one of the teachers had to spend a lot of effort moving a stack of notebooks out of the way, one-by-one, before dividing up the cookies by sight. The other counted out the cookies as before. Again, most of the kids — 70% — said that the counting teacher was fairer, suggesting that they weren’t simply considering how much effort the teachers put in.</p>



<p>In a final study, both teachers acted unfairly, giving just three cookies to the hard worker and seven to the one who had done minimal cleaning, and the kids were asked which teacher was very unfair. Now 69% of the children said the counting teacher was the <em>unfair</em> one. This again suggests that the kids were thinking about the motivations of the two teachers, with the counting teacher appearing to more purposefully ensure that the hard working puppet did not get a fair reward.</p>



<p>There are some limitations to the work. In particular, the kids were always forced to choose which of the two teachers was fairer (or which was unfair). The question implies from the outset that one teacher is known to be fairer than the other, so the children might be making an informed guess about which teacher the researchers are most likely to consider fair. An alternative would be to get kids to rate <em>how fair</em> each teacher is — though this is perhaps a hard task for such young children. Overall, though, the results suggest that children as young as four have quite a sophisticated understanding of how people use counting to distribute resources fairly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/los-alamos-laboratory-atomic-bomb-wildfire">Growing wildfire threats loom over the birthplace of the atomic bomb</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are things I will always remember from my time in New Mexico. The way the bark of towering ponderosa pines smells of vanilla when you lean in close. Sweeping vistas, from forested mountaintops to the Rio Grande Valley, that embellish even the most mundane shopping trip. The trepidation that comes with the tendrils of smoke rising over nearby canyons and ridges during the dry, wildfire-prone summer months.</p>



<p>There were no major wildfires near Los Alamos National Laboratory during the year and a half that I worked in public communications there and lived just across Los Alamos Canyon from the lab. I’m in Maryland now, and social media this year has brought me images and video clips of the wildfires that have been devastating parts of New Mexico, including the Cerro Pelado fire in the Jemez Mountains just west of the lab.</p>





<p>Wherever they pop up, wildfires can ravage the land, destroy property and displace residents by the tens of thousands. The Cerro Pelado fire is small compared with others raging east of Santa Fe — it grew only to the size of Washington, D.C. The fire, which started mysteriously on April 22, is now mostly contained. But at one point it came within 5.6 kilometers of the lab, seriously threatening the place that’s responsible for creating and maintaining key portions of fusion bombs in our nation’s nuclear arsenal.</p>



<p>That close call may be just a hint of growing fire risks to come for the weapons lab as the Southwest suffers in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years">grip of an epic drought</a> made worse by human-caused climate change (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>). May and June typically mark the start of the state’s wildfire season. This year, fires erupted in April and were amplified by a string of warm, dry and windy days. The Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fires east of Santa Fe have merged to become <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/16/1098779996/new-mexico-wildfires-southwest-not-unprecedented">the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history</a>.</p>



<p>Los Alamos National Lab is in northern New Mexico, about 56 kilometers northwest of Santa Fe. The lab’s primary efforts revolve around nuclear weapons, accounting for 71 percent of its $3.9 billion budget, according the lab’s fiscal year 2021 numbers. The budget covers a ramp-up in production of hollow plutonium spheres, known as “pits” because they are the cores of nuclear bombs, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/plutonium-pit-production">to 30 per year beginning in 2026</a>. That’s triple the lab’s current capability <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/HR%201865%20-%20Division%20C%20-%20EW%20SOM%20FY20.pdf">of 10 pits per year</a>. The site is also home to radioactive waste and debris that has been a consequence of weapons production <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-bomb-physics-fission-hiroshima-anniversary">since the first atomic bomb was built in Los Alamos</a> in the early 1940s (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>What is the danger due to fire approaching the lab’s nuclear material and waste? According to literature that Peter Hyde, a spokesperson for the lab, sent to me to ease my concern, not much.</p>



<p>Over the last 3½ years, the lab has removed 3,500 tons of trees and other potential wildfire fuel from the sprawling, 93-square-kilometer complex. Lab facilities, a lab pamphlet says, “are designed and operated to protect the materials that are inside, and radiological and other potentially hazardous materials are stored in containers that are engineered and tested to withstand extreme environments, including heat from fire.”</p>



<p>What’s more, most of roughly 20,000 drums full of nuclear waste that were stored under tents on the lab’s grounds have been removed. They were a cause for anxiety <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/06/28/137468916/mandatory-evacuations-ordered-as-wildfire-threatens-los-alamos">during the last major fire to threaten the lab in 2011</a>. According to the most recent numbers on the project’s website, <a href="https://n3b-la.com/area-g-tru/#numbers">all but 3,812 of those drums have been shipped off</a> to be stored 655 meters underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.</p>



<p>But there’s still <a href="https://www.energy.gov/em/articles/los-alamos-national-laboratory-strategic-vision-2022-2032">3,500 cubic meters of nuclear waste</a> &nbsp;in the storage area, according to a March 2022 DOE strategic planning document for Los Alamos. That’s enough to fill 17,000 55-gallon drums. So potentially disastrous quantities of relatively exposed nuclear waste remain at the lab — a single drum from the lab site that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/in-us-cleanup-efforts-accident-at-nuclear-site-points-to-cost-of-lapses.html">exploded after transport to Carlsbad in 2014</a> resulted in a two-year shutdown of the storage facility. With a total budgeted cleanup cost of $2 billion, the incident is one of the most expensive nuclear accidents in the nation’s history.</p>



<p>Since the 2011 fire, a wider buffer space around the tents has been cleared of vegetation. In conjunction with fire suppression systems, it’s unlikely that wildfire will be a danger to the waste-filled drums, according to a <a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-16-26211">2016 risk analysis of extreme wildfire scenarios</a> conducted by the lab.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ig/downloads/audit-report-doe-oig-21-13">a February 2021 audit</a> by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General is less rosy. It found that, despite the removal of most of the waste drums and the multiyear wildfire mitigation efforts that the lab describes, the lab’s wildfire protection is still lacking.</p>



<p>According to the 20-page federal audit, the lab at that time had not developed a “comprehensive, risk-based approach to wildland fire management” in accordance with federal policies related to wildland fire management. The report also noted compounding issues, including the absence of federal oversight of the lab’s wildfire management activities.</p>

<p>Among the ongoing risks, not all fire roads were maintained well enough to provide a safe route for firefighters and others, “which could create dangerous conditions for emergency responders and delay response times,” the auditors wrote.</p>



<p>And a canyon that runs between the lab and the adjacent town of Los Alamos was identified in the report as being packed with 10 times the number of trees that would be ideal, from a wildfire safety perspective. To make matters worse, there’s a hazardous waste site at the bottom of the canyon that could, the auditors wrote, “produce a health risk to the environment and to human health during a fire.”</p>



<p>“The report was pretty stark,” says Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “And certainly, after all the warnings, if they’re still not doing all they need to do to fully mitigate the risk, then that’s just foolishness.”</p>



<p><a>A </a><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/igprod/documents/IG-0760.pdf">2007 federal audit</a> of Los Alamos, as well as nuclear weapons facilities in Washington state and Idaho, showed similar problems. In short, it seems little has changed at Los Alamos in the 14-year span between 2007 and 2021. Lab spokespeople did not respond to my questions about the lab’s efforts to address the specific problems identified in the 2021 report, despite repeated requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Los Alamos area has experienced three major wildfires since the lab was founded — the Cerro Grande fire in 2000, Las Conchas in 2011 and Cerro Pelado this year. But we probably can’t count on 11-year gaps between future wildfires near Los Alamos, according to Alice Hill, the senior fellow for energy and the environment with the Council on Foreign Relations, who’s based in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The changing climate is expected to dramatically affect wildfire risks in years to come, turning&nbsp;Los Alamos and surrounding areas into a tinderbox. A study in 2018 in <em>Climatic Change </em>found that the region extending from the higher elevations in New Mexico, where Los Alamos is located, into Colorado and Arizona will experience the <a href="http://web.missouri.edu/~stambaughm/Stambaugh_etal_2018_ClimaticChange.pdf">greatest increase in wildfire probabilities in the Southwest</a>. A new risk projection tool that was recommended by Hill, called Risk Factor, also <a href="https://riskfactor.com/zip/87544/87544_fsid/fire">shows increasing fire risk in the Los Alamos area</a> over the next 30 years.</p>



<p>“We are at the point where we are imagining, as we have to, things that we’ve never experienced,” Hill says. “That is fundamentally different than how we have approached these problems throughout human history, which is to look to the past to figure out how to be safer in the future…. The nature of wildfire has changed as more heat is added [to the planet], as temperatures rise.”</p>



<p>Increased plutonium pit production will add to the waste that needs to be shipped to Carlsbad. “Certainly, the radiological assessments in sort of the worst case of wildfire could lead to a pretty significant release of radioactivity, not only affecting the workers onsite but also the offsite public. It’s troubling,” says Lyman, who suggests that nuclear labs like Los Alamos should not be located in such fire-prone areas.</p>

<p>For now, some risks from the Cerra Pelado wildfire will persist, according to Jeff Surber, operations section chief for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forestry Service’s efforts to fight the fire. Large wildfires like Cerra Pelado “hold heat for so long and they continue to smolder in the interior where it burns intermittently,” he said in a May 9 briefing to Los Alamos County residents, and to concerned people like me watching online.</p>



<p>It will be vital to monitor the footprint of the fire until rain or snow finally snuffs it out late in the year. Even then, some danger will linger in the form of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-forest-fires-climate-change">“zombie fires</a>” that can flame up long after wildfires appear to have been extinguished (<em>SN: 5/19/21)</em>. “We’ve had fires come back in the springtime because there was a root underground that somehow stayed lit all winter long,” said Surber.</p>



<p>So the Cerro Pelado fire, and its occasional smoky tendrils, will probably be a part of life in northern New Mexico for months still. And the future seems just as fiery, if not worse. That’s something all residents, including the lab, need to be preparing for.</p>



<p>Meantime, if you make it out to the mountains of New Mexico soon enough, be sure to sniff a vanilla-flavored ponderosa while you still can. I know I will.</p>
